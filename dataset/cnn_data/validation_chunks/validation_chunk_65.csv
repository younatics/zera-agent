"It was a lifestyle that promised peace, love and seclusion from the wickedness of the 'outside world' - but this week a family of 14 walked out of a remote community declaring they had been living in a 'false system'. The family, many of whose children were born in the Gloriavale Christian Community in Haupiri - on New Zealand's west coast - have moved 200 miles away to live with a 'normal' family as they begin reintegrating into society, the New Zealand Herald reports. Gloriavale, which was established about 45 years ago, does not condone the use of birth control and it is common for a married couple to have 12 or more children. Scroll down for video .

The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control . 'It's a huge deal for them to stop wearing their community clothes and so they are going to transition slowly,' Liz Gregory, who has offered the family of 14 her home, told the New Zealand Herald on Wednesday. The adults have forsaken their nun-like headdresses and white bibs to put on everyday clothes, while the children have removed their hooded hats and blue uniforms. When it was revealed that the large family had walked out - following other groups who have left in recent years - donations of money, clothes, furniture, toys and books, began to pour in to help them get back on their feet. The father, identified only as James, who managed the commune's self-sufficient dairy farm for 20 years, is now looking for a job. The community, founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members, is headed by Neville Cooper, known to the families as 'Hopeful Christian'. But it has been revealed that he was convicted of sexual abuse in 1994 and spent 11 months in jail. A Cooperite wedding at Gloriavale - a community which promised peace, love and seclusion from the wickedness of the 'outside world' The happy couple finally kiss and they are carried from their Cooperite wedding at Gloriavale . The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control. One young couple were married after just six weeks of courtship. Their website states the couple 'make vows to God and each other before the Church, for no preacher can ""marry"" them'. The marriage procedure is as follows: 'Then they go to a private place pleasantly prepared for love-making. As they consummate their marriage before God, He joins them together in a bond that only death can break.' 'They return as a married couple to a wedding feast with the rest of the Church.' The cult has several sources of income which includes dairy farming and deer farming. Gloriavale consider home births to be significant events with about 35 babies born each year, according to their website. Children, who are fully dressed, are pictured playing in the pool at Gloriavale . Members of the Gloriavale Christian Community, based ar Haupiri,  making iced buns . Speaking of the family of 14 who have recently walked out, Ms Gregory said they had 'come to believe they were in a false system and have left 500 of their family and friends (the only ones they've every known.' She added: 'They are hugely courageous…they are very excited about starting life out here. 'They are feeling blessed, but are aware of the road ahead of them.' Ms Gregory told the Herald that the family, who do not want to make any public comment, was in great spirits 'which is incredible, because what they have done (walking out) is massive.' A former member, Phil Cooper - who is the son of leader Neville 'Hopeful Christian' Cooper - told the Greymouth Star last year that he knew of two or three families that have left in recent times. The community is headed by Neville Cooper, known to the families as 'Hopeful Christian' He said that young people growing up at Gloriavale were cut off from the outside world and when they left they were not allowed to keep in touch with those left inside the community. This, he told the paper, had left people 'devastated' because of the emotional pain of people not being able to see their own mother again. Young people who had grown up at Gloriavale 'don't know anything else,' he said. 'My kids (living on the 'outside') have strong faith - they chose that. But (Gloriavale children) know nothing else.' Peter Righteous, spokesman for the Gloriavale Christian Community, told the New Zealand Herald that they did not comment on people who had walked out. 'We haven't got time to be caught up in a lot of nonsense,' he said. 'We have a life we must live before the Lord. 'If people do not want to live an unselfish life of service to the Lord, it's up to them. They can do as they wish.'","A family of 14 walked out of a remote community declaring they had been living in a 'false system'

"A super slimmer who swelled to 26 stone after eating a loaf of bread a day is now toasting her diet - and literally becoming half the woman she used to be. Michelle Quinn, 42, ballooned after munching her way through toast, sarnies and slices of bread all day. Her diet used to be made up of white toast with margarine for breakfast, sandwiches and crisps for lunch and fish and chips and takeaways for dinner. Michelle Quinn has lost half of her body weight after ditching her bread-based diet which saw her eat a loaf a day, she has also dropped from a clothes size 30 (left) to a size 12 (right) Before losing weight 43-year-old Michelle was a size 30, here she proudly holds up a pair of her old trousers . But she gave up the bread and started a diet of breakfast of cereal or fruit and yoghurt, home-made soup for lunch and healthy versions of her favourite meals. Michelle, of South Shields, Tyneside, says she feels like a new woman after losing 12.5st and dropping from dress size 30 to size 12. She has been named Slimming World's Greatest Loser in the West Harton area of South Shields. She said: 'I feel like a new woman since losing weight. In fact, I look so different that people who I havent seen for a while often can't believe I'm the same person. 'For me though it's the change on the inside that's been the biggest - I'm happier, healthier and much more confident now. Michelle, pictured with her uncle Derek, joined a slimming group in 2013 in a bid to shift the weight, she says she had struggled with high blood pressure, back pain and that she got breathless easily . Michelle was not fat as a child but piled on the pounds thanks to her diet of fish and chips and sandwhiches . Now a size 12, Michelle no longer feels the need to eat a whole loaf of bread every day . She continued: 'I still enjoy all my favourite meals like burgers and chips and roast dinners but I've learned how to make small changes like using lean meat or cooking with low calorie spray instead of oil or butter. 'It fits in really well with the rest of my family and we can all eat the same meals.' Michelle weighed 25st 3lbs when she joined the group in April 2013 and has since dropped to 12st 10lbs. She said: 'Before I lost the weight I hid behind a big bubbly personality. I'd pretend it didn't bother me that I was bigger than most other people, but that was far from the truth. 'I hated shopping for clothes and found just climbing up stairs and doing simple everyday tasks would leave me tired and out of breath.' Michelle's weight was also putting a huge strain on her health and she suffered with high blood pressure, chronic back pain and got breathless easily.","Michelle Quinn ballooned thanks to her addiction to bread and chips .

"These incredible photographs show dogs hard at work in the most dangerous job in the world - clearing mines in the war fields of Afghanistan. The mines are a legacy of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s and children are particularly vulnerable to the blasts when they go out to play or tend to their herds of cattle. Mine Detection teams work with the highly-trained dogs, typically Belgian or German Shepherds, to find and neutralise the lethal explosives in the Namak Ab District of Afghanistan.

The dogs are selected as puppies based on health and their fixation on a rubber ball, which is used as a reward for them during the mine-hunting sessions . The humbling and inspirational pictures were taken by Craig McInally, a 40-year-old former US Army bomb disposal expert who has been working in explosive ordnance disposal and mine action since 1999. Craig has served in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, El Salvador, and Nigeria and has been stationed in Afghanistan since January 2014. He said: 'Some mines are intentionally designed with minimum metal to make detection difficult. 'Dogs can search much faster than a person with a detector, especially in areas where mine contamination is low. This is particularly helpful in reducing the total size of a suspected area.'

Devices found in Afghanistan: (From the left) The Italian TC-6 antitank blast mine - minimum metal and hard to detect- the Russian PMN-2 antipersonnel blast mine and finally a Russian PMN antitank mine, perhaps the most abundant mine on Earth . The mines are often buried several inches into soil, making them extra hard to detect .

The dogs then know to sniff along in a straight line searching for the explosives. When the dog reaches the end, it is called back and their progress is marked with coloured flags. The process will continue until all the fields are cleared of mines. After the mines are found they are destroyed in a controlled explosion.","The mines are a legacy of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980's .

"A member of the firing squad assigned to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman has revealed what it is like to pull the trigger. The revelations come as Chan's fiancee Febyanti Herewila saw the convicted drug smuggler for the first time after he was transferred to Nusakambangan in Central Java for his execution. Chan's brother, Michael, gave up his place on the boat from Cilacap - the port closest to Indonesia's 'Death Island' - so she could visit him, Fairfax Media reported. Scroll down for video . Andrew Chan's fiancee Febyanti Herewila visited the convicted drug smuggler for the first time since his transfer to Nusakambangan in Central Java . She took the place of Chan's brother, Michael, as visitor restrictions at Indonesia's Death Island are strict . Ms Herewila, who is known as Feby, was one of the last people who visited Chan last Tuesday before he and Sukuraman were transported in armoured cars to the island. She and Michael tried to seek out a final visit before Chan's transfer but were unsuccessful. With Chan and Sukuraman held in semi-isolation cells, the pair are only allowed three visitors each per day, a source close to the family told Daily Mail Australia. As the Bali Nine duo are just days away from their executions, a member of Indonesia's firing squad told News Corp taking a prisoner's life was something he would never forget. Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukuraman (right) are set to be executed after they were found guilty of attempting to smuggle drugs from Indonesia into Australia . It was revealed earlier this week that Chan had proposed to Febyanti Herewila after his clemency was rejected by the Indonesian president . The executioner was also part of the group that put to death five people at Nusakambangan on January 18. The weapon of choice for the firing squad is a SS1 assault rifles, which is made in Indonesia and is standard issue to officers. As a select number of the members on the squad are given live rounds, the executioner - who did not wish to be named - said he would never know if he delivered the final bullet that killed one of the inmates. 'As Brimob [Indonesia's answer to Australia's special forces], I have to do my job and I don't have any choice,' he told News Corp. Chan's mother, Helen, also accompanied her future daughter-in-law to visit her son in Besi prison . She was one of the last people to see Chan before he was transferred last Tuesday. Last Wednesday she and Chan's brother, Michael, tried to visit him before the Bali Nine pair were transported to Nusakambangan . 'But as a human, I will never forget this for the rest of my life.' It was revealed earlier this week, Chan and Feby got engaged last month following his failed bid for clemency. Following the news of their engagemant, Feby told News Corp she was totally in love with Chan and she did not accept his proposal out of pity. 'I love him for who he is. And I see what he does for other people and that makes me love him more,' she said. 'If you ask me why do I love him, it's because he also has weaknesses as well but he also has a lot of good things about him. I accept him the way he is. I am also very proud of him.' Chan's mother accompanied Feby along with Sukuraman's mother, sister and brother to visit the inmates. Australia's Consul-General to Bali, Majell Hind, also made the boat trip across with the family members. The pair's lawyer will appear in Jakarta's State Administrative Court on their behalf on Thursday to appeal a decision made in February not to review Indonesian president Joko Widodo's decision to put them on death row.","Executioner said he would not forget executing convicted drug smugglers .

"Weeping and wailing Nick Gordon, the troubled fiancé of Bobbi Kristina Brown, has admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed: 'I'm so sorry for everything.' Gordon, 25, was speaking to Dr Phil McGraw in a dramatic intervention due to air on Wednesday, Daily Mail Online can reveal. Asked if he still intended to kill himself he said: 'If anything happens to Krissi I will.' Amid scenes of high emotion, an often incoherent Gordon admitted drinking heavily and taking Xanax, for which he has a prescription, in an attempt to deal with life since Bobbi Kristina was found, face down and unresponsive in her bathtub on January 31. Scroll down for video . Breakdown: With his mother, Michelle, by his side Nick Gordon struggles to stay coherent as he is questioned by Dr Phil. Girlfriend Bobbi Kristina is in a medically induced coma . Troubling preview: A trailer for the interview of Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon by Dr Phil McGraw was released Sunday night. Swinging from crying  to flying into a rage, the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by Dr Phil . Comfort: Nick's supportive mother Michelle was by Nick's side during the entire intervention . Blame game: Michelle said her son 'cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt. He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.' Hugs: Before he left for rehab, Nick and his mother embraced. She said her son was at 'the breaking point'. He said: 'My pain is horrible. My heart hurts. I have panic attacks.' In recent weeks Gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of Xanax, alcohol and prescription sleeping pills. Gordon had agreed to meet with Dr Phil believing that he was there to be interviewed. According to Dr Phil: 'He felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster.' Instead, on learning of Gordon's rapidly deteriorating mental, emotional and physical state, the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab. Dr Phil stated: 'I don't think he has any chance of turning this round. Left to his own devices he will be dead within the week.' Gordon's mother, Michelle, was by her son's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive – at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed. She described her son as 'at breaking point.' She said: 'He cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt. 'He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.' Leaning towards Gordon's mother, Dr Phil said: 'You and I have one mission with one possible outcome and that's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression, his guilt…and to get clean and sober.' He added: 'His life absolutely hangs in the balance.' Questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of January 31st that led to Bobbi Kristina, 22, ending up face down in her tub. Just two days ago Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Leolah Brown, made a series of explosive Facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had 'strong evidene of foul play' relating to Gordon's role in events. She posted: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!' Leolah made her claims in response to being invited onto Dr Phil's show. Tough to watch: The young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . In her message she wrote: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece….We have strong evidence of foul play.' Marks were found on her face and arms, marks that Gordon has explained as the result of CPR which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived. And speaking to Dr Phil, Gordon insisted: 'I did everything possible in the world to protect them [Whitney and Bobbi Kristina].' Railing against the decision by Bobbi's father, Bobby Brown, to ban him from his fiancée's bedside at Atlanta's Emory Hospital, Gordon said: 'My name will be the first she calls.' According to his mother, Michelle, Gordon cannot forgive himself for his 'failure' to revive Bobbi Kristina. His guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier. 'I hate Bobby Brown!' His tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend's father Bobby Brown, who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . 'Are you drinking?' The emotional man's anger only increases as Dr. Phil asks about Nick's sobriety . Refuses to go: The 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . Resigned: Ultimately, Gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . Then, on 11 February 2012, it was Gordon who tried to resuscitate Whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath-tub just hours before she was due to attend a Grammy awards party. Speaking to Dr Phil, Michelle said: 'Nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed Whitney. 'He administered CPR [to Whitney] and he called me when he was standing over her body. He couldn't understand why he couldn't revive her. He said, ""Mommy why? I couldn't get the air into her lungs."" Gordon has now entered a rehab facility in Atlanta. Meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma. It is now six weeks since Bobbi Kristina – Krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub of the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia. Unlike Whitney's death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Nick, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. In an interview with The Sun  a friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone. Sounding eerily similar to Bobbi's mother and father's drug-dependent relationship, the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on. 'Bobbi and Nick would spend a lot on drugs every day, it just depended on how much money they had. It wasn't unusual for them to spend $1,000 a day on drugs. 'There were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours, just lying there on the bed. There were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice. She was always covered in cigarette burns.' Their relationship was also very volatile. 'When Whitney died Nick was left with nothing, so he knew he had to control Krissi to get access to the money. She'd do whatever he told her. 'He was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her. They would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around.' According to Stepho: 'But Krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother. She was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her. Nick knew this and took advantage of it.' Troubled relationship: A friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone .","Dr. Phil McGraw staged a highly-charged intervention with Nick Gordon last Thursday .

"A woman whose eczema covered her entire body and caused a 'snowstorm' when she walked says porridge oats have dramatically improved her skin. Amy-Louise James, 25, had such severe eczema she had to change her bed sheets every day because of her weeping wounds. She also scratched so much that flakes of skin fell from her body - forcing her to apologise to strangers for being 'disgusting'. Now she has treated her eczema using Quaker's oats – bought from Tesco for £1.99. Amy-Louise James, 25, had such severe eczema she had to change her bed sheets every day because of her weeping wounds . She also scratched so much that flakes of skin fell from her body - forcing her to apologise to strangers for being 'disgusting' Now, Miss James, with her partner Nicola, says one of the best remedies she has tried is Quaker oats – bought from Tesco for £1.99 . Miss James said spreading porridge over her body has improved her skin - and she is healthier than she has been in years. She said: 'People don't realise how serious eczema is, they think it's just red skin that's a bit itchy. 'I had to change my bed every day because there would be so much skin and my eczema wept so much the sheets got all sticky. 'I itched constantly and there would be blood on the sheets too. It was just permanently painful.' Miss James, who works for a recovery firm in Northampton, first suffered from a small flare up aged three. She said: 'I can't remember not having eczema. It started in the creases of my arms when I was little.' The eczema gradually spread over her arms and patches appeared on the back of her knees, followed by her hands, stomach and over her legs. In her teens, the eczema progressed and by aged 15, it had spread to her neck and her face. She said: 'I was teased for having 'lovebites' on my neck but it was the eczema. 'I used scarves to try and cover it up but then people thought I was covering the lovebites.' And while most distraught teenagers would reach for the foundation, Miss James had no idea how to use cosmetics. She said: 'I wasn't one of those girls who knew how to use make up. I didn't know how to cover it up. 'When I got to college and started going out, I just saw so many girls on nights out who were beautiful and I looked disgusting. 'I just couldn't even hide it, so on a bad day I wouldn't even leave my room. 'I thought it was down to stress with exams.' Miss James' eczema used to cover her entire body and caused a 'snowstorm' when she walked . Even sat at her desk, Miss James was faced with problems. She said: 'At the office I would have to go to the bathroom and have a scratch for 20 minutes. 'My fashion sense went downhill because I couldn't wear anything that wasn't cotton.' Despite trying countless treatments, nothing worked. Skin diseases such as eczema are the most common reason we go to the GP, according to figures from the British Skin Foundation. The condition, characterised by dry, itchy red skin, is now estimated to affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of adults. Eczema is an inflammatory condition of the skin characterised by dryness and itching . The skin barrier is unable to function properly, which leads to water loss from the skin, triggering itching. Bacteria readily gain entry to the skin -especially if it has been scratched - and cause infection. Moisturisers or emollients are the first line in treatment and contain humectants. These contain ingredients that draw water from the lower levels of skin to rehydrate the upper levels and those which prevent further water loss from the surface while the barrier repairs. The inflammation is treated by topical steroids. Oatmeal baths have long been recommended for people with sensitive skin conditions including eczema. Oats have properties which meant they are able to naturally moisturise the skin and relieve itching. They also contain antioxidants which have an anti-inflammatory effect. 'I'd used light treatment, different creams, medication, herbal remedies - I'd tried everything,' she said. And in desperation to keep her condition at bay, she became reliant on steroid cream, which if used incorrectly, can thin skin and increase the risk of skin infections. Miss James said: 'If I had a flare up, I would use the cream all over then it would be at bay for two weeks. 'But when it came back it would be worse than ever.' Eventually, Miss James came across the International Topical Steroid Awareness Network (ITSAN) which has research showing a link between steroid cream and worsening eczema.' After discussing with her doctor, Miss James stopped using the treatment in May 2014 and is now using other skin creams to calm the eczema. But one of the most surprising and effective treatments she has found is porridge oats. She said: 'Now I make a face mask using goat's milk and porridge oats, it's really soothing. 'I have oat baths, you just use a pair of old tights to put the oats inside. 'The water looks disgusting but it works for me.' Her home treatment, along with anti-histamines from her GP, have cleared up her eczema on some of her body. She said: 'My face is much better now, and my stomach and legs you can't even tell I've got it.' However she still has severe eczema on her hands, neck and arms but is hopeful she will have further recovery. Despite porridge having helped her, she still wears cotton whenever she can. Miss James also credits her the support of her partner of six years, Nicola Wilson, 26, with her progress. She said: 'People don't realise how serious eczema is, they think it's just red skin that's a bit itchy' She said: 'Nicola is a teacher so she works long hours and then she comes home and looks after me. 'I can't bathe myself because of the condition so she washes me. 'We joke that she's become my carer.' However, due to the stress her body is under, and because she scratches patches of eczema on her head, for the past nine months Miss James' hair and eyebrows have been falling out. She now washes her hair just once a week – with shampoo for thin hair and to stimulate hair growth – so not to irritate her scalp further and cause more hair loss. She said: 'I have to be careful with my hair as it's holding on by a thread. I think others in my condition would have shaved their heads. 'It upsets me as I got my hair really long and healthy and then one day it started to fall out. I back-comb it to cover up bald patches. I'm trying to make the best of it.' She added: 'I started a blog to document my journey and so many people have been supportive. 'I'm no longer just the girl with the eczema.'

"Benjamin Netanyahu's wife drank excessive amounts of alcohol including three bottles of champagne a day, a former caretaker claimed in court. Meni Naftali is suing the Israeli Prime Minister's office over allegations he was subjected to abusive language during his 20 months on the job. In the witness box yesterday Naftali - who is seeking around $250,000 (£167,000) in damages - claimed Sara Netanyahu drank large amounts of alcohol. Mrs Netanyahu vehemently denies the claim. Sara Netanyahu (right), wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left), drank excessive amounts of alcohol including three bottles of champagne a day, a former caretaker claimed in court. Mrs Netanyahu denies the claims . The lawsuit, which was filed to the Jerusalem district labour court in Israel, states Naftali worked long hours and received 'unrestrained tongue-lashings from the prime minister's wife, Mrs. Sara Netanyahu'. It adds: 'The vast majority of which were with the prime minister's knowledge.' In one instance, Naftali said Mrs Netanyahu called him at 3am to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic storage bag instead of a carton, according to the lawsuit. In another, Naftali claimed that she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old. The cross-examination stage of the civil suit began yesterday. Naftali told the court that when he initially met Mrs Netanyahu he did not know she drank 'crazy amounts' of alcohol. The lawsuit states Naftali worked long hours and received 'unrestrained tongue-lashings from the prime minister's wife, Mrs. Sara Netanyahu'. Mr Netanyahu waves to supporters (above) after claiming victory in Israel's election . 'When I [later] became the house manager I found out that she drinks about three bottles of champagne a day,' the Times of Israel reported him saying. She also pocketed thousands of pounds of profits by recycling bottles purchased by the state, Naftali added in an earlier interview. Mrs Netanyahu denied any abusive treatment and said any allegations were 'designed solely to sully' her reputation. Cochavit Dolev-Netzach, representing the prime minister, confronted Naftali with allegations he had exhibited violent behaviour. Naftali denied the claim. Further cross-examinations will include questioning Mrs Netanyahu and Ezra Saidoff, the deputy director general of the Prime Minister’s Office, Israeli daily Haaretz reported. Guy Eliyahu and Emmanuel Sela, two former employees, are expected to act as witnesses to back up Naftali. Mr Netanyahu stands on stage with his wife. Naftali told the court that when he initially met Mrs Netanyahu he did not know she drank 'crazy amounts' of alcohol . Mrs Netanyahu has received criticism since  the 1990s after it was alleged she squabbled with her staff. Meanwhile, the government's state comptroller found in February that 'excessive' amounts of public funds were spent by Mr Netanyahu and his wife on food, furniture and gardening at their state residence and private home. In a report by the official watchdog, it was claimed cleaning expenses in the home on the coastal city of Caesarea averaged more than £1,370 a month in taxpayer's money even though the couple only spent the occasional weekend there.","Meni Naftali also alleges he was repeatedly subjected to abusive language .

But more and more frustrated Australians are ditching their travel plans and spending more time searching than they are on their actual holiday, a new study has found. A survey of 1000 people across the country by travel search engine KAYAK found that one in four Aussies spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their trip. Travel agents' interests, the overload of information online, hidden costs and fluctuating prices were found to be making holiday-bookers extra cautious with their plans. About 38 per cent of people admitted they spend more time looking for flights and hotels then researching the activities they hope to do on the trip. One in four Aussies, like Sydney marketing manager Sam Kelly (pictured on his last trip to Bali), spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their holidays . Sydney marketing manager Sam Kelly, admitted that the number of hours it took him to plan his last trip to Bali amounted to two weeks worth of working hours. 'I spend a lot of time - hours and hours - it's a big process. I don't go on budget holidays, but I've saved thousands of dollars by going through this process,' he told Daily Mail Australia. The 27-year-old said that he spent the time researching potential hotels and destinations by looking at various booking sites and reviews, adding that despite enjoying the process, he found it took up a 'ridiculous amount of time'. 'It's the amount of information out there. One website that will do that legwork for you and get you the best hotel prices, show you reviews and airfares all in the one currency - one true source of truth  -would be ideal,' he said. Mr Kelly admitted that it was during office hours that most of his searching and booking occurred, and he's not alone. According to KAYAK 26 per cent of those surveyed from Canberra did the same thing - a figure which almost three times the national average. It also found that 31 per cent of people have resorted to completely abandoning their travel plans and bookings due to their frustration. Investment banker Todd Fortescue came close to doing so himself when he and his girlfriend found themselves constantly bickering after becoming frustrated with travel agents helping them with their trip to Canada earlier this year. The 27-year-old said there was an information overload online and admitted that he did a lot of research for his flights and hotels while at work . Instead, the couple ditched their travel agent, choosing to find their own booking deals online. 'We were getting frustrated that we weren't getting anywhere with booking and that it was costing more than we had anticipated and were thinking that maybe we should postpone it for a year when we had more time and knew exactly what we wanted,' Mr Fortescue told Daily Mail Australia. 'We went to a travel agent to get assistance and gave them an outline of what we wanted but some of them would give us all these different stories about why they didn't have accommodation in certain areas. It seemed like they were working on commission with hotels because when we looked into the areas ourselves, we found plenty of options. 'There was this constant back and forth of emails and some agents were in different time zones and the more time we wasted the more money we wasted as we got closer to the dates. It was much cheaper when we did it ourselves.' Hidden costs were found to be one of the highest ranked frustrations for holiday-bookers, worse than fluctuating prices and information overload. Overall, KAYAK found that 86 per cent of the people they surveyed 'spend the same amount of time or more planning and booking holidays than they did three years ago', but that more than half reported their holiday satisfaction had declined or stayed the same.","A quarter of 1000 holiday-bookers surveyed take two weeks to plan a trip .

"The driver of a car that hit and killed a young woman in the early hours on Sunday morning was on the way to work, police believe. Brisbane woman Ashleigh Humphrys died in a hit-and-run incident after deciding to walk from Toowong to her Seventeen Mile Rocks home in Brisbane  after having an argument with a friend while they were out celebrating her 20th birthday. Now, after it was revealed that a man was assisting police with their investigations, officers have said they believe he was on his way to work and went to his shift as normal on Sunday, the Courier Mail reported. Scroll down for video . Ashleigh Humphrys was walking home after her 20th birthday celebrations when she was hit by a car and killed at 4am on Sunday in Brisbane . Police seized his car, believed to be a dark coloured sedan, which is also undergoing scientific investigation with the Forensic Crash Unit, according to Nine News. The young 20-year-old woman is believed to have either have been on her hands and knees or lying on the road when she was struck by a car and left to die. Police said people tried to put Ms Humphrys, who was understood to be intoxicated at the time, into a cab at a Caltex service station but she walked away. Police said Ms Humphrys’ injuries suggested she was low to the ground when she was hit in the right inbound lane on the Mt Coot-tha Rd extension of the Western Freeway between the two roundabouts. A security guard from a nearby service station called police after he witnessed Ms Humphrys walking in a disorientated state along the road . Only moments later the guard, who was still on the phone to police while driving around trying to find Ms Humphrys, discovered her dead on the road at the city end of the Western Freeway . A security guard from a nearby service station called police after he witnessed her walking in a disorientated state along the road,The Courier Mail reported. Only moments later the guard, who was still on the phone to police while driving around trying  to find Ms Humphrys, discovered her dead on the road. Just before Ms Humphrys was hit, CCTV footage shows two taxis stop near the woman and put their hazard lights on. It was then that a dark-coloured sedan drove past the taxis, mounted the footpath before swerving back onto the road and driving off. One taxi has been seized as part of the investigation after cabbie came forward last night and police said they were talking to a person who was 'within the vicinity' of the incident. Police  need to speak urgently with the other two drivers seen in the video footage at the time of the incident and will look for the other taxi driver through cab companies if they don't come forward.

Ms Humphrys decided to walk from Toowong to her Seventeen Mile Rocks home . Senior Sergeant Simon Lamerton strongly urged the driver in question to come forward for everyone concerned in the horrific incident. 'A young person has lost their life, the driver of this car is involved and for the sake of the family and for their own conscience and mental health into the future, these sorts of things you don’t want to carry with you,' he said to the Brisbane paper. 'Not only for your own conscience but also for the family and the purposes for the coronial report.' 'It's very important we hear your side.' Inspector Rob Graham said.

"As Demelza suggestively asked Ross Poldark to help unfasten her dress, it was the steamy love scene fans had been waiting for. But while most of the drama’s huge audience of viewers were transfixed by the unfolding romance, some were left scratching their heads with the question – how did she put on the gown in the first place without assistance? The strong-willed servant, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, 22, told Aidan Turner’s Poldark that she needed his help to remove the dress as it undid from the back. However, it was never explained how, this being the case, she had squeezed into the outfit unaided in the first place. Scroll down for video . How did she get it on? Demelza asked Poldark to help her to remove her dress, but fans were left confused as to how she got the gown on in the first place . By why would she want to? A Poldark spokesman said: 'Of course Demelza could have got the dress off by herself' This led to a number of fans of the BBC1 drama to take to Twitter during Sunday’s episode to pose this very question, with many joking it had been a clever ploy to lure Poldark between the sheets. With no sense of time passing, other viewers expressed puzzlement at how quickly the story was progressing, with Demelza marrying Poldark just minutes after they first kissed on screen. Also, Elizabeth, the other object of Poldark’s brooding affections, gave birth just one episode after dramatically announcing she was pregnant. Despite these minor concerns the vast majority of the audience still seem enthralled by the Cornwall-set adventure, based on the novels by Winston Graham. Just as the original 1970s series turned Robin Ellis into a global sex symbol, the hunky Turner, 31, is fast becoming the nation’s new favourite heartthrob. Pillow talk: Fans of the BBC1 drama took to Twitter during the episode to joke it had been a clever ploy to lure Poldark between the sheets . Morning after: Last weekend’s episode attracted 6.2million viewers, thanks in part to regular glimpses of the Cornish hero's toned torso . Viewing figures have been consistently impressive, with last weekend’s episode attracting 6.2million viewers and each of the first three instalments of the eight-part breaking the six million mark. But with such large audiences it becomes difficult to please everyone and the show has found some fans poking fun at it online. After Demelza and Poldark spent the night together, one tweeted: ‘Enjoying Poldark great chemistry between Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson - but how did Demelza get the dress done up?!’ While another added: ‘Okay Demelza I get it you need help getting your dress off *wink wink* but how exactly did you do it up in the first place?’ A third joked: ‘RE : Poldark & Demelza. As a costume fairy, I have to ask, if she needed help getting out of the dress... WHO GOT HER INTO THE DRESS [sic].’ Other viewers seemed fazed by the pace of the script. Fans pointed out that barely ten minutes elapsed between the scenes where Poldark first kissed Demelza and the pair tying the knot on screen. Others were left bemused that Elizabeth, played by Heida Reed, revealed she was pregnant at the end of the second episode and then gave birth during the third. Hunky hero: Just as the original 1970s series turned Robin Ellis into a global sex symbol, Aidan Turner (pictured) is fast becoming the nation’s new favourite heartthrob . One person posted on Twitter: ‘Writers of EastEnders will see how to move the plotline along. First kiss to wedding in five minutes!’ But another complained: ‘I’m annoyed with Poldark. The pacing was dreadful. Isn’t the whole point the tension between Ross and Demelza? What now?’ Writing about Elizabeth’s pregnancy, a fan added: ‘Poldark is rather good, would watch the next one now. Though if you are pregnant in Poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes.’ Complaints have previously been raised about the make-up in the programme. Some have claimed that Poldark’s scar, a souvenir from his time fighting in the American War of Independence, looks like mascara or hair dye running down his face. Others have pointed to Demezla appeared to be wearing perfect make up, despite having just escaped crushing poverty. A spokesman for the Poldark production team said: ‘OF COURSE Demelza could have got the dress off by herself!!! But why the hell would she want to?’","Eleanor Tomlinson's character needed Poldark's his help to remove dress .

"Questions: Matthew Yussman failed part of a lie detector test after claiming he'd been held hostage . A credit union manager who told police he was held hostage, strapped with explosives and ordered to rob $4.2 million from the bank failed part of a lie detector test, it has emerged. Matthew Yussman, 46, had claimed two masked men ambushed him in his home in Bristol, Connecticut in the early hours of February 23 and held him and his mother captive. The next day, they ordered him to rob two Achieve Financial Credit Union branches, he said. He was ultimately found outside one of the banks with a device strapped to his chest, while his mother was discovered on her bed with another explosive beneath it. Both bombs turned out to be fake. Police previously said they had not determined if Yussman was a victim or a suspect but it has now emerged that he gave deceptive answers during a lie detector test the night of the attempted heist. He apparently lied while answering a question about his involvement in the home invasion, according to the Bristol Press, citing a search warrant for Yussman's home. New Britain Police Chief James Wardwell said Yussman later withdrew from the test. 'He made the decision not to continue the interview a short time after,' Wardwell told the Press. The details emerged in search warrants secured this week for Yussman's home, car and laptop. Authorities previously took items, including his laptop and routers, and swabs from his home, and are investigating his cellphone and garbage bags taken from his car, among other items. The suspects reportedly ambushed Yussman in his garage as he returned home around 12.30am. Attempted heist: Police swarm around the Achieve Financial Credit Union in New Britain, Connecticut on February 23 after Yussman was found in the parking lot with a device strapped to his chest . Scare: Armored vehicles were seen on the scene before investigators learned the device would not go off. Yussman said two men stormed into his home that morning and took and his mother hostage . When his mother, who lives in an apartment on the side of the home, noticed he had failed to go inside, she checked on him and found him face-down with his hands zip-tied behind his back. Valerie Yussman, 70, told police that she saw the two 'well-spoken and polite' armed men in the garage and that they ordered her to stay on her bed. The men took Yussman from the home for 30 minutes around 3.30am after unplugging Mrs Yussman's phone, leaving her food and using duct tape to pin her to the bed. Her son told cops he was blindfolded and put in a car before they drove around for 30 minutes and returned to the house. It is not clear why they left the home. Valerie Yussman told police that she overheard the men saying they owed someone money and would kill the Yussmans unless they paid them. Her son and the men left later that morning after vacuuming a couple of rooms, she said. Around 8am, the bank's president called 911 and said Yussman had called him to explain his predicament, but told him not to call police. Minutes later, police found Yussman alone in his car outside the New Britain branch of the credit union and determined that the device on his chest was not going to detonate. Public works trucks were brought to the scene as 'shields' because they would be large enough to withstand a blast or stop a car from fleeing if needed, Wardwell said. Probe: Yussman, the manager of a Achieve Financial Credit Union branch (pictured), remains under investigation and search warrants have been granted for his home, car and laptop this week . The suspects had disappeared by the time police arrived. They are believed to have fled in a vehicle that looked like a white older model four-door Mazda, according to reports at the time. The incident sparked a massive police response involving dozens of officers and SWAT equipment. Schools were put on lockdown and roads were closed. Yussman was handcuffed and taken to the hospital, where he was for exposure to freezing temperatures while having to sit in the unheated car. His mother was not hurt. The investigation is continuing. No arrests have yet been made but police previously said they were looking for two suspects. 'We're considering all possibilities, whether or not [Yussman] was coerced, doing something against his will, or a suspect,' Wardwell said following the incident.","Matthew Yussman, 46, told police he was ambushed by two masked men while in his garage in Bristol, Connecticut on February 23 .

"A pair of Romanian burglars who stole more than £400,000 worth of property - including a tin of mackerel - have been branded 'a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde'. Ovidiu-Constantin Plamada, 31, and Mariana Sandra, 43, both with an address in Ilford, Essex, were jailed for six years each after admitting their role in 179 residential burglaries over seven months. The pair were arrested as they drove across the Dartford Bridge on November 4, last year with stolen goods taken in two recent burglaries. Ovidiu-Constantin Plamada, left, and Mariana Sandra, right, admitted a seven-month 179-home burglary spree . The pair stole random items including an umbrella, chewing gum and even hand disinfectant, pictured . Plamada and Sandra also stole jewellery, pictured, as part of their estimated £400,000 haul . Officers linked Plamada and Sandra to 179 burglaries across London, Essex and Kent. The pair stole everything from expensive jewellery, to random items such as a victim's dressing gown, woman's make-up set, a duvet and even a tin of mackerel. Other items recovered from the pair included a cigarette lighter, several packets of chewing gum and even a bottle of hand disinfectant. Judge Samatha Leigh jailed the pair for six years at Basildon Crown Court after they admitted the thefts. Judge Leigh said: 'You both committed highly organised offending that had a devastating effect on people and violated their homes. You are a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde.' Palmada and Sandra even stole one victim's make-up bag worth an estimated £100 - but far less second hand . Police initially questioned the pair about two burglaries but using the latest forensic techniques, they linked Plamada and Sandra to a string of other crimes. Detective Sergeant Brett Hagen, of the Metropolitan Police, said: 'Plamada and Sandra were a prolific burgling duo who committed a vast number of residential burglaries over a relatively short period of time. 'They were clearly committing burglary for financial gain, but also stole some strange items such as a tin of mackerel, women's make-up and a duvet set, suggesting they were actually using victims' personal property to furnish their home and their lifestyles. 'The jail sentence reflects the scale of their offending and will provide them with plenty of time to reflect on the dozens of victims who continue to suffer the effects of having been targeted by thieves. 'I would like to thank DC Trevor Guy of the Metropolitan Police and DC Steve Cunningham of Essex Police who both led their respective strands of the operation with tenacity and determination. 'The overwhelming evidence gathered by these officers has resulted in society being afforded a well-earned rest from the activities of two habitual thieves. 'In addition, as a result of this investigation a large number of victims have been reunited with their property.' Chief Inspector Mike Hamer of the Metropolitan Police added: ""This represents a fantastic result for the team and highlights the benefits of Police Constabularies working together to combat serious crime. 'The effects of becoming a victim of burglary run far deeper than a loss of property. 'I hope that the sentences bring a measure of closure to the vast number of people victimised by these criminals.' Other victims lost a lighter, some costume jewellery and even a USB charging point for a car's lighter .

"When the Queen ascended to the throne in 1952, the latest thing in ship design was the Orient Line's Oronsay, a 1,500-passenger vessel built by Vickers-Armstrong at its yard in Barrow-in-Furness. The excellent P&O Heritage website offers fascinating glimpses of life on board - all tea dances and cucumber sandwiches. What a change there is today. The bow of Britannia carries a huge stylised Union Jack, which serves not merely as a clever national marketing device, but broadcasts a British heritage which has been brought bang up to date . You feel that the latest P&O vessel Britannia, which the Queen officially named last Monday in Southampton, could fit the Oronsay on to one deck. However, they are not just vessels from different eras - they come from wholly dissimilar philosophies. Oronsay was built primarily to get passengers from Tilbury to Sydney - fun was considered to be a fancy dress party or the odd beetle drive. Britannia has been purposefully built for enjoyment. It is an entertainment monster, bristling with fun on almost every deck. It is, to borrow a line from poetry, a stately pleasure dome. It's customary to bemoan the compromised standards of the modern era, to yearn for the sturdier certainties of times past. Cruising, at least, is one area where newer almost always means better. P&O Cruises may be part of the American Carnival corporation these days but, happily, it remains British to the tips of its mastheads. The bow of Britannia carries a huge stylised Union Jack, which serves not merely as a clever national marketing device, but broadcasts a British heritage which has been brought bang up to date. The ambassadors for modern P&O Cruises are chefs such as Marco Pierre White, Atul Kochar and James Martin because it is in the area of food, strangely enough, in which the UK has begun to lead the world. Another area where we set the standard is in hotels: the international success of Nick Jones and his Soho House group has ushered in a new era of laid-back elegance. It is this very style that Britannia has captured so impressively. The modern era of British cruising, which P&O Cruises began with the Oriana more than 20 years ago, has now achieved an apotheosis with Britannia. For those poor holiday limpets who will not consider cruising because they refuse to acknowledge the emergence of what is arguably the purest form of holidaymaking, I have one piece of advice: be ruled by Britannia because Britannia really does rule the waves.","Britannia has been purposefully built for enjoyment .

"Homeopathic medicines are 'no more effective than placebo' in treating health problems, new research has concluded. A team of experts in Australia has warned people who choose homeopathy 'may put their health at risk' if they reject or delay traditional, mainstream treatments. They advise the alternative medicine is not used to treat health conditions that are chronic, serious, or those that have the potential to become serious. Homeopathy is a form of complementary, holistic medicine used by more than 200 million people across the world. Advocates advise it is used for both acute and chronic conditions. It is based on the principle of 'like cures like', the British Homeopathic Association states. A report from Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council has warned people who choose homeopathy 'may put their health at risk' if they reject or delay traditional, mainstream treatments . The idea is that substances that cause illnesses can become remedies in small, highly diluted doses. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council report assesses the evidence effectiveness of homeopathy for treating health conditions from a total of 225 existing studies, dating back to 1997. Each was rated by the team from one - very strong - to four - very weak - to determine the research's reliability. The council only used studies which were deemed controlled trials - and therefore included a comparison group who were not given homeopathic treatment. It found there is no conclusive evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebos in treating patients and easing their symptoms. The council's chief executive, professor Warwick Anderson, said: 'The review shows that there is no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy works better than a placebo. 'People who choose homeopathy may put their health at risk if they reject or delay treatments for which there is good evidence for safety and effectiveness. 'People who are considering whether to use homeopathy should first get advice from a registered health practitioner and in the meanwhile keep taking any prescribed treatments.' The researchers found homeopathic treatments were no more effective than sugar pills and other control, pretend medicines to treat asthma, migraines, stress and colds. Homeopathy is a form of complementary, holistic medicine used by more than 200 million people across the world. Advocates advise it is used for both acute and chronic conditions. It is based on the principle of 'like cures like', the British Homeopathic Association states. The idea is that substances that cause illnesses can become remedies in small, highly diluted doses. The BHA advise it can be used to treat eczema, depression, coughs, the menopause, chronic fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, hay fever, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. There were signs it was more effective than placebos for ADHD, bruising, HIV, chronic fatigue, ulcers and depression. But the council concluded the experiments were not carried out properly and the results were not very reliable. For a treatment to be considered effective, the council's Homeopathy Working Committee advised it must result in health improvements that cannot be explained by the placebo effect, and these health improvements must be meaningful for a person's overall health. There must also be evidence that the health improvements in people taking the treatment are unlikely to be due to chance and the result must be seen consistently in several studies, the council's report said. Professor Anderson concluded: 'From this review, the main recommendation for Australians is that they should not rely on homeopathy as a substitute for proven, effective treatments. 'This statement was the result of a rigorous examination of the evidence and used internationally accepted methods for assessing the quality and reliability of evidence for determining whether or not a therapy is effective for treating health conditions.' Homeopathic remedies are prepared by taking a substance, plant, animal or chemical material, diluting it in water or alcohol, then forcefully hitting the container against a hand or surface. The medicines come in the form of pellets to be placed under the tongue, tablets, liquids, ointments, sprays and creams. The Australian health council assessed the effectiveness of homeopathic medicines based on three criteria. In the first instance, they looked at a review of past studies, carried out by an independent contractor . The council found there is no conclusive evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebos in treating patients and easing their symptoms. Advocates of the alternative medicine say it is useful in treating a range of illnesses, including multiple sclerosis, colds, coughs as well as irritable bowel syndrome . In addition, experts considered an independent evaluation of information provided by homeopathy interest groups and the public. And finally, the council took into consideration clinical practice guidelines and government reports on homeopathy, published in countries across the world. Cristal Sumner, chief executive of The British Homeopathic Association said the Australian Council's report 'seriously misrepresents the nature of the clinical research evidence in homeopathy'. 'The NHMRC's conclusion fails to caution that the review admitted that ""the evidence base for the majority of clinical conditions was considered of insufficient size to enable clear conclusions on the efficacy of homeopathy to be drawn"",' she said. 'Moreover, the review's focus on medical conditions fails to recognise that homeopathy is based on individualised treatment, not on a named medical condition. 'A recent meta-analysis published by the British Homeopathic Association has provided independently verified evidence that individually prescribed homeopathic medicines may have clinical effects that are greater than those of placebos. 'The NHMRC's statement also fails to note that its review commended further quality research in homeopathy.'","Experts in Australia warn homeopathy 'may put people at risk' if they choose to delay or reject traditional medicines .

"Headteachers are failing to inform the police about would-be jihadi pupils at risk of travelling to Syria, a senior prosecutor has said. Nazir Afzal said schools were worried about pupils travelling to the war-torn country over the Easter break but were protecting teenage students as they do not want them placed under investigation. Mr Afzal, who stood down yesterday as chief crown prosecutor for northwest England, said the leaders of two London state secondary schools had told of him more than a dozen male and female pupils whose parents believed they were ‘groomed and seduced’ by Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Nazir Afzal (pictured) said schools were worried about pupils travelling to the war-torn country over the Easter break . However, police have not been told of the families’ concerns as the schools do not want their pupils to be criminalised. Mr Afzal told The Times: ‘One head said he was being approached almost on a daily basis by parents who fear their kids are about to go to Syria. ‘Both said they were scared of the Easter break and would be relieved if all their pupils came back after the holidays.’ One of the schools is in east London and the other in west London. Around 600 Britons, many of them teenagers or young adults, are believed to have joined IS since 2013. Several children have already travelled to Syria to join the extremist group, including four girls from Bethnal Green academy in east London. Around 600 Britons, many of them teenagers or young adults, are believed to have joined IS since 2013 (file picture) They paid cash for direct flights to Istanbul before crossing the border to Syria. Another four pupils were stopped from travelling. Mr Afzal said that the two head teachers who had spoken to him ‘had no idea what advice to give the parents’ and had complained about a lack of ‘face-to-face support’ for young people who are victims of online radicalisation. He said: ‘They didn’t know what to do. They’re told to direct parents to the police, but the parents don’t want the police to be told and the heads don’t want to criminalise their pupils. ‘They wanted to know why there was no therapeutic, preventative option for these children.’","Nazir Afzal said schools were worried about pupils travelling over holidays .

"Unmasked:Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi . A charity that funded the human rights group which described Jihadi John as a ‘beautiful young man’ has been forced to halt further donations. The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust had made six-figure donations to Cage, but links with the ‘warped’ campaign group prompted outrage from Westminster and the threat of a Charity Commission inquiry. The Mail has also highlighted criticism of Cage and its pronouncements about Jihadi John, identified as Mohammed Emwazi, for the past week. Last night the Rowntree trust reluctantly agreed to stop bankrolling Cage after officials at the Charity Commission – furious over Cage’s support for the IS killer – threatened a statutory inquiry into its leadership if it refused to give ‘unequivocal assurances’ it would withdraw funding. Cage caused outrage last week over its attempts to justify the killings meted out by Kuwaiti-born Briton Emwazi, because he had claimed to have been harassed by MI5. The campaign group gave an extraordinary press briefing about Emwazi – carried live at length on the BBC and Sky – after he was identified as the man behind the mask of Jihadi John. Asim Qureshi, its research director, described one of the world’s most wanted terrorists as a ‘beautiful young man’, ‘extremely gentle’ and ‘the most humble young person that I ever knew’. The 32-year-old blamed British security services for Emwazi’s radicalisation, saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an ‘outsider’. And on Thursday night, Qureshi was a guest on BBC1’s This Week, which appeared to expose him as a cheerleader for jihad. Scroll down for video . When presenter Andrew Neil confronted him with a previous interview in which he had appeared to support executing adulterers by stoning, he refused to give a straight confirmation or denial, instead repeatedly stating: ‘I’m not a theologian.’ Cage has been propped up largely by grants from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust since 2007, making a combined total of £305,000. The trust said its last grant payment to Cage was in January 2014. A separate charity, The Roddick Foundation, has also handed over £120,000 to Cage. The Charity Commission wrote to the Rowntree and Roddick charities on Monday, giving them 24 hours to give unambiguous assurances they would stop funding Cage. 'Warped' Cage's research director Asim Qureshi (left) at a press conference about Jihadi John last week . While officials at Roddick gave ‘immediate’ guarantees they would pull the plug, the Rowntree charity dragged its heels and agreed to stop funding Cage only after the Charity Commission threatened to launch an inquiry into how it is run. A source said Rowntree complained of ‘unprecedented regulatory pressure’ when they eventually backed down. The source added: ‘Very reluctantly, and with very little grace, Rowntree caved in at the 11th hour. It is extraordinary how they dithered over whether Cage was a suitable organisation to fund.’ The Charity Commission started investigating both the Rowntree and Roddick charities over their funding of Cage in 2013. Much of the rest of its income comes from cash donations from Muslims. Last week Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said: ‘Cage is an organisation with a warped view. No sensible person should be funding it.’ Sources at the Charity Commission believe officials at Rowntree may have been ‘duped’ when they agreed to support Cage. The Mail has highlighted criticism of Cage and its pronouncements about Jihadi John, identified as Mohammed Emwazi, for the past week . In a statement Rowntree said: ‘In the last week we have been put under intense regulatory pressure to rule out any future funding of Cage. ‘In the light of regulatory pressure, and to protect the interests of all our grantees and the other work of the Trust, we have decided to confirm we will not fund Cage either now or in the future.’ A Charity Commission spokesman said: ‘Statements by Cage officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities. In these circumstances, [we] required unequivocal assurances from the two charities that they have ceased funding Cage and had no intention of doing so in the future. We are glad both The Roddick Foundation and The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust have ceased funding Cage.’ A Cage spokesman said last night: ‘We respect their decision. We thank them for their past support. ‘Both of these charities have played a significant role in contributing to the development of Muslim civil society here in the UK.’","Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust had made six-figure donations to Cage .

"Most parenting advice says you don't have to worry if your baby doesn't start speaking until around 18 months. But that won't be an issue for Toni and Paul McCann from Ireland whose adorable son Cillian said his first word at just seven weeks old. The tiny tot, who is now nine weeks old, was filmed by his 36-year-old mother who says that she knew he had been trying to communicate for a while. In an adorable video, filmed by his mother Toni, Cillian McCann, then seven weeks old says his first word . Cillian has three older sisters, Toni revealed that her little girls, Sophie (bottom right), Eva (bottom left) and Ellie (top), did not start talking at such an early age . Toni said: 'He was trying to speak for a while but that day I knew he was trying to say something. 'I'd read that babies communicate from a young age and to give them space to answer when you talk to them. 'That was I was doing that day and because he was so alert and making such good eye contact I decided to video him. You can tell my total shock when he came out with ""hello"".' In the short clip, Cillian can be seen moving his mouth around trying to talk. After making several attempts he eventually comes out with his first word. Toni, who has three older daughters Sophia 12, Ellie, 11 and Eva, eight, said that she knew other people would be shocked when they saw the film. In the video Cillian is seen struggling to get his word out, but with a bit of encouragement from his mother he finally says hello . She said: 'If I hadn't have videoed it I'm sure people wouldn't have believed me. I don't think I would have believed it myself! 'After that he said it again to my daughter Eva although it wasn't as clear. When he has been focused and interacting with me since that day I have been telling him ""I love you"" and I can see he is trying to copy that! 'I have three older girls and never experienced this with them although I think I probably just talked ""at"" them and didn't give them space to respond.' Toni says that Cillian was very alert from a young age and had been trying to make out words since he was just five weeks old. This happy family snap shot shows the clever little boy resting on the back of one of his sisters, Eva (left), Ellie (middle) and Sophia (right) Toni said she is pleased that her little boy, pictured with his sisters Sophia, (left) Eva, (middle) and Ellie (right), can bring so much joy to the world . She said: 'He loves his sisters but from a very young age he always responded most positively to interaction from his dad, my husband Paul. 'From about five weeks old his little tongue would stick out when his dad was talking to him. I realise now he was trying to talk because that's what he does in the video.' And people have been very impressed by their talented son. 'People's reaction has been so lovely,' said Toni. 'Lots of people have said it brightened their day. Lots of people say they can't stop watching it. A girl I know said it is a perfect example of the love between mother and child! 'Some people don't believe it's real, that it's been edited but on the whole most people love it. That is really lovely for me as there is so much bad in the world it's great that my wee son is spreading some joy.'","Cillian McCann was filmed by his mother Toni at seven weeks old .

"Alaska wildlife officials are preparing to release North America's largest land mammal into its native US habitat for the first time in more than a century. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game plans to begin moving wood bison, which can weigh up to 2,000 pounds and stand six-feet-tall at the shoulder, from a conservation center near Anchorage to the village of Shageluk. A hundred wood bison will be released into the Innoko Flats about 350 miles southwest of Fairbanks in a few weeks after they're acclimated. Scroll down for video . The Alaska Department of Fish and Game plans to begin moving wood bison, which can weigh up to 2,000 pounds and stand six-feet-tall at the shoulder, to the village of Shageluk so they can be released in a few weeks . The bison will be flown in 20-foot containers that can hold seven adult cows in individual stalls or up to 17 younger bison. Two containers will be trucked Sunday to Anchorage and flown by commercial carrier for the hour flight to Shageluk. A C-130 from Lynden Air Cargo, one of the multiple corporate sponsors involved, can carry two containers each flight. Half the initial herd moved will be adult cows. About 25 are pregnant. The rest of the herd will be juveniles two years old or younger. Bulls will be barged to the area in summer. Wood bison feed on grasses, sedges and forbs and wider variety of other plants like the state's abundant willow . Biologist Cathie Harms said: 'This has been an incredibly long project - 23 years in the making, . 'To say we're excited is an understatement.' The state hopes to complete the flights by Tuesday but will proceed slowly if there are snags. Wood bison are very large, very powerful wild animals, Harms said. She added: 'We're making them do something they don't want to do/' Once in Shageluk, the bison will be kept in pens several acres large before being released in two or three week after 'they're in good shape'. Wood bison are the larger of two subspecies of American bison but did not roam in Lower 48 states. The smaller subspecies are plains bison, which were not native to Alaska but were introduced to the state in 1928, where they have thrived. Wood bison flourished for thousands of years in Alaska but disappeared in the 1800s or early 1900s. No one knows why. They feed on grasses, sedges and forbs and wider variety of other plants, including Alaska's abundant willow. The state had a strong interest in reintroduction as a source of food for subsistence hunters and as a game animal for sport hunting, but plans ran into a political snag. Wood bison flourished for thousands of years in Alaska but disappeared in the 1800s or early 1900s . In 2008, the state imported 53 wood bison from a national park in Canada, adding to a smaller herd that was held at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in Portage. However, wood bison are a threatened species and state officials worried that the federal government would designate their new home in the wild as critical habitat, requiring consultation with federal agencies before oil and gas drilling or other development could occur. The problems were worked out. The US Fish and Wildlife Service in 2013 declared that wood bison reintroduced in Alaska would be considered an experimental population not essential to the continued existence of the species. The wood bison will be managed by state wildlife officials and exempt from certain restrictions in the Endangered Species Act. The Fish and Game Department does not expect predators to be a problem. Biologist Harms said: 'Wolves don't seem to know what to do with them.' Alaska did not record a bear or a wolf killing a plains bison until nearly 30 years after they were introduced 87 years ago.","Animals can weigh 2,000lbs and are North America's largest land mammal .

"A man shot on the US-Canada border in Washington state was in the country illegally and wanted in connection with a murder, according to officials. The man, later identified as Jamison Childress, 20, was approached by two border agents after setting off ground sensors when crossing the border on Thursday afternoon, according to US Customs and Border Protection. He displayed 'erratic and threatening' behavior toward the agents and sprayed one of them with an incapacitating spray, the agency said. One of the agents then shot the man in the head and killed him about 300 yards from the border near Sumas, Washington. Scroll down for video . A man, later identified as Jamison Childress, 20, was shot near the US-Canada border (pictured) after 'erratic and threatening' behavior . Border authorities did not release the man's identity, which was later confirmed by a local medical examiner. He is thought to be from British Columbia. Whatcom County Sheriff Bill Elfo said that he was wanted in connection to a murder. Childress was set to stand trial for 2013 assault and mischief charges on Tuesday in Prince George, British Columbia, according to the Abbotsford BC News. He was also set to face charges for theft later this year. It was not clear where the murder he is connected to took place. Lawyer Michael Reed represented Childress previously and said that he was surprised by news of a murder charge, The Canadian Press reported. Reed expressed 'disbelief' about the incident. 'People cross the international border to bring crime and violence to our communities,' said at a news conference. The agent who was sprayed with the chemical required medical attention but was not seriously hurt, the agency said. The incident occurred at the small border crossing of Sumas, about 100 miles north of Seattle, Washington . Both agents involved in the incident, who have served 10 and 19 years, were placed on administrative leave. They were not identified Friday. A multiagency task force, including the sheriff's office, will investigate the shooting, which occurred shortly after 2.30 p.m. on Thursday. Sumas is about 100 miles north of Seattle. Officials released few details at the news conference, saying the investigation was in the early stages. They declined to release other details about the dead man. 'We have not confirmed his citizenship,' Elfo said, though the man was confirmed to have entered the US from Canada. 'It was apparent he was erratic and aggressively approached the agents,' he said. A hatchet was found in the man's backpack, but it was not displayed at the agents. One agent's face was burned by the spray, which Elfo did not identify. Previous media reports wrongly identified the dead man as Daniel Paul, 42, who is wanted for the murder of his girlfriend in Vancouver. He is still at large.

"Three major airlines are facing legal action over allegations of poor handling of passengers hit by disruption to flights. Jet2 and Wizz Air were said to have breached airline policies when it came to consistently offering their customers compensation for disrupted flights and had imposed false deadlines for claims. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) added that Aer Lingus and Jet2 had also failed to tell passengers about their right for compensation. Aer Lingus, Jet2 and Wizz Air have not made changes to their policies requested by regulators despite extensive discussions, it is claimed . All three airlines had also failed to make the changes to their policies requested by regulators despite extensive discussions, it is claimed. The CAA has announced it has launched enforcement action against the carriers and will seek a court order unless they comply. But a spokeswoman for Jet2 hit back at the claims, calling them 'materially inaccurate'. She said the airline was already paying £289 compensation per person for disruption caused by technical faults - in line with the Huzar ruling - even though their average fare is £80. 'Airlines are entitled to limit to two years the period in which claims can be made by contractual limitations and these have been upheld by the court on a number of occasions,' she added. 'Jet2.com strictly abides by court decisions and is acting in accordance with the law, not contrary to it. The CAA alleged that Jet2 and Wizz Air have failed to satisfy the regulator that they are consistently paying compensation for disruption caused by technical faults, despite a Court of Appeal ruling clarifying that airlines must do so . 'No enforcement action has been taken. The CAA is obligated to consult with Jet2.com before considering enforcement action. Given the misapprehensions of the CAA, Jet2.com expects that following the mandatory consultation process the CAA will not wish to take the matter any further.' A spokesman for Aer Lingus added: 'Aer Lingus' procedures, relating to the provision of information to customers affected by operational disruption, are fully compliant with all the relevant regulations. -Jet2 and Wizz Air have failed to satisfy the regulator that they are consistently paying compensation for disruption caused by technical faults, despite a Court of Appeal ruling clarifying that airlines must do so. -Jet 2 and Wizz Air are imposing two-year time limits for passengers to take compensation claims to court, despite a Court of Appeal ruling that passengers should have up to six years to take a claim to court. -Jet2 and Aer Lingus have failed to give satisfactory evidence that they proactively provide passengers with information about their rights during disruption in line with the requirements set out in European regulation. 'We have provided a number of documents to the CAA in recent months to substantiate this point and we continue to engage with the CAA to address their concerns.' The move by the CAA comes after the authority carried out a six-month review of airline policies in relation to supporting passengers during disruption, including their approaches to paying flight delay compensation and providing information to fliers about their rights. Wizz Air's spokesman Daniel de Carvalho said: 'An application for stay had been made regarding a case in the English courts while the European Court of Justice is considering a relevant case relating to the extent of airlines' liability to pay compensation claims in certain cases involving technical faults and defects. 'After this lawful application for stay was denied by English courts, Wizz Air decided not to appeal this decision and to re-assess the tens of cases where customers claimed compensation after flight disruptions caused by unforeseeable technical faults. 'The UK CAA is well aware that Wizz Air is re-assessing these cases and has confirmed to the UK CAA itself, some time ago, that it will apply the UK CAA's own list of extraordinary circumstances in the relevant cases. 'Wizz Air further confirms that claims can be raised within two years after the flight disruption, in line with its general conditions of carriage agreed to by customers at the time of booking, an approach which has been upheld by the English courts.' Aer Lingus denied claims and said their provision of information to customers affected by operational disruption,  were 'fully compliant with all the relevant regulations' Andrew Haines, chief executive of the CAA, said: 'Airlines are well aware of the support they must provide when there is disruption and passengers have every right to be disappointed that a small number of airlines are not complying with the Court of Appeal rulings and continue to let people down in this way. 'Since the law was clarified last year, we have been active to ensure airlines are applying consumer law appropriately and I warmly welcome the response of those airlines that have changed their policies as a result of this work. 'Our job is not done until all airlines can demonstrate they are providing care, assistance and compensation as required by law. 'While we have no power to secure redress for individual consumers, we are determined to stand up for passengers and are taking this action to safeguard their rights, making sure all airlines consistently provide their passengers with the support and compensation they are legally entitled to.'","Aer Lingus, Jet2 and Wizz Air facing legal action by Civil Aviation Authority .

"Almost a dozen retiring MPs could see upwards of $130,000 per year paid out to them in their pensions, a move which could cost taxpayers $20 million in coming years. Eleven of 19 members of parliament who are retiring after Saturday's NSW election, were elected before the pension reforms in 2007 and therefore qualify for the huge payouts. Former Liberal Premier Barry O'Farrell was first elected in 1995, so he will be eligible for the pension, however former Labor Premier Nathan Rees is among the eight MPs who will miss out, The Daily Telegraph reported. Nearly a dozen retiring MPs, including former NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell have huge pensions awaiting them . Former Labor MPs Richard Amery (left) and Barry Collier (right) qualify to receive at least $130,000 a year . George Souris, Nationals MP will also be eligible for a large sum after more than a quarter of a century in parliament . Mr Rees will instead receive a standard superannuation scheme, akin to those other public servants are rewarded. The guidelines state that retiring members of parliament who have served a minimum of seven years, and were elected before 2007 are entitled to 48.8 per cent of the base parliamentary salary of $149,541. For each month past the seven year mark, that figure rises by 0.2 per cent, meaning some MPs such as Labor's former father of the house Richard Amery could see more than $150,000 a year after his 32 year service. Labor MPs Carmel Tebbutt (left) and Cherie Burton (right) will also be eligible for a large sum . Liberal MP Robyn Parker (pictured) qualifies for the hefty pension scheme . Former Premier Morris Iemma introduced the new reforms in 2007, after a report revealed the extent to which taxpayers were footing the bill. Nationals MP George Souris will also be eligible for a large sum after more than a quarter of a century in parliament, as will Labor MPs Carmel Tebbutt and Cherie Burton. Other candidates from the Labor camp include Barry Collier and Barbara Perry. Liberal MP Robyn Parker qualifies for the hefty pension scheme, as does Nationals' Andrew Stoner and Don Page, and Independent Chris Hartcher. Independent Chris Hartcher is eligible for the scheme, which was changed in 2007 to make it more modest . Former NSW deputy Premier Andrew Stoner (left) can look forward to a profitable pension, as can fellow Nationals MP Don Page (right) Between these 11 MPs the bill taxpayers may have to foot could reach $20 million over coming decades, taking into account the average life expectancy of Australians. However the scheme has been heavily criticised by Greens upper house member John Kaye, who described it as 'excessively generous'. 'The old scheme was excessively generous and most people would look at it and question where the fairness is', Mr Kaye told The Daily Telegraph. He added that some MPs eligible for the old scheme 'clearly don't need it', and asked them to watch how they spend their cash.

"The Director-General of the BBC is being protected by an elite squad of bodyguards after receiving a chilling death threat over the sacking of Jeremy Clarkson. Tony Hall and his wife Cynthia have been guarded round the clock at their home since a terrifying email was sent to the BBC just hours after he took the dramatic decision to drop the controversial Top Gear star. Last night Scotland Yard confirmed officers were investigating the 'threat to kill' made on Wednesday, after the BBC decided it was 'credible' and alerted police. Scroll down for video . Tony Hall, the Director General of the BBC, leaves his home escorted by security officers . Lord Hall was placed under protection immediately after the BBC received the death threat . Lord Hall leaves his Oxfordshire home as a personal protection security van remains parked outside . The Mail on Sunday has learned that the BBC's head of security put out an urgent appeal for ex-Special Forces personnel to take part in the top-secret operation to protect Lord Hall, at a cost to licence payers estimated at more than £1,000 a day. A security source told this newspaper: 'There was a sudden urgency on Wednesday to find an eight-man security team to protect the Director-General of the BBC. 'A select group of close protection officers were approached and told that, as a direct result of the Top Gear punch-up and Jeremy Clarkson being sacked by the BBC, the DG had received a death threat. 'Some of the operation was visible, as a deterrent, while other bodyguards would have kept a very low profile.' Closely guarded: Lord Hall arrives back at his home in with security minders standing by . Under protection: Last night Scotland Yard confirmed officers were investigating the 'threat to kill' made on Wednesday, after the BBC decided it was 'credible' and alerted police . On alert: The Director-General of the BBC is being protected by an elite squad of bodyguards . Our exclusive pictures show that within hours of the death threat being made, Lord Hall and his wife were under close guard at their £1.5 million Oxfordshire home. At 10.30am on Thursday, two men sat in unmarked Mercedes cars parked on double yellow lines outside Lord Hall's 18th Century townhouse, occasionally mounting patrols around the nearby streets. At 4.40pm one of the cars, a saloon, pulled up outside the front door and the driver waved to the driver of the other car, an estate. Lady Hall emerged from their house and was escorted to the saloon and driven off, before the car returned without her. At 9pm that evening the two men in the Mercedes cars were relieved by a team from a leading provider of security services. A Ford Transit Connect van marked London Protection Services Ltd drew up outside the house and two black-clad men sat outside the property overnight. Security team members keep a close eye on Lord Hall's wife Cynthia as she escorted from the property . The firm, which has 1,000 operatives from military, Special Forces and police backgrounds, charges £300 per man, per shift. At 6am on Friday, Lady Hall came out of her front door to speak to one of the security men, who then joined her inside the house. Lord Hall, dressed down in a green Barbour jacket, black jeans and walking boots, then emerged and drove a mud-spattered Jeep to the front door. He filled up the boot of the off-road vehicle, watched by the bodyguards, before his wife joined him and they drove off together. It is believed they went to their second home in the West Country for the weekend after Lord Hall's most turbulent week at head of the BBC since he took over two years ago in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Director-General became a target after taking the final decision to axe Clarkson, the BBC's biggest star, from his £1 million-a-year role presenting the Corporation's biggest global money-spinner. Overnight shift: The guards remained stationed outside the property throughout the night . Two security team members hired to protect Lord Hall and his wife stand guard beside unmarked cars . He decided not to renew the 54-year-old's Top Gear contract after an internal investigation found that he had punched producer Oisin Tymon in a 30-second physical assault, following a prolonged verbal tirade. The 'fracas' was over the lack of a hot meal after a day's filming. North Yorkshire Police are investigating – but although Mr Tymon does not want them to press charges, he has been the subject of sustained abuse from Top Gear fans who blame him for Clarkson's sacking. One Twitter user said they hoped Mr Tymon 'visits the morgue very soon' while another wrote: 'Tony Hall BBC director, I wonder if Oisin's and your head can stop a bullet!!! just wondering.' The chilling email was sent to the BBC just hours after Lord Hall announced Jeremy Clarkson (pictured) was being sacked . An insider said: 'With less than 12 hours' notice the close protection officers were asked if they could go to the DG's house to protect him and his family. The job was described as a ""fastball"", which meant that an immediate response to the threat was required. The threat was also regarded as credible. 'On that basis, requests for close protection officers to make themselves available for this job were put out on Facebook pages and groups which are strictly for approved and highly qualified security personnel. A number of close protection officers came forward and were briefed about the threat to Tony Hall. 'The security operation took various forms, including personal security at home and following his car when he was driving. ' Lord Hall has received a death threat before. In 1999 he went into hiding under police protection following a call that said he would be 'next' after the murder of Jill Dando. At the time, Lord Hall was chief executive of BBC News. The new threat is the most serious made to a senior Corporation figure since a decade ago, when BBC 2 controller Roly Keating had to go into hiding after being accused of blasphemy for screening the Jerry Springer opera, which depicted Jesus in a nappy. Scotland Yard said last night: 'Police in Westminster are investigating an allegation of threats to kill. The allegation was reported to police on Wednesday. Enquiries continue. No arrests have been made.' The BBC added: 'We wouldn't comment on security matters.'","BBC boss Tony Hall has been placed under protection of elite bodyguards .

The family's attorney, James Maron, said the Esmonds began to have seizures on Friday, and they were taken to island hospitals and airlifted back to the Philadelphia area by Monday. 'Their conditions, while serious, are stable and improving,' the attorney said in a statement issued to The News Journal. 'The boys remain in critical condition.' The odourless pesticide used inside a suite at the complex was reported to be methyl bromide, which is used to treat mould, insects and rodents. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are investigating whether the family was poisoned by a pesticide . According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, the odourless pesticide can be fatal or cause serious central nervous system and respiratory system damage. As it is acutely toxic, use of the pesticide is restricted to outdoor use only in the United States. Investigators confirmed that the chemical was applied 'to deal with indoor bugs,' said Judith Enck, an administrator for the EPA, to USA Today. 'Their conditions, while serious, are stable and improving,' a statement from Maron's law office said. 'The boys remain in critical condition.' Steve Esmond is the administrator of Tatnall Middle School in Wilmington, Delaware, and his wife, Theresa, is a dentist. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa Condominium Resort, told 6ABC that it is aware that the family became seriously ill, but that the unit where they stayed was not treated with a pesticide. It said that pesticide was used to treat the unit immediately below the suite where the Esmonds were staying.","Esmond family began to have seizures at their resort at US Virgin Islands .

"Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are 'fearing the worst' as Italy's highest court prepares to decide their fate, according to their entourage. Knox is waiting for the verdict in their final appeal for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher at home in Seattle, while her one-time lover is in Rome for the hearing at the city's imposing Supreme Court, nicknamed the Palazzaccio or 'Bad Palace'. Sollecito could be seen arriving at court this morning with his current girlfriend Greta Menegaldo, before appearing deep in thought as he left this evening after the case was adjourned until Friday morning. Knox's lawyer Carlo della Vedova described her client as 'very worried' about adding: 'She hasn't been sleeping much.' Della Vedova also scotched rumours that the American had been trying to get pregnant to avoid possible extradition. 'That is absolutely false. She is not engaged either,' he said. However, it has now been revealed Knox's lawyers have turned to the European Court of Human Rights in a last ditch attempt to stop the final ratification of her conviction for murder. They have asked for the case to be suspended, pending the acceptance of her appeal to the European Court against a conviction for slander. Scroll down for video . Raffaele Sollecito is pictured leaving Rome's Supreme Court today as Italy's top judges delayed until Friday a ruling on whether to uphold his and Amanda Knox's conviction for the murder of student Meredith Kercher .

Supporters of Raffaele Sollecito and Amanda Knox are seen outside the court this morning . Knox at a television interview in New York last year. She has always denied murdering Ms Kercher (right) Knox claims that she was coerced by police into making false statements blaming the murder on bar owner Patrick Lumumba during interrogations of more than 40 hours in November 2007. As the slander is considered circumstantial evidence in her murder trial, her legal team asked for the murder trial to be suspended, Knox defence lawyer Carlo Della Vedova confirmed. But the move has left representatives of the Kercher family shocked. The Kercher's lawyer Vieri Fabiani said: ‘If the Strasbourg court condemns the Italian Republic, what would it change? What could it usefully serve? Absolutely nothing.’ Meanwhile, a consultant for Sollecito said that he had already said his goodbyes to his family and air hostess girlfriend Greta Menegaldo, who accompanied him to the packed courtroom this morning, where neither was able to find a seat. The assistant said: 'It is as if he is not there anymore. He said goodbye to his family and Greta outside the court. He fears the worst.' Knox and Sollecito served four years for the brutal murder of Leeds Student Miss Kercher in Perugia in 2007. She was found half naked with multiple stab wounds to her body and a deep gash in her throat. The pair were freed on appeal in 2011. But last year, they were sensationally reconvicted and ordered to serve 28 and 25 years respectively for the murder. Now the Supreme Court can opt to confirm the convictions, in which case extradition proceedings would start against Knox.  Or if they find contradictions or illogicality in the guilty sentence they could send the trial back to appeal stage. Sollecito has asked to have his case annulled on the basis that it should have been separated from that of Knox, as all the proof points to her. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito in their infamous clinch after they were named as suspects in Ms Kercher's murder. Sollecito now claims their stories on the night of Ms Kercher's death are not 'intertwined' Sollecito (right) has seemingly abandoned all loyalty to Knox (left) with his bid to distance himself from her . Sollecito out with his girlfriend Greta Menegaldo (left). Knox (right) is pictured in Seattle on a recent outing . One of the world's leading DNA experts, who has extensively investigated the murder of Meredith Kutcher, has claimed the forensic evidence against Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito is 'incredulous' and 'made up' by prosecutors.' Knox, 27, and Sollecito, 30,  stand accused of killing the British student in Perugia and the Italian Supreme Court is expected to either uphold or quash their convictions today. Professor Peter Gill, a lecturer of Forensic Genetics at Oslo University, Norway, looked in-depth at the DNA results from the crime scene using the originally analysis by the Italian Police Scientific Department and also a second independent analysis ordered by the judge in the first appeal. In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, Professor Gill admits that the evidence against Knox and Sollecito is very weak and and compares it to something out of the fictional CSI TV series. He said: 'It's very, very tenuous to use this [DNA] evidence to link to the conclusion that it proves  an activity such as stabbing a victim. If Knoxs' conviction is upheld she could delay going to jail if she were pregnant, according to Italian legal experts. There has also been speculation that political pressure from the US could hamper the extradition process. Sollecito is reportedly seeking to separate his case from Knox's, with his lawyers pointing out that a partial confession written by the American and later retracted did not mention his presence at the scene of the crime. If that argument succeeds, the Italian could be given a new trial. Since being convicted Sollecito has deserted Knox, his one-time lover, and is now insisting that their positions are 'not intertwined'. His case should have been considered independently of Knox's, he now insists. Yesterday bombshell court papers revealed that Sollecito claims he does not remember whether Knox was with him at the time of Ms Kercher's murder. In a dramatic change in legal strategy, Sollecito has cast serious doubt on Foxy Knoxy's alibi, with the Italian now saying he can't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night on which the British student was brutally murdered. All the evidence against the former couple points to Knox, Sollecito claims in papers filed by his lawyers in advance of the make-or-break Supreme Court hearing today. Ms Kercher, a 21-year-old student from Coulsdon, Surrey, (left) was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in Perugia in 2007. Knox (right) is appealing a decision reinstating what was her conviction for killing Kercher . Rudy Guede is serving a 16-year sentence for his involvement in Kercher's death after a separate trial . The house in Perugia where British student Meredith Kercher was murdered aged just 21 in November 2007 . Supporters of Amanda Knox are convinced that her guilty verdict for murder will be upheld by the Italian Supreme Court when they make their decision later this week. American Amanda Knox and Italian Raffaele Sollecito both stand accused of killing British student Meredith Kercher and have been tried three times for the crime. The last hearing, in January last year, again found them guilty. Knox's legal team has been warned that this decision is likely to be rubber-stamped by the Supreme Court today. People close to the case do not believe Ms Knox stands a chance in the hugely-divisive case. One supporter said they were prepared for  the 'greatest miscarriage of justice' that has ever happened to a US citizen. In their previous two trials, Knox maintained that they were together at Sollecito's flat on the night of the murder after which Miss Kercher, 21, was found half-naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy. In an A-Z of reasons for distancing his position from hers, Sollecito's lawyers are attempting to demonstrate that the evidence used against Knox does not concern him. In the 306-page paper, Sollecito claims that his computer records prove he was watching the Japanese Manga cartoon Naruto at the time of the alleged murder. But he is not sure whether Knox was at his house for the whole night as he had been smoking marijuana. The document says: 'The defence intends to emphasise that Sollecito has always shown himself to be extraneous to the crime, and has always said that that night he did not move from his own home. However, he did not rule out that Knox could have gone out.' The document also points out that Knox, unlike Sollecito, had an alleged motive for the murder.

This photo in November 2007 shows Knox (left) and Sollecito together. The pair were 20 and 24 at the time . The report explaining the motivation  refers to a statement that Rudy Guede made to police that Miss Kercher believed Knox stole €300 and two credits cards from her. Ivory Coast-born Guede is serving a 16-year jail sentence for his involvement in Kercher's death after a separate trial. Judges ruled he did not act alone. Sollecito, by contrast with Knox, 'had no reason to want the death of Meredith Kercher.' The document states: 'The alleged motives [not getting along and the missing €300] concern only relations between the victim and Amanda Knox, not Sollecito.'","Raffaele Sollecito, 30, arrived at Italy's highest court in Rome this morning .

The mother Takisha Douglas had dropped her son off at Harris's home while she went to work on Friday. She says she called Harris while at work and the babysitter said she was taking the boy to a New Orleans grocery store. Douglas says she called again after getting off work and Harris's phone went to voicemail, reports the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Authorities had since issued an endangered-missing child advisory for the boy. Why'd she do it? Harris was found walking along an eastern New Orleans street around 7:30am Sunday morning with the infant. It remained unclear Sunday afternoon what her alleged intentions were . Douglas had reportedly known Harris for years but that this was the first time she'd looked after her child. St. Bernard Sheriff Jimmy Pohlmann told the Times-Picayune that local authorities worked with the FBI leading up to the arrest. Pohlmann said Harris was found walking along an eastern New Orleans street around 7:30am Sunday morning with the infant.

"A couple falsely claimed £90,000 in benefits to fund their dream wedding in Cuba which took place while they were on bail for previous fraud. Tracey Dougherty, 38, and Stephen Turner, 60, claimed tens of thousands of pounds together over a period of 15 years. Dougherty told officials she was a single mother of four to claim income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit while Turner claimed out-of-work benefits despite being a self-employed driving instructor. Tracey Dougherty and Stephen Turner conned officials out of almost £90,000 in benefits that was used in part to fund their lavish Cuba wedding . The couple's deception was discovered when police searching their Wigan home found wedding invitations on which Ms Dougherty boasted about paying for guests' flights. She was jailed for eight months while her husband was ordered to repay more than £2,000 following a trial at Liverpool Crown Court. The court heard how Dougherty had been claiming taxpayer's money on the premise that she was a single parent since 2000. She had in fact moved in with Turner who was also given government money as his mother's carer for a spell. Alone the woman claimed more than £84,000 over 12 years, all the while living with her partner. In August 2013 the couple were arrested when officials suspected they had been committing benefit fraud. The couple flew 20 guests to the exotic destination for their 2013 nuptials after being bailed for fraud . Ms Dougherty claimed benefits for a single parent despite living with her partner and her four children for 12 years . The following month, after denying living together, they married in the exotic setting while on bail, the conditions of which did not prevent them from travelling abroad. They both pleaded guilty to falsely claiming benefits at Liverpool Crown Court. Council bosses have slammed their behaviour since. Councillor Paul Kenny said: 'This couple lived a lavish lifestyle at the expense of the local taxpayer. 'At a time when people are struggling to make ends meet, this kind of behaviour will no doubt frustrate those footing the bill. 'Benefits are there for people who need them, not for those who want to subsidise their income and pay for expensive holidays.'

"A Mexican Mafia hit man convicted of beating and strangling a San Antonio woman because she didn't pay the gang's 10 per cent tax on her illegal drug sales was executed Wednesday evening. The injection of Manuel Vasquez with a lethal dose of pentobarbital leaves Texas with enough of the powerful sedative to carry out only one more execution. Vasquez was the fourth Texas inmate put to death this year, and at least six are scheduled for execution in the coming weeks. Texas prison officials, like those in other death penalty states, have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use. Scroll down for video . Put to death: Gang enforcer Manuel Vasquez, 46, was executed Wednesday for the ordered murder of a San Antonio woman who ignored a 10 per cent street tax on drugs known as a 'dime' Vasquez, 46, was pronounced dead at 6.32pm CDT, 17 minutes after the drug began being administered. Vasquez, in a final statement, told his family and friends he loved them and thanked 'the Lord for his kind mercy, faithfulness and unconditional love.' 'In Jesus' name I pray,' he said, then told the warden: 'I'm ready.' He took three deep breaths, then began snoring loudly. The snores became progressively quiet, and all movement stopped within less than a minute. The sister of his victim was among witnesses watching through a window. He never looked at her. His own sister and a female friend cried as they watched in an adjacent room. Vasquez's lawyers filed no late appeals to delay his execution for the 1998 slaying of 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra. Evidence at Vasquez's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra for ignoring the Mexican Mafia's 10 per cent street tax on drugs — known as a 'dime.' 'I'm sure she was told if you're selling, you've got to pay the tax,' said Mary Green, an assistant Bexar County district attorney who prosecuted Vasquez. 'I guess she didn't take it seriously.' After a night of drinking and drugs at a run-down San Antonio motel, Vasquez and two companions put on bandannas on their facesbarged into the nearby room of Ybarra and her boyfriend, Moses Bazan, early on March 19, 1998, according to evidence presented at his trial. Bazan was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw Ybarra being beaten, heard Vasquez holler that she was biting him and saw Vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle Ybarra. The attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry, stuffed them into a pillowcase and fled. When Bazan regained consciousness, he stumbled to the motel office to summon police. He was able to identify at least one of the attackers, leading to the arrest of all three. One of them, Johnny Joe Cruz, took a plea deal that carried a seven-year sentence and testified against Vasquez. The third man charged, Oligario Lujan, is serving a 35-year prison term. Court records show the three were carrying out orders from Mexican Mafia boss Rene Munoz, who spent years on the Texas Department of Public Safety's 10 Most Wanted List until his arrest in 2012. Joel Perez, Vasquez's lead trial lawyer, recalled last week that the motive for the slaying was 'very detrimental'. 'We have the Texas Mexican Mafia, and anyone selling drugs they collect a dime - 10 percent,' he said. 'And the motive in this case was she wasn't paying.' Detectives also found the blood of the victims and Vasquez's blood on clothing left in the trunk of a car he used. 'It put him at the scene when he denied being around there,' Mary Green, an assistant Bexar County district attorney who prosecuted Vasquez, said. The lethal injection of Manuel Vasquez on Wednesday evening at Huntsville prison in Texas would leave T officials in the nation's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply . 'I recall he was an extremely violent individual. In the punishment phase we proved up two other homicides he'd been involved with.' Vasquez had a lengthy record and had been in and out of prison at least twice. One conviction involved the beating of a man who died after his body was set on fire. Records also show Vasquez' father is serving a life sentence for a 1976 murder, and a brother and cousins are or have been in prison. Texas' next execution is scheduled for next week. Randall Mays is set to die for a 2007 shootout where two East Texas sheriff's deputies were killed. Executions set for April in the nation's most active death penalty state will require a new lethal drug supply to be carried out. Some states have started considering other options. Utah's Legislature gave final approval Tuesday night to a proposal to allow executions by firing squad if there is a drug shortage. Legislation to allow firing squads also has been introduced in Arkansas, while a Wyoming firing-squad measure failed. In Oklahoma, lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow the state to use nitrogen gas to execute inmates. 'I remain optimistic we'll be able to carry out executions according to the schedule,' Brad Livingston, executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, has told The Associated Press. 'Time will tell.' Vasquez' execution is the 522nd in Texas since the state reinstated capital punishment in 1976.","Manuel Vasquez, 46, was injected with lethal dose of pentobarbital for carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra in San Antonio, Texas .

"Security experts have warned of the dangers associated with USB drives for some time, but until now, the biggest danger has been viruses and malware. Now there is a new potential threat that turns the lowly thumb drive into a ‘laptop killer’ by using a high voltage to destroy the computer’s components. Dubbed ‘USB Killer’, the crude device was created by a Russian electronics expert known as Dark Purple. The malicious drive has been dubbed ‘USB Killer’ and it uses a high voltage and current to ‘fry’ the laptop’s components. The prototype (pictured) was created by a Russian electronics expert known as Dark Purple . The user posted photos and specifications about the project on Russian blog Habrahabr, and this was later syndicated and posted in English on Kukuruku. The English post said: ‘I work in [a] company engaged in the development and manufacture of electronics. ‘In modern computers, the USB ‘physics’ is built in the processor [and] the task of the designed USB flash drive is to burn all of this stuff, or at least kill the USB port.’ Dark Purple posted photos and specifications about his project on Russian blog Habrahabr. The user said: 'In modern computers, the USB ‘physics’ is built in the processor [and] the task of the designed USB flash drive is to burn all of this stuff, or at least kill the USB port’ (the custom circuit board is pictured) The drive uses high voltage and high current to ‘fry’ the electronics inside the port. And because this port is often connected to the CPU, the whole laptop can be affected. A colleague of Dark Purple is reported as saying the device is ‘like an atomic bomb: cool to have, but can not be applied’ Dark Purple ordered the parts, including a custom circuit board, from China before making a ‘full-fledged prototype’. And in tests, the user said they had ‘burnt down’ everything they could. In November a team of Berlin-based researchers reverse-engineered the files that control how a USB drive's software works. This so-called firmware was then reprogrammed to give complete control of a PC to the hacker. Firmware is a software program, or set of instructions, programmed onto a hardware device. It tells the device how to communicate with other devices, including computers. Drive manufacturers will often update firmware to improve the performance of their devices. These changes are made at a central level before being pushed out to individual devices. The flaw was discovered by Karsten Nohl and Jakob Lell at Security Research Labs has been dubbed BadUSB. It affects thumb drives and external hard drives, but also any device that connects to a PC using USB. This includes keyboards and the mouse, as well as the USB drives used to charge phones and tablets. ‘The basic idea of the USB drive is quite simple,’ explained Dark Purple. ‘When connected to the USB port, an inverting DC/DC converter runs and charges capacitors to -110V [and] when the voltage is reached, the DC/DC is switched off. ‘The loop runs till everything possible is broken down.’ Put more simply, it uses high voltage and high current to ‘fry’ the electronics inside the port.

"A terminally ill bride has been granted her dying wish of a dream wedding after being given just six weeks to live. Natalie Price, of Redditch, Worcestershire, planned her big day in just 20 days after being told her lung disease, which also claimed the life of her mother, was terminal on March 6. The mother-of-two, whose eight-year-old son Bradley has just been diagnosed with the same condition - fibrosing alveolitis - and her partner of 11 years, Andy, planned the wedding to ensure they had a fairy tale wedding. A thrilled Natalie and Andy Price hold their marriage certificate after organising their wedding in just 20 days . Natalie and Andy celebrate their big day with sons Callum (on her immediate left) and Bradley, right, as family and friends look on . Andy sprang into action along with family and friends to make it happen. And yesterday Natalie enjoyed her dream wedding day as she married her long-term sweetheart in front of family and friends. 'I'm so happy to have finally married Andy,' Natalie, who lost her ten-week-old baby daughter, Paige, to cot death, said. 'Our wedding day was the best day of my life.' Now the 30-year-old has just one more bucket list wish - to raise enough money to send her two sons, Callum, 11, and Bradley to Disneyland Florida after she dies to take their mind off the pain of losing their mum. Andy, 48, said he was determined that Natalie would have the dream wedding she always wanted. 'Natalie and I have been together for 11-years and we are soul mates. We'd always wanted to get married but we just never got round to planning it. Natalie's father, William Bradley, walks her down the aisle while the guests wait inside . The couple said they had always planned to marry after being together for 11 years . 'After ten months of regular scans and X-rays to monitor Natalie’s health we were told the devastating news that she had declined rapidly and had just six weeks to live. We knew from that moment we needed to act fast. 'Our wedding day was the best day of our lives, it was perfect in every way - I just wish I could have my wife for longer than just a few short weeks. 'It was mine and Natalie’s dream to get married and thanks to our family, friends Lisa Dorgan and Laurence Walsh, and local businesses, we were able to fulfil that wish before it was too late. 'It breaks my heart to think about the future without her but I need to stay strong for our boys. 'Seeing Natalie come down the aisle in her dress allowed me to forget all the heartbreak for just a minute. Fibrosing alveolitis is a relatively rare lung condition which causes scarring and thickening of the alveoli - tiny air sacs - leading to shortness of breath. Developing over a number of months or years, the condition is difficult to treat and is usually long term. In some cases, fibrosing alveolitis is the result of an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the body’s own healthy tissues. However, about half of all cases are idiopathic, which means no cause can be identified. 'It was the most magical day and we will never forget it.' Natalie’s wedding day was provided free of charge by Micheala Evans, manager at The Southcrest Manor Hotel, Redditch, who arranged for the registrar and 100 guests to attend the ceremony. 'I can’t believe how amazing our local community has been, they’ve made mine and Natalie’s dream come true and it’s a day we’ll never forget,' added Andy. 'She looked beautiful on our wedding day and our boys Bradley and Callum really enjoyed themselves too. 'Before the wedding we sat down with the boys and the Primrose Hospice to tell them that their mummy is going to die. Cuddle time: Natalie gives her young niece Scarlett Nason a hug . The happy couple smile during the civil ceremony with their young sons acting as ring bearers . 'That was the most difficult and heartbreaking thing we have ever had to do.' Family friend, Lisa Dorgan, decided to help raise funds to pay for specialised treatment for Natalie in America by taking part in the 10km Birmingham Morrisons Run in May and so far has pledges amounting to £5,000 via her GoFundMe page. 'I've known Natalie for years as our mums were best friends,' she said. 'I decided to raise funds for her to go to Chicago for a life-saving transplant but Natalie’s health deteriorated so rapidly and after being given just weeks to live, that was no longer an option. Sealed with a kiss: Andy kisses his bride who is having the wedding day she dreamed . Andy and Natalie relax with their sons Callum and Bradley at their home in Redditch . 'The money raised is now going towards sending her boys to Disneyland as we managed to tick off her dream wedding without dipping into it. 'I’m over the moon that her big wedding day was organised so quickly and that her boys will hopefully get the chance to go on holiday as well.' 'Natalie has been through so much in her short life,' said Andy. Natalie is pictured here on the left with her sister Vanessa two years ago, before her lung condition worsened . 'Her mother, Tracy, died of lung cancer at just 39, when Natalie was pregnant with our eldest son, Callum, so she never got to meet him. 'Then in 2006, Bradley was born and at four months old he was rushed to hospital with a collapsed lung. Bradley spent seven months in hospital and was later diagnosed with the same disease as Natalie. 'We now have the worry that he too will end up like his mum, although he is a normal healthy boy at the moment. 'The wedding helped us to forget all the heartbreak for just a minute. 'There are many people to thank and we will get round to doing just that.'","Natalie Price, 30, was told lung disease was terminal on March 6 .

"To you, it might just look like a white hat. But to Academy Award winner Russell Crowe, it's much, much more than that.

Crowe spotted the 'jaunty, white' hat being kicked along the ground 'just before dawn' from a vantage point at his accommodation in Madrid on Saturday. The violence of the act spurred on a series of ponderous, even existential, thoughts. Partial to a good piece of headwear, the Academy Award winner Russell Crowe is pictured here in a scene from Les Miserables .

"A teenager has claimed her high school banned her from carrying out an on-campus 'prom-posal' to her girlfriend because they are lesbians. Casey Akers, 16, from Keller, Texas said she often sees students ask others to be their dates to prom while at school yet when she was going to ask a female friend, they told her it was 'not appropriate'. Speaking to NBC, the teenager said she believes it is because both she and her friend are gay. Scroll down for video . Denied: Casey Akers, pictured, said her school gave its permission for her to carry out a 'prom-posal' on campus - until they found out she was asking a girl. The school has denied the claim . 'I gave them all the details before. They say it's fine. They find out who I am asking, then say it's not fine,' Casey told the channel. Her mother, who helped Casey prepare for her promposal, said she does not know why the school is stopping her from asking someone they know is her friend. After being told she could not 'prompose', Casey sent a private message to a friend on Twitter about what had happened and, with Casey's permission, the friend shared it publicly. 'I asked the administrators if I could do a promposal, not mentioning it was for a girl,' Casey wrote in the now-widely-circulated message. 'I had a box with flowers on it, cookies and a poster that said ""Out of all these cookies, you're my favorite one. Prom?"" The girls name is Cookie and that's where the idea came from.' Plan: Her mom helped her decorate this box with paper flowers so she could jump out and surprise her date . Date: 16-year-old Casey, left, poses with a girl, right, she identifies as her girlfriend online. She said that despite the school's ban on her promposal, she will be taking her girlfriend to the prom anyway . But  as she walked to lunch, staff members approached her and told her it was 'not appropriate' to ask her friend, adding: 'You know why.' Within hours of the friend sharing the message, the hashtag #LetCaseyPromposal started trending on Twitter and hundreds of youngsters began messaging the teenager to show their support. 'Regulating who your students ask to prom is disgusting #LetCaseyPromposal,' one wrote. Casey said she still intends to go to the prom with her friend. The school district released a statement saying they did not allow any student - regardless of their sexual orientation - to carry out promposals on campus. Scene: She attends Timber Creek High School, pictured, but the school district said it does not allow anyone to carry out 'promposals' - regardless of gender or sexual orientation - on campus . 'Any previous promposals that have occurred have done so without District approval,' their statement said. 'Promposals, and other similar public displays, may create a disruption to the academic setting, therefore they are not allowed for any student.' Casey and her friends noted they had often seen promposals carried out on campus.

"A leading liberal clergyman has come under fire from traditionalist Anglicans after allowing a full Muslim prayer service in his church. Reverend Giles Goddard, vicar of St John’s in Waterloo, central London, joined in the event by reading a passage from the Bible at the ‘Inclusive Mosque’ event. He then asked the congregation to praise ‘the god that we love, Allah’, it was reported last night. Reverend Giles Goddard, vicar of St John’s in London, held an 'inclusive mosque' event during which a full Muslim service was hosted inside his church (pictured, painting a cross on the church for Ash Wednesday) It is thought to be the first time an entire Islamic service has been held by the Church of England and has sparked criticism from evangelical clerics. Orthodox clergyman said the event was against canon law, which prohibits any divergence from the official liturgy. They argued that it could be ‘offensive’ to Christians who are persecuted for their faith. Rev Goddard defended his decision to hold the event, describing it as a ‘very moving’ service. He said his intention was simply to offer people a ‘place to pray’. He told the Christian Today website that everything his church did was legal and within bishops’ guidelines. Mr Goddard said he was simply offering the Muslims a place to pray, adding that the religions share 'the same God' (pictured, St John's) He added: ‘It is very much about St John’s being a place of welcome. We understand God as a generous God, a God who celebrates love and celebrates life. ‘We try and make sure we live that out. In that sense we feel very properly Anglican.’ The ‘Inclusive Jummah’ was held in partnership with the Inclusive Mosque Initiative. It was organised to coincide with the run-up to International Women’s Day last weekend. The service was arranged by Dr Amina Wadud, a campaigner for gender justice in Islam. Rev Goddard said the service had not put off Christian churchgoers and his congregation is growing. He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We are offering a place for people to pray so it made absolutely perfect sense. We should be offering [a place] to party, we are the Church of England. ‘They could have gone to a community centre, I suppose, but they loved being in a church, they were just really pleased and delighted to have the welcome and it was very moving, really. It is the same God, we share the same tradition.’ At the end of the service, the vicar read a section of Psalm 139 and said: ‘This is from the Hebrew scripture – we all share these great traditions, so let us celebrate our shared traditions, by giving thanks to the God that we love, Allah.’ Rev Stephen Kuhrt, vicar of Christ Church, New Malden, said: ‘I am appalled by islamophobia and when people whip up anti-Muslim frenzy, but the vicar of St John’s Waterloo has done something that is completely illegal, which is to allow an Islamic service to be held in his church, and then he has participated as well.’ Critics say Rev Goddard has overstepped his bounds by introducing other faiths. Rev Robin Weekes, the minister of Wimbledon’s Emmanuel Church, said: ‘The issue is not primarily that canon law has been broken, which it has, but that it is offensive to Christians who believe that there is only one God.’","Giles Goddard, vicar of St John's, Waterloo, held 'inclusive mosque' event .

"'Busy': Richard Baker made a 'Max Speed 20mph' sign after police claimed they ‘did not have the resources’ to monitor motorists outside his home . Police told a pensioner that they were too busy to deal with speeders using his road – but turned up within 30 minutes after he put up a DIY warning sign. Officers in Newbury, Berkshire, claimed they ‘did not have the resources’ to monitor motorists outside pensioner Richard Baker’s terraced home. So he made a ‘Max Speed 20mph’ sign and stuck it on the roadside –only to find an officer on his doorstep demanding that he remove the notice half an hour later. Mr Baker, 71, said he and his partner Rosemary Cribb fear someone will be knocked down and killed by the ‘mad’ drivers. ‘No one will do anything about the speeding, but put up an illegal sign and all of a sudden you get the police banging on your door,’ he said. ‘All I want to do is stop people speeding before there’s a tragedy – somebody’s got to do something about it. 'West Berkshire Council says it’s not their fault, and Thames Valley Police told me they haven’t got the time or resources. ‘But they can very soon find the time to send someone round to knock on my front door. ‘I put up the sign and inside 30 minutes an officer was round here telling me to take it down. ‘I’m just so frustrated – has it got to take someone’s death for them to do anything about the speeding traffic?’ 'West Berkshire Council says it’s not their fault, and Thames Valley Police told me they haven’t got the time or resources,' Mr Baker said . Mr Baker’s road was made a 20mph zone in 2010 after repeated requests from worried residents and local councillors. But Mr Baker said signs warning motorists that it is a 20mph limit are not clearly displayed and pointed out that even some of his neighbours are not aware of the speed restrictions. He said: ‘This morning a woman complained to my daughter that it isn’t 20 along this road, it’s 30mph. She came back and said she was totally unaware it was 20mph.’ A police spokesman said they would investigate Mr Baker’s complaints.","Police said they were too busy to monitor drivers in Richard Baker's road .

"A woman has gone on trial for allegedly shooting up a McDonald's after bacon was left off her burger twice in 24 hours. Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, is accused of firing a 9mm handgun through the restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan in the early hours of February 9, 2014. No one was hurt in the incident. She is on trial after refusing a plea deal and now faces up to seven behind bars if convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, shooting at a building and use of a firearm. In court on Tuesday, her attorney John Beason said Torres did not mean to pull the trigger when she shot the drive-thru window after the server had gone out of view. In court: Shaneka Monique Torres, pictured in the courtroom during the first day of her trial on Tuesday, is accused of opening fire on a McDonald's in February 2014 after they got her order wrong . 'She says she pulled the trigger, but she did not pull it on purpose,' Beason said, according to Mlive. 'Stupid? Yes. Mistake? Yes. Accident? Yes. Intentional? No.' Torres had gone to McDonald's the previous day for a burger but was unhappy to find it did not have bacon on it, as she had requested, police said. After speaking to the managers, they offered her a free bacon burger on her next visit, police said, and  after drinking at clubs with a friend that night, she took them up on their offer. Sitting in the passenger seat, she headed to the drive-thru at 2am - stopping to chat up a manager at one of the windows before giving him her number, which later helped police track her down. Scene: A news report from February 2014 shows the window Torres allegedly shot after getting a burger with no bacon inside. Her attorney said she shot the gun but did so accidentally . But when she and her friend received their order, she again had no bacon on her burger. On trial: Torres, pictured in her mug shot, miraculously did not injure anyone . Torres pulled out a handgun and fired once, sending the bullet through the window and out the other side of the restaurant, police said. Beason told the jury on Tuesday that the gun, which had no safety, went off accidentally. Torres' friend, Nydia Ray, who was driving the car, told the court her friend had not been upset by the lack of bacon on her burger. She said she saw the gun after handing the order back and was in the middle of saying 'What the f*** is going on?' when it fired. The server, Essence Lake, had walked away from the window when she heard the shot and saw the hole in the glass, she said, adding the bullet would have struck her if she'd still been by the window. 'We went back and forth screaming and yelling and then we pulled off,' Ray said. The women went to Ray's home but not before a witness wrote down the plate number. Police tracked the women down 30 minutes later. Grand Rapids Police Officer Patrick Loeb said Ray told him that her friend had been upset over the order. She told him Torres said something along the lines of 'do you know who you're talking to?' before she fired - which Ray has since denied. The trial will resume on Wednesday. Caught: Torres was found soon after speeding away from the Grand Rapids McDonald's (pictured) because she'd given her number to the restaurant's manager as she flirted with him before the shooting .","Shaneka Monique Torres went on trial after rejecting plea deal and could get as long as seven years behind bars if convicted .

"First Lady Michelle Obama spent the final hours of her visit to Japan 'banging the drum' on her mission to promote education among girls world-wide. Mrs Obama stopped off at 1,000-year-old Buddhist and Shinto houses of worship in Kyoto - which in the past served as Japan's capital. Mrs Obama toured the Kiyomizu-dera temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site built in 780 on a tree-lined hill overlooking the city, and also visited the Fushimi Inari shrine, one of the most well-known Shinto shrines. At the Buddhist temple, the first lady watched local college students enacting a Noh performance, a classical style of Japanese musical drama using ornate costumes and masks to play the roles of women, ghosts and various other characters. Scroll down for video . Michelle Obama met with members of the Akutagawa High School Taiko Club during her visit to a Shinto shrine in Kyoto, western Japan . Mrs Obama told the youngsters 'you guys are good! That's good exercise. Wonderful' after having a go on the traditional Taiko drums . Mrs Obama did not accompany her husband on a trip to Japan last year so used this visit to promote girls' education projects . Local college students in kimono performed a brief piece of Noh, a classical Japanese musical drama that usually employs elaborate costumes and stylized masks to symbolize roles of women, ghosts and other characters. After Kiyomizu-dera, a UNESCO World Heritage site, Mrs Obama traveled across town to the 1,300-year-old Fushimi Inari shrine, a place of worship for Japan's other major religion, Shinto. There are 30,000 such shrines in Japan that venerate the guardian god of abundant harvests, prosperity and family safety. The Fushimi Inari is renowned for the many crimson torii gates lining paths through its leafy grounds. Commenting on the performance, Mrs Obama said: 'You guys are good! That's good exercise. Wonderful.' Mrs Obama arrived in Japan on Wednesday for a visit that has focused mainly on cooperation in the 'Let Girls Learn' initiative to support girls' education in the developing world. President Barack Obama and his wife recently announced the program, which will devote millions of dollars in aid for girls' empowerment projects. Writing on her blog, Mrs Obama said: 'Does this kind of work sound exciting to you? If so, you should consider joining the Peace Corps . 'You can also make a difference by tutoring a classmate, or reading to a younger sibling, or volunteering through your school or place of worship.'

"South Korean businesses are using young, attractive female teachers to entice people into learning English online. The country's citizens spent more than £3.5billion pounds on private education to learn the language in 2013 alone. But with 17,000 private academies across the country, one company is using the power of sex appeal to stand out in the ultra-competitive market. Scroll down for video . Enticing: Seoul-based education company 'Goddess of Education' advertises its online courses with young, good-looking female teachers . Interactive: The company specialises in video-taught lessons with the attractive and 'immaculately groomed' tutors . Inviting: The women who have their own profile pages on the website go by nicknames like 'business Cinderella' and 'English pronunciation goddess' Standing out: The beautiful tutors are the company's way of differentiating itself from the competition in a super-competitive English-teaching market in South Korea . 'Goddess of English' is a Seoul-based education website that specialises in video lessons taught exclusively by women who are young, attractive and immaculately groomed. The site features individual profiles of all of its teachers who have nicknames such as 'business Cinderella' and 'English pronunciation goddess'. And to apply for a job with the company, would-be teachers need to provide at least three profile pictures. The companies Chief Executive says there is 'no doubt that people will want to see lessons more if the teacher is pretty and attractive'. Yang Jae-hoon told MailOnline: 'It's just a case of preparing our teachers so their appearance comes out well on screen, to innocently increase motivation for education.' He says many of the site's 5,000 paying members are men in their 20s studying for state exam and older men who need English for business, but an increasing number of women are signing up too. But the website has caused some controversy in the image-dominated society where cosmetic surgery is common and job-seekers attach their picture to applications. Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest newspaper, reported on growing concern that even education is suffering from the country's pervasive 'lookism'. Big money: South Korean citizens spent more than £3.5billion pounds on private education to learn the language in 2013 alone . Marketing ploy: The company's Chief Executive says there is 'no doubt that people will want to see lessons more if the teacher is pretty and attractive' 'Motivation': Yang Jae-hoon told MailOnline: 'It's just a case of preparing our teachers so their appearance comes out well on screen to innocently increase motivation for education' Criticism: But a former 'Goddess of English' teacher - who wishes to stay anonymous - says the curriculum it teaches is poor . Another educational website called 'Red English' which featured teachers donning much racier attire launched last year but closed down within a few months. A former 'Goddess of English' teacher - who wishes to stay anonymous - says the curriculum it teaches is poor. She added: 'I think that in a society without laws prohibiting discrimination in hiring practices, it's not surprising that a business would try this kind of thing to attract customers.' Even normal English academies called 'hagwon' in South Korea are often accused of discriminating in employment on the basis of appearance, gender and race. 'If you look at posters advertising English courses at any hagwon, you can see the most attractive teachers everywhere promoting their courses,' the former teacher said. But Yang insisted he prioritises his recruits' teaching abilities and never hires them solely for their appearance. He said: 'Above all, we judge a teacher the most on her mind and character. Today's star teachers see that it is important to be able to empathize with students. Second is the teacher's English and teaching ability.'","Seoul-based education firm is using attractive female teachers to stand out .

"There are moments when a parent feels particularly proud of their child, and there are moments when a child looks up to a parent with the utmost respect. In the case of Scott Byrne and his daughter Jen, they experienced both on Wednesday when they flew their first flight together as co-pilots for American Airlines. The father-daughter team got the opportunity to work as First Officer and Captain on a flight from Chicago to Dallas-Forth Worth, and then on to John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California. Father and daughter Scott and Jen Byrne flew their first flight on Wednesday as First Officer and Co-Pilot for American Airlines on a flight from Chicago to Dallas, and on to Orange County . Professionalism ruled the day, and they were so busy with the pre-flight checks, and then take-off itself that Scott, who joined American Airlines in 1990, said he almost forgot who was sitting next to him. 'Jenny was such a natural. She did an absolutely fantastic job. And it's my 28-year-old daughter. I am so proud,' he told ABC. The day had even more significance. 'It also marked the one-year anniversary since I've joined American,' said Jen, originally from Algonquin, Illinois. Based in Chicago, she is trained to fly Boeing 757s and 767s and is also a U.S. Air Force Reservist with the 89th Airlift Squadron out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. She has also worked for SkyWest Airlines and as a DC-8 Flight Operations intern with UPS. As well as working for American Airlines, Jen  is also a U.S. Air Force Reservist with the 89th Airlift Squadron out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio . On the day, Jen hoped for an extra smooth landing to impress the man she refers to as her 'hero'. 'I was just praying it would be a good landing,' she said. With safety always a priority, the landing was indeed a good one. 'I looked over at him and he was smiling and it was the best feeling in the world,' said Jen, who has wanted to be a pilot since she was eight years old. With the two of them working side by side, there was one person who wasn't going to be left out of this special family occasion. Mom came along for the ride too - though only as a passenger. Both Scott and Jen credit her for getting Jen where she is today. She helped her achieve her dreams by keeping her dedicated when things got tough. 'Every credit goes to my wife,' said Scott.

"Highly regarded Australian architect Peter Stuchbury has continued to soar after receiving the Australia Institute of Architects highest honour, the highly coveted Gold Medal for Architecture. He earned the prestigious award for his considerable contribution to the advancement of architecture though practice, teaching and participation. While you may imagine the award winning 60-year-old's own home to be a lavish contemporary monument, you'll be surprised to know that in reality Mr Stuchbury didn't opt for an opulent structure but instead a simple and sustainable tent on Sydney's northern beaches. Scroll down for video . The master architect's northern beaches tent home is only a meagre 45-square-feet . The visionary took out the Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal for Architecture after presenting his tent home to the jury . His own home, which he presented to the NSW Architecture Awards jury, is a humble 45-square-metre tent house which he said is 'designed to challenge the conventions of our suburban lives.' 'The tent house provides a model for sustainability. It is a purposeful step towards a radical view of living in the suburbs,' Mr Stutchbury told jurors. 'It is a necessary step towards reduction if we as a community are to rediscover a sustainable lifestyle.' Unlike some lavish small homes that are heavily styled Mr Stutchbury instead chose simplicity preferring to decorate his home modestly. 'The tent house provides a model for sustainability. It is a purposeful step towards a radical view of living in the suburbs' His bedroom opens out onto a wooden deck and only houses a bed, a chest of drawers, a rack of clothing and a rocking chair. The home is saturated in a warm glow as the light entering the home is filtered through canvas walls. Mr Stutchbury has garnered a reputation for his environmentally sustainable residential structures which have been internationally recognised to have an intrinsic link to the site they are built on. Mr Stutchbury's Invisible House in Megalong Valley embraces its bush setting as he aims to design homes that relate to where they are . 'Stutchbury has mastered the art of creating architecture that speaks of the place it inhabits – buildings that are environmentally sustainable, culturally specific and locally embedded' 'In 34 years of practice, Stutchbury has mastered the art of creating architecture that speaks of the place it inhabits – buildings that are environmentally sustainable, culturally specific and locally embedded,' said the Gold Medal jury. His firm, Peter Stutchbury Architecture, has received 47 institution awards and have been entered into around 20 national and international design competitions. He is best known for his work on Bay and Springwater house which took out the country's top architectural honour, the Robin Boyd Award, in 2003 and 2005 respectively. Mr Stutchbury's Bay House in Sydney won the coveted  Robin Boyd Award in 2003 . Repeat offender: He also took out the Robin Boyd award again in 2005 for his Springwater House . As a founding director of the Architecture Foundation Australia Mr Stutchbury continues to pass on his message of creating a more sustainable built environment by teaching students of Glenn Murcutt International Architecture Master Class and those at the University of Newcastle. Professor Stutchbury said winning a prestigious award like this has been very 'humbling' and 'a deep honour' adding that he found himself 'speechless' after realising he had joined the ranks of architecture greats who had also won the accolade.

"New Zealand's former cricket captain Martin Crowe, who is terminally ill with lymphoma, has penned a moving tribute to his countrymen ahead of Sunday's World Cup final against Australia. In a heart-wrenching column published on Cricinfo, the 52-year-old said Sunday's match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground might be the last he ever sees. 'My precarious life ahead may not afford me the luxury of many more games to watch and enjoy,' Crowe wrote. Terminally ill New Zealand's former cricket captain Martin Crowe had admitted in his latest column that the World Cup final could be the last he ever sees . Crowe, pictured in 1988 (left) and 1994 (right) played 77 tests and 143 One-Day Internationals for New Zealand . 'So this is likely to be it. The last, maybe, and I can happily live with that.' Crowe, who played 77 tests and 143 One-Day Internationals for New Zealand, was regarded as one of the world's best batsmen during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma two years ago but it went into remission. Late last year, however, a new, more aggressive form of the disease, double-hit lymphoma, developed and he said he had been told only five percent of sufferers survive more than 12 months. He was regarded as one of the world's best batsmen during the late 1980s and early 1990s (pictured bottom left) He said he could 'happily live' with watching Australia and New Zealand play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for his last game. His column sung praise for both Michael Clarke (left) and Brendon McCullum (right) Crowe said he had decided against chemotherapy and was instead trying natural treatments. He was inducted into the international cricket Hall of Fame last month and is making the trip from New Zealand to watch the final live, cheering on the players he regards as the 'sons I never had'. 'I will hold back tears all day long. I will gasp for air on occasions. I will feel like a nervous parent,' he wrote. 'Whatever happens, March 29 at the MCG will be the most divine fun ever.' Current Black Caps skipper Brendon McCullum told a news conference on Saturday he had read Crowe's column and he paid tribute to his ailing predecessor.

"Former BBC boss Greg Dyke has branded Jeremy Clarkson a 'disaster waiting to happen' amid claims the presenter punched a Top Gear producer. The FA Chairman said the BBC has been placed in an impossible position and 'can't win either way' whatever the outcome of the Top Gear Inquiry. Clarkson, who is currently suspended after allegedly hitting Oisin Tymon in a row over hot food, has reportedly promised to sue the BBC if he is sacked from the popular show. Speaking to ITV News today, Mr Dyke said: 'First of all I'd say that I don't think Jeremy Clarkson is the first presenter I've met who would have liked to have thumped his producer. Scroll down for video . Former BBC boss Greg Dyke (right) has branded Jeremy Clarkson (left) a 'disaster waiting to happen' amid claims the presenter punched a Top Gear producer . 'But in truth he is a disaster waiting to happen really for the BBC. It's hard to…I'm glad I'm not the executive who has to take that decision because if you were, you can't win either way now.' The former BBC Director General added: 'Even if you decide to keep Jeremy…what happens next?' Clarkson allegedly believes that the BBC have launched a 'smear campaign' against him which he 'won't let go'. Sources close to the 54-year-old have said he is likely to take action against the Corporation for wrongful dismissal, if he is not reinstated to the programme. It comes amid reports that the BBC are filming a pilot of a new motoring show called The Getaway Car, which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges. Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas', prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air. The four Top Gear roadshows scheduled for Norway next weekend have been postponed. Tickets for the postponed shows cost between £42 and £100, meaning the decision could cost the BBC more than £1million in lost revenue if Clarkson is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled. Sacking Clarkson could mean the end of Top Gear, which makes the BBC millions every year . Speculation about his future has been mounting and will be decided this week when the corporation's internal investigation into his behaviour is handed over to the director-general. The BBC’s internal inquiry into Clarkson’s fracas with Mr Oisin is expected to made public as soon as Tuesday. It is being led by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland who oversaw the investigation into the disastrous Newsnight edition that falsely accused the late Conservative peer Lord McAlpine of being involved in the north Wales child abuse scandal. The presenter launched an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala last week. Speaking at an event in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, Clarkson said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'. He said: 'I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me. 'I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.' But the under-fire presenter claimed that the 'sweary' incident had all been in good humour. Writing in his column in the Sunday Times, he said: 'I woke up after a night at a charity do to be told by my lawyer that someone had uploaded a video of me using choice language to describe bosses at the BBC. 'But it was all meant in jest and anyway it worked. By being brief, controversial and a bit sweary I woke the room up and the auction prize I was offering - one last lap of the Top Gear test track - raised £100,000.' Clarkson, pictured with co ho-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at a Top Gear Live show in Prague, will not be performing at the four events in Norway as they have been cancelled . Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas' with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (right), prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air . The Top Gear frontman revealed that he has been 'put on silence' which is why he has been refusing to comment on the allegations. He said: 'I've been put on silence. There are very good reasons from my point of view why I simply can't say a word.' Insiders suggested Clarkson and Mr Tymon had given ‘quite different’ versions of events. Sources close to Mr Tymon say he was punched and left with a split lip, while Clarkson has admitted some ‘handbags and pushing’ but is understood to have denied anything worse. The BBC was given a reminder of the strength of support behind Clarkson when a million-strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank. The vehicle, apparently driven by the motoring show's enigmatic professional driver The Stig, made its way from Westminster, through central London and towards New Broadcasting House near Oxford Street. Fans were pictured rallying to support the delivery of the Change.org petition, started by political website Guido Fawkes. There is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear – worth £50million a year to BBC coffers – off the air while the investigation was under way . The petition, launched last week, reads: 'We the undersigned petition the BBC to reinstate Jeremy Clarkson. Freedom to fracas. #BringBackClarkson'.' It emerged yesterday that a report into Clarkson's behaviour was commissioned by BBC head of TV Danny Cohen after a series of other scandals last year. Top Gear caused an international incident after driving through Argentina with a number plate allegedly linked to the Falklands War and used the word 'slope' describe an Asian man. A report into the cases apparently concluded that Top Gear should have a new producer role to act as a go-between the show's team and the BBC's management to help deal with any future crisis. The BBC today refused to comment on the report or its conclusions. There is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear – worth £50million a year to BBC coffers – off the air while the investigation was under way. ‘The programme could and should have carried on during Clarkson’s suspension,’ said an insider. ‘Jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings. ‘He has a great deal of public support... But he does need to rest and sort himself out.’ David Cameron's 11-year-old daughter Nancy has gone on hunger strike in protest at the presenter's suspension from Top Gear. She has threatened not to eat until the  presenter was restored to the BBC One show. Mr Cameron said: 'Nancy has threatened to go on hunger strike unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored. 'We told her that this is not necessarily a useful intervention - he’s not exactly Gandhi.'","Greg Dyke said Jeremy Clarkson was a 'disaster waiting to happen'

"Katie Hopkins has sparked an online backlash for calling Angelina Jolie 'smug' after she revealed she underwent preventative surgery for cancer. The controversial columnist posted a message on Twitter when the Hollywood star, who is married to Brad Pitt, revealed she had surgery to remove her ovaries and Fallopian tubes due to a second health scare. As thousands of people took to Twitter in support of the 39-year-old mother-of-six, Ms Hopkins wrote on the social media site: 'Angelina Jolie. Smug doesn't even come close. Curating her organs to maximise life expectancy. What's next fag ash lil? Your lungs?' According to Katie Hopkins (left), Angelina Jolie's (right) was 'smug' after announcing her cancer surgery . Katie Hopkins insensitive tweet that has caused a social media backlash . She then posted a picture of the A-lister holding a cigarette and tweeted: ‘This is my point. 'Fill your boots with preaching, but don’t then fill your lungs with tar.’ However, Twitter users were quick to respond, with many posting abusive messages to Celebrity Big Brother star Ms Hopkins. Julian Nicholas wrote: 'Smug? Potentially increasing her life expectancy to be able to watch her children grow up and grow old with her husband?' Joshua Cox tweeted: 'If you listen to the actually story, it's to prevent cancer, I'm sure you'd do it on your battered old daffodil.' Avril Walkinshaw said: 'That's bad Katie, even for you,' And follower Nige wrote: 'Wow, sometimes you can go just that little bit to far!' Katie Hopkins implied that Angelina was hypocritical for smoking while wanting to prevent ovarian cancer . Ms Hopkin's bizarre tweets come just days after the controversial columnist  said fat children should be forced to attend special sports schools until they shed excess weight. Writing in her column for Now! magazine, she said: 'The most upsetting thing of all is a fat child. 'Watching fat parents drop their fat kids off at school in their cars makes me so angry my teeth itch and my nipples twizzle.' In her video blog for the magazine, the mother-of three said she blames the parents for children with weight problems: 'I've always said that a fat child lives in the shadow of a fat parent. 'The fat kids go through the school gates and there's the fat mum in the car, who doesn't bother to get out, still wearing her pyjamas...and that really does my head in.' Earlier this month, Ms Hopkins caused a Twitter storm when she tweeted controversial comments after she watching Kelly Clarkson on The Graham Norton Show. She tweeted: 'Jesus, what happened to Kelly Clarkson? Did she eat all of her backing singers?' Then added: 'Happily I have wide-screen. #grahamnorton'. When social media users tried to defend the singer, Katie followed up with: 'Look chubsters, Kelly Clarkson had a baby a year ago. That is no longer baby weight. That is carrot cake weight. Get over yourselves.' She also compared E! red carpet presenter Kelly Osborne to a troll and criticized Lily Allen live on radio for not losing her baby weight fast enough. 'After she had her baby she did what most mums do, and she kind of went around being lazy and she said, ""Oh it's baby weight,""' Katie said. 'I don't agree with that. It's not baby weight, because the baby's already out. It's just weight.' Earlier this week, This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield spoke about the star's offensive social media presence in an interview in Heat magazine. 'She does occasionally go way too far and I read things she’s said and think, ""That’s so offensive, that will actually hurt people"",' he said. But the presenter did also say he was fond of the star: 'Although she’s the epitome of a pantomime villain, she’s lovely and very likeable off air.' Angelina with Brad and her children (left to right) Pax, Zahara, Knox, Shiloh and Maddox. The star said: 'I know my children will never have to say, ""Mom died of ovarian cancer""' Angelina's surgery, which Ms Hopkins criticised, comes two years after her double mastectomy and on Monday the  Maleficent star published a piece in Time magazine explaining her decision. In the article titled, Angelina Jolie Pitt: Diary Of A Surgery in the New York Times, she revealed she had already been planning to undergo the surgery to remove her ovaries and Fallopian tubes, but a call from her doctor two weeks ago made the procedure more urgent. The star wrote: 'I went through what I imagine thousands of other women have felt. 'I told myself to stay calm, to be strong, and that I had no reason to think I wouldn't live to see my children grow up and to meet my grandchildren. 'I know my children will never have to say, ""Mom died of ovarian cancer"". Angelina's decision was praised by cancer charities who say the star has raised awareness about early detection and prevention.

"Gareth Lee (pictured leaving court today) said he was left 'shocked' and in 'disbelief' when the bakery refused his order . A Christian baker who refused to make a cake bearing a pro-gay marriage slogan has begun a court battle over equality laws. Belfast-based Ashers Bakery refused to make a cake featuring an image of Sesame Street puppets Bert and Ernie below the motto 'Support Gay Marriage'. Northern Ireland's Equality Commission is now supporting a legal action against the family-run bakery on behalf of gay rights activist Gareth Lee, whose order was declined. Mr Lee told a court today he was left 'shocked' and in 'disbelief' when one of the owners of the bakery, Karen McArthur, rang him and told him she would not be processing the order he had already paid for. 'It made me feel I'm not worthy, a lesser person and to me that was wrong,' he said. Opening the case, Robin Allen QC, representing Mr Lee, said the baker's objection on religious grounds was not lawful. He said baking a cake did not mean the bakers supported any message the cake might carry and compared the baking of a cake to a postman delivering a letter or a printer printing a poster. 'A postman taking a letter to the door or a printer carrying out a printing job - nobody would say that involved promoting or support,' he said. 'It's simply a functional relationship, a working relationship.' The lawyer also noted the publicity around the case and highlighted that politicians, church figures, bloggers and others had expressed opinions on the matter. But the barrister insisted the case must be judged on the facts alone, saying: 'Law must not be determined by those who shout loudest.' Mr Allen QC said he was not in court to challenge the McArthur family's faith and highlighted that the proposed design would not have had an Ashers logo on it. The case is being heard at Belfast County Court by district judge Isobel Brownlie. The Commission, which monitors compliance with equality laws in the region, has alleged that the stance of the company was in breach of legislation. The case has sharply divided public opinion in Northern Ireland and beyond. In the wake of the bakery's refusal to provide the service last May, the commission, a state-funded watchdog body, took on the case on behalf of Mr Lee. Initially, the commission asked the bakery to acknowledge that it had breached legislation and offer 'modest' damages to the customer. Claims of discrimination were made after a Christian-run bakery in Northern Ireland refused to make a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan on it on religious grounds. Pictured, left: The design. Pictured, right: Belfast Councillor Andrew Muir cutting the cake which was eventually made by another bakery . Ashers bakery general manager Daniel McArthur, supported by his wife Amy (right), has said he is fighting the case to allow Christian business owners to follow their beliefs in how they run their firms . When Ashers, which is owned by the McArthur family, refused, the commission proceeded with the legal action. Outlining his view of the facts, Mr Allen said Mr Lee had used the bakery in Royal Avenue in Belfast city centre 'regularly' before the incident. He said his client had seen a leaflet in the shop advertising a service whereby images could be printed in edible icing on a cake. He said there was nothing on the leaflet which suggested a limitation on the service due to 'religious scruples'. The barrister told the court that the order was accepted by Ashers director Karen McArthur and Mr Lee paid for it in full. 'A contract was therefore concluded,' he said. Mr Allen said that, over the next few days, Mrs McArthur expressed concern about the requested cake design with her daughter-in-law, Amy, and the matter was then discussed with her son, Daniel. After that Mr Lee was informed that his order would not be processed due to the family's religious views, said the lawyer. A court was told  that for the bakery to refuse to make the cake was like a postman refusing to deliver letters . Mr Allen said if companies were allowed to break contracts with individuals then 'the law is worth nothing'. He added: 'The rule of law says there shall be no discrimination in the commercial sphere.' The barrister insisted that Ashers was not an 'explicitly religious' business and referred to an interview Daniel McArthur gave to a newspaper in which he claimed the majority of his 60-plus workforce were unaware of his family's faith. Mr Allen stressed the importance of anti-discrimination legislation in Northern Ireland, given its history of sectarian strife. Daniel and Amy McArthur sat on one side of an almost packed courtroom, with Mr Lee watching from the other side. The Ashers case has prompted the Democratic Unionist Party to propose a law change at Stormont that would provide an 'equality clause' which would essentially enable businesses to refuse to provide certain services on religious grounds. Mr McArthur has previously said: Mr McArthur has previously insisting that Christians should be able to apply their beliefs to the day-to-day running of their businesses. He said: 'I would like the outcome of this to be that any Christians running a business could be allowed to follow their Christian beliefs and principles in the day-to-day running of the business and that they are allowed to make decisions based on that.' The hearing continues. Mr McArthur, with his wife Amy and daughter Robyn, sat in court today to hear the legal argument .","Bakery owned by Christian family refused to make gay marriage cake .

"A woman who lost her unborn baby girl after the fetus was cut from her womb in a brutal attack by a  stranger has been released from hospital, her family said on Wednesday. Michelle Wilkins, 26, was seven-months pregnant when she responded to a Craigslist ad for maternity clothes in Longmont, Colorado last week. She was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out allegedly by 34-year-old Dynel Lane. Miss Wilkins had been treated at Longmont United Hospital. In a statement, her family said: 'Today marks a week since the brutal attack that nearly cost Michelle her life and ended that of her soon to be born baby Aurora. 'She is now out of the hospital in a safe location and accompanied by her partner Dan, is taking the first tentative steps along a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation. Scroll down for video . Michelle Wilkins, 26, was seven months pregnant when she was stabbed and had her baby removed by a female attacker in Longmont, Colorado. She was released from hospital on Wednesday . A GoFundMe account has been set up for the 26-year-old and raised close to $47,000 from well-wishers. Her family expressed their gratitude on Wednesday . 'She is surrounded by friends and family and wishes to express her deep gratitude for all the expressions of love, kindness, and spiritual solidarity she has received from both the Longmont community and from around the world. 'Michelle believes her recovery is directly aided by the prayers and positive energy she is receiving. The statement continued: 'We cannot predict what lies ahead for Michelle. We have no guidebook on how to navigate this crisis, or a checklist on what to do next. We wish there were. 'What we can say is that we have all been deeply moved by the many people who have reached out to Michelle and her partner to share their own personal stories of tragedies they’ve endured and how they managed to first just survive and then eventually start to heal. That alone has given us the strength to get up and face each day. The 26-year-old was surrounded by family who confirmed she had now left hospital. They said she was drawing comfort from her beloved dog, Jade, who had not left her side . 'You’ve touched our hearts and souls and we thank you so much.' A GoFundMe page has raised close to $47,000 for the 26-year-old. The family wrote on the fundraising page that Miss Wilkins was also being comforted by her 'beloved dog Jade'. The 26-year-old had moved to Colorado and just started a job teaching pottery classes. On March 18, she answered a Craigslist ad for baby clothes in a suburban neighborhood of Longmont, about 30 miles from Denver. She was glassed in the neck and then attacked with a small knife in the basement, allegedly by Dynel Lane. The suspect then fled with the baby, who was found by Lane's husband, taking her last breath's in the bathtub. Lane reportedly told her husband that she had suffered a miscarriage and he took her to hospital with the baby. The accused attacker told hospital staff she had suffered a miscarriage but later admitted her atrocious deed. Around 2.30pm, Miss Wilkins managed to make a 911 call as she lay bleeding out on the basement floor. During the desperate six-minute call, she faintly told the dispatcher: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.' The police officers who found her, Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski, described finding Wilkins weak and in a state of shock. 'I started yelling and Michelle yelled back, very faintly, and it was muffled — ""Help me! Help me!""' Sawyer told KTLA this weekend. He described finding her covered from head to toe in blood. 'So I put some gloves on and held her hand and went through where her injuries were … trying to figure out exactly what we had,' he said. Piotrowski believed that Miss Wilkins was the one who 'saved her own life.' 'She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,' he said. The situation was so bad that he had to leave the room for a moment to compose himself. The 26-year-old was released from Longmont United Hospital on Wednesday. 'She is taking the first tentative steps along a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation,' her family said . Last Friday, a member of hospital staff told Daily Mail Online how Wilkins did not realize she had lost her baby and still believed she was carrying her child. Abby Johnson, 18, an intern at the hospital, said the horrified woman, who had blood pouring from her stomach, pleaded for help and was concerned about the safety of the baby which had been due this spring. Miss Johnson, speaking through her friend Gary Brennan, said Miss Wilkins was in 'a terrible state with her guts hanging out. She had been bleeding really badly'. The victim's cousin told ABC11 that the baby was Miss Wilkin's first child and would have been her parents' first grandchild. Suspect, Dynel Lane, 34, was arrested presenting the abducted child as her own in hospital, and was facing charges of first-degree attempted murder, assault and child abuse. She been remanded in Boulder County Jail on $2 million bail. Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, (pictured with her husband, David Ridley) was facing murder charges in Colorado after she allegedly cut a baby from the womb of a seven months' pregnant woman who she lured to her home with a Craigslist ad for baby clothes . Police were  investigating whether Lane knocked Wilkins her unconscious and then removed the fetus by cutting open her abdomen. Wilkins arrived at the home shortly before midday to buy baby clothes which had been advertised. She was also stabbed in the neck with a broken glass before being cut open. Lane, who has two daughters, was held on $2million bail during a hearing at Boulder County Jail, Colorado (pictured in booking photo) In Longmont this week, protesters took to the streets of the city, which has a population of 90,000, to pressure police into charging the suspect with murder. The demonstrator's held placards with messages such as 'Murder is murder' and 'Justice for Michelle'. Among then were several pregnant women who got together to join the demonstration through social media. Katelyn Dunn, 26, said: 'We feel so sorry for Michelle. She had carried her child for seven months and must have been so excited about the future as a mother. 'It is a very special thing to have a child and this is such an appalling thing to happen. We feel so much for her and want the attacker to be accused of murder and nothing less.' Murder charges against Lane now depend on whether the child was alive outside of the 26-year-old expectant mother's womb, the district attorney's office said last week. Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L. Garnett said: 'The issue of whether or not murder charges are appropriate involving a case involving the death of a fetus or a late-term pregnancy is always a difficult issue. 'Under Colorado law, essentially, there's no way murder charges can be brought if it's not established that the fetus lived as a child outside the body of the mother for some period of time. 'I don't know the answer yet as to whether that can be established, what our facts are here.'","Michelle Wilkins, 26, was knifed when she responded to a Craigslist ad for maternity clothes in Longmont, Colorado last week .

"A female CEO has apologized to every mother she has ever encountered in the workplace for 'silently slandering' their commitment to their jobs. PowerToFly President Katharine Zaleski admitted, in a first-person piece for Fortune magazine, that she didn't realize how awful she had been - until she became a mother herself. The 34-year-old, who lives with her husband and daughter in Brooklyn, New York, recalled one instance where she made a silent presumption about a Time managing editor. Ms Zaleski presumed that she was 'too much of a mother' to follow through on a partnership idea - based on the pictures of the editor's children on her desk. Scroll down for video . PowerToFly President Katharine Zaleski (pictured with her husband and daughter) admitted, in a first-person piece that she had been horrible and didn't understand the position of working moms in the past - until she became one herself . PowerToFly President Katharine Zaleski admitted in an essay that she used to be a harsh critic of working moms during her time as an editor at Huffington Post and Washington Post . Ms Zaleski, a former editor at Huffington Post and The Washington Post in her twenties, wrote that she also judged women who couldn't make it to last-minute team drinks - even though they would arrive at work two hours earlier the next day. She also didn't speak up when another female editor said they should  fire a woman who was pregnant. Working 'late' became an obsession, she said, in order to show commitment to her job - even though mothers in the office would typically skew their days much earlier. Ms Zaleski wrote in Fortune: 'For mothers in the workplace, it’s death by a thousand cuts – and sometimes it’s other women holding the knives.' Soon after giving birth herself, Zaleski said that she believed her career was over and that she couldn't imagine going back to the office for ten hours each day. Soon afterwards she met Milena Berry who wanted to start a company that would allow women to work from home in a range of jobs. PowerToFly was born. And that Time editor whom she silently wrote off? Ms Zaleski explains that Cathy Sharick, mother-of-three, has now joined the business as executive editor. PowerToFly allows women to work from anywhere that suits them - from their home office to a coffee shop. Workers can take on full-time or part-time contracts, but as the company website states: 'We give you a lot of freedom and we expect a lot in return.' Ms Zaleski said in several interviews this week that all the tools for moms to work remotely are already in place. Conference calls can be made on Skype, presentations shared on Google Docs, team planning completed on Jira. Women from 65 countries have joined the site to improve their chance at finding work - and have so far taken home a collective $1 million in pay, according to Ms Zaleski. The challenges are many, the co-founder wrote - and sometimes from career-driven, younger women who she described as 'hardliners' about spending time in the office 'culture'. She wrote: 'They don’t realize how that ''culture'' pushes women out because it’s too often set up around how men bond. 'Many of these young women are just toeing the company line. I don’t begrudge them. I feel sorry for them. They’re hurting their future selves.

"A paramedic who abandoned patients in an ambulance while he went shopping and had a hair cut has been found guilty of misconduct at a health tribunal. Dominic Colella, who has resigned from the London Ambulance Service, twice 'held his colleagues to ransom' by forcing them to wait until his return before they could be driven to hospital. The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) sitting at a hearing in Kennington, south London, today ruled he was guilty of misconduct relating to two incidents in March 2013 and he was struck off the medical register. Dominic Colella, who was not present at the hearing, was found guilty of two counts of misconduct while working with the London Ambulance Service . In the first incident, an 85-year-old man who collapsed in the queue in a Marks and Spencer store from severe blood poisoning was forced to wait for 20 minutes in the back of an ambulance. Colella, who failed to turn up at the hearing, had returned to the store and came back with two full bags of shopping before driving him to hospital on March 9, 2013. The tribunal heard Colella's colleague, who was left to care for the elderly man alone, was questioned by the patient's 'anxious' wife about why her husband had not been taken to hospital. Yvonne Purves said: 'After a little bit of time I wondered where [Colella] had gone. 'The wife was understandably anxious about what had happened to her husband and was wondering why we weren't leaving to go to hospital. 'He then came back with two full bags of shopping and loaded them in to the front of the ambulance and flippantly said 'do you want to go to hospital then?'. 'Obviously, I wanted to go to hospital some time ago. I waited 20 minutes for Colella while alone in the ambulance.' The panel heard how Colella left a patient in an ambulance with a colleague for 20 minutes while he did some shopping in a Marks and Spencer (file picture) Just two weeks later, while responding to another potentially life-threatening 999 call, he delayed a 40-year-old patient with a head injury from being taken to hospital and left him in the care of a more junior practitioner so he could have his hair cut. Colella admitted abandoning his colleagues and patients, but the panel said his failure to turn up to the hearing meant they could not know if he appreciated the seriousness of his actions, meaning there was a 'risk of repetition'. Paramedic Donna Blair, who had arrived at the scene first, said she was handing over care of the patient to Colella's colleague when she noticed a nearby shopper looking 'gobsmacked'. She told the panel: 'I looked to my left and saw Dominic sitting at the hairdresser's chair with a lady putting a cape around his neck.' She told the hearing she had thought he was 'just having a joke' when he earlier asked her whether she fancied a haircut, and added that he could do with a trim himself. The panel heard that he delayed the ambulance leaving for hospital by between five and ten minutes. Chairman of the panel, Gillian Fleming, said members of the public would be 'shocked' to know a paramedic could show such disregard for his patients saying his 'fitness to practise was impaired'. Ms Fleming added that they do not know if Colella, who joined the London Ambulance Service in 1996, has since continued to work as a paramedic. Ms Fleming said today: 'Whilst it appears no harm was caused, the potential impact of the registrant's actions could have had serious consequences for the patients. 'The registrant's actions may indicate an attitudinal problem which he appears to have taken no real steps to address. 'There's no evidence to suggest his behaviour has changed.' Ms Fleming said Colella would be struck off the HCPC register with immediate effect, adding: 'The registrant has shown little in the way of insight or remorse. 'The panel considers that a striking off order is the only appropriate and proportionate order in this case.'","Dominic Colella twice 'held his colleagues to ransom' by making them wait .

Picture Editor of BBC Focus magazine, James Cutmore, who was a member of the judging panel said: 'The image of the horse's uterus with the foetus evokes many different emotions at once. It's fascinating, sad, macabre, almost brutal. 'Yet the subject is also delicate, detailed and beautiful. The image shows us a large and magnificent creature reduced to this sad, fragile and half-formed creation, which I find very humbling.' One of Mr Frank's favourite images is of the injected testis of a goat. 'This image grabs my attention because you can't tell what it is. It is when science becomes pure art,' he said .

"A 22-year-old college student whose disappearance had police scouring Southern California for weeks said she was overwhelmed with personal problems when she decided to walk away. Sahray Barber, whose March 9 disappearance triggered a huge land and air search across Southern California's Inland Empire, resurfaced on March 19. She had spent the ten days living in two Los Angeles-area hospitals under assumed names. Scroll down for video . Sahray Barber vanished on March 9 from her home in San Bernadino, California, and a search effort began . The 22-year-old college student reappeared on March 19 after spending about ten days in LA hospitals . After leaving the second hospital, she met a woman who treated her kindly and finally got her to open up and to reach out to her father, Barber said. Barber called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home. While she was gone, a huge search involving aircraft, dogs and horseback riders was being carried out by police. Barber released a statement to the Riverside Press-Enterprise Enterprise on Thursday trying to explain what happened to her. She said she had lost her job, her car had been wrecked and computer problems were causing her to fall behind in her studies at the Art Institute of California-Inland Empire. She wrote: 'Things got so bad that I didn't know what to say or who to ask for help, . 'I had dug a hole so deep, that I felt entirely hopeless.' She called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home . Barber indicated that she paid little attention to media reports of the search while she was in the hospital, but was stunned when she found out all it involved. The young woman called what she did 'incredibly dumb'. She wrote: 'I ask for everyone's forgiveness, most especially my wonderful family for all the worry and long nights I caused you, and all the amazing men, women, dogs and horses that searched for me.' On the day she vanished, Barber walked out of her apartment, threw her computer and a few other belongings over a wall and left with just a few dollars in her pocket. Her disappearance was even more concerning because two women had recently been assaulted on the campus of California State University, San Bernardino, near Barber's home. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said the department will seek criminal charges against Barber's roommates. They gave statements to police that indicated Barber had been killed, according to Burguan. It's possible that Barber will face charges as well due to the scope and cost of the investigation.","Sahray Barber vanished on March 9 from San Bernadino, California .

"More than 50 former female staff at a Wild-West-themed bar in in New York's Rockefeller Center have received payouts after being forced to work in a 'hyper-sexualized work environment' that 'degrad[ed] and humiliat[ed] its female employees', according to court records. According to a lawsuit filed at Manhattan Federal Court, women working at Johnny Utah's bar were required to remove wedding and engagement rings; wear 'sexually provocative', cowboy-style clothing; take part in bawdy drinking competitions with male customers, sit on their laps, and pour alcohol into their mouths; and kiss each other while riding a bucking mechanical bull. On one occasion, to mark Thanksgiving, women were even asked to wrestle in a pool of cranberry sauce, the New York Daily News reported. The level of the settlement is not known. Scroll down for video . Exploited: Female staff at Johnny Utah's bar in Manhattan's Rockefeller Center were allegedly forced to remove their shirts and kiss each other while riding a mechanical bull. There is no suggestion that the woman pictured is one of the plaintiffs . Total bull: The bar is famous for its mechanical bull, which has been at the centre of the sexual exploitation law suit. Female employees at Johnny Utah's were allegedly forced to dance for male customers and sit on their laps, wear sexy cowgirl outfits, and even wrestle in a pool of cranberry sauce . The working environment at the bar, the suit alleged, led to the women being subjected to 'pervasive and regular unwelcome sexual comments' and advances by customers and male staff. But those who complained were criticised for not being 'team players'. 'Managers frequently remind the female servers that they are expendable and tell them that '20 other women' are willing to take their job,' court papers said. According to the New York Daily News, female workers were also called 'ugly' or 'stupid' by male managers if they were not 'throwing the party' or looking 'attractive enough'. They were also forced to play drinking games with the manager of the bar and his friends, the suit says. The bar has also been accused of secretly recording titillating images of the women, and routinely posting them on Twitter, Facebook and its own website without their consent. '[Johnny Utah is] a hyper-sexualized work environment that increases the defendants profits by exploiting, degrading and humiliating its female employees,' said the court papers. 'Johnny Utah's is in business of selling food and alcohol to the public, not providing adult entertainment to heterosexual men.' Destiny Frye, one of the plaintiffs, was 19 when she began working at the bar as a hostess. Despite being under-age, she and others were allegedly ordered to drink before riding the bull. Much of the alleged abuse centred around Johnny Utah's famous mechanical bull, which once featured on the cartoon show Family Guy. Court papers say that women were urged by their bosses to 'take off their shirts' and 'kiss other female employees when they ride the bull together'. Embarrassing: Johnny Utah's mechanical bull is so notorious that it once featured on Fox Broadcasting company cartoon Family Guy. Its sexual connotations are satirised by the character Peter, who is shown wearing a bikini top . Party time: Johnny Utah's publicity posters featured sexually provocative images of women, seemingly leaving potential customers in little doubt about what to expect. Female employees were allegedly required to remove their wedding rings before starting work, and to flirt with male customers - and each other . 'During the ride, the Johnny Utah's DJ periodically stops the music and announces over the microphone that if the female employees who are riding the bull ""make out"" with each other, there will be a free round of shots of alcohol for all customers,' the papers said. 'The customers yell and scream for the female employees to kiss one another', and the women were 'expected to submit to the degradation'. This is not the first time that the restaurant and bar, which is owned by John Sullivan, who also owns the popular bars McFadden's and Calico Jack's, has found itself in court. Over the years, a number of personal injury lawsuits have been brought on account of the mechanical bull. Den of iniquity: Johnny Utah's bar, in New York's Rockefeller Center, has been plagued by scandal after scores of female former employees alleged that they had been routinely sexually exploited while working at the bar.

"An unseasonable wildfire driven by strong winds prompted an evacuation of a ski lodge in southern Montana. The blaze a few miles west of the community of Red Lodge had grown to 700 acres by Saturday night, US Forest Service spokesman Jeff Gildehaus said. The fire was first reported on open private land around 12.30pm, but it was driven by winds gusting 35 to 50 mph into the Custer National Forest, where the Red Lodge Mountain Resort ski area is located. It was zero per cent contained as of early Saturday night. A wildfire near the Red Lodge Mountain Resort ski area in southern Montana had grown to 700 acres after being reported at 200 acres earlier on Saturday . Thirteen engines and two fire attack crews had been deployed, according to KTVQ. 'There's snow between the ski area and the fire and the timber. But it's also a solid run of timber from where the fire is to the ski area,' Gildehaus said. 'So it gets up in the trees and starts running the crowns of the trees and it starts advancing toward the ski area.' He said that the decision to evacuate the Red Lodge ski area was made about 2:30 p.m. Saturday as a precautionary move and because there was just one road for firefighters and skiers to use. The evacuations have since been lifted, and Gildehaus said people were free to return to the ski area. He said the winds had eased somewhat and were expected to continue that course through the night. Gildehaus wasn't sure how many people had been evacuated, but he estimated about 500. The resort posted on its Facebook page that guests were safe and being escorted down the mountain by law enforcement. Red Lodge Mountain Resort ski area had an evacuation order on Saturday that was lifted. The US Forest Service said that no structures had been damaged in the blaze thus far (file photo) It plans on being open Sunday. The fire burned around rural homes, but no structures were damaged, Gildehaus said. With still no containment by Saturday night, the blaze had more than tripled from the 200 acres reported earlier in the day. Wildfires in the area at this time of year are unusual, he said. 'But down in the low elevation, there isn't any snow and things are pretty dry,' Gildehaus said. 'We haven't really had any green-up yet where grasses turn green. We got all the dry grass from last year, and things are pretty dry.' The fire actually started on Wednesday after a subdivision's controlled burn, according to the Billings Gazette. Red Lodge Fire Chief Tom Kuntz said that the blaze 'would have been a major fire in the summer,' A rain shower helped firefighters, but Kuntz said that several days would be required to deal with the fire. Traffic on state highways was diverted on Saturday. Other wildfires were reported elsewhere Saturday in Montana and northern Wyoming, leading to the evacuation of a subdivision. The southwestern portion of Montana and northern part of Wyoming are filled by a forest that stretches south to Shoshone and Yellowstone national parks.","Blaze at Custer National Forest grew from 200 acres earlier on Saturday .

"When we learn how to write, our brain does not learn the individual lettering of words - instead it is tuned to remember how the word appears as a whole. That's the finding of a new study that has shown how neurons respond differently to real words compared to so-called 'nonsense' words. During tests, brain scans revealed the new words appear as shapes rather than a group of letters in what researchers behind the study have dubbed a 'visual dictionary.' When we learn how to write, our brain doesn't learn individual letters, instead it is tuned to remember how the word appears as a whole, according to new research. Brain scans revealed neurons respond differently to real words compared to so-called 'nonsense' words in what's been dubbed 'visual dictionary' The study, carried out at Georgetown University Medical Centre, suggests brain is 'holistically tuned' to recognise complete words, according to the researchers. Lead author Dr Maximilian Riesenhuber from the Laboratory for Computational Cognitive Neuroscience said: 'We are not recognising words by quickly spelling them out or identifying parts of words, as some researchers have suggested. 'Instead, neurons in a small brain area remember how the whole word looks - using what could be called a visual dictionary.' The small area in the brain called the visual word form area is found in the left side of the visual cortex, opposite the fusiform face area on the right side, which remembers how faces look. The study published in the Journal of Neuroscience looked at the brain activity of 25 adults who had learn a set of 150 nonsense words. For the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), before and after participants learnt the new words. Using the fMRI-rapid adaptation, the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the nonsense words. Before learning the words, neurons responded as though the training words were nonsense words. However over time, the neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words. The researchers said this shows the brain is 'holistically tuned' to recognise complete words, and may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities. Dr Riesenhuber added: 'One area is selective for a whole face, allowing us to quickly recognise people, and the other is selective for a whole word, which helps us read quickly.' The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, looked at the brain activity of 25 adults who had learn a set of 150 nonsense words. For the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Images of the brain were taken before and after participants learnt the new words. From this, the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the 'nonsense' words. Before learning the words, neurons responded as though the training words were nonsense words. But over time, the neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words. Co-author Dr Laurie Glezer said: 'This study is the first of its kind to show how neurons change their tuning with learning words, demonstrating the brain's plasticity.' The researchers said the study shows how the brain processes words, but may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities. Dr Riesenhuber said: 'For people who cannot learn words by phonetically spelling them out - which is the usual method for teaching reading - learning the whole word as a visual object may be a good strategy.' In particular, the team found the visual word form area in the fusiform gyrus (shown in purple) changed as the participants learned the 'nonsense' words. The neurons began by responding to the training words as if they were nonsense, but over time, these neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words . Following a previous study carried out by the team published in 2009, the researchers were contacted by a number of people who had experienced reading difficulties and teachers helping people with reading difficulties, all saying that learning word as visual objects had helped a great deal. That study showed the existence of a neural representation for whole written real words - also known as an orthographic lexicon. The latest research now shows how novel words can become incorporated after learning into this lexicon. Dr Riesenhuber said: 'The visual word form area does not care how the word sounds, just how the letters of the word look together. 'The fact that this kind of learning only happens in one very small part of the brain is a nice example of selective plasticity in the brain.'","Experts studied the brain activity of adults learning 150 'nonsense' words .

"A grieving mother today revealed how she feels responsible for her son dying in a suspected suicide in jail - after shopping him to police for mugging a 90-year-old woman. Sharron Lewis, 50, of Bournemouth, named her son Sheldon Woodford, 24, to police after recognising him in an appeal by detectives. The drug addict had stalked pensioner Betty Aldworth moments before the attack in the town, which knocked her to the ground and left her with knee and shoulder injuries. Sharron Lewis (right) had reported her son Sheldon Woodford (left) to police after recognising him in an appeal by detectives. He went on to commit suicide while in jail . Grieving mother Mrs Lewis, pictured with Sheldon, revealed she blames herself after her son was found hanging in his cell at HMP Winchester in Hampshire last week . He mugged the woman for her handbag while high on a cannabis-like legal drug called Clockwork Orange, and was jailed last month for robbery for more than four years. But Mrs Lewis said although she felt she did the right thing by speaking to police, she blamed herself after her son was found hanging in his cell at HMP Winchester in Hampshire last week. She told the Daily Mirror: ‘I feel responsible and I feel that I failed him. I know I did the right thing for my son and for the old lady. 'I did it because he could have seriously hurt someone next time. I did it for his own good. 'I did it because he needed help and the only way he was going to get it was being in prison. He was in the right place to get help and he obviously didn’t get it.’ On camera: CCTV footage showed Sheldon Woodford stalking the pensioner in Boscombe, Bournemouth . Speaking to Mirror reporters Euan Stretch and Paul Vass, she added that Woodford had attempted to hang himself four weeks before his death, and had been under hourly observation in jail. Mrs Lewis, who lives with her second husband David, 56, said Woodford was a ‘troubled person from childhood’, but he had forgiven her for alerting police that it was him in the CCTV appeal. Detective Constable Leo Glendon said at the time of Woodford’s sentencing last month that Mrs Lewis saw the police photo of her son  and 'felt it right' to come forward. He added: ‘She felt that any loyalty towards her son was superseded by the fact that he had picked on a vulnerable, elderly lady. Robbery: Woodford snatched 90-year-old Betty Aldworth's bag in the attack which knocked her to the ground . Moving: He could then be seen attempting to make a getaway with her bag while she remained on the ground . 'She felt it was right to come forward and inform us due to the nature of the crime and the fact Woodford was targeting elderly people and could still be a danger to them. 'We received a call from Woodford's mother on January 2 during which she said ""That's my son"". Circled: Woodford, immediately prior to the incident . 'She wanted him to be forced to get help and the only way that was going to be possible is if he was put behind bars.’ Judge Peter Johnson described Woodford's crime as 'a cowardly, despicable act', saying: 'That injury is still causing her pain. The sentence of this court must be a severe one.' He had nine previous convictions for 26 offences - including five robberies. Bournemouth Crown Court heard Woodford had moved back to the Dorset coastal town from the home he shared with his partner and baby in Chippenham, Wiltshire, after becoming overwhelmed by his role as a father. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘HMP Winchester prisoner Sheldon Woodford died in hospital at 2.10pm on March 12. ‘Every death in custody is a tragedy and, as with all deaths, there will be an investigation by the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.’ Scene: Woodford was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Bournemouth Crown Court for the crime on this road .

"Cruise companies last night cancelled all stops in Tunis following the terrorist attack. An association which looks after more than 50 cruise operators – including P&O, Thomson and Cunard – said no ships would be calling at the city ‘in the foreseeable future’. The mass cancellations follow a stark warning from the Foreign Office that ‘further attacks are possible’. The FCO has also advised holidaymakers to only travel to the interior of the country with a ‘reputable tour guide’. Scroll down for video . Cancellation: An association which looks after more than 50 cruise operators – including P&O, Thomson and Cunard – said no ships would be calling at the city ‘in the foreseeable future’ (file picture) Italian operators MSC Cruises and Costa Cruises, used by hundreds of British tourists each year, have already scrapped planned stops to Tunisian ports with immediate effect and said they were ‘seeking alternative ports’. Holiday companies Thomson and First Choice said they had also cancelled voyages to Tunis, while P&O, Princess and Celebrity cruises said they were taking advice from security services. A spokesman for the Cruise Lines International Association said last night: ‘No CLIA member ships are scheduled to call at Tunis in the foreseeable future. ‘Cruise lines coordinate closely with national and international authorities when visiting destinations around the globe to help ensure passenger safety.’ Last year, 425,000 British holidaymakers visited Tunisia and last night there were fears that as many as 6,500 could still be in the country. However a spokesman for Thomson and First Choice said: ‘Our customers stay in beach destinations, not Tunis, and we can confirm that none of our customers or staff were affected by Wednesday’s events.’ He added that, as a precaution, all excursions to Tunis have been cancelled. Meanwhile a spokesman for travel agent association ABTA said the tourist season was only just getting under way but safety was always a priority. He told Sky News: ‘Tourist numbers to Tunisia have picked up over the last two years and we have had very healthy bookings for this summer. The season really picks up around mid-April to May. Warning: It comes following a stark warning from the Foreign Office that ‘further attacks are possible’. Pictured: Tourists flee from the Bardo Museum in Tunis after Wednesday's attack . ‘We now have a developing situation. ABTA follows FCO advice very closely and safety is always the main concern.’ Bob Atkinson, a travel expert at TravelSupermarket, added: ‘Tour operators have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their tour operators. ‘Consumers who already have holidays booked this year will want to be convinced of the safety – most of them will be staying at beach resorts and the vast bulk would not even go to Tunis on a day trip.’ The Tunis outrage has tragic echoes of the November 1997 Luxor massacre in Egypt, when gunmen killed 58 foreign holidaymakers including six Britons. Tour operators pulled out of the Egyptian market and it was some time before holidays started again. The CLIA spokesperson continued: ‘Cruise line security personnel, in addition to ongoing communication with national and international security authorities, enhance the security of cruise ships. ‘CLIA members maintain rigorous policies and procedures designed to safeguard passengers.’","Decision made by group which looks after 50 operators, including P&O .

"Much of the goodwill Hillary Clinton built up as serving as secretary of state has dissipated, a new poll shows, just as she prepares for a second bid for the presidency. And her popularity has taken an especially hard hit since the public became aware that she operated a private email system while serving in President Barack Obama's cabinet. A CNN/ORC International survey taken last weekend, after Clinton held a press conference at which she tried to explain away her secret server, found that Clinton's high approval ratings as an Obama administration official had entirely eroded. Scroll down for video . Hillary is currently disliked by as many Americans, 44 percent, as she was in June of 2008 when she officially ended her presidential campaign and endorsed her future employer, President Barack Obama . She is currently disliked by as many Americans, 44 percent, as she was in June of 2008 when she officially ended her presidential campaign and endorsed her future employer. That's a six-point drop from CNN's last poll, taken in November, when 38 percent of respondents said they weren't fond of Clinton. Likewise, a slim majority, 53 percent, said they view Clinton positively, down from 59 percent a few months ago, and 69 percent at her career peak in the State Department in September of 2011. Throughout her time as the country's chief diplomat Clinton generally enjoyed favorability ratings in the '60s. It was after she tendered her resignation in early 2013 that the public's adoration of her began to slide, dipping to 55 percent after she claimed last spring that she and husband bill were 'dead broke' when they moved out of the White House. After a quick bounce back up to 59 percent late last fall, Clinton's likability now teeters above the majority water mark. This as the Democratic politician is expected to formally launch her presidential campaign as early as the first week in April. Clinton's last known paid speech, to the American Camp Association, will take place on Thursday, suggesting an announcement will come within weeks. A handful of Democratic operatives are also rumored to be leaving their posts at the White House and elsewhere soon for top spots in Clinton's campaign network. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raises her glass during a toast at a ceremony to induct her into the Irish America Hall of Fame on Monday in New York City. This as the Democratic politician is expected to formally launch her presidential campaign as early as the first week in April. Her last known paid speech is this week . A total of 51 percent of respondents to CNN's poll said they believe the email system revelations to be either very or somewhat serious in nature compared the combined 48 percent who said the controversy was not too serious or 'not a problem at all.' The same amount, 51 percent, said Clinton needed to better explain her motives and that they believed she'd done something 'wrong.' The split indicates that while the public haranguing of Clinton over her use of a personal email address to conduct government business has mostly ended the subject could prove as an effective attack line for Clinton's Republican opponent in the general election next year. Still, 52 percent said Clinton's actions don't disqualify her from serving as commander in chief, and 57 percent said they'd be 'proud' to have her in the Oval Office - up from 50 percent the last time CNN's pollsters asked potential voters the same question in March of 2014.","The high approval rating Clinton enjoyed as an Obama administration official has entirely eroded .

"The majority of taxi drivers have always been men but there are some women who are killing it as cabbies while balancing life's everyday pressures as they strive towards their dreams. The Uber rideshare service has taken off around the globe and two Australian women have jumped behind the wheel of the popular initiative while they juggle studying for complete career changes, paying their bills and providing for their kids. These inspirational ladies have not allowed obstacles to stop them from achieving what some may see as the impossible - and the convenience and flexibility of using their own cars and choosing the hours that suit them is making their crazy lives that bit easier and less stressful. Alice Clark started her biomedicine degree in 1999 but was then struck down with viral encephalitis and had to learn to walk and talk again . Alice then moved in with her friend Ellen (right with her son) to care for her as she lost her life to lung cancer . Alice Clark, from Brisbane, has been through some pretty tough hurdles in the past 15 years but that hasn't stopped her from picking herself up, dusting herself off and pushing on with her dreams. She started a biomedical degree in 1999 when she was mysteriously struck down with viral encephalitis which doctors believe may have been contracted by a random mosquito. Although she has very little recollection of those next 18 months, let alone her time in hospital where her heart stopped twice, Alice, who was in her mid 20s at the time, had to start from scratch learning to walk and talk all over again. 'There were two other presentations in Brisbane at the time - one died and the other is a quadriplegic so I feel very blessed,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'From there, I must have stepped under a ladder, broken a few mirrors and annoyed a lot of black cats because the years that followed were shadowed by illness in my family as well as a very dear friend of mine who was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer.' Alice moved in with her friend Ellen for six months, to help care for her as she lost her life to lung cancer. 'After this I had to take some time to myself to recover from the agony of watching a loved one fade away,' she said. 'Finally, this year I can begin again to finish what I started in what seems like a lifetime ago.' Her studies were further delayed as she then cared for her mother and brother (left) who became ill over the past two years  she then discovered Uber ridesharing app (right) which found 'too good to be true' Alice had to delay resuming her studies in 2013 when he mother fell ill and then delayed them a second time last year when she had to travel to Vietnam to look after her brother who became sick. Alice, who is now 38 years old, was finally able to start studying this year and she looked into what she could do for work on the side. 'The thought of going back into hospitality wasn't enticing and then I read about Uber and thought it was too good to be true because you get 80 per cent of your earnings,' she said. 'I was looking for the perfect job and it ticked all of the boxes which you rarely find.' Alice balances her car trips with working the Defence Force, as a reserve medical attendant which she has been doing since 1995. 'It has allowed me to more comfortably balance the metaphorical work/study seesaw,' she said. 'I can drive when I am available and still fit in my studies and assessments. 'The flexibility allows me to earn a living and study, without either pastime encroaching on the other.' After surviving a near-death experience and then caring for three sick loves ones, it is now time for Alice to focus on herself and her future. 'Once these degrees are completed I hope to apply for Medical School with the aspirations of one day becoming a trauma or vascular surgeon in the Royal Australian Army,' she said. 'My ultimate dream is to spend six months with the military and six months working with Medicine Sans Frontier (Doctors without Borders).'

She also has a passion for umpiring netball and is training to increase her levels so she can fulfill her dream of becoming an umpire at a national level. But most importantly, she provides full-time care for her son Tyler who is 12-years-old. 'With all this happening, my ultimate dream is that my boy will grow into a respectful well-rounded adult with compassion, and a drive to work toward whatever he wants to be,' she said. 'He is old enough to leave at home for a couple of hours and I just come home in between jobs to go to the loo, get a feed and check up on him,' she said. 'I'm lucky he's such a good, responsible boy - he has learnt to cook his own dinner and even cooked me dinner last night.' Debra said she has never felt unsafe or in danger while ferrying around customers. 'Riders are always excited to have female drivers and you meet some really great people,' she said. 'Young people sometimes lack a bit of respect but I just go into mum mode and say ""would you like to walk instead?"".'

"It was the generation of dodgy haircuts, questionable tracksuits... and, yes, VHS dating. A new video, highlighting the cringe-factor of the video dating adverts, which were once deemed a good way to meet a potential partner in the Eighties, has found its way online. Now, it's being used in a Canadian advert, and is chock full of cheesy pick-up lines, talk of 'working out at the gym,' and explanations as to why one woman doesn't like men who 'when they laugh'. Star of the show: Donny explains how his work in the gym and on the arm wrestling circuit earned him the name 'Big D' Entitled ‘Date Night,’ the hilarious commercial channels the world of VHS dating in all its glory, perhaps making modern-day daters grateful for websites and apps. Among the characters there is Donny, who is referred to as ‘Big D’ in the gym and on the arm wrestling circuit, apparently. And Connie who doesn’t like it when men grunt and snort while laughing. Sporting a pair of over-sized glasses and a moustache, one man says: ‘If you don’t believe in love at first sight, let me reintroduce myself,’ before giving a little smirk. While a hipster-looking type stares down the camera and says: ‘I once made love in the sewers of New York City.’ Complementing the characters are some wonderfully coloured backdrops and some state-of-the-art fades between shots. Looking for love: Connie explains that she does not like it when a man grunts or snorts when laughing . The commercial concludes with Donny stating: ‘When I start nibbling on this sucker,’ while stroking his earlobe, ‘it’s game over,’ as the introductory music returns. According to CBC News Nova Scotia, the company were going to use real footage from the 80s but instead used actors to deliver the lines. The original video, which has gained much attention, has been viewed over 120,000 times on Youtube and people have commented such things as: ‘Well played, Halifax. Well played,’ in appreciation. Oversized glasses, terrible hair and creepy moustaches feature throughout the advert to give it an authentic 80s feel . And according to Downtown Halifax Business Commission, the advert has been a commercial success too. Commenting on their site, they wrote: ‘Our date night packages are sold out! But that doesn't mean you can't have a great night on the town in Downtown Halifax. ‘Who knows, maybe you'll run into Big D or Connie. They love it here. And they have great taste.’ Brightly coloured backdrops and state-of-the-art fades between shots feature throughout the commerical .","Video features creepy moustaches, terrible clothes and 80s music .

"When you go on safari, you want to get a good view of the animals, and experience nature up close. One motorist, in the Kruger National Park in South Africa got more than they bargained for, when they were trapped right in the middle of a pride of lions and a ginormous elephant. The small blue car was powerless to move as more than a dozen large cats from the Vurhami pride lay in its path, with a tusked elephant blocking the route behind. The nail-biting moment when a pride of lion gazes at a small car unable to move round them as it is trapped by a giant elephant behind . The photographs of the incident were taken by a housewife in another vehicle, who witnessed the scary encounter . Just lion around! The driver's path is blocked by a dozen cats, part of the Vurhami pride, relaxing on the safari road . Thankfully the car owner was in no danger, and waited for the elephant to continue its stroll, before managing to escape round the lazy cats. The dramatic photographs were taken by housewife Stella Stewart in 2013 and have only recently come to light. The 59-year-old housewife who took pictures from the car opposite, said the motorist was in no danger. She said: 'There was no aggression from either the elephant or lions so I was more interested on how long she would have to wait for the lions to move over. 'She wasn't ever in danger. The elephant didn't even give it a second glance. 'But the lions on the other hand were very wary of both the car and elephant. 'I've seen lions and elephants road blocks but never together and a car stuck between them.' As the elephant slowly ambled to the other side of the road the driver, who has not been identified, calmly swerved round the side of the pride to avoid the lethargic cats. Phew! Thankfully the giant elephant ambles across the road allowing the small car to reverse and escape round the pride of lions .","A motorist got up close and personal to the wild creatures when it was sandwiched during a  safari .

"Joe Biden made yet another of his trademark gaffes today as he met Ireland's prime minister to mark St Patrick's Day - then suggested one side of its sectarian divide was unwelcome in Washington. Sporting a green tie and noticing that everyone else was also wearing one, or clad in green, he suddenly blurted: 'Anyone wearing orange is not welcome in here.' The purported joke was a reference to Ireland's religious and political divide which was at the heart of the Troubles, the violence which killed 3,000 from the late 1960s until the start of the millennium. Orange is the color associated with the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland, and overcoming sectarian tensions has been a major part of the effort to bring peace to the once-deeply troubled province. Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister – whose official title is Taoiseach – and his wife Fionnuala Kenny, the guests of honour, both laughed nervously. They said nothing, but continued to smile for the cameras. Scroll down for video . Wearing of the green: From left Ireland's prime minister Enda Kenny, his wife Fionnuala and vice-president Joe Biden. The vice president made a joke about sectarianism and got her name wrong . I'm with...: Vice president Joe Biden points at shamrock worn in his breast pocket to mark St Patrick's Day . After a brief pause, Mr Biden declared: 'Only joking.' He then welcomed the Kennys, Irish Ambassador Anne Anderson and the Irish entourage into the Naval Observatory in Washington, his official residence. The Vice Pesident made no further reference to his blurted-out bad joke, but at one point in his breakfast remarks appeared to refer to the Taoiseach's wife as 'Fiona', although he subsequently corrected it to Fionnuala. Northern Irish Protestants traditionally wear orange during their annual summer parades, while green is used as a symbol by mostly Catholic Irish nationalists and is a theme of St Patrick's Day celebrations around the world. In Northern Ireland, there was an immediate demand from a senior Unionist for an apology. 'Whether they were intended as a joke or not, the comments are a slur on those who would be known as 'orange' i.e. Protestants,' said the Rev William McCrea, a member of the British parliament for the Democratic Unionist Party. 'When Northern Ireland is making such an effort to make St Patrick's Day an inclusive celebration, Joe Biden's comments were disgraceful and careless,' he added. Asked about the request for an apology, an official in Biden's office said the vice president had made clear that he was joking. Biden's mother, Catherine Finnegan, was of Irish origin. Her ancestors had moved to Ireland in the wake of the potato famine. The Vice President made another minor blunder later when he read a quote from a Yeats poem he described as 'Easter Sunday 1916', when the word Sunday is not in the title. The poem was about the Easter Rising, when Irish rebels began a violent attempt to force Ireland to become independent from the United Kingdom, which succeeded five years later. It actually broke out the next day, Easter Monday, April 24 of that year. The use of Easter Sunday would materially affect the subject of the poem, best known for its phrase 'a terrible beauty is born'. He described Yeats as 'a Protestant hero in a predominantly Catholic country.' He then told the Taoiseach: 'You've become a close friend and I admire you a great deal.' Laughing: Despite the gaffe, Irish prime minister Enda Kenny laughed with Mr Biden . Mr Biden also revealed that he had a stammer as a child. 'My uncle, Ed Finnegan, a bachelor, used to sleep in the same room as my brother and I. I used to stutter very badly when I was a kid. But at night Ed used to recite the poetry of Yeats. And I would get up and recite in front of a mirror, and try to learn not to contort my face when I spoke and stuttered.' Mr Biden has a long list of previous gaffes – he once asked a wheelchair-bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge the crowd's applause, and after being chosen as Vice President he even suggested that Hillary Clinton would have been a better choice. Most recently he was widely ridiculed for putting his hands on the shoulders of Stephanie Carter, wife of defense secretary Ash Carter, and whispering in her ear as her husband was sworn in. He also told the father of a teenage girl – Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch's grandaughter Emily – that he hoped he had a 'big fence' as Hatch was sworn in. Five years ago, Biden incorrectly suggested at a St Patrick's Day reception that the mother of then Irish prime minister Brian Cowen was dead, saying 'God rest her soul', before correcting himself to say 'God bless her soul'. At today's Washington event the Taoiseach presented the Vice President with a book of Yeats' poetry, but told him he should not open it for at least another 25 years, 'when you are old and grey and nodding by the fire.' He then invited Mr Biden to play a round of golf in Ireland - the fifth time he has done so, with no success so far. Mr Kenny joked: 'The golf courses are still there. And they are in better condition than they have been for many years. So welcome home, Finnegan.' Mr Biden replied that last year the Taoiseach had tried to intercede for him with the president, telling him, 'You gotta let him go. You gotta let Joe go.'","Biden was supposed to be greeting Irish prime minister Enda Kenny in Washington to mark feast of Ireland's patron saint .

Miss McGeown said: 'I understand there's a level of bureaucracy in these sort of things but I just feel that both sides, Southern Water and the council, knew what the problem was but nobody was prepared to take responsibility for it.' She added Southern Water had taken more than two weeks to fix a different drain in the same road - and then told her it was the county council who were responsible for the repair.

"Students preparing for college campus tours can now make the task easier by hopping on a private jet and visiting schools  - but it will cost $43,500. The price is nearly the same as the $43,938 undergraduate tuition  at Harvard (that's not including room and board). The ten-hour flight cards offered by Magellan Jets, a company that provides private travel services, also include perks like car services to transport clients to and from each campus. In its second year of running the offer, the company said last year 18 people purchased the cards, and each made around three or four college visits in one day. Families can pay $43,500 to have a private jet help their college hopeful make multiple college visits into a short period of time (above file photo) This year, they are expecting 50 buyers of the package, which is offered from March 25 - June 30, a Magellan spokeswoman told CNBC. 'There is a little bit of a misconception with private jets that it's all glitz and glamour, but the real reason people use them is productivity and efficiency,' Greg Belezerian, vice president at Magellan told MarketWatch. 'This is a tool that our clients use in order to be more efficient. I know that might sound weird, but that's really why they're using it.' While data from last year revealed that over the past three decades the average tuition at a public four-year college had more than tripled,  most families are likely looking at financial aid options before considering splurging on a chartered jet to visit campuses. But for those who can afford to dish out the money, Magellan said its college tour service was created as a way to help alleviate the stress that often comes with campus visits, according to CNN Money. Belezerian said the idea came from clients who were already using their services for college tours so they just met the demand. Last year, he told Business Insider that through the service, a student can visit up to eight campuses in different cities in one weekend. He said they were able to take one student to visit Northwestern, Duke, and Syracuse in one day. This year they have already taken a few clients on tours. Greg Belezerian, a vice president at Magellan, said there is a misconception with private jets being all 'glitz and glamour' but that the real reason people use them is for efficiency (above students on a college tour at Saint Michael's College) The company organizes a flight schedule based on the schools a client wants to visit, then sets up the car services, while some times even coordinating private tours of college towns with local chauffeurs. If a family using the service cannot fit in all of the schools they wanted to visit using the ten-hour card, they have to purchase additional  cards. Following each visit, their client is given a notepad from each college they toured so they can write their feedback. Magellan puts together all of the notes and sums up their client's reaction from each school. And once the college hopeful chooses a school, they receive a gift basket from the company filled with branded items from the institution. Mimi Doe, co-founder of Application Boot Camp, which offers a $16,000 four-day course for students to complete their college applications, said she is surprised there are not more concierge-style college visiting services. She told MarketWatch: 'It's clunky to visit schools. There should be a hotel/private plane/car service that's all connected.'","Magellan Jets offers ten-hour flight cards for clients to go on college visits while also offering car services .

"The first ‘significant’ solar flare of the year has been spotted by a Nasa observatory. The flare peaked at 12.22pm EDT (4.22pm GMT) yesterday and was watched by the orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This flare was the most powerful of the year so far, and is predicted to cause a geomagnetic storm on Earth tomorrow following blackouts today. Scroll down for video . Space weather experts in Colorado, US issued a warning on a solar flare. It was the biggest eruption of the year and peaked at 4.22pm GMT yesterday (shown) This flare was classified as an X2.2-class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense, and so on. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation, but harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground. However, when intense enough, they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This flare was emitted from Active Region 12297 (AR12297) on the sun. According to the US Space Weather Prediction Centre (SWPC) in Boulder, Colorado, the flare caused an hour-long blackout in some high-frequency radio communications over some areas. The flare (seen in different wavelengths on the left and right) has already caused radio blackouts on Earth and a minor geomagnetic storm could occur tomorrow. This flare was emitted from Active Region 12297 (AR12297) on the sun. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. ‘An R3 (Strong) Radio Blackout peaked at 1622 UTC (12:22pm EDT) today, March 11,’ they said in a statement.. ‘This is yet another significant solar flare from Active Region 12297 as it marches across the solar disk. ‘This is the largest flare the region has produced so far, after producing a slew of R1 (Minor) and R2 (Moderate) Radio Blackouts over the past few days.’ They also note that ejections of material associated with the flare - known as a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) - are predicted to arrive today and tomorrow. ‘The combined effects of these storms have prompted a G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm watch to be issued, with the possibility of additional or upgraded watches if/when additional data can be analysed,’ they wrote. A geomagnetic storm is a temporary disturbance of Earth's atmosphere, which can cause communication problems. Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), illustration shown, was launched on 11 February 2010 and has observed the sun ever since. It’s goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around Earth. It captured the images of this latest large flare . According to the US Space Weather Prediction Centre (SWPC) in Boulder, Colorado, the flare (shown) caused an hour-long blackout in some high-frequency radio communicatiosn over some areas . A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots. Their frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods. Radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end. The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time. Solar flares are not to be confused with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The former are the flash of light from the sun, while the latter are the actual emission of material that we often see as 'loops' coming from the surface. While the two often accompany each other, the relationship between them is not entirely understood.","Space weather experts in Colorado, US issued a warning on a solar flare .

"The identity of the man who lost out on a $1million Powerball prize has finally been revealed. Hung Nguyen, a mechanic from South El Monte, California with a 5-month-old baby, was unable to claim his $1,098,624 prize last week because he had lost his ticket after purchasing it in September. What's more, Nguyen knew he had won the prize, as did California Lottery officials who released footage of him purchasing his ticket in hopes he would come forward before the six months the winner has to claim the prize had lapsed, but Powerball prizes can only be claimed if the individual has the physical ticket. Scroll down for video . Hung Nguyen (above), a mechanic with a 5-month-old baby, was unable to claim his $1,098,624 Powerball prize after losing the ticket . California Lottery officials released video of Nguyen (above) purchasing his ticket, but Powerball winners must produce the physical ticket to collect their winnings . That footage was seen by the owner of the repair shop where Nguyen works, who quickly passed on the news. 'The owner mentioned it to him and he thought that the owner was joking around with him,' a translator for Nguyen told ABC 7. Nguyen then tried to come forward even though he did not have the ticket, but the winnings ultimately went to the California public school system. The other big winner, the Rosemead Supermarket that sold the ticket, was still able to collect their $5,493 bonus. As for unclaimed winnings, it happens more than people might think, with $20million going unclaimed during the last fiscal year in California alone. Despite all this, Nguyen said he will continue to play the lottery and hopes that he wins big again. He then added that he will never again throw away one of his tickets.","Hung Nguyen, a mechanic from South El Monte, California with a 5-month-old baby, was unable to claim his $1,098,624 prize .

"A soldier's dramatic account of a pivotal moment in the Battle of Waterloo has been unearthed after 200 years. Corporal Richard Coulter was part of the 'glorious' charge of the Household Heavy Brigade in the famous battle which left British swords 'reeking with French blood'. Despite heavy casualties, the attack on June 18, 1815 proved to be a turning point in the one-day battle at a time when Napoleon Bonaparte's forces had the upper hand. A soldier's dramatic first hand account of the Battle of Waterloo has been unearthed after 200 years . Days after the battle, which brought to an end the French dictator's plans to rule Europe, Cpl Coulter wrote home to a cousin, giving a graphic account of the fighting. The soldier, who was a cabinet maker from Northumberland before he joined the army in 1809 and served in the Life Guards, described how he survived being stabbed in the shoulder. He then told how he had fled on foot from 1,500 bayonet-wielding enemy soldiers after his horse was cut down 20 yards from their position. He wrote: 'We had very hard fighting and with men of no despicable size or appearance. 'I received a cut on my bridle hand, had a sword run through my jacket in the shoulder. Corporal Richard Coulter's letter described being part of the 'glorious' charge of the household heavy brigade in the famous battle which left the British swords 'reeking with French blood' 'We drove them under their own cannon into their own lines and stay'd their (sic) too long, for the infantry began to play upon us. 'I had my horse shot in a charge against a solid column of infantry...he received another ball, he tumbled over another horse... about 20 yards from the face of the column of 15 hundred or 2 thousand men. The battle brought to an end French dictator Napoleon Bonaparte's plans to rule Europe . 'I struggled to get clear, they saw me and sent some musket shot at me but they struck the horses. My poor horse had a great many balls in him. 'I got my legs clear looked over his neck, and saw more approaching to bayonet me. I mustered all my strength and run off faster than I ever went to school in my life, their flankers fired after me.' On his retreat he described seeing 'the road covered with dead men and dead horses.' He added: 'This was a Glorious Charge we returned and was Huzza'd by the infantry which they had threatened with destruction. Our swords reeked with French Blood.' The letter has now emerged for sale at auctioneers Bonhams. A spokesman said: 'This letter is a vivid, first hand account of the battle. It has a great immediacy about it and goes into great detail.' Cpl Coulter  joined the army in 1809 and served in the Life Guards. At 2pm on June 18, 1815, with Napoleon winning the battle, the Household Brigade led by Lord Edward Somerset crossed the crest of the Allied position and charged downhill in support of the hard-pressed infantry. The charge destroyed an enemy brigade but attempts to recall them failed and they became overrun by the enemy. Maj Gen Ponsonby became surrounded by a group of lancers who beckoned to him to surrender after recognising his rank. Several comrades spotted the danger and rode to his rescue which prompted a lancer to spear him to death. The letter is being sold by Bonhams on April 1. Dear Cousin, . We had very hard fighting and with men of no despicable size or appearance I mean their Curassiers in complete Armour if you had heard us the first Charge we made on the 18th you had been reminded of Mr Greenwoods Braizer's Shop such a rattling of swords about their Backs & Helmets it was really Laughable.

The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe and sent the great French emperor into exile for a second and final time. France's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition, led by the British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington. The armies amassed near the town of Waterloo in modern-day Belgium, not far from the border with France, and it was the French who made the first move around 11am. The two sides clashed for 10 hours, with the British fending off repeated attacks from the French, until Marshal Blücher arrived at the head of a Prussian army. This was the decisive intervention which finished Napoleon off, allowing Wellington to counter-attack and forcing the Frenchman to surrender. The battle forced Napoleon from the throne of France, leading to his exile on St Helena - but Wellington later admitted it was 'the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life'. Despite the popular image of Waterloo as a heroic endeavour, it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed, with the French bearing the brunt of the losses.","Corporal Richard Coulter described a pivotal moment in Battle of Waterloo .

"Children offered a sip of their parents’ wine at parties and social occasions are more likely to start drinking by their mid-teens, researchers warn . Children offered a sip of their parents’ wine at parties and social occasions are more likely to start drinking by their mid-teens, researchers warn. A study has found that those who had sipped alcohol by the age of 11 were five times more likely to have had a full drink within a couple of years, and four times more likely to have binged or been drunk than peers who had not tasted alcohol at an early age. The study was carried out in the US where, say researchers, some parents try to lessen the taboo appeal of drinking by following the ‘European model’ of introducing young children to alcohol under supervision at home. Lead researcher Kristina Jackson, of Brown University in Rhode Island, said: ‘Our study provides evidence to the contrary.’ Previous research suggests parental attitudes are one of the most important factors involved in when teens start drinking. A survey of UK schoolchildren found witnessing drinking at home and seeing their parents get drunk raises the risk of children having an alcoholic drink by the age of 13. In the American study, 561 Rhode Island middle-school students were surveyed periodically over three years. At the beginning of sixth grade – around the age of 11 – almost 30 per cent of pupils said they had sipped alcohol. In most cases, their parents provided it – often at a party or other special occasion. By the time the students reached the ages of 14 and 15, one in four early ‘sippers’ said they had had a full alcoholic drink, compared with 6 per cent of those who had not. Almost one in ten of early sippers had got drunk or binged – compared with just under 2 per cent of ‘non-sippers’, says a report in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. Researchers accounted for several factors which influence under-age drinking, including parents’ drinking habits and any history of alcoholism, as well as tendencies among the children to be impulsive and take risks. Even then there was still a connection between early sipping and risky drinking by high school, said Dr Jackson. She said it was possible little tastes of alcohol sent young children a mixed message because some may have difficulty understanding the difference between a sip of wine and having a full drink. She stressed parents should not be alarmed if they had already let their child have a taste of wine, adding: ‘We’re not saying your child is doomed.’ Dr Paul Wallace, of the charity Drinkaware, said: ‘Alcohol can harm children while they are still developing which is why the UK chief medical officers say an alcohol-free childhood as the best option. ‘It’s best to talk to your child about the risks associated with drinking. You have more influence than you might think.’ One in five teenagers have bought or tried electronic cigarettes, a major British study has found. This includes many who had never smoked regular cigarettes. It is feared youngsters hooked on the nicotine in the devices will then move on to tobacco cigarettes, putting themselves at risk of lung cancer and other diseases. Experts warn that rather than being an aid to quitting smoking, e-cigarettes are increasingly seen as ‘a recreational drug in their own right’. Professor Mark Bellis, of Liverpool John Moores University, surveyed 16,000 people aged 14 to 17 in the North West of England. A fifth said they had bought or tried e-cigarettes. More boys than girls had done so, and the rate increased among those from deprived areas, the journal BMC Public Health reports. Professor Bellis warned nicotine can affect younger brains more seriously.","US researchers say some parents are introducing children to alcohol early .

"After-effects: Jay Francis shows off his face after he was stung nearly 400 times by an angry swarm on Friday while watching a baseball game with his family . An 89-year-old Utah grandfather who survived being stung by nearly 400 bees while he watched a baseball game with his family on Friday has described the terrifying attack. 'First it was one, then two, then three. Then they were everywhere,' said Jay Francis of the attack. 'It was just horrible. My head started aching. I can't believe how sensitive it was.' 'My whole head was just swollen. I felt like I was a lucky man after hearing the statements the doctors had to make,' he said. The swarm of nearly 1,000 angry bees descended on the baseball game at Elks Field, sending players running and Francis and his family trying to duck for cover. Francis' son, Kevin told KSL he was shocked to turn and see his father enveloped by the bees which had been disturbed from their underground hive. 'His face was just covered in bees. You saw his eyes and his mouth,' Kevin Francis said. The Francis family tried to get the bees off of Jay for 15 minutes before the St. George Fire Department arrived to help. 'Since they were being so aggressive, we used water and foam to destroy those aggressive bees,' said Robert Hooper an official with the St. George Fire Department. 'There were people running everywhere, swatting at bees. It was very chaotic.' Once the swarm was fought off, Francis was rushed to hospital where he was treated for nearly 400 hundred bee stings.

His wife was treated for almost a dozen stings herself and his son was hit with 50 stings. The bee attack during the baseball game began when a beehive near a telephone pole at the baseball field was disturbed just after 11 a.m. Lone Peak High School baseball coach Matt Bezzant told The Spectrum newspaper of St. George that the bees came from a dugout and players were chased by as many as 70 bees at one point. Fire crews doused the dugout area with a chemical foam to combat the bees.

Casey Lofthouse, a local beekeeper and a member of the Washington County Search and Rescue team, told the St. George News that 'bees will protect their home'. 'Both Africanized or European honeybees will protect their hives. The main difference is that the Africanized bees are more aggressive,' he added. Lofthouse said in the event of a swarm of bees, cover your head and neck as best as possible and vacate the area, preferably going indoors.","Jay Francis was watching a baseball game just outside of St. George .

"A sheep and cattle grazier is using her 32,000 hectare farm to help drought-stricken farmers get fit. Instead of using traditional equipment, Joy McClymont uses things lying around her 32,000-hectare farm to train her clients by using irrigation pipes as weights, swing truck springs in place of kettle bells, tyres to do push ups and the dam to run laps around. Then passes on her tips and tricks to her fitness program clients. Mother-of-four Joy McClymont lives out in Queensland's central west and started Off The Track Training . This is helping producers in Ms McClymont's region get their minds of the crippling drought which has gripped more than 70 per cent of Queensland. The former triathlete, who lives 100km from Longreach in the state's central west, told Woman's Day three-quarters of her clients were suffering from the dry conditions. She said the process of getting and keeping fit had been therapeutic. 'I tell them [my clients] their fitness is the one thing they can actually control and exercise will change the way they face the day. It tricks you - you feel like you're 10 kilograms lighter and bulletproof,' Ms McClymont said. 'For me, this has been sanity saving.' She wanted her clients to use equipment they already had their farm with spending a huge amount of money . This includes moon rocks as medicine balls (above) and irrigation pipes as weights . Ms McClymont used to be a competitive triathlon and qualified for an ironwoman competition . Ms McClymont said the idea of starting an outback fitness program that people could access online came after the birth of her first child with her husband, Paul. She now has four children aged from one to six years old. The former ironwoman qualifier found it was extremely difficult for her to get back on the horse after her pregnancy because of the remoteness of her home. 'I just wanted to do something to make it easier for people to look after their health and do something for themselves in tough times, especially when there's a drought,' Ms McClymont told Daily Mail Australia. 'It also makes it easier for them to manage their stress when their health is better.' That's when she started up Off The Track Training, which gives people living in rural areas access to all the benefits of a metropolitan personal trainer. Ms McClymont and her group of trained professionals provides tailored training programs, meal plans and nutritional advice to clients from the Northern Territory, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. They also get face-to-face time with Ms McClymont and her team when required as well as contact through Facebook or the phone. These programs can last from 50 days to 100 days depending on her clients' needs. She said this communication helped build a support network for those who are drought-stricken. 'When you live on a property, so much of your identity is tied to the place. When it doesn't perform well, people often have nothing else in their lives.' Ms McClymont recommends exercising outside to utilise the landscape and get fresh air into the body . This man is doing squats with a metal beam, which could be found on a farming property . Ms McClymont is helping those living in remote and rural areas to get their minds off the Queensland drought . Currently, more than 70 per cent of Queensland is suffering drought conditions and have been doing so for three years . Ms McClymont told Daily Mail Australia said she did not wanting her clients to spend more money on equipment they would not use. 'The idea is to get them to exercise on their property,' she said. 'I want them to use what they have, so they can be seriously sustainable and they're not spending buckets of money to exercise. 'People buy my programs but they buy the connection, the network... That is what is needed mostly, they need support to get them there.' Tyres are also a good way to exercise. Ms McClymont recommends running over them and using to do push ups . Ms McClymont also uses her 20-kilometre driveway as a running or cycling track to keep fit . She said her best pieces of gym equipment were an irrigation pipe, round moon rocks and a crowbar. Being out on a remote property, Ms McClymont has had to get creative with how she keeps fit. She uses her 20-kilometre as a cycling track, does sprint exercises on her airstrip and her dam to do laps. The mother also tries to incorporate training into her day-to-day activities. During mustering season, Ms McClymont opts to run from one gate to another instead of driving her ute.

"Stressed-out adults are shelling out thousands of dollars to unwind at the world's first preschool for grown ups. The unique New York-based program, known as Preschool Mastermind, was created by Brooklyn resident Michelle Joni, who holds weekly sessions in her apartment, where her adult attendees are able to finger paint, sing, snack and nap. And, despite the hefty price tag, the new concept has already attracted a variety of New York's professional elite, from photographers and authors to corporate lawyers, all of whom are eager to forget the stresses of their everyday life and spend some time connecting with their inner child. Young at heart: Michelle Joni's Preschool Mastermind offers adults the chance to act like children . Arts and crafts: The preschool's grown-up pupils are offered a variety of traditional activities, such as nap time, art class and slumber parties . 'It is totally surreal,' Michelle, who goes by the name of Miss Joni when with her 'pupils', said of the success of her preschool. 'At the first class we had a nap time and all the grown ups laid down with their blankets and cuddled up in a ball. 'I just looked around and thought this is absolutely crazy - I cannot believe this is happening right now. 'We do all sorts of activities from show-and-tell to dress-up; we also play with Play-Doh have snack and nap time. 'It really is a preschool for adults and everybody loves it.' The classes, which are priced between $333 and $999 for a month-long course, depending on what each adult is able to pay, have been taking place once a week throughout the month of March, and are scheduled during the evenings, so that any working adult participants are still able to attend, after completing a full day at the office. And, just like a traditional preschool, pupils get the chance to enjoy a class picture day, a slumber party and even a parents' evening where they can show off their work. 'It's amazing, we say ""It's snack time"" and everyone is like ""Yay, snack time"" - then its nap time and everybody cuddles up together in a ball,' Michelle added. 'They totally get into it – it's really great getting in there and making things with Play-Doh and loving it.' Interestingly, the adults who attend Michelle's classes confess that they feel no embarrassment about taking the opportunity to revert back to their childhood selves - and some even insist that the classes serve as a perfect way of inject more fun into their lives. Put it all together: The classes are run by Michelle (pictured), who goes by the name of Miss Joni during school hours . Daring duo: Michelle (R) and her assistant Miss CanCan (L) both have a background in early child development . Tuneful melody: The preschool program also includes music lessons for participants . Lawyer Amanda Devereux, 33 is one such participant, and admitted that she attends the classes because they provide her with a forum in which she can try new things and experience some of the fun she used to enjoy as a child. 'I'm a litigator, I deal with securities litigation and complex commercial cases,' she explained. 'This is definitely a contrast from my job but I would like to think I'm a lot like I was when I was a child. 'I still like to have fun and try new things. 'My family are really into the idea and my work colleagues are not surprised I've taken the class. 'My mother just sent me a sweater for [my] class picture day with a note saying she used to pick out my clothes when I was four, so why not now?' Along with  lawyers from the corporate sector, the class also attracts mothers who want a break from their everyday obligations at home. Sarah Fader, 35, an author and mother-of-two, explained that attending the quirky preschool allows her to embrace her own inner child, after spending a day looking after the needs of her own children at home. 'Being a mom and taking care of children is very taxing,' she said. 'I wanted to get back to that feeling of freedom and childlike fun and wonder that I used to have. 'My children are seven and four and doing this grown up preschool reminds me of what it must be like as a child and helps me become a better parent.' Free and fun: Michelle believes that the classes serve as a form of therapy for the adults . Artistic expression: The adult attendees are even allowed to finger paint on the walls . Secret success: Michelle believes that each pupil at her preschool needs the chance to escape from their adult obligations . Preschool Mastermind creator Michelle believes that, for many of her participants, the classes serve as a form of therapy, allowing adults to deal with their real world problems from the point of view of their inner child. 'My hope is that everyone who participates in  Preschool Mastermind really comes out with a new sense of looking at the world with curiosity, with imagination and they are able to see things differently,' she said. 'Part of this is finding the secret to getting adults to get out of their normal routine and start playing more.' With parents day currently on the horizon, Michelle added that all of her pupils are being encouraged to bring along their own parents, or their friends and family members, to share with them everything that they have achieved during their classes. 'On parents day they will either have their parents or their friends here and they'll get to show off in a big show-and-tell showcase,' Michelle added. But while Michelle's classes have gone down a storm with her pupils, they have also, perhaps unsurprisingly, garnered some unwanted attention from prospective pupils who have misunderstood exactly what the classes are about. 'We have had some adults inquiring about changing diapers and if this is all about adult baby play - but that is not what this is,' Michelle explained. 'There is nothing sexual about this class it's just fun. 'There are some people that think this is a waste of time and a waste of money - they say they can finger paint on their own. 'To them I would say go and finger paint on your own – I hope you do. Freedom of expression: According to Michelle, the participants at her preschool are looking to find 'more magic in life' Select group: Michelle admitted that the classes have received some criticism, but added that she is aware her preschool program 'is not for everybody' 'It's fine that people criticise this – it's not for everybody. 'People come because they want to stop being so serious all the time and want to learn and have that fun come to them and they want to find more magic in life.' While the classes might seem like a bit of a folly for pupils, both Michelle, and her assistant Miss CanCan, boast an impressive background in early child development - and both have experience in preschool education. 'Something you may not know about me is that I have nearly half a degree in Early Childhood Education,' Michelle explains on her website. 'I wanted to be a preschool teacher for many years, so that is what I originally went to college for! I love preschoolers, and we connect on a serious level. 'But then I realized that career path meant being chained to a classroom and told that my butt can’t show… So I switched to Fashion Merchandising.' She adds: '[Miss CanCan] used to be a preschool teacher abroad and has fantastic insights, puns, a Master’s in Teaching, and imagination.' But despite her enthusiasm for the class and her pupils, Michelle remains realistic about how some people will view her grown up preschool. She added: 'For those of you who say this is a weird thing to do, I would say you are probably right.'","The New York-based preschool program is the brainchild of Brooklyn resident Michelle Joni .

The body of the female adult bottlenose, named Graze, was discovered in the Port River, north of Adelaide before Christmas last year, but was only examined this month by scientists. South Australian Museum senior research scientist Catherine Kemper said four shotgun pellets were found in the dolphin's body after she was found in the Barker Inlet area. 'It appears Graze did not die immediately after she was shot,' Ms Kemper told Daily Mail Australia. One of the four shotgun pellets was found on the deceased body of female adult bottlenose named Graze . Graze pictured a decade ago when she was first sighted in 1992 by a Whale and Dolphin Conservation group . 'She was emaciated, and there were signs of disease that may have been related to the shotgun pellets entering her body. 'We believe she died within weeks or even months. The shooting wasn't a primary cause of death but it was a secondary - something else followed after she was shot.' Dr Kemper said there had been about 10 dolphins discovered dead after being shot in Adelaide waters since 1998, despite all mammals are protected by law. 'We're more annoyed and concerned than sad,' Ms Kemper said. 'It's distressing to think someone would injure one and we don't know why they're doing it - either intentionally or accidentally but it's  animal cruelty because it's not really a nice thing to do. 'It's an illegal act. We're more concerned and we want to make sure people are obeying the law. 'I also understand that the local people have not been happy with it either so I suspect someone will make a report soon if they see anything suspicious.' South Australian Museum senior research scientist  Catherine Kemper (right) dissecting another dolphin . Ms Kemper said  it was animal cruelty for a dolphin to be shot with a gun . Whale and Dolphin Conservation group Dr Mike Bossley first sighted Graze in 1992 and had since followed her movements and monitored her behaviour ever since. 'It is clear that despite the implementation of the Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary in the area, these dolphins are still under threat,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is important that more resources are put into the sanctuary to improve its effectiveness.' Dr Bossley said when he first identified Graze, she had suffered a major wound across the top of her back  but fortunately, she survived and went on to have a number of calves. But this was not the first time a dolphin was killed by a shotgun in the local waters. Two dolphins were killed in the Barker Inlet in 1998 and the calf of one of these died shortly afterwards. The South Australian Museum has subsequently found shot gun pellets in dolphins collected in the Adelaide area on a number of occasions but the bodies were found just outside the sanctuary boundaries. Anyone who kills or wilfully injures a dolphin (stock image) could face up to $100,000 or two years in prison . The South Australian government introduced the sanctuary in 2005 to protect Adelaide's resident bottlenose dolphins, and introduced heavy fines for those who attack the animals. In South Australia, the maximum penalty for anyone who kills or wilfully injures a protected marine mammal could face a hefty fine of up to $100,000, or two years imprisonment. Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary manager Cristina Vicente told Daily Mail Australia these fines are issued under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. 'We would like to encourage anyone that may have information about the incident to contact us or the  police,' Ms Vicente said.","Scientists at the South Australian Museum conducted an autopsy on Graze the dolphin .

"Three men who smuggled more than 230lbs of cocaine hidden inside plastic bananas  have been jailed for a total of 59 years. Leonel Hernandez-Gonzalez, 37, Oscar Alberto Grisales-Cuervo, 46, and Daniel Valdes Jaramillo, 24, worked with Colombian drug lords to bring in cocaine worth £25million in a consignment of bananas, hiding the drugs among the real fruit. The three men, from London, were arrested after meeting at a Brixton cafe to exchange a 'treasure map' detailing where drugs were hidden in a warehouse in Kent. Drug smugglers: Daniel Valdes Jaramillo, 24, and Leonel Hernandez-Gonzalez, 37, have been found guilty of smuggling £25millions worth of cocaine into the UK hidden in plastic bananas . Had their scheme worked, the country could have been flooded with the illegal deadly drug, Southwark Crown Court was told. Prosecutor Ken Millett said: 'On 10 July last year following a lengthy, proactive investigation by officers from the Specialist Crime directorate at New Scotland Yard, officer found 100kg of high-grade cocaine at a banana warehouse ripening plant just off the A2 in Kent. 'Those bananas had been found in a pallet of a consignment of genuine bananas that had been sent on or about 21 June from Colombia.' More than 30 pallets of bananas were delivered to an industrial estate in Hartlip, near Sittingbourne, where father-of-one Jaramillo worked and received the drugs delivery. 'Police officers had been keeping Mr Jaramillo and others under observation and he was under observation. Jailed: Former butcher Oscar Grisales-Cuervo, of London, was jailed for 22 years . 'He had been seen meeting up with Mr Grisales Cuervo and Mr Hernandez Gonzalez,' said Mr Millett. Officers were watching as the bananas and drugs were dropped off at the warehouse and placed within the ripening room. Mr Millett continued: 'The drugs could not be recovered until a map of the location of the drugs could be obtained from the first two defendants [Grisales Cuervo and Hernandez Gonzalez. 'That treasure map was later sent from Colombia to Mr Grisales Cuervo and after he consignment had been delivered they met up with Mr Jaramillo at a cafe in Brixton where the details of where the drugs were to be found were handed over. 'As the men left the cafe on 10 July they were arrested by police officers, each were found in possession of a large quantity of mobile phones, including encrypted telephones. 'Later that night the officers found the consignment of drugs at until four hidden within the centre of a pallet which had specific identity markings on it,' he said. 'This consignment was part of a wider conspiracy to import large shipments of drugs into the United Kingdom using this and other methods of secretion.' The high-grade cocaine was 91 per cent pure and was to be cut with other substances before it reached street level where the purity can be as low as one to 15 per cent. The drugs had a wholesale value of up to £8m and a street value of £24.5m. 'The bananas were wrapped in a particular cling film and had been smeared with some kind of oil or grease or chemical to prevent detection by sniffer dogs,' said Mr Millett. 'The form of the cocaine imported, namely in plastic bananas, made it plain the sophisticated and ingenious method of just how it was brought into the country and therefore the levels of planning involved.' Christopher Whitehouse, for Grisales-Cuervo, said he was a man of 'modest means' who moved to the country 18 years ago. Fake fruit: The three men worked with Colombian drug lords to bring in cocaine worth £25million in a consignment of bananas, hiding the drugs among the real fruit. More than 30 pallets of bananas were delivered to an industrial estate in Hartlip, near Sittingbourne, where father-of-one Jaramillo worked and received the drugs delivery . He had been 'trying to make his way' in the country and had worked in restaurants and markets before setting up a 'legitimate' butchers. During his evidence Grisales Cuervo insisted he did not recognise the famous footie nicknames and protested he had no idea his Blackberry phone was encrypted. 'I'm not interested in football.... the matches of the Colombian team I might have seen some of them but it is not I'm a crazy fan and love football as such,' he told jurors. Other messages referred to needing to 'clean up the product' and advising to use commercial storage as a house would be 'too conspicuous'. The drugs had a wholesale value of up to £8m and a street value of £24.5m . Grisales-Cuervo codenamed cocaine 'panela' - an unprocessed brown sugar popular in Colombia and often sold in small blocks, it was said. The gang also stashed packs of cocaine in rolls of paper to be shipped into the country in an operation that had been going on for 'years'. He also claimed he sent messages about the bananas because he worried he would get in trouble with the authorities if the bananas rotted and attracted 'plagues'. Former butcher Grisales-Cuervo and fellow Colombian Hernandez-Gonzalez was convicted by a jury of importing the class A drug between January and July last year. Valdes Jaramillo pleaded guilty to the same offence before trial. Sentencing the trio Judge Juliet May said: 'The operation required trusted, informed and capable agents in the UK. 'On the evidence in the case suggests the defendants were very much performing to the direction of others, not masterminding the scheme but taking a key part in a scheme masterminded by others, very probably in Colombia. 'None of the men had wealthy lifestyles but Valdes Jaramillo said he expected a very significant payment.' She commended the work of police officers who worked hard to stop a smuggling ring. She said: 'The seizure was the culmination of a careful, committed police operation. 'In March 2014 they observed Hernandez-Gonzales handing £300,000 to a taxi driver who was later acquitted for his involvement, which was clearly proceeds from the operation. 'Hernandez-Gonzalez was the subject to police observation, and a probe was put in Grisales-Cuervo's car revealing the extent of his role in the conspiracy with the bananas. 'There clearly had been dummy runs at least, if not actual runs, and very significant imports would have continued had the police not stopped it.' She said Valdes Jaramillo played a 'very significant' liaison role with the Colombian cartel and played a 'leading role' in the UK operation. Hernandez-Gonzales organised the distribution networks in the UK while Grisales-Cuervo travelled out to Colombia in June to visit the cocaine factory and meet the bosses of the cartel face to face. Hernandez-Gonzalez, of Hounslow, and Grisales-Cuervo, of London, were found guilty after a trial and jailed for 22 years in jail. Valdes Jaramillo, of  Old Kent Road, who pleaded guilty at the first opportunity for being involved in the conspiracy was jailed for 15 years. Dressed in a striped blue shirt and blue suit, Grisales-Cuervo wiped away tears as he was being led out of court, while the blue suited Hernandez-Gonzalez sat impassive when he was being sentenced. Dressed in a blue polo shirt, Valdes Jaramillo hung his head as he was sentenced. There were sobs from their families in the public gallery as the three men were led away.","Men jailed after smuggling more than 230lbs of cocaine into the UK .

"If you're an Amazon customer in the UK your future online purchases could arrive at your home or office by drone. Frustrated with how long it is taking to get approval for its flying delivery service in the US, Amazon is said to have approached the British Government to launch a trial of the technology in Britain. Transport minister Robert Goodwill revealed the plans at a press conference for driverless cars and wider technologies earlier today. Amazon has approached the British Government about trialling its flying Amazon Prime Air service in the UK, transport minister Robert Goodwill has confirmed. One of its prototype delivery drones is pictured . ‘I had some people from Amazon coming to see me the other day; they want to replace van deliveries with drone deliveries, and they can’t do any trials in the US because they’re over-regulated,’ he said. ‘So my favourite word is deregulation, and we need to make sure that wherever you are in the world, and if you want to innovate and you want to invest in this sort of technology, come to the UK because we’re here to help you.' The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US last week approved Amazon’s plan to begin testing drones for online deliveries, though the e-commerce firm first made the request in July last year. But in the time it took to approve the use of its first-generation drone,  Amazon has developed a new version, which makes the ruling 'obsolete'. So the firm is setting its sights on foreign markets. The project, called Amazon Prime Air, was first revealed in a YouTube video in late 2013. The company is developing drones that can fly at speeds of 50 miles per hour (80 kph), operate autonomously and sense and avoid objects. Amazon’s Paul Misener wrote in a letter to the FAA in December: ‘Without approval of our testing in the United States, we will be forced to continue expanding our Prime Air R&D footprint abroad.’ Under US law, operating drones for commercial purposes is illegal, however it is allowed in the UK if permission is granted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The FAA is said to be currently reviewing its rules on drones, with new regulations expected to be announced in the near future. Amazon is developing aerial vehicles as part of Amazon Prime Air. The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds (2kg). About 86 per cent of Amazon's deliveries are five lbs or less, the company said. 'We believe customers will love it, and we are committed to making Prime Air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so,' Amazon has said. In the US, the flying of unmanned aircraft, including recreational drones, is banned above 400ft (122m). Any flight that takes place within five miles (8km) of an airport can also only occur once air traffic control has been notified. The UK’s CAA has laid out guidelines for drone users that specify that unmanned aircraft must always be flown within the ‘line of sight’ of the pilot, which it generally measures at 1,600ft (488m) horizontally and 400ft (122m) vertically. This remains a stumbling block for Amazon and other companies as it means they would only be able to deliver items within 1,600ft (488m) of their warehouses. So far, law enforcement of drone regulation breaches in the UK appear to have been relatively tolerant. Chief inspector Nick Aldworth, of the Metropolitan Police, told a House of Lords select committee on piloted aircraft systems that tourists had been caught flying drones in parts of central London, despite laws restricting use close to buildings and congested areas. ‘We have decided not to enforce the legislation that exists, even though they were in contravention of it, because it did not seem proportionate,’ he said. Chinese internet giant Alibaba is also currently carrying out its own private trials of drone technology for deliveries. A new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones. 'NoFlyZoneUK.org is the first site in the UK to introduce the vast benefits which the drone industry will inevitably bring,' says John Tansley, its Managing Director. 'In fact the service is intended to benefit the public, the drone industry and the UK Government. 'Our hope is that in allowing the public to request that their property become a no fly zone, then this will address the privacy concerns which have been mooted by the relevant authorities.' A new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones. An example of a map marking such zones is shown . The company will monitor and record drone traffic so its service can provide a 'rapid drone intercept solution' to prevent hostile incidents such as a terrorist attack. Mr Tansley, who has previously served in HM Forces and in the Metropolitan Police, believes the service will allow the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) industry to establish itself in the UK. 'As our database grows, it will help services such a Amazon’s Prime Air, DHL’s drone delivery service and Google’s Project Wing among others realistically get a foothold in the UK while simultaneously addressing current security and privacy concerns,' he added. NoFlyZoneUK.org will be able to monitor and track all drone, UAV, Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) and Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) flights and share this information with the public.","Transport minister Robert Goodwill confirmed Amazon asked for the trial .

"Two sisters from New Zealand may have started small, establishing their business from their father's shed, but are now experiencing big success after their beauty products were given the tick of approval by the Duchess of Cambridge. Trilogy's Certified Organic Rosehip Oil is said to be an essential in Kate's make up bag and the secret to her flawless skin and the 'Kate Effect' means the business' sales are soaring. The Duchess is understood to have discovered the product when it was gifted to her in a pack from Trilogy when she visited New Zealand last year. 'Kate continues to use rosehip oil in her daily skincare regime,' according to US Weekly. 'She loves the effect is has on her skin. [Her mother] Carole [Middleton] is also a fan.' Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge, who is seven months pregnant with her second child, is said to be a fan of Trilogy's £16.50 rosehip oil . The company was founded by Kiwi eco-conscious sisters Catherine de Groot and Sarah Gibbs in 2002, reportedly whilst they worked in their father's shed in Upper Hutt . At seven months pregnant, the soon-to-be mother-of-two is said to be embracing natural products and loves that the skincare line is made without any potentially harmful retanoids. Trilogy's international spokeswoman Lisa Wilson said the company was 'absolutely over the moon'. 'Celebrity endorsements of this scale can be transformational for a company,' she said. 'Especially for us, centred down here, it's really quite exceptional to think our product may have made it into the hands of the Duchess of Cambridge.' The company was founded by Kiwi eco-conscious sisters Catherine de Groot and Sarah Gibbs in 2002, reportedly whilst they worked in their father's shed in New Zealand's Upper Hutt. Gibbs was a chartered accountant and De Groot was a former beauty journalist at the time but they shared a vision to create a line of anti-aging products. Their innovative company was inspired by their discovery of the benefits of rosehip oil to correct fine lines, wrinkles, stretch marks and scars. As with anything that Kate is reported to be a fan of, the $21.95 oil has already sold out for Brits online at Boots.com and sales have also increased in the US. Kate's influence has already been felt by the company, with Trilogy's share price rising nine per cent to 82 cents the day the news broke. It is now well-proven that an endorsement from Kate Middleton can lead to a product selling out within minutes. When the Queen-to-be was photographed wearing the 'Roamer Day Dress' by Australian brand Zimmerman's at the Easter Show in Sydney in 2014, it quickly flew off the shelves . The Duchess Of Cambridge donned the knee-length summery frock - which retails for $495 - for the second time as she took in the Andy Murray game at Wimbledon in London three months later . A source told the magazine: 'Kate continues to use rosehip oil in her daily skincare regiment. She loves the effect is has on her skin. [Her mother] Carole [Middleton] is also a fan' This has now aptly become known as 'the Kate effect'. When the Queen-to-be was photographed wearing the 'Roamer Day Dress' by Australian brand Zimmerman's at the Easter Show in Sydney in 2014, it quickly flew off the shelves. 'The response that we had was immediate and it travelled from around the world. We had people we knew in all sorts of places contact us saying they had seen the coverage,' co-founder Nikki Zimmerman told Vogue. The brand first began in 1991 when the sisters sold their dresses at Paddington Markets in Sydney. The effect was again in full force when it took just eight minutes for a Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dress to sell out worldwide when she wore it in the Blue Mountains during the same Royal Tour. The Trilogy line is working perfectly for the mother who wants only the best for herself and her baby during her pregnancy. 'Kate is very cautious of products and treatments,' a source told US Weekly. 'Baby's health comes first. 'Kate continues to use rosehip oil in her daily skincare regiment. She loves the effect is has on her skin. [Her mother] Carole [Middleton] is also a fan.' The Kate effect strikes again? The oil has already sold out on Boots.com . The oil's description reads: 'Rosehip oil's potent natural actives make it highly effective for a variety of skin concerns including dehydrated and ageing skin. 'Trilogy's rosehip expertise ensures the finest quality oil with minimum 80 per cent essential fatty acids (omega 3 and 6) and fatty acid (omega 9) content. Independent clinical studies show it helps improve the appearance of scars, stretchmarks, fine lines and wrinkles.' Derived from the wild rose bushes that grow high in the Chilean Andes, where the altitude and pollutant-free environment produce the highest quality rosehips, the oil's benefits have been known by the indigenous population for hundreds of years. Not only is it rich in vitamin C and high in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, known to heal scar tissue, it's also a great source of retinoic acid, which studies show reduces the appearance of wrinkles and brightens skin. It has also been reported that Deborah Mitchell uses Rosehip Oil in her LIA therapy treatment that Kate loves. Models David Gandy, right, and Miranda Kerr have also praised the oil's skin-boosting properties . It is results like these that prompted Kate Middleton's facialist, Deborah Mitchell, to add rosehip oil to her signature LIA therapy treatment. 'Rosehip is perfect for all ages and skin types, including those with sensitive skin conditions like rosacea and acne. I add a drop to moisturiser to boost the results - Kate loves it because it gives skin a luminous glow,'  Deborah told the Daily Mail back in 2012. Models David Gandy and Miranda Kerr have also praised the oil. 'I put it on at night and I wake up glowing,' Miranda has said. The model loves it so much that she even created her own version for her Kora Organics skincare line. A spokesperson for the Duchess of Cambridge declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. Many brands are using the wonder ingredient in their products.

"Beyonce is set to take the coveted leading role in the latest version of A Star Is Born . It's the leading role that has crowned the career of some of Hollywood's finest actresses. And now Beyoncé is set to follow in the footsteps of Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand by taking the coveted part in the latest version of A Star Is Born. The film would provide Beyoncé, 33, with her biggest role yet, playing an unknown who rises to stardom as her famous husband's career spirals downwards. The movie will be directed by American Sniper actor Bradley Cooper, who is also expected to play the leading man. The female lead was first created by Janet Gaynor in the original 1937 version, appearing with Fredric March. The movie was remade in 1954 with James Mason and Garland – who, like Gaynor, was rewarded with a Best Actress Oscar nomination – and again in 1976 with Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. 'Beyoncé feels this could be her big Hollywood breakthrough,' says a movie insider. 'It's a role she has wanted for years. She's shown that she can act in Austin Powers: Goldmember, and held her own singing in Dreamgirls, but this is her chance to prove her dramatic range and maybe even win an Academy Award.' Hollywood studio Warner Bros has been trying to remake the film for years, negotiating with potential leading men including Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Will Smith and Christian Bale. But now Cooper, 40, fresh from his Oscar-nominated success in American Sniper, has come to the fore. He will first be appearing in the West End in May with his hit Broadway production of The Elephant Man. When that run ends, he will make his directorial debut with A Star Is Born, and he has named Beyoncé as his first choice for his leading lady. Negotiations are under way to finalise the deal. Scroll down for video . Beyoncé was previously signed to star in a remake of the movie in 2011 when Clint Eastwood planned to direct the action, but the project fell apart a year later when the singer became pregnant with her daughter Blue Ivy. 'I was looking forward to the production and the opportunity to work with Clint Eastwood,' she said after dropping out. 'For months we tried to co-ordinate our schedules to bring this remake to life, but it was just not possible.' A source close to the singer added: 'Beyoncé wants this role, and she's going to do everything she can to make it happen, but right now it's down to her agents and managers to hammer out a deal that works for her and the studio.' The singer's spokesman said: 'Beyoncé is looking to get back into films and thinks she can not only take on this role but bring something special to the part.' It has been six years since she appeared on the big screen. However, that film, Obsessed, was a disappointment at the box office.

"In the months before John Lennon was tragically gunned down outside The Dakota in New York City on December 8, 1980, by deranged killer Mark David Chapman, life for the ex Beatle and his bride Yoko Ono was full of 'unclouded happiness'. And those moments, during the creation of what would be their last album together, are captured in the collection of photographs of the couple, published for the first time in the book, Double Fantasy. The photographs were taken by Kishin Shinoyama, who has now written about them in a book by him and Yoko Ono, published by Taschen Books in multiple international editions. The touching and beautiful collection of never-before-seen photographs were shot while they were making their last album together: the Double Fantasy Album. Scroll down for video . Woman: John confided to the photographer who shot these pictures that he had been obsessed with alcohol, women and drugs until Yoko came into into his life . Double Fantasy, which won the Grammy award for album of the year, was a love story in song . Cozy: John and Yoko schmooze in the outdoor patio of a Manhattan restaurant. 'John couldn't go out anywhere while he was in the UK because of his fame,' writes Yoko. 'Coming to New York gave him freedom. I think this was the moment when he took off his armor.' Ironically, John was killed in front of the New York City apartments building behind the couple, where they lived . John and Yoko leave their apartment at The Dakota and head to Central Park across the street . The Beatles had broken up a decade before. John had embraced a new life he described as 'househusband' and he was now focused on creative, political and musical projects. The couple had made international news in 1969 with their Vietnam War protest, the Bed-In in Amsterdam and Montreal. The Double Fantasy album was going to be John's comeback at age forty, reflecting his personal growth in music and self that he attributed to Yoko, now 82, the first woman who told him that his previous lifestyle of wantonly pursuing women, alcohol and drugs was meaningless. Paul McCartney and John had finally resolved a bitter rift that dissolved when both men bonded over fatherhood and baking bread. They were once again 'good friends', McCartney told Jonathan Ross on his show last December. McCartney was one of three people that Yoko called when she returned home from the hospital that fateful night to say that John had not survived the five hollow-point bullets Mark David Chapman fired at the singer just outside their apartment at The Dakota, across the street from Central Park. 'It was just so horrific that you couldn't take it in – I couldn't take it in', McCartney said. 'Just for days, you just couldn't think that he was gone. It was just a huge shock and then I had to tell Linda and the kids. It was very difficult for everyone. That was like a really big shock, I think, in most people's lives. A bit like Kennedy there were certain moments like that.' Beautiful boy: John relaxing with son Sean Lennon at their Dakota apartment . Hanging out: The couple, in the New York living room, loved living in the city . At work: The couple worked intensely for over a month, recording 28 songs  - 14 of John's and 14 of Yoko's . The concept of Double Fantasy was a back-and-forth dialogue, a kind of musical conversation between them . George Harrison was deeply shocked by his bandmate's murder but had had little contact with him in the years prior to the murder. Broken up emotionally, Ringo Starr and his wife, Barbara Bach, immediately flew to New York to offer comfort to Yoko. 'They were two people in one,' Ringo said. Lennon was the unofficial leader of the Beatles, 'the cheeky wit and sardonic soul of the Beatles', Newsweek wrote in 2014. His death was the end of an era. Yoko remembers the last time the couple went into the studio together in 1978, the Hit Factory in New York. Yoko introduces the collection of photos in the book. 'When John and I decided to make the album Double Fantasy, breaking a five-year silence, we wondered whom we should ask to take the photographs. As the two of us thought about it, suddenly the face of Kishin Shinoyama came to mind. 'I said, ""For once, I'd really like to have a Japanese photographer."" John quickly agreed, saying, ""Right, that sounds good."" I never expected that ""for once"" would turn out to be the last album John and I made together, and that ""for once"" would live on forever'. Kishin Shinoyama remembers that last recording session: 'I checked in at the Hotel Lexington, and by early afternoon I was down the street at the door of The Hit Factory on West 48th Street, the recording studio where John and Yoko were working on the final parts of the record, inserting choruses and other additional layers of sounds. 'The two had been working intensely for over a month, recording 28 songs — 14 of John's and 14 of Yoko's. The concept of Double Fantasy was a back-and-forth dialogue, a kind of musical conversation between them. 'As I entered the studio, the atmosphere was of creativity and concentration. Yoko greeted me and immediatelyintroduced me to John. He was slim and dressed all in black. His demeanor was very sweet, gentle . . . almost tender. He welcomed me warmly and then returned his attention to four backup singers, directing them as they laid down the chorus to a song he had written called ""Woman"". Chill: John was trying to clear away those feelings - of fame, of the past - in order to become a new person, says the photographer . 'Throughout the sessions, I noticed that John always spoke with the staff and the studio musicians in a quiet, clear manner, remaining calm and focused, despite the seemingly endless days and nights of work. Overall, there was a feeling of both relief and exhaustion in the air, a sense that this important and cathartic project was finally nearing completion'. While dining later at Mr Chow's, Kishin learned that he and John were both 40 years old.John revealed 'he was at a turning point, that he wanted to forget everything that had come before and start again', Kishin writes.'He was trying to clear away those feelings — of fame, of the past — in order to become a new person. 'He explained to me that without Yoko, he wouldn't be there now -  that the first part of his life he had been obsessed with alcohol and women and drugs, and that Yoko had been the first woman to tell him that what he was obsessed with was meaningless. 'He felt that those words had changed him, and this new album was going to celebrate that change'. A month after Kishin returned to Japan, John was shot and killed. 'I look back at these photos, so many years later, and I feel that I captured John and Yoko at their happiest moment. They were doing creative work, working on the album, recording together. And they were raising their son and loving each other and living a full life together,' Kishin offers. 'It was such a lucky time for me to be there, a moment of unclouded happiness for John and Yoko.'","Before John was murdered in 1980, his days with Yoko were captured on camera by noted photographer Kishin Shinoyama .

'I made the decision a long time ago that it would take a lot to commit to a long-term relationship or have children of my own because my pets mean the world to me. 'I had a girlfriend while I was at college and there's no doubt that that the reptiles were a key factor in the reason we split: she hated them! I've been single ever since. 'Occasionally there have been opportunities and nice people who have tried to flirt with me but I know they'd never understand my reptiles, or put up with sharing the bed with a lizard.' Wash: Mr Dixon puts his reptiles in the bath to ensure they are keeping clean . Feeding: Two of the animals munching on their greens in Mr Dixon's living room . Passion: The 24-year-old is pictured posing with some of his snakes, turtles and iguanas . As well as keeping animals in his bedroom, Mr Dixon can often be seen in his neighbourhood taking the reptiles for a walk. 'My iguanas live in my bedroom as that is the place I go to relax,' he said. 'I love having them in there with me because I can just lie on my bed and enjoy nature's wonderful creations. 'I also wash my reptiles in the bath because I love seeing them swim like crocodiles in the bathtub. 'In the summer months I take them outside for walks on leads and I'll let them climb the trees we have around us. 'At present I have four iguanas, a chameleon, one leopard tortoise, four tarantulas and two Costa Rican zebras.' Mr Dixon works with vets around Cheshire to rescue abused reptiles, then nurses them back to health at his home before either adopting them as pets or giving them away to caring new owners. Menagerie: The professional animal rescuer has multiple tanks in his house to keep the animals in . Outside: A reptile plays around in a special 'run' located in Mr Dixon's garden . Chilling out: Mr Dixon watches television accompanied by a pet turtle . He added: 'Over the years, I've lived with a huge number of reptiles, some I bought, some I have rehomed and some I have rescued myself. 'At one time I had 32 lizards including bearded dragons, water dragons, chameleons, leopard geckos, fat-tailed geckos and a golden gecko. 'I also had around 17 snakes comprising of corn snakes, rat snakes, king snakes, three boa pythons, a rainbow python and a Colombian python. 'Are they dangerous? Yes. Can they bite? Well, anything with a mouth can bite, even people, so it really doesn't bother me.' Iguanas and monitor lizards are renowned for being highly territorial and for taking up a large amount of space, but this does not faze Mr Dixon. Hands-on: Mr Dixon has been passionate about reptiles since he was just a child . Danger: These photographs show the gory bites Mr Dixon has sustained from his beloved animals . He said: 'Their frustrations can be taken out on the owner so of course they can be dangerous. 'They can inflict serious bites but, in my experience, bites are never given without some kind of warning. The problem is recognising the warning signs. 'What I like about reptiles is that they're difference from your usual household pets. 'I love seeing a full repertoire of natural behaviour. An Iguana head-bobbing, for example, is majestic and almost dragon-like in appearance. 'I learn new things every day. I've seen at least 15 different communicational head-bobs from my big male iguana, Albus.' He added: 'My auntie was rescuing and rehabilitating Iguanas for as long as I can remember and much of what I learned came from her. 'Sometimes my big male iguana will even come up and sit on my knee and defeat the laws of his very nature. There is nothing more rewarding than that. 'And at least they never nag me to do the washing up.'","Shaun Dixon helps to rescue abandoned lizards, snakes and spiders .

"Mount Everest towers over Nepal and although many people dream of scaling its summit, there are beautifully remote villages, farms and monasteries nestled within its huge shadow that are also worth a visit. Last year Google took its Street View cameras on a 10-day trek around the Khumbu region - also known as the Everest region - to explore these quaint landmarks and locations. During the trek the cameras captured the small Sherpa village of Thame, the Phortse Thakiri Chholing Gomba monastery and Khumjung inside the Sagarmatha National Park. Scroll down for video . Google recently took its Street View cameras on a 10-day trek around the Khumbu region - also known as the Everest region - (pictured) to explore the remote villages and landmarks of Nepal. During the trek the cameras captured the small Sherpa village of Thame, the Phortse Thakiri Chholing Gomba monastery and Khumjung inside the Sagarmatha National Park . The trek was led by Apa Sherpa, a 55-year-old Sherpa mountaineer  who holds the world record for reaching the summit of Mount Everest 21 times - more than any other person. He scaled the summit for the first time at the age of 30. In 2009, Apa founded the non-profit Apa Sherpa Foundation to help the local community of young people in the Khumbu region. The Street View images were captured in March 2014 when Apa took members of Google Earth Outreach, and the Nepalese nonprofit Story Cycle through the region. Mount Everest is the Earth's highest mountain, with a peak at 8,848 metres above sea level. In 1865, Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society upon a recommendation by Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India. Mr Waugh named the mountain after his predecessor in the post, Sir George Everest. It has become a mecca for climbers, and has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet. The southeast ridge was the route used by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay when they reached the summit for the first time in 1953. 'Our region is famous for being home to Everest, but it’s also the home of the Sherpa community and has been for centuries,' Apa said. 'The region has much more to offer than just the mountain. So last year, I guided the Google Maps team through my home region to collect Street View imagery that improves the map of our community. 'Now you can find Thame on the map and explore other communities nestled at the base of Everest, like Khumjung and Phortse.' Thame, and neighbouring upper Thame are small Sherpa villages in the Solukhumbu District of Nepal. Tenzing Norgay, one of the first people to climb Mount Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary grew up in the region and the Thame monastery is one of the oldest in Khumbu. Another village captured by the Street View trekkers was Khumjung. It sits 13,000ft (3,970 metres) above sea level near Mount Khumbila. It is located inside the word heritage site Sagarmatha National Park. 'When people ask what it feels like to reach the top of Mount Everest, I say ""heaven,""' added Apa. 'My hope is that my children and future generations have many choices for employment outside of mountaineering.' But the images don't just feature peaks and landscapes. Google also captured parts of the Phortse farming village in the Khumbu Valley including the Thakiri Chholing Gomba, or small monastery. Paintings inside the monastery began in 2008 by Buddhist artists and were completed by the end of 2009 using funding from the Greater Himalayas Foundation.

Google also captured parts of Phortse in the Khumbu Valley, including the Thakiri Chholing Gomba, or small monastery (pictured). The paintings on the monastery walls were started in 2008 by Buddhist artists using funding from the Greater Himalayas Foundation . 'Partnering with Google Maps allowed us to get important local landmarks on the map and share a richer view of Khumbu with the world, including local monasteries, lodges, schools and more, with some yaks along the way!,' continued Apa.

'Your online trip to my home awaits you on Google Maps. And if you ever get the chance to visit the Khumbu region in person, come stay at the Everest Summiteer Lodge that I built with my own hands. We’ll be ready to welcome you.' Everest is one of 14 mountain peaks on Earth that stand taller than 26,000ft (8,000m) and the local Nepalese name for it is Sagarmatha, which means 'mother of the universe.' Mount Everest is the tallest of these so-called ‘eight-thousanders’ and is the standard to which all other mountains are compared. All 14 of them are found in China, Pakistan or Nepal. Everest’s geological story began 40 million years ago when the Indian subcontinent began a slow-motion collision with Asia. The edges of the two continents were forced together and formed the tall ridges that make up the Himalayas today. Glaciers have chiselled Mount Everest’s summit into a huge, triangular pyramid, defined by three faces and three ridges that extend to the northeast, southeast, and northwest. The southeastern ridge is the most widely used climbing route. It is the one Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay followed in May 1953 when they became the first climbers to reach the summit and return safely. Despite its reputation as an extremely dangerous mountain, commercial guiding has done much to improve the safety of the Everest ascent. As of March 2012, there had been 5,656 successful ascents of Everest, although 223 people had died at fatality rate of 4 per cent. The satellite image was taken in December, just weeks after Nasa captured the rivers of black lava snaking over the snow-covered slopes of the stratovolcano Mount Etna in Sicily. In 2012, mountaineer and filmmaker David Breashears took 477 individual images to create gigapixel image of the Khumbu glacier from the Pumori viewpoint near Mount Everest.

"A dozen whales have died after they were stranded against a breakwater wall, while authorities hope to free five of the creatures who remain stuck. Early on Monday morning the Department of Parks and Wildlife were alerted to 22 long finned pilot whales who had become stranded in Bunbury, West Australia. Since then, 11 have died. Since then six have been rescued and 'herded out' by some small boats, a Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPAW) spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. However one of these whales has now become re-stranded. On Monday morning 22 long finned pilot whales were discovered stranded in Bunbury, West Australia . There are a number of other whales who still remain alive but stuck, with vets checking on the marine animals revealing they are in relatively good health considering the situation. These remaining whales are in slings, and the DPAW spokesperson said earlier on Monday they hoped the creatures can be moved by early afternoon local time. However one of the whales who was earlier released has become stuck again, and the same could happen with three others. 'This afternoon's efforts have focussed on the rescue of four remaining whales that were stranded in the shallows, and they were pulled out to sea using a sling and boats,' Department of Parks and Wildlife nature conservation leader Kim Williams said. 'Unfortunately one of these whales has re-stranded and is being taken out to deeper water again, while the other three are not swimming strongly and there is a chance they will also re-strand. 'There is another pod of 15 long-finned pilot whales that has been swimming in the area all day, and we are hoping the whales we released this afternoon will join them. 'We will continue our efforts to rescue the animals until nightfall, when it is no longer safe to do so, and we will re-assess the situation in the morning.' Eleven of them have since died, and six have been herded back out to sea by small boats . Tragically, some of the long finned pilot whales who died also suffered serious injuries. The moving waves had been pushing them up against the break wall, injuring the creatures and spilling blood into the shallow water. Strandings along the coastline are not unheard of in the area, with the largest in West Australian occurring in 1996. Of 320 long finned pilot whales became stuck in Dunsborough, about 78 kilometres south of Bunbury, all but 20 were rescued. A number of the creatures remain stranded but vets and authorities hold hopes for their survival .","A dozen long finned pilot whales have died in Bunbury, West Australia .

"Shooting: Officer Sara Berkey, 30, told a dispatcher that she had shot her ex-boyfriend Adam Jovicic, 29, of Cuyahoga Falls, at her Hiwood Avenue home . A policewoman was caught on tape during a harrowing 911 call as she described the moment she shot and killed her ex-boyfriend after he broke into her home. Officer Sara Berkey, 30, from Ohio was audibly distressed as she told a dispatcher that she had shot her ex-boyfriend Adam Jovicic, 29, of Cuyahoga Falls, at her Hiwood Avenue home. Berkey said: 'Hurry, hurry, my boyfriend just broke in and was beating me up and I shot him.' Scroll down for audio . Jovicic was taken to Akron City Hospital, where he died at about 5 a.m. Thursday from two gunshot wounds to the abdomen, according to the Summit County Medical Examiner. Investigators described the incident  as a home invasion case after Berkey called 911 and left the phone on. Throughout the seven-minute recording, obtained by the Northeast Ohio Media Group voices can be heard in the background. Berkey screams throughout the call. She can be heard yelling: 'I'm sorry' and 'No, please' throughout the recording. Meanwhile, a man's voice can be heard asking the woman if she wants to die and says 'I have nothing to live for.' Other parts of the recording are inaudible. Berkey was knocked unconscious and suffered other minor injuries, according to a Munroe Falls police report obtained by Cleveland.com . Jovicic, a former corrections officer at the Summit County Juvenile Detention Facility was likely drunk when he broke into her home, according to investigators. But reports suggested that officers were in the driveway when the shots were fired and Berkey can be heard later talking to them. Berkey, an officer since 2008 works in Kent city schools but has been placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated. She had an exemplary work record, according to her personnel file with several commendations from superiors for work she performed as a patrol officer. She had only just taken on a new position as the school resource officer at Kent Roosevelt High School. Munroe Falls Mayor Frank Larson  asked the Summit County Prosecutors Office to review their investigation. Victim: Adam Jovicic, 29, of Cuyahoga Falls, pictured, was taken to Akron City Hospital, where he died at about 5 a.m. Thursday from two gunshot wounds to the abdomen, according to the Summit County Medical Examiner . The prosecutors will decide whether Berkey will face criminal charges. However, Larson believes that she acted appropriately. He said: 'She did what she had to do. Everyone has a right to defend themselves. No one has a right to attack another person. You can only imagine what she's going through.'","Officer Sara Berkey, 30, shot her ex-boyfriend Adam Jovicic, 29, .

"While one husband only left his wife a farthing because she called him a 'rotten old pig', another man bequeathed £26,000 to Jesus Christ - but only if He could prove His identity. The bequests in these bizarre wills also include one from a father who wanted his step-daughter to receive the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages' after her late mother did not pay her for them. The team at genealogy firm Fraser and Fraser - based in Farringdon, central London - have spent almost half a century compiling a list of the strangest requests they have discovered on wills. Unusual: The strange wills include the 1888 document by boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence . 'Rotten old pig: Mr Orton, who only left one farthing to his wife, was born in 1818 and died in 1888, aged 70 . Bequest: Frank Smith, from Romsey, Hampshire, wrote in his will to leave all remaining possessions to his daughter if she did not continue living with her 'immoral husband' or allow him to benefit from the inheritance . Writing's on the will: Isaac Cooke from Surrey, who died in 1936, left everything to his wife, Alice. He wrote his entire will in a seven-verse rhyming poem. One section reads: 'To Alice Cooke my loving wife, for her to keep or use. Without reserve throughout her life, however she may choose' During that time the experts have dug up scores of unusual passages written on the legal declarations - before whittling these down to a top ten, which have now been revealed. Their discoveries include the 1888 will of boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence. They also found a 'beautifully written' seven-versed poem and a will revealing how a man left money to Christ, as long as He could prove His identity. In another will, 59-year-old Annie Langabeer wanted to give her brother-in-law two shillings and sixpence so he could 'buy a rope' because she wanted him to hang himself. Employees at the firm have looked through a staggering 200,000 wills since the late 1960s trying to trace people's family trees. They found one written in 2002 by Stephen Cuthbert, from Wiltshire, which included strict instructions that his estate paid for the 'p*** up' after his funeral. Money: The will of Kenneth Gibson, born in 1923 in Lincolnshire, who requested in 1999 that his step-daughter should get the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages that she claimed in my presence that her late mother Ann Cox had not paid her for' Wide-ranging: Sir Charles Stewart Henry Vane Tempest Stewart, the 7th Marquess of Londonderry, wrote his 55-page will in 1945. He was one of the richest men in the country at the time and had everything covered. He not only wanted his wife to have all of his animals, but also 'the natural increase of animals' too . Romantic: Richard Walker wrote his will in 1981 and decided to leave the majority of his wealth, £10,000, to the 'love of his life', Miss Miss Gay Varasporn Suwanahong - who he met in a bar in Thailand. She could only receive the sum when she turned 21. Mr Walker, from Wolverhampton, died in Bangkok in 1982, aged 41 . Staff at Fraser and Fraser also stumbled across the will of Frank Smith, from Romsey, Hampshire, who decided what to do with his £2,989 in December 1937. He asked to leave all of his remaining possessions to his daughter as long as she did not continue living with her 'immoral husband'. Mr Smith, who died in November 1942, said the money should go to the Exchequer if she disobeyed his request. Information from another will written in February 1999 found Kenneth Gibson, from Lincolnshire, included a peculiar request. He said his stepdaughter must be given the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages' after her late mother, Ann Cox, did not pay her for them. He died two months later in April, aged 75. The father's odd request was discovered by Neil Fraser, 39, a partner at Fraser and Fraser, while he was working on a case and trying to trace a family tree. Hanging request: The will of Annie Langabeer, from Sutton, Surrey, who died aged 59 in 1932. She wrote that her brother in law, Daniel Jones, should be paid two shillings and sixpence to enable him to purchase a rope . Choice: The will of Martin Turner, from January 1916. He was in the British Army and had the original surname of Tuchmann, which was stated in all records. But he requested everyone should call him, his heir heirs and children by the surname Turner only . A drink to say goodbye: The will of Stephen Cuthbert, from Wiltshire, who wrote his will in 2002 with strict instructions that his estate paid for the 'p*** up' after his funeral . Long process: The team at genealogy firm Fraser and Fraser - including partner Neil Fraser (above) - have spent almost half a century compiling a list of the strangest requests they have discovered on wills . He said: ‘Most of them are fairly old. Usually when we find the hilarious passages, we are all just researching people's next of kin and we suddenly stumble across something unusual. ‘Anyone can access the wills and they take two weeks to arrive from the Principal Registry of the Family Division. You can even apply for the Queen Mother's will or Princess Diana's. ‘We have looked through around 200,000 wills since 1969 and it's quite hard to spot the unusual lines because they are typically just one paragraph in a five page document. ‘But every now and again you will stumble across a funny line, paragraph or strange request which makes us laugh in the office.’ Mr Fraser, of Highgate, north London, added: ‘We can choose to leave everything we own to a charity, a next door neighbour or we can even leave it to a dog. I think there is always a place for humour in a will.’ 1. Annie Langabeer, from Sutton, Surrey, died in Epsom, aged 59 in 1932. She wrote in her will her brother in law, Daniel Jones, should be paid two shillings and sixpence to enable him to purchase a rope with the message 'though dead our spirits live'. 2. Isaac Cooke, from Surrey, wrote his will in 1935 and died in 1936. He left everything to his wife, Alice, and wrote his entire will in a seven-verse rhyming poem. One section reads: 'To Alice Cooke my loving wife, for her to keep or use. Without reserve throughout her life, however she may choose.' 3.

He wrote in his will to leave all remaining possessions to his daughter as long as she doesn't continue living with her 'immoral husband' or permit her husband to benefit from the inheritance. And if the daughter does not do this, everything will go to the Exchequer for the purposes of the state. 4. Albert Orton, 70, from Coventry, was born in 1818. He only left one farthing to his wife because he was disgusted at the treatment he received from her. The boot and shoe manufacturer said she called him a 'rotten old pig' because he broke wind. He died in 1888, aged 70. 5. A man left £26,000 to Jesus Christ, provided that his identity could be established. 6.

"Guests got their money's worth when a herd of elephants appeared out of the bush to drink out of a private swimming pool on the exclusive Phinda Private Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. More than 60 of the beautiful creatures decided to make use of the resort's pool, taking turns to drink from it three at a time. Rangers and visitors at the resort were treated to a very up-close view of the wild animals as specialist guide Mark Lautenbach snapped these amazing pictures. Scroll down for video . Guests got more than they had paid for when a herd of 60 elephants appeared out of the wild to drink from a private swimming pool . The pool is part of The Homestead, a resort on the exclusive Phinda Private Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa . Lautenbach, 30, who took the pictures on March 3, has been a guide at the resort for the past eight years. He said that the elephants had initially arrived to use a nearby waterhole, but soon turned their attention to the lodge. 'This morning after a rather quiet game drive I had breakfast with the guests and headed off to a rangers meeting in the south of the reserve,' he wrote online. 'The lodge I work at - The Homestead - has a beautiful open plan deck, small gym with two rooms on either side and a pool on the deck overlooking a small waterhole. 'While I was away something spectacular occurred and I was fortunate enough to return just in time to get some photos.' Although there is thick woodland surrounding the waterhole, several herds emerged to go to a nearby waterhole - which was all mud . The elephants had initially arrived to use a nearby waterhole, but soon turned their attention to the lodge and its sprawling pool . 'The view from the lodge is rather open with thick woodland beyond the waterhole, but at around 11 o'clock that morning a herd of elephants emerged from the woodlands and came to drink at the waterhole - a usual but privileged site for guests at Homestead,' he added. 'What we didn't expect was that right behind them another herd arrived, and then another and then another. 'They all went to the small waterhole which had now been depleted at a rapid rate and found there to be just mud. Elephants can drink up to 100 litres of water a day on average and its estimated that these herds drank about 6,000 litres in one sitting . 'Instead of moving off to find water elsewhere, they had a mud wallow then turned their attention to the lodge swimming pool. 'By the time I had arrived there were over 60 elephants all around the lodge drinking from the swimming pool two or three at a time. 'They did not have the decency to drink first before wallowing in the mud, turning the water muddy brown before finishing over half the pool water.' The herd spent over three hours drinking, wallowing and socialising around the lodge before disappearing back into the bush . Experienced guide Mark Lautenbach who has worked on the reserve for eight years, was on hand to photograph the amazing sight . 'Elephants can drink up to 100 litres of water a day on average,' Lautenbach explained. 'With easily over 60 elephants all helping themselves to the fresh blue waters of Homestead pool, they must have dank over 6,000 litres of water in one sitting.' Apparently, the elephant herds spent around three hours drinking, wallowing and socialising around the lodge before disappearing back into the bush. He said: 'I cannot say it was as if they were never here. 'It looked like a Thailand beach party after a full moon with piles of stinky, half-digested dung littered all over the front of the lodge and a few bucket scoops of dirty mud water at the bottom of the pool. 'The deck was splattered with mud and the grass flattened to the ground.'","Several herds of elephants made use of an exclusive resort pool on the Phinda Private Game Reserve .

"Motorists in Essex have been left bemused by 'Britain's most pointless lane' - a bizarre road layout which is not even long enough for the buses it was built for. Residents in North Stifford, Essex, say the 'pointless' bus lane on High Road - which at 50ft long is not big enough for a double-decker - should never have been built. The quirk in the road means cars and vans are forced  off a stretch of straight road and onto a narrow 'chicane-like' bend in order to avoid breaking the law. Residents in North Stifford, Essex, are asking why the 'pointless' bus lane on High Road (pictured) which is just 50ft long and is not long enough for a double-decker bus, was built. They claim it is a 'hazard' Every week thousands of drivers  have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled to come along the route each day. Following a series of accidents, the lane has now been branded a 'hazard' with motorists questioning what its purpose is. Emma Taylor, 24, a hairdresser from nearby Grays, spotted the strange road layout when she was driving at the weekend. She said: 'It really is bizarre. I drove through it on the way to my mum's house. 'I found it so strange that I actually had to turn back and have another look to make sure I was not seeing things. The quirk in the road means cars are forced onto a narrow 'chicane-like' bend in order to avoid the lane . 'The bus lane is so short that it is pointless and I nearly bashed the alloys on my Audi when I went around the traffic islands.' People living near to road say there have been a series of accidents which they believe have been caused by cars struggling to get through the narrow layout as they avoid the bus lane. Miss Taylor added: 'I understand why we need bus lanes and I think they are a good idea normally but this has to be the most pointless one in the country. Following a series of accidents the lane has been branded a 'hazard' by motorists who use it every day . 'I have shown pictures of it to my friends and they were all laughing and wondering what on earth its there for.' Another driver, who asked not to be named, said: 'There is no obvious reason why it is here. 'It's very narrow so I assume the highways bosses think it is slowing cars down but it's on a 30mph stretch of road here so it's not as if motorists are driving fast along here. 'I think it's more likely to cause accidents rather than prevent them. 'The bus drivers must find it very amusing as well.' A Thurrock Council spokesman said: 'At the time the bus lane was put in – in 2007 – the North Stifford village was suffering from HGVs using High Road as a short cut to and from the nearby A13 and especially when the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge and M25 southbound was jammed. 'High Road had and still has safety speed restricting tables across the road width and it also has a number of aging houses close to the road, this lead to residents suffering noise, dirt and major vibration problems. 'The installation of a bus gate of this type has effectively reduced HGV traffic while still allowing public transport access to and through the village. 'The council has received no complaints from villagers about this bus gate in recent years.' Thousands of drivers have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled .","Bizarre short bus lane in North Stifford, Essex, is just 50ft long .

"A mother has not eaten a meal for seven years due to a rare condition which left her stomach paralysed. Nicola Nichols, 25, from Bolton, was struck down by a 'mild case of man flu' in 2008. She has not been able to keep any food or drink down since and vomited up to 50 times every day. Initially doctors believed she had an eating disorder, before finally diagnosing her with gastroparesis. This is a condition in which the stomach muscles are paralysed, meaning food is not emptied properly. Scroll down for video . Nicola Nichols, 25, has to be fed through a tube directly into her bloodstream (left) as she was diagnosed has a rare condition meaning her stomach muscles are paralysed in 2008 (right) Mrs Nichols has not eaten food for seven years and gave birth to children William, three, and Felicity, 11 months despite not being able to eat during her pregnancy . Mrs Nichols has been told she will never eat again, but she says despite this, she feels lucky and her and her husband Ben, 27, call their children their 'two miracles' She is kept alive by a food and glucose bags that feeds directly into her blood stream, and a glucose bag that provides her with energy. She unable to eat anything at her wedding to IT worker Ben, 27, and has been told she will never eat again. Mrs Nichols said: 'I can't really stress just how mild this flu was - I called it man flu. 'My mum had flu at the same time but mine was only slightly different. 'But once I started vomiting, it is crippling pain and I haven't really stopped vomiting since. 'We always say that you take eating and drinking for granted until you can't do it. 'I still cook the kid's teas and it smells and looks great but if I even had a bite then I'd be in crippling pain.' The mother-of-two 'miracle' children was forced to jack in her new admin job after just three months to battle the debilitating illness. Her weight plummeted from nine stone to just seven and her attempts to regain weight by eating food caused her to regurgitate anything she consumed. Gastroparesis is a chronic condition in which the stomach is unable to empty in the normal way. Symptoms including feeling sick and vomiting when eating, bloating, loss of appetite and weight loss. The problem is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles controlling the emptying of the stomach. In many cases, the cause of this nerve damage is unknown but it can also be caused by poorly controlled diabetes. Other possible causes include Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and some medications. The condition cannot be cured but it can usually be controlled. Some people are able to manage the condition by changing their diet, for example by eating six small meals a day or by sticking to soft, easily digestible foods. In some cases, symptoms can be improved with medication but other people require injections of Botox into the valve between their stomach and small intestine. If all of these options fail, a patient can have a new procedure which involves fitting a pacemaker device to encourage the stomach to process food. If none of these options succeed in making the stomach process food, the patient will have to be fed through a tube. Source: NHS Choices . The condition meant at her wedding she could only look on as guests lapped up a feast of duck, beef and a rich chocolate cake for dessert. Mrs Nichols said: 'Imagine being sat at the top table at your wedding watching everyone tuck in to the wedding cake that you made and you can't have any. 'It was the same with the wedding breakfast and I just had to hold the glass of champagne for the toast, I couldn't even have a sip. 'Of course, it was a magical day but it was so difficult.' Mrs Nichols' problems began when she was 18. Her stomach stopped working after a bout of flu two years earlier, leaving her unable to keep any food or liquid down. She would vomit up to 50 times a day, but doctors suspected she had an eating disorder. Finally, in 2008 Mrs Nichols was diagnosed with gastroparesis, a condition in which there is a problem with nerves or stomach muscles, meaning it does not empty itself of food properly. It is caused by damage to the vagus nerve, which regulates the digestive system. When this nerve is damaged, the muscles in the stomach and intestines stop working, preventing food from moving through the digestive system properly. It is usually cause by diabetes, Parkinson's or as a complication of surgery, but sometimes there is no clear cause and sufferers report they  after coming down with flu, a virus, food poisoning or after taking antibiotics. Mrs Nichols was fitted with a gastro pacemaker, a metal device fitted in the abdomen to transmit electrical signals to the stomach muscles to get them working again. But the emergency measure failed and she suffered intestinal failure, where her bowel could not digest the foods and absorb the fluids necessary for her to live. She has to be fed directly into her bloodstream with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) - a specially made three-litre bag and pump that gives her nutrients for 12 hours every night. She has a food bag two days a week and a glucose bag five days a week, which both have to be stored between two and eight degrees. Mrs Nichols was struck down with mild flu in 2008, and after this vomited up to 50 times a day. She was unable to eat any of the food on her wedding day to partner Ben, an IT worker . A side effect of being fed through a tube is that Mrs Nichols' hair became thin and fell out, something she finds difficult . Mrs Nichols said: 'It has a real impact on your life because you can't make any last-minute decisions - everything has to be planned months in advance' 'You have to have the bag delivered there, the bag has to be stored in a fridge between two and eight degrees, everything has to be deep cleaned - sometimes it just really isn't worth it.' 'It's funny because it really restricts your life but, obviously, I wouldn't be here without it so it gives me life too.' The illness has left Mrs Nichols wheelchair-bound and she has had to watch her hair fall out, something she has found very difficult. She said: 'A side effect of the TPN is that your hair can get very thin and fall out. 'My hair came out in clumps and I lost the majority of it and poor William said it scared him, which broke my heart, so Ben chopped off all my long hair. 'It's awful for a woman to have to go through that - but after he did mine, he shaved his hair off too in support. 'He joked and said he didn't want me to wake up the next day and be the only baldie in the family.' And she was consigned to hospital for three months after becoming seriously ill with sepsis in September last year. Despite the chronic illness, she has managed to give birth to son William, three, and 11-month-old daughter Felicity. The two children were both born healthy despite their mother being unable to eat for two. Mrs Nichols said: 'I call them my two miracle babies - William was fed off my old tube and Felicity was fed by TPN. Mrs Nichols knows she will never eat 'real food' again, and her weight dropped from 9st to 7st . 'William knows it's different and will always say as soon as we meet anyway ""my mummy is fed by a tube"", which really breaks the ice. 'Felicity is just coming up to the age where she keeps grabbing the tube and that's not too helpful.' She adds that she feels 'luckier than most' because she was able to have children, and receives support from her family and from William's school. She said: 'We always say that someone else is always worse off. I'm lucky that I have two beautiful children despite my problem. My two miracles. 'William's school is great. I have only managed to do one school run since he started in September because I was too poorly and couldn't go in. 'But the staff at the nursery have been fantastic - they take photocopies of the work he does in the day and photos of him in class and they send them to me so I can keep up with what he gets up to, so even though I am not always with it, I have snippets in my mind. ‘On days I feel like I can't take it anymore, seeing his face lit up is all I need to keep going.'","Nicola Nichols, 25, suffered from a mild case of flu seven years ago .

"A company advertising a competition to win a £2,000 luxury holiday to Ireland have blundered by using a photo of a castle in Scotland. And the mistake has been met with anger by officials at popular tourist hotspot north of the border. The contest to win a trip to the Emerald Isle is being promoted with a picture of Eilean Donan Castle, which is in the western Highlands  and seen by many as one of Scotland's most famous castle. WomenFreebies.co.uk used a photo of Scottish Castle Eilean Donan to advertise a competition for Ireland . Unsurprisingly, the use of the Scottish castle advertising a holiday to Ireland didn't go down too well... The Eilean Donan Castle officials had some words of advice for the website WomenFreebies.co.uk . The image was posted to the Facebook page of WomenFreebies.co.uk with the caption 'Like if you'd love to visit Ireland'. The page has almost 800,000 followers and thousands liked the post, but eagle-eyed Scots spotted the gaffe and pointed out the mistake. Nikki Thompson, 63, of Ardrishaig in Argyll, said: 'I laughed to myself. I knew right away that it was the Eilean Donan - it's not in Ireland. 'It's obviously the wrong castle in the wrong place. 'If you are going to advertise a luxury holiday in Ireland, you should at least have a picture of Ireland, you would think. 'I actually messaged them but they never got back to me.' Eilean Donan Castle's website describes the site as 'one of the most iconic images of Scotland . The first fortified castle was built in the mid 13th century and stood guard over the lands of Kintail. And officials at the castle waded into the topic when they posted their own response on the competition page by writing: 'We are NOT impressed at all!!!'.

"Jailed: Juraj Orsula, 46, claimed he had been blinded by the sun when his red Mercedes Actros lorry crashed into the back of queuing traffic . A Slovakian lorry driver who killed three members of the same family and injured eight others after ploughing into the back of stationary traffic on a motorway has been jailed. Juraj Orsula, 46, claimed he had been blinded by the sun when his red Mercedes Actros lorry crashed into the back of queuing traffic, which had built up on the M26 in Kemsing, Kent, after two previous collisions earlier that morning. Helen Akande, 22, and her sister Mary, 16, both students from Sarcelles, France, died at the scene of the crash in April last year, while their father Michael, 54, died two weeks later in hospital as a result of his injuries. Three people in another vehicle suffered serious injuries, including a boy aged seven who suffered a severe brain injury, a boy aged three who had a broken leg and a 36-year-old man with a fractured skull and brain injury. Orsula, of Topolcany, Slovakia, pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court yesterday to three counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and three counts of causing serious injury while driving dangerously. He was jailed for six and a half years, and disqualified from driving for seven years. Crash: Traffic had built up on the M26 in Kemsing, Kent, after two previous collisions earlier that morning . Sentencing: Orsula pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) yesterday to three counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and three counts of causing serious injury while driving dangerously . Detective Constable David Holmes, from Kent Police, said: ‘The events of that day will linger long in the memory of those affected, some of whom will never fully recover from their injuries. ‘Juraj Orsula claims he was blinded by the sun in the moments leading up to the collision, which should have been reason enough to reduce his speed. ‘Instead he continued to drive as normal before crashing into stationary traffic and leaving a trail of devastation. He must now live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life.’ Mr Holmes added: 'Hopefully Orsula's sentencing will mark the start of the healing process for everyone affected by this devastating incident, and our thoughts are with them all today.'","Juraj Orsula claimed he was blinded by sun when he crashed on M26 .

"A man has been charged for abusing his girlfriend's dog after he was secretly filmed by a neighbor who couldn't bear the alleged cruelty. Ryan Francis Baker, 32, from Medford, Massachusetts, was arrested by police on 17 March after his neighbour handed over videos showing him throwing the 18-month-old pitbull around his back garden.

The neighbor who supplied the video clips to police, Ed Moyer, told Fox News Boston: 'To see a dog put through that, it was just so inhumane, you know. It was disturbing.' Moyer later told WCVB.com: 'I witnessed the abuse of this dog dozens of times. 'I can hear the dog yelping, screaming, crying uncontrollably. It's heartbreaking from 100 yards away, and she's in the house 10 yards away.' Baker's girlfriend, who has not been named, was unaware that Baker had been mercilessly abusing her pet.

"When Robin Rinaldi revealed the intimate details of her 5:2 marriage she drew gasps from married couples and staunch monogamists. For the author of The Wild Oats Project described how, for a year, she would spend weekdays sleeping with strangers and weekends with her husband of 17 years, Scott Mansfield. At the time, the dramatic move was a bid to save their relationship after Scott had a vasectomy, but now he's spoken out to say that he never wanted to see other people. Scroll down for video . In her new book Robin Rinaldi revealed that  she spent a year having sex with other people ultimately ending her marriage, now her husband Scott has revealed he wouldn't have ever chosen the experiment . While Robin has widely discussed their free-wheeling year, and explores it in a new book, The Wild Oats Project, Scott has kept quiet on the matter - until now, revealing that if he'd had his way the couple would never have entered into the '5:2' marriage in the first place. 'It wasn't something I wanted to do,' the brewer and wine-maker told The Times. 'I didn't like the idea of opening up our marriage. But if I didn't do it, I felt we were heading for divorce, so I thought why not take the chance and maybe we can come out the other side?' His premonition was correct a ultimately the decision led to the end of their marriage and Robin getting together with one of her lovers. Scott says that while he understood his wife's desire to experience sexual relationships with other people - he himself had enjoyed a promiscuous youth - he had always felt it might spell trouble for their marriage. And it seems the question of whether or not to have children had always been an issue for the couple with Scott  being firmly against the idea. Irretrievable: After Rinaldi's year of uninhibited encounters, she was unable to rekindle her loving marriage with Mansfield, and the two now have different partners . However, he defends himself in the new interview, revealing that he had always been honest with Robin about his desires and intentions. 'Is it cruel to not change your mind about something you believe in?' he said of fatherhood, 'I don't think Robin ever thought I was being cruel. At any point she could have left me and found somebody else to have a child with or I could have left her and found somebody who wasn't going to bother me about it.' During the course of the year-long experiment he revealed that he dated a handful of women, however, he only slept with one of them. Account: Rinaldi describes every step of the 'project' in intimate detail in her newly-released book, The Wild Oats Project . They had a six month relationship before he eventually called it off. And Scott says it was flattering to get attention from other women. He said: 'I enjoyed the feeling of being attracted to other women and getting good feedback. I had a couple of women who said to me: 'I can't believe your wife would risk losing you, you're such an awesome guy,' so when you hear that, you know, it makes you feel pretty good.' Today he's in a long term relationship with his girlfriend Renee Alexander, who he lives with and the former couple consider themselves at peace. In Robin's book she declares, 'I refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers.' But during her  year of promiscuity in 2008, she made up for lost time, sleeping with ten men and two women. Appearing on ITV's This Morning yesterday, Robin opened up about her unorthodox decision, which she says was triggered by her husband's vasectomy. 'I would say before the year I was in a somewhat inhibited but satisfied, normal loving relationship. 'But when I got into my early 40s my husband got a vasectomy and I knew the discussion of having a baby was over, which kick-started this experience.' 'I looked forward to my death bed and thought. ""What will I have?"" I won’t have children and grandchildren. Will I at least have lived fully?""' 'If I couldn’t have one I wanted the other,' she explained. 'Like a lot of women at that age I was hitting my confidence and sexual peak and suddenly realised very dramatically that I wasn’t going to have children. It was the perfect storm. 'I have had lots of people telling me I should have travelled the world, tried painting classes or cooking – but I already know how to cook!' 'WIld oats': Robin, 50, negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years, which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship . She also said having 'very little sexual variety' in her youth was a motivating factor, as the fact that she was living in San Francisco, which she described as 'a very liberal city'. 'I was also at a marital crisis and was thinking about trying a partial separation, ' she said. 'So I thought OK while we do that I need to sow some wild oats and let him do the same.' Under the terms of her new deal, Rinaldi took out an apartment, where she lived from Monday to Friday and would bed her conquests. But over the weekend she would go back to Mansfield, and the two would live as a married couple, without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart. 'The ground rules were safe sex, not to get seriously involved with anyone and to refrain from mutual acquaintances,' she explained. 'But at the end of the year, we each broke two rules.' To find willing participants in her project Robin decided not to pick up men at bars, but to be more strategic in her search. 'I was a very busy magazine editor working long hours and never in my life had I picked up a man at a bar or had a one night stand,' she explains. So I felt like going about it in a more clear-headed, conscious way.' Robin posted an online ad, entitled Good Girl Seeks Experience. In the post, she wrote: 'I'm a 44-year-old professional, educated, attractive woman in an open marriage, seeking single men age 35-50 to help me explore my sexuality.' 'I said I wanted to meet in public for dinner and drinks. I explained that if it led to sex then great, but that I couldn’t get seriously involved or see them more than a few times.' The next day, Robin had 23 offers. So would she advise it? ‘Not if you want to stay married,' she told This Morning hosts Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden. 'Read my book instead and have an armchair adventure.' 'I was well aware it would be very risky – but I didn’t think we had that much to lose. 'This 5:2 idea of weekends together and weekdays apart was to put a bit of distance between us to see each other in a new light and add some sparkle. 'That happened at first,' she said, but admitted their sexual exploits ended up pushing them apart. 'It was hard to put it all back in the box,' she explained. Robino said having 'very little sexual variety' in her youth was a motivating factor, as the fact that she was living in San Francisco, which she described as 'a very liberal city' Appearing on ITV's This Morning Robin Rinaldi, now 50, opened up about her unorthodox lifestyle . Robin, who made the life-changing decision to pursue sex with other people in 2008, has written a book about her exploits called The Wild Oats Project. In the book she describes her relationship with Mansfield as 'stuck in a rut', adding that 'our once-a-week sex life was loving, but lacked spontaneity and passion'. Recounting her exploits, Robin described her first encounter with a 40-year-old lawyer, whom she bedded in her apartment on the second date: 'We stumbled to the bed, where he turned me onto my hands and knees and took me from behind. 'We had intercourse twice and, after he left, I felt satiated.' She later moved on to much younger men, and described texting her husband goodnight from a Las Vegas hotel room moments after a 23-year-old paramour left the room. Two of her 12 encounters were with women, one of which was a threesome. Describing another encounter, she writes explicitly about taking a new-found pleasure in fellatio. Scott Mansfield has been gracious about his ex-wife, who has written about their open marriage experiment, seven years later. They are both in new relationships . However, after the raucous year, Rinaldi admitted, she could not turn back. Attempts to rekindle their marriage after the year failed - and Rinaldi began sleeping with one of the men from the past year, whom she refers to by a pseudonym. She wrote: 'The turning point was hearing from Alden. He sent me an e-mail, out of the blue, several months after the project had come to an end. 'Before long, we were having sex again. Being with him was exquisite. After reconnecting with Alden and falling deeply in love with him, there was no going back.' Scott was even happy with his ex-wife writing the book, detailing every aspect of their sex lives and her exploits with other men. Speaking to the Daily Beast about how he responded to the book, she said: 'His response was, ""You have to write it. If you write it well, it won’t really be about us, it will be about lots of marriages.""' Robin Rinaldi has found love again with one of the lovers she met on her year of sexual freedom .","'Good girl' writer Robin Rinaldi, 50, was with Scott Mansfield since 1990s .

But they said they were not aware of any blog he had kept. Local media reported that Babu had a Facebook page that contained the line 'Iamavijit', meaning he was a follower of Avijit Roy, the Bangladeshi-American blogger hacked to death  last month. Roy, a Bangladesh-born U.S. citizen, died after he was attacked on Dhaka University campus when he was leaving a book fair with his wife. The killing took place a month after a prominent Bangladeshi-American blogger Avijit Roy (pictured with his wife Rafida Ahmed), who is known for speaking out against  extremism, was hacked to death in Dhaka . The scene following the attack on the couple shows Ms Ahmed covered in blood. An obscure militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack it said was in retaliation for his 'crime against Islam' A previously unknown militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack. An Islamic extremist, Farabi Shafiur Rahman, was paraded in court earlier this month over the murder. The U.S. has sent a team of FBI investigators to Bangladesh to help probe the murder of the author of bestseller The Virus of Faith, who was visiting the city where he was born. The 43-year-old's family has accused Bangladeshi authorities of failing to do enough to protect him after he received death threats for his anti-religious writing. Islamic extremist Farabi Shafiur Rahman (centre) has been arrested and appeared in court over the murder of Avijit Roy, who was hacked to death with a machete in the middle of the street last month . Roy, the founder of the Mukto-Mona (free mind) blog, was born in Bangladesh to a family of scholars but moved to Atlanta, Georgia, around 15 years ago. He and his blogger wife Rafida Ahmed, who was also badly injured in the attack, were hauled off their rickshaw by two assailants in the attack. He was on his way back from a university book fair in Bangladesh when he was targeted on Thursday by at least two men over his opposition to religious extremism. They sliced his head with the long blades before turning on his wife, Rafida Ahmed, and cutting her finger off when she tried to save him.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"E-cigarettes, speciality beers and protein powder have been added to the typical basket of goods used to calculate inflation. Sweet potatoes also made it on to the list of commonly-bought products – while liver was re-introduced for the first time since 1999. The alterations reflect the changing shopping habits and lifestyles of the typical Briton, with 13 items added and eight removed by the Office for National Statistics this year. The Office for National Statistics revealed details of the items which will now be included in the 'basket of goods' to calculate inflation . The ONS yesterday revealed it had added e-cigarettes for the first time as the devices found popularity with smokers trying to quit. Rising demand for ‘craft’ beer made by micro-breweries has also led to the inclusion of the ales, while protein powder features on the list after the ONS found it was increasingly used by fitness fanatics. The food supplement is dissolved in drinks and is supposed to help the body recover after strenuous workouts. Statisticians added the ‘relatively new vegetable’ of sweet potato to reflect rising ‘interest’, and melons were added for the first time to widen the range of fruit being monitored. Chilled pizza has replaced the frozen version as shoppers increasingly ditch freezer food in favour of fresher alternatives. The data suggested that DIY habits are also changing, with coloured paints replacing white. Revealing a growing reliance on technology, phone chargers and covers and music streaming subscriptions such as Spotify were also added to the basket. Changes in the cost of craft beers and ales are included for the first time to reflect 'the increase in expenditure and shelf space devoted to speciality/real ales' Headphones, online gaming subscriptions and music streaming services like Spotify are also added to the basket . Changing fashions mean yoghurt drinks and sat-nav devices are no longer used to asses changes in the cost of living . Making their debut on the basket of 700 items were headphones – which can cost hundreds of pounds and have become a fashion accessory among teenagers – and online subscriptions for games console services. Although liver was re-introduced to represent ‘the market for offal’, officials said there had not been a particular rise in popularity of the food. Satnavs were axed as many cars now have built-in devices, while yoghurt drinks and lilies were also removed. Carnations, which are more commonly found in stores, survived the cull. The typical basket has radically changed since the figures were first collected in 1947. In the 1940s, it included an unskinned wild rabbit, a gallon of lamp oil and a table mangle for wringing out wet washing. Clothes included a ready-made three-piece suit, Oxford shoes, back-lacing corsets and seamless rayon hose. By the 1980s, these outmoded fashions had been replaced by tracksuits, trainers and jeans.","Office for National Statistics reveals our changing shopping habits .

'I was happy that those who were injured were getting plenty of immediate appropriate attention, and I heard at least one person identify themselves as a doctor, so although conflicted, I was okay with sticking to my role in documenting the event,' he told the site.

"British car-maker Jaguar has launched its new XF compact sports saloon in spectacular fashion with the world's first dramatic 'high-wire drive' over water on cables just an inch thick. In a stunt worthy of the latest Bond movie SPECTRE – for which the firm is supplying many of the cars – the new Jaguar XF was revealed during a dramatic 'high-wire' water crossing in the heart of London's business district. The feat took place high over the Royal Dock in London's Canary Wharf today. Scroll down for video . The new Jaguar XF compact sports saloon traverses the high-wire during its incredible unveiling in London today . The vehicle was driven across the wires by British stuntman Jim Dowdell, a veteran of action stunts in the Bond and Indiana Jones films . Dowdell drove the Jaguar XF 240m across a high-wire (pictured) to demonstrate its lightweight aluminium construction . Jaguar teamed up with expert stuntman Jim Dowdell – a veteran of dramatic action stunts in movies including the Bond and Bourne series, as well as Indiana Jones, to perform 'a world first high-wire water crossing' in the all-new aluminium-intensive Jaguar XF using wires just over an inch thick. Dowdell drove the all-new Jaguar XF 240metres across a high-wire to demonstrate the new XF's lightweight aluminium-intensive construction and agility. A Jaguar spokesman said: 'The dramatic drive across two 34mm-diameter wires suspended high above water, highlights the lightweight and agile credentials of the new XF.' The high-wire feat is also a fitting symbol for the sort of high-wire act Britain's Jaguar is performing for real to take on far bigger German rivals BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The company's new XF sport saloon promises 'business class' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines. It is being built at Jaguar Land Rover's Castle Bromwich factory in Birmingham. Following its high-wire reveal, it makes its official global debut at the New York motor show on April 1 before going on-sale from Autumn 2015. Jaguar says the new XF is 80kgs lighter than its closest competitor thanks to its aluminium-intensive construction. This has helped create fuel efficiency of more than 70mpg with CO2 emissions of 104g/km: 'This is the lowest CO2 emissions of any non-hybrid model in the segment.' Engines include a frugal new 2.0litre 163 horse-power Ingenium diesel to a 380 horse-power V6 supercharged petrol. Crew members help position the car on the wires during the lead-up to the stunt filmed in Canary Wharf today . A Jaguar weight was dangled beneath the vehicle to help keep its balance as it is driven over the River Thames . Jaguar says the new XF will deliver 'an unrivalled blend of refinement, fuel economy, dynamics and design' to the business car segment. The firm said: 'The next generation XF is completely new from the ground up and will be the second Jaguar model to use the brand's advanced aluminium-intensive architecture. The all-new XF will set new business segment benchmarks for weight and efficiency, resulting in class leading fuel economy figures of over 70mpg.' They added: 'The all-new XF retains its predecessor's core attributes but uses Jaguar's advanced aluminium-intensive architecture to elevate them to a completely new level'. Some 75 per cent of the new car's superstructure is made of aluminium, saving up to 190kg weight. This wide shot shows the vehicle driven across the river in the daring stunt performed today to launch the new vehicle . An assistant dangling by a harness is belayed over to the vehicle to remove its covers for the start of the stunt . Nearby traffic came to a standstill in the area this morning as workers stopped to gaze at the remarkable stunt . The proportions have also been tweaked. So although the new car is 7mm shorter and 3mm lower than the car it replaces, the new XF has a 51mm longer wheelbase – the gap between the wheels - which means more rear seat space with more legroom, knee-room and headroom. Powering the new cat, engines include 163 horse-power and 180 horse-power 2.0litre Ingenium diesel engines linked to six-speed manual-and eight-speed automatic gear-box transmissions. The manual four cylinder 163 horse-power diesel delivers C02 emissions of just 104g/km and is 'the lightest, most efficient non-hybrid diesel model in the segment' weighing 80kg less than its closest competitor. There is also a powerful 3.0litre 300 horse-power V6 twin-turbo diesel engine and a 3.0litre 380 horse-power V6 supercharged petrol engine. Jaguar says the lightweight body structure, electric power assisted steering, and specially tuned driving dynamics on the rear-wheel drive car help deliver 'the ideal balance between agility, comfort and refinement'. The Jaguar XF boasts a 3.0 litre, 300 horsepower engine diesel engine.

"Collectors of Diana mugs and Will and Kate plates get ready - the new royal baby is set to bring with it a new piece of collectible memorabilia. To mark the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child, a £5 coin will be issued to celebrate the occasion. The forthcoming royal baby - due mid to late April - will be fourth in line to the throne and is not expected to ever rule as monarch, but just like older brother Prince George the occasion will be marked with a commemorative coin. A commorative £5 coin has been issued to celebrate the birth of the second royal baby. A similar commission was made at the birth of Prince George (his coin pictured) The Queen, the baby's great-grandmother, approved the decision at a meeting of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on March 19. The coins are anticipated to be very popular as thousands of commemorative coins were struck to celebrate the arrival of George in July 2013 and sold out within days. The Royal Mint produced 10,000 solid silver crown-sized £5 coins, which cost £80 each, and 2,013 (equivalent to his birth year) 22 carat gold sovereigns, which cost £800 each. Both featured the prince's namesake St George. In July 2013 after the birth of Prince George 2013 coins were issued with those born on the same day entitled to a free 'lucky' silver coin . Babies born on the same day as George were also entitled to receive one of 2,013 free 'lucky' silver pennies. When George turned one, the occasion was also marked by a commemorative £5 coin - making him the first member of the royal family to have his first birthday honoured with a new UK coin. Only 7,500 of the sterling silver crowns were cut and feature the royal arms in a cross-form design. His christening was also marked with a coin, which was decorated with traditional lilies and cherubs. As well as his  birth coin Prince George also had a second £5 coin to mark his first birthday, above .","The £5 crown-sized coin will be released after baby's birth in April .

"Donna Oettinger and her baby Zaki died on a train track after the mother was told she couldn't getpsychiatric help, an inquest has heard . A mother cradling her three-year-old son lay down in front of a train after being told by her psychiatrist 'I can't help you', an inquest has heard. Donna Oettinger, 41, had been denied urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son Zaki died on train tracks in south London in March 2013, it was claimed. Just three months before her death, she took an overdose while visiting a friend in Yorkshire and was 'disappointed' to have survived, the inquest was told. A care worker treating the accounts assistant from Croydon in south London then told her family she needed 'urgent' home care on her discharge. Despite being promised this by mental health bosses, Ms Oettinger was then told the home team could not provide psychiatric help, the inquest heard. An inquest into the two deaths at Croydon Coroner's Court today heard her mother Carol Oettinger describe the family's battle to secure the right therapy for her daughter. She told the inquest her daughter went alone to visit friend Frances Felt in Yorkshire to 'work on her anxiety' in December 2012 but took an overdose. A day later she was seen by Paul Willison, a social worker in Rotherham, who recommended that she received 'intensive home therapy'. After agreeing to receive treatment and telling doctors she recognised the consequences of her behaviour, she was then deemed 'not treatable'. In a statement given to the inquest Mr Willison said he contacted health workers in Croydon with his concerns and said: '[They] said there was a home treatment team that covered Donna's locality.' However her mother told the court that on her daughter's return to London, a psychiatric nurse said this was not the case. Mrs Oettinger told the inquest: 'We said Donna had just come out of intensive care, Paul Willison had faxed his concerns through saying she needed urgent treatment. She said 'we didn't do urgent treatment here.' In desperation the family turned to her psychiatrist, Dr Hemanth Rao, but Mrs Oettinger added: 'Donna said she was unhappy to have survived her suicide attempt. 'I said to Dr Rao about Mr Willison's report... she was recommended home treatments, there was nothing in actual fact. Dr Rao said he couldn't help us.' Mrs Oettinger had starting suffering depression after going to Zaki's father, Mohammed El Shaer, in Egypt . Trainee psychologist Dr Hermanth Rao, said: 'Potentially any patient can benefit from home treatment. 'I don't really know how the home treatment team (HTT) works in Rotherham, there is a suggestion that there is some psychological treatment that they could give. 'However in Tamworth Road in London the HTT is not experienced in providing psychiatric therapy. 'In Rotherham they said the HTT is necessary because of the skills of the team, but the same may not be same in London. 'I also suspect that the HTT threshold in Rotherham might be much lower than in London.' Dr Rao said that a faxed note from Rotherham social worker Paul Willison had not been 'uploaded' to computer systems. In a statement the social worker told the inquest that he had advised Ms Oettinger was given home treatment and checked that it would be available in Croydon. After seeing Ms Oettinger on return from Yorkshire Dr Rao advised that she was assigned a 'care coordinator' to be provided through the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. However a miscommunication meant that the intended nurse, Elizabeth Oduntan, was not informed, the inquest heard. Ms Oettinger was seen by the nurse for an assessment on December 17, just days after her failed suicide bid. She admitted to Coroner that she had not checked the notes faxed by the Rotherham team. She said: 'It's not something I would usually do, but I can't remember why I didn't contact Rotherham.' When asked if she agreed she should have she replied 'yes, if I had the time.' Instead the nurse said it was a 'duty crisis' and her only objective was to make sure her patient was on the right medication. 'The immediate problem presented to me was how is she doing to be safe,' she told the inquest. The coroner highlighted that without contacting the doctors who treated her for her overdose she wouldn't have been able to give the correct advice, to which the nurse agreed. Shaheen Rahman, representing Ms Oettinger's family, said the nurse had done 'the very minimum' considering she was assessing someone who had just tried to kill themselves. As a result Ms Oettinger was not immediately referred to the HTT. She was admitted to A&E at the Mayday Hospital, Croydon, on January 17 after telling her sister that she wanted to end her life. It was not until then that Dr Rao finally made a recommendation that the nurse be assigned as her care coordinator. But he no longer had any contact with the family after mid-January as the trainee, on a six-month rotation scheme, left the clinic. The inquest heard how Ms Oettinger began suffering with severe anxiety after a period of cocaine use that came to an end in Spring 2012 when she went to see Zaki's Egyptian father, Mohammed El Shaer. But going clean left her terrified she had caused herself permanent harm and, through tears, Mrs Oettinger said: 'Donna was worried about her mental health, she had panic attacks and suffered with anxiety. 'She kept saying to me 'am I going to get better?' I said 'of course you are going to get better.' In September 2012, the family arranged to see a private psychiatrist who diagnosed an anxiety disorder, but they were told that they would have to wait up to 18 months for therapy sessions on the NHS. Her mother said: 'I wanted to take her to see somebody so there could be some reassurance that she hadn't damaged herself, that there were possibilities of her getting better.' Ms Oettinger was left to cope with the medication and suffered with side effects, but struggled at work as her illness affected her concentration. The mother and baby were seen lying on the tracks at Riddlesdown Station,  before their deaths . Her condition deteriorated to the point she had to leave work and could not look after her son properly, the inquest heard. 'She wanted to get better. I looked after Zaki, even though Donna was ill she would give him a kiss in the morning and at night when he went to bed,' her mother told the inquest. Then in October 2012 she began to make threats to kill herself. Her mother broke down as she gave a harrowing account of stopping her daughter throwing herself in front of a train after a trip to buy a coat for Zaki. She said: 'We got to the station and she said 'I'm going to throw myself under the next train.' We sat down and I had my legs over her to make her sit there. Zaki was in the pushchair.' The inquest heard how Ms Oettinger threatened to hurt herself on two other occasions with a knife and was referred to a specialist psychologist with the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust in October 2012. Ms Oettinger and her son were struck by a service from Uckfield to London Bridge on March 22, 2013. The inquest heard a harrowing account from train driver Patrick Cusak who spotted her jump onto tracks with Zaki as he neared the station, just yards from the home they shared with her mother in Croydon. They had walked to the station from their south London home. A police report said: 'There was nothing in her demeanour to suggest they are anything other than mother and son on their way to the station' In a statement the train driver said: 'She jumped down, I think she almost rolled over to cuddle the child. She had a gentle arm, a consoling arm around the child.' The pair were pronounced dead at the scene. A police investigation said the pair's final journey to the station was caught on CCTV and there was 'no doubt' anything had been dropped on tracks. A report said 'there was nothing in her demeanour to suggest they are anything other than mother and son on their way to the station.' The two-day inquest continues.

"The London Mayor said it would be 'fatal' for the Tories to give any suggestion of a fresh power-sharing deal . David Cameron should rule out coalition with any other party after the general election, according to Boris Johnson. The London Mayor suggests it would be 'fatal' for the Conservative Party to give any suggestion that it is in the market for a fresh power-sharing deal with the Liberal Democrats or another smaller party. 'We should say ""stuff coalition with anyone"",' Mr Johnson told the Daily Mail. 'We are there to win, we are there to offer leadership, we are there to be a Conservative government. 'If we go into this thing issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party, it would be absolutely fatal.' Asked whether the Prime Minister should rule out a second coalition altogether, Mr Johnson replied: 'Yes. Otherwise people don't know what they are voting for.' Lord Steel says there is no appetite among Liberal Democrats for another coalition – or among the two big parties. 'A lot of David Cameron's Tories want a Tory-only government, even if it's a minority one, and similarly on the Labour side,' the former Liberal leader told the BBC. 'I suspect – if you have to look into the crystal ball – that we're going to get a minority government which will have a multitude of minorities in the parliament, which is something new, and they'll be able to play one off against the other.' He said the most that Lib Dems would countenance in another hung parliament would be a 'confidence and supply deal', where they agreed to support a larger party in key votes but did not enter a formal coalition or take ministerial jobs. He also said that his party needed to 'recharge its values'. Mr Johnson, who is Mr Cameron's chief leadership rival, criticised the fixed-term parliaments legislation introduced by the coalition – suggesting it should be repealed. 'The sooner it expires, the better. I always thought it was some bit of Lib Dem nonsense,' he said. 'Constitutionally the thing we need to address is the rank injustice that it takes so many thousands more votes to elect a Conservative rather than Labour MP. It's an absolute scandal.' Former Conservative minister Sir Alan Duncan has led the calls for a cross-party deal to repeal fixed-term legislation, branding it a 'recipe for political horse-trading and coalition manoeuvrings'. Labour's Jack Straw and Tory Kenneth Clarke support the move. Critics say five years is too long, risking a 'zombie parliament' in the final year. Few appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change, which was introduced to ensure one of the coalition parties could not walk out on the other and prompt an election. Boris Johnson - considered Mr Cameron's main rival for the Tory leadership - said he should rule out any coalition deal after the election . It means prime ministers no longer have the power to go to the Queen to ask her to call an election when opinion polls are favourable. Instead, they need to win the support of a 'supermajority' of two thirds of MPs for an election to be held at any time outside of a five-year fixed period. This means the leader of a minority administration would never be able to go to the polls without the backing of his or her opponents. The only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no-confidence. But other parties then have a two-week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held. A new coalition could therefore take power without an election. Critics say the legislation is a recipe for never-ending power-sharing.","David Cameron should rule out a coalition and govern alone, Johnson says .

"An opulent riverboat dedicated to the Habsburg dynasty's only female ruler is undergoing its final touches just days before it sets sail on its maiden voyage from the Netherlands. Uniworld’s newest luxury passenger vessel, the S.S. Maria Theresa, is being billed as its most majestic ship to date, but members of the media and public won't be able to step foot on it until its first viewing in Amsterdam tomorrow. Two days later, the 150-passenger boat will carry holidaymakers for the first time as it embarks on a 10-day journey from Amsterdam to Antwerp, Belgium, with each guest paying more than £2,500 for the entire trip. Scroll down for videos . The S.S. Maria Theresa's grand lobby features an enormous oil painting of the Habsburg dynasty's only female ruler . Designed by the Red Carnation Hotel Collection, the S.S. Maria Theresa boasts 64 staterooms and 11 suites, including the 410-square foot royal suite. Its smallest staterooms are just over 160 square feet. Guests will enjoy extravagant amenities on board the 443ft vessel, as all of the Baroque-inspired ship's luxury accommodations have fabric wall coverings, plush carpets, antique furnishings and original art. Canopy or four-poster  Savoir beds are another lavish touch, while open-air French balconies on the main and upper decks offer panoramic water views. The grand lobby features a 10-ft oil painting of Maria Theresa, whose 40-year reign ended with her death in 1780. When they’re not in their rooms or above deck passengers can unwind in full-service bars, a restaurant or cinema. The riverboat also has a heated swimming pool, spa, and coffee bar, and guests are treated to in-room butler services. Princess Anita von Hohenberg, a direct descendant of the Habsburg dynasty, will be on hand for the christening of the vessel. Her father, Franz Ferdinand, Duke of Hohenberg, was a grandson of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, an heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian Empire's throne. His assassination in 1914 is widely acknowledged to have sparked the outbreak of the First World War. Staterooms inside the 150-passenger boat feature tasselled shades, chic linens and pillows, and specially-made English Savoir beds . Throughout the vessel, including this reception room, elaborate interior decorations feature Baroque styles and velvet upholstery . The S.S. Maria Theresa's maiden voyage, departing on Saturday, is being called a 'tulips and windmills' tour, as guests will take in some of the Netherlands' iconic sights. Using a network of canals and rivers, the vessel will stop in Hoorn, Nijmegen, Rotterdam and Veer in the Netherlands before calling at Ghent and Antwerp in Belgium. For the inaugural cruise, prices start from £2,504 per person. To upgrade to the royal suite, it will cost an additional £3,175 per person. The year’s most expensive cruise on the S.S. Maria Theresa, a 15-day journey from Budapest to Amsterdam, starts at £4,688 per person, with an additional £2,560 required to secure the royal suite. Much like the public spaces, the suites and staterooms are decorated in a colour scheme that includes royal blue, white and gold . The S.S. Maria Theresa has 64 staterooms in two categories; the smallest staterooms are 162 square feet in size . Kathryn Beadle, Uniworld's managing director for the UK, said in a statement: 'We are thrilled to have Princess Anita von Hohenberg as the godmother of our newest super ship, the S.S. Maria Theresa. 'There is no one more deserving of this honour than the direct descendent of Maria Theresa herself, who ruled for 40 years over an extraordinary and far-reaching empire. 'Guests travelling aboard this magnificent ship will visit sites of historical interest throughout the former Habsburg Empire for a true immersion into Europe's vivid history, whilst enjoying fantastic luxury, comfort and service on board our newest vessel.'","Uniworld is set to unveil its newest luxury 150-passenger boat, a tribute to Maria Theresa .

"It was just over two months ago that McDonald's released an advertisement stating it 'will never be kale'. But it seems the fast food giant may be having a change of heart regarding the trendy super food, with a new report suggesting that McDonald's plans to introduce kale to its menu soon. Janney Capital Markets restaurant analysts wrote that 'one of our industry sources indicates that McDonald's U.S. plans to roll out kale as an ingredient in its restaurants at some point in the not-too-distant future.' Scroll down for video . McHipster? Despite running this ad just weeks ago, it's been reported that McDonald's will begin to offer kale on its menu in the near future . Janney analyst Mark Kalinowski told CNN the move could mean kale salads and even smoothies may be on the horizon and said the company's goal is to appear healthier or of a higher quality. 'McDonald's clearly aims to raise consumers' perception of the quality of its food. Adding kale to the menu in some way could help be a step in this direction,' he wrote. However, McDonald's stayed mum when questioned about the superfood, telling CNN, in part: 'we're always looking at new and different ingredients.' Either way, don't expect your future Big Macs to be piled with the curly greens. Six weeks ago, the fast food mega chain debuted a commercial in which the words 'WILL NEVER BE KALE' appeared in block letters over the signature burger's lettuce layer. The news comes after McDonald's on Monday vowed to remake itself as a 'modern, progressive burger company' after aggressive competition from Chipotle, Chick-fil-A and myriad 'better burger' chains bit into U.S. restaurant sales last month. February ended the run of former Chief Executive Don Thompson. His short tenure included 2014, when falling profit, revenue and traffic resulted in one of McDonald's worst years in decades. Steve Easterbrook, a McDonald's insider who led two UK-based restaurant chains before returning to the company in 2013, took the helm at the Golden Arches on March 1. Leafy: The trendy vegetable would likely be offered in the form of salads and smoothies, say analysts . Moving on up: Reports of the new McMenu item come just after the company's announced intention Monday to become a more 'modern, progressive burger company' The company that virtually invented fast food has struggled to find the right recipe to meet diners' growing appetite for healthier, fresher food. In his first big move as CEO, Easterbrook last week announced that McDonald's USA will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics. The policy, which will affect McNuggets and other products sold in its roughly 14,000 U.S. stores, will put McDonald's more in step with Chipotle and Chick-fil-A. McDonald's shares were up 0.8 percent at $97.90 at midday. The stock is up about 10 percent since Easterbrook's promotion was announced in late January. Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months dropped a steeper-than-expected 4 percent in February, contributing to the 1.7 percent decline in global sales for the month. Analysts, on average, had expected a 0.7 percent fall for the United States and a 0.3 percent drop worldwide, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. February sales results from Europe were slightly better than expected, but the unit that includes Asia continued to struggle with the after-effects of a supply chain scandal last year. McDonald's has been trimming complicated menus to speed up service; giving restaurant operators more control over aspects including regional food choices; testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with Chipotle, Subway and other popular restaurants; and tweaking advertising to emphasize 'Lovin,' a play on the company's ubiquitous 'I'm lovin' it' tagline. Still, one pension fund adviser on Monday renewed its call for McDonald's to shake up its board. 'Today's disappointing numbers underscore the widespread reforms McDonald's requires ... and these changes must go beyond new management to include refreshing its stale and insular board,' said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds that hold a small percentage of McDonald's shares.","A Big Mac ad that debuted in January pasted the words 'will never be kale' over the signature burger's lettuce .

"The United States has delivered 10 armoured but unarmed Humvees as part of its $75 million non-lethal military aid deal to Ukraine. Over the next month, a total of 230 of the vehicles is due to arrive in the troubled region to help Ukrainian forces prepare against further attacks from Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. The U.S. has already sent Ukrainian forces high-tech night-vision goggles, surveillance drones and secure communications systems as part of their commitment. Scroll down for video . The first of 230 armoured Humvees from the United States  is unloaded from a C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft . The heavily armoured vehicles form part of $75-million worth of non-lethal military aid to Ukraine from the US . The Humvees, pictured, are unarmed, but heavy machine guns can easily be fitted to the roof turrets . Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said: 'I have just personally seen - having been behind the wheel of the Humvee - that it is an extremely effective, extremely powerful, extremely good military vehicle which Ukrainian air forces, Ukrainian special divisions, the Ukrainian army are waiting for today.' He told Ukraine Today: 'And I as the president of Ukraine, as commander-in-chief, on behalf of the Ukrainian people, would like to thank to the United States of America for its comprehensive and firm position regarding the resolution of the conflict in the Donbass, for recognising Russia as an aggressor which annexed Crimea and which launched direct military aggression in particular areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.' So far, President Barack Obama has decided against equipping Ukraine with offensive military equipment, although the armoured Humvee vehicles donated to Ukraine have turrets which can be easily fitted with heavy machine guns. Fighting in the region has abated although there are some skirmishes still being reported. Although, President Obama has deployed A-10 Thunderbolt ground attack aircraft to Powidz airbase in western Poland. The four tank-killing aircraft are involved in a number of training missions until the weekend. Meanwhile, EU leaders will hold a summit with President Poroshenko in Kiev about the status of the Minsk ceasefire agreement. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, pictured, thanked the United States for the delivery . President Poroshenko said the Humvees were 'very powerful and extremely good military vehicles' President Poreshenko met with the flight crew, pictured,  and representatives of the US Embassy in Kiev . Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Yevhen Perebiynis said: 'We expect that the EU-Ukraine summit will take place on April 27.' European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk are expected to attend, as well as EU heads of state and government who wish to go, EU officials added. Trade issues will likely also be on the agenda, the officials said. The summit will be a chance for Poroshenko, who attended an EU summit in Brussels in February, to brief leaders on whether the Ukraine ceasefire deal is fully working and to shape the EU's decision on whether to extend or lift sanctions on Russia. EU leaders agreed last week that economic sanctions imposed on Russia will stay in place until a Ukraine peace deal is fully implemented, effectively extending them to the end of the year if need be. But they will still have to take a formal decision later on whether to extend economic sanctions on Russia expiring in July. Russia has always denied assertions by Ukraine, backed by the United States and the European Union, that it has been sending arms and troops across the border to support the pro-Moscow separatists. EU leaders will meet President Poroshenko, pictured, in a summit in Kiev next month to discuss the crisis . Despite the reduction in violence, innocent civilians are still being killed and injured as a result of the conflict. Three people were killed and six were injured after the bus they were travelling in struck a landmine in eastern Ukraine. The bus had been in the process of crossing from government to rebel-held territory. A local police official, Ilya Kyva, said the bus had been carrying about 20 passengers from Artemivsk, a government-held town north of the region's main city of Donetsk, to Horlivka, which is held by the separatists, about 22 miles away. The bus struck the land mine as it apparently tried to negotiate around a road block manned by government forces, Interfax quoted Kyva as saying. Kyva said the six injured people were 'in a serious condition'. So far, more than 6,000 people have died in the conflict which erupted last April.","Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko praised the new military hardware .

"Tim Esworthy, 66, from Colchester, was 'absolutely appalled' to find his private medical details had been sold . CASE 1: Pensioner who lost leg at work . Retired financial services manager Tim Esworthy was ‘absolutely appalled’ to find his private medical details had been sold. The 66-year-old lost his leg in a workplace accident 39 years ago and has a prosthetic limb. He said he had been targeted by cold callers selling products to ease joint pain, as well as receiving sales calls regarding solar panels, pensions and PPI claims up to eight times a day. He has also been hassled by scammers who tried to obtain his computer and bank details by claiming to be from companies like Microsoft. Mr Esworthy, who lives in Colchester with his wife Pauline, 63, said: ‘I’m absolutely appalled. ‘It is terrible – it shouldn’t happen. They know they can target vulnerable people because they have their medical information. ‘Whenever I have taken out any kind of insurance or bought any kind of warranty I have to declare my disability. Now I wonder if they got (my medical details) through that. ‘It is quite scary to think of where that information is ending up. It is like Big Brother – they are watching you.’ He said he received cold calls several times a day, some of which appeared to be targeted at him because of his mobility problem. ‘I’ve had people calling trying to sell me some syrup that was good for your joints,’ he said. ‘I said “I don’t want to know, don’t phone me again”, but she still phoned back several times. ‘We have had people call up more than once and say: “You’ve got a problem with your computer, just give us your details”. ‘Or “Do you have a standing charge on your bank account?” They said they would get my money back if I gave them all my bank details. ‘There must be plenty of people who fall for it. Especially if they are targeting people they know have medical problems.’ CASE 2: The gran targeted bystairlift salesmen . Grandmother Christine Lewis was on a list of people who have mobility problems obtained by the Mail and has been targeted by stairlift salesmen cold calling her. The 62-year-old is recovering from a brain haemorrhage she had 12 years ago and was formerly wheelchair-bound. She said it was ‘disgraceful’ her personal medical details had been sold and the companies responsible ‘ought to be prosecuted out the water’. Christine Lewis, who is recovering from a brain haemorrhage she had 12 years ago, was on a list of people who have mobility problems obtained by the Mail and has been targeted by stairlift salesmen cold calling her . She added: ‘If they’re selling that sort of information, the fact I’m disabled, surely that breaches my rights. ‘It’s disgraceful. It’s illegal so why are they getting away with it? ‘They shouldn’t have my information, especially if they know I’m disabled because they are targeting me because they think I’m vulnerable. ‘If people are selling lists with me name on that explains why I get so many (cold calls). ‘I’m a strong person but there are a lot of people who are frightened of all this. My neighbour is more vulnerable and she believes all these calls.’ Mrs Lewis receives an average of two cold calls a day but sometimes as many as eight. She also receives calls and texts to her mobile phone. ‘I’m sick of them,’ she said. ‘Sometimes they get nasty with me. It’s non-stop - I end up losing my temper. ‘I’m quite laid-back but this really winds me up. I have felt like unplugging my phone but then they win and I do need to use it. ‘I’m not as disabled as I was but it can be difficult getting to the phone. It is always at an inconvenient time. They call as early as 8am and I’ve had calls as late as 9.30pm. It really infuriates me. ‘I get so many calls from abroad, you think: “How do you know my details?” ‘I find it so intrusive. It is coming into your home and interrupting your day.’ CASE 3: The couple plagued by 20 calls a day . Former builder Mic Foley and his wife Sylvia were harassed by 20 or more calls a day from salesmen and scammers which caused so much stress Mrs Foley had to visit a doctor. Former builder Mr Foley, 56, has difficulty walking due to ill health and was on a list of people with mobility problems obtained by the Mail. The couple, from rural Suffolk, have even received calls from medicine sales representatives who said they ‘were aware’ that someone in the house had a medical problem. They believe Mr Foley’s details could have been passed on by companies they bought disability aids from online. Grandmother Mrs Foley, 62, said: ‘It’s frightening. It is scary how much they know about you. ‘We were having about 20 calls a day. We have been getting calls and emails, they were mainly from scammers, asking for money. It is mainly people with foreign accents saying their name is David or John. ‘It really was horrendous. because we are in all day you don’t get away from it. They got me into such a state. ‘I was getting frightened. I was losing my temper over it and I was so stressed I went to the doctors. ‘But if you have got a disability and you live in a place like this you do buy things off the internet, so you are having to put your information out there all the time.’ The couple nearly lost thousands when they fell for scammers claiming to be from Microsoft who they allowed to take over their computer, but luckily they realised at the last minute and their bank suspended all their accounts. Mr Foley said he thought it was ‘crazy’ his details were being sold but he felt there was ‘nothing’ he could do. The couple have paid a company to block the cold calls but still receive ‘at least’ three a day.","Tim Esworthy, 66, has prosthetic limb after losing leg in workplace incident .

"A country song with a theme as old as time has some listeners up in arms - and some radio stations now refusing to put it on the airwaves. Little Big Town has a hit with their new tune Girl Crush, selling an impressive 25,000 copies a week, a song about a girl who wants to get back her man. That girl though is not afraid to admit she is a little bit jealous of her former man's new lady however, and some are now claiming the song 'promotes the gay agenda.' Scroll down for video . The song Girl Crush by Little Big Town (above) has been banned by some country stations after listeners complained it 'promotes the gay agenda' The problem it seems is with one of the verses sung by group member Karen Fairchild, in which she croons; 'I want to taste her lips, yeah cause they taste like you / I want to drown myself in a bottle of her perfume / I want her long blond hair, I want her magic touch / Yeah cause maybe then, you’d want me just as much. . . I got a girl crush.' And for this, a simple tale of jealousy, some stations are saying they are getting just as much outrage from listeners as when The Dixie Chicks criticized President Bush back in 2003. 'Is it frustrating to you that here is your song - that is one of the Top 10 sellers for weeks and weeks and weeks - and people on the radio are still afraid to play it because they think it’s a lesbian song?' radio host Bobby Bones asked the group during a recent interview according to The Washington Post. 'Just the fact that we’re still discussing that, number one, there’s so many problems with that whole issue,' answered Fairchild. Bones, who hosts the most popular country radio morning show in the country then said; 'It shouldn’t even matter if it’s a lesbian song, is the first thing.' This is not the case for listeners however, with one individual in Texas writing in to say to a station after they played the song; 'You are just promoting the gay agenda on your station and I am changing the channel and never listening to you ever again!!' Alana Lynn, who hosts a morning show in Boise, Idaho, says she got a similar response from some listeners. Kacey Musgraves (left) went through the same thing when her single Follow Your Arrow included a line about girls kissing girls, but Katy Perry topped the pop charts with I Kissed A Girl (right) Newcomer Kacey Musgraves dealt with the same problem from country radio when her song Follow Your Arrow, listed by some in the industry as one of the best songs of 2013, was shunned as it included the lyrics; 'Kiss lots of boys / Or kiss lots of girls / If that's something you're into.' Despite selling over 500,000 copies, the song never charted higher than 43 of the Billboard chart for country music radio airplay. This has never been a problem on the pop charts meanwhile, with Katy Perry finding herself atop the Billboard Hot 100 with her debut single I Kissed a Girl. Now, the group has actually filmed a spot that explains the song, with Fairchild saying; 'It’s about a girl saying, you know, ""Why do you love her and not me?""' The group did at least have their last song go to the top spot on the country charts and receive plenty of airplay - Day Drinking.","The song Girl Crush by Little Big Town has been banned by some country stations after listeners complained it 'promotes the gay agenda'

There are only 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones - a price-weighted average of the biggest stocks  - but for a long time Apple was excluded from the pile because its stock price was too high and there was worry it would distort the balance. Apple has finally been accepted to join America’s oldest and most prestigious stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average . However, following Apple's big stock split last summer, this is no longer a problem. The company increased the number of shares it had to reduce the unit price from around $645  to $91. Currently the price rests around $130. With Apple's entry AT&T will leave the Dow Jones. David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said there was no need to have two big telecom companies in the equation.

"Ukip's only Scottish MEP David Coburn is facing calls to resign . Nigel Farage is today at the centre of a political storm after refusing to condemn his party's only elected politician in Scotland for comparing an SNP minister to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza. The Ukip leader claimed that David Coburn's controversial remark was merely a 'joke in poor taste' and has rejected cross-party demands to kick the MEP out of the party. The Daily Mail told on Saturday how Mr Coburn, who is also bidding to become an MP in the General Election, said in conversation: 'Humza Yousaf, or as I call him, Abu Hamza.' Mr Yousaf, the Scottish Minister for Europe and International Development, last night said Mr Farage's response was 'pitiful' and challenged him to sack Mr Coburn. Mr Yousaf is now taking legal advice following the 'Islamophobic' slur, and will subsequently consider reporting the issue to the police. Scotland's party leaders and high-profile UK politicians have joined forces to condemn Mr Coburn. An online petition calling for Mr Coburn to resign has been launched, with nearly 300 signatures as of last night. In the wake of the controversy, the SNP has called on  David Cameron to rule out a post-election deal with Ukip. Mr Coburn, who has insisted his remark was made 'in jest', made the comment  during a telephone conversation with the Scottish Daily Mail last week, in which he spoke about his appearance on BBC Two show The Big Immigration Debate. He claimed that Mr Yousaf was supposed to appear on the programme, and said: 'Humza Yousaf, or as I call him, Abu Hamza, didn't seem to turn up.' Challenged by the Mail during the conversation, Mr Coburn said the remark was intended to be private. However, there had been no prior agreement that the discussion was off-the -record. Hook-handed Hamza was earlier this year given a life sentence by a New York judge for supporting terrorism. The hate cleric was convicted last May of multiple charges, including hostage-taking and plotting to set up a terror training camp in the US. The Scottish Daily Mail telephoned Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday to ask for his response to Mr Coburn's remark. He replied: 'I really haven't read them in full, to be honest with you, I've been busy doing other things.' Informed of what was said and told that Mr Yousaf has called for disciplinary action against Mr Coburn for making an 'Islamophobic' comment, Mr Farage replied: 'What, for telling a joke in poor taste?' He added: 'It looks to me like a joke. I haven't spoken to Mr Coburn at all, but I assume it's a joke in poor taste.' Pressed if he would suspend Mr Coburn, he said: 'No... come on, this is nonsense isn't it? 'The bloke has made a joke in poor taste is my interpretation of it. I think one should make jokes in good taste, not jokes in poor taste.' Asked again if he would take any action, Mr Farage said: 'Not right now. I have many other things on my plate, this is not top of my list. I don't deal with party discipline, I'm the political leader.' Nicola Sturgeon arrives at The Scottish Parliament with Humza Yousaf - described by Ukip's David Coburn as Abu Hamza . Mr Farage then ended the call. Ukip MEP for the East Midlands, Roger Helmer, also refused to condemn his colleague and wrote on Twitter: 'David Coburn makes a lighthearted remark, & the politically correct brigade go into overdrive. Grow up, guys.' Last night, Mr Yousaf said: 'Racism and Islamophobia are no laughing matter. 'This is a pitiful response from Mr Farage - at best it shows he doesn't have a clue of what's going on in his own party and at worst it indicates he doesn't see anything wrong in what Mr Coburn has said. 'Mr Coburn is not fit for public life and must be sacked by his leader.' The SNP minister said he is seeking legal advice on whether the remark may have broken laws on racial and religious hatred. Terror cleric Abu Hamza has been deported to the US . He added: 'It has been heartening to see the opposition parties condemn Mr Coburn's comments - and I have also been overwhelmed by the many messages of support and encouragement I have received from people across the country.' First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the slur was 'reprehensible'. Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said of the Ukip MEP: 'People across Scotland, including even those who voted for him, will now want to see the back of him.' Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives tweeted: 'Totally unacceptable. Our country is better than this. And he's got form. Mindless idiot.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie called Mr Coburn 'an offensive fool' while the Scottish Green Party has called for Mr Coburn's resignation. Asid Khan, president of Glasgow Central Mosque, said: 'David Coburn's unacceptable Islamophobia has no place in a tolerant, diverse Scotland. 'Muslims have spent years rightly distinguishing the true teachings of Islam against the actions of terrorists. For an elected member to refer to Humza Yousaf as a convicted extremist is beyond the pale. David Coburn's remarks have deeply insulted the entire Muslim community in Scotland.' Vicki Burns, of Show Racism the Red Card Scotland, said: 'Ukip claim that they are not a racist party, therefore they must treat the racist language and behaviour of their members seriously.' Mr Coburn was also criticised by former First Ministers Jack McConnell and Henry McLeish. However, Ukip's Scottish chairman, Arthur Misty Thackeray, claimed his colleague had made a 'slip of the tongue' and 'got a name wrong'. He said: 'I very often get referred to as Minty, which I believe is a character from EastEnders, but I don't take offence and run greeting to the papers about Mistyphobia.' Mr Coburn did not respond to a request for a comment. In an email to Mr Yousaf, headed Sincere Apology, he wrote: 'In reference to a private comment I made, reported to you by Alan Roden, I am very sorry that I have offended you as I clearly have. It was wrong to say what I did, even in jest, it was not something of which I am proud. 'Please accept my sincere apologies for the inference, it was wrong.'","MEP David Coburn's said he called the SNP's Humza Yousaf 'Abu Hamza'

Grown human beings acting like school girls over a five-year-old.’ Another, who goes by the username of 'Pheoma', tweeted: 'Five-year-old Kai signed autograph for fans on Sunday...

Following the match, the 29-year-old uploaded a picture of him and Kai before the game on Instagram, writing: ‘It was great to have my son Kai as mascot yesterday.’ It was a vital win for the home side who clung on to a two-point lead over Liverpool in fourth place, with the clubs set to face each other at Anfield on Sunday.","Kai was mascot for Manchester United in 3-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur .

"Authorities in eastern India have been left embarrassed after images of people scaling the walls of a school exam centre to pass notes to relatives were broadcast on national television. The images show dozens of people clinging to the windows of the four-storey building in the eastern state of Bihar, where more than 1.4million teenagers are sitting their leaving exams. Other images showed police officers and school staff doing nothing and simply standing by as people passed study aides to candidates inside examination centres. Scroll down for video . Relatives of those sitting exams inside a school scale the walls of the building in order to pass the students notes during their test . Cheating during school examinations in Bihar is widespread but local authorities have been left red-faced after the footage went viral . Many in India were left shocked after seeing the brazen cheating methods. Here a person is pictured handing a relative notes through a window . The students sitting the tests face tremendous pressure because they must pass the exams to continue their education. The images went viral on Twitter and made national headlines, but Bihar's education minister P. K. Shahi refused to accept any blame for the cheating. He said: 'You tell us what can the government do to stop cheating if parents and relatives are not ready to cooperate? Should the government give orders to shoot them?' Attempts to stop mass copying have often triggered violent protests. Students are sitting the Class 10 board examination amid widespread reports of mass copying and cheating across 1,200 schools. State authorities posted police at all schools where examinations were being held, 'but we can't use force to drive away the parents,' Mr Shahi said. He admitted to the media that holding 'free and fair exams' was a big challenge for the Bihar government and the situation was so bad that at least four to five people helped every student to cheat. In the last three days, more than 600 students caught cheating in the board examination have been expelled, while officials said over 1,000 students were caught cheating in examination in three subjects, including Mathematics and English. A woman sitting one of her school leaving exams checks notes on her lap which were passed to her inside the classroom . Another student refers to notes sitting on her lap as she sits the exam. The Class 10 board examination is a high pressure test as it determines if students are able to continue their studies . Lalkeshwar Prasad, chairman of the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), which is conducting the examination said: 'The students were expelled on charges of adopting unfair means.' It is not the first time that exam cheating has been exposed in Bihar - more than 1,600 students were disqualified in 2013 after similar videos emerged. Police also detained more than 100 adults for helping students cheat. Sriniwas Tiwari, secretary of the Bihar School Examination Board, said students caught cheating could be barred from taking the exam for up to three years, ordered to pay a fine or even sent to jail.","Remarkable Indian television footage shows dozens of people scaling walls to pass notes to students sitting exams .

"Right now, the Solar Impulse 2 plane, covered in 17,000 solar cells, is making its way around the world on a five-month trip to highlight the benefits of solar technology. But if you want to see a more everyday benefit of solar power, one company has an answer - a bag strap that harnesses the energy of the sun. Imaginatively called the Sun Strap, it uses flexible solar panels made from waterproof materials to allow you to charge your phone, or any other gadget with a USB port, while out and about. Scroll down for video . This bag strap allows you to charge your phone and any other gadget with a USB port - using the energy of the sun.  The Sun Strap is flexible solar panel made from weather and water proof material that can be attached to the strap of a bag . The £65.50 ($99) device was part of a successful Kickstarter project by Skajaquoda in Minnesota that raised £12,678 ($19,111) on the crowdfunding website. Weight: 5.8oz (165 grams) Size: 3” x 15” (7.6 x 38 cm) Battery: 5,600 mAh Lithium-ion . Outputs: 5V/1A . Input: 5V/1A . Compatible with: Apple, Samsung, HTC, Motorola, LG, GoPro and most others USB devices. As you walk around in the sun, the strap converts the sunlight into energy and charges an internal battery. That battery then charges anything connected to the USB or micro USB ports on the bottom of the device. When the device is fully charged on solar power it has enough energy to charge an an iPhone three and a half times or fully charge an iPad mini tablet. It can also be used as a camera strap to keep a camera charged even as it is being used. The lightweight device, weighing just 0.37lbs (165 grams), is designed to fit around any strap and can also be mounted to the frame of a bike to power electronics when on the move.

"A married couple and their friend have been killed in a car accident while on a 'trip of a lifetime' in New Zealand. Mitchell and Ruth Peterson, who had five children together, and grandmother Tammy Barnett from Richfield, Utah, were in an SUV when they turned into into the path of the truck outside the North Island city of Hamilton on Tuesday. Mrs Barnett's husband, Richard, was injured in the crash and was in a stable condition in Waikato Hospital on Thursday afternoon. The members of the Latter-Day Saints Church were visiting the branch in Hamilton, the New Zealand Herald reported. Tammy Barnett from Richfield, Utah, was killed when an SUV overturned near the city of Hamilton, in New Zealand, during a 'trip of a lifetime'. Her husband Richard (pictured) was injured in the crash and was in a stable condition in hospital on Thursday . Tragic: 'Devoted' parents Mitchell and Ruth Peterson, who had five children together, were also killed . They were travelling in a convoy with other tourists who witnessed the crash, and local police are now investigating. Their wrecked vehicle was discovered by an off-duty police officer who was on his way home. On Monday, when they touched down following a flight from Los Angeles, he wrote on Facebook: 'We made it to New Zealand. Wish I could say the same for our luggage. Or at least tammys.' Mr Barnett, who is an orthodontist in the town, and his late wife, have four children and four grandchildren together. Mr Peterson was a LDS in his ward and ran a visitor center. Richfield Mayor David Ogden told the Desert News: 'The whole valley has been affected by this. We all know them. They are so important in our lives, and so we are going to rally around the families.' A GoFundMe page set up in a bid to cover Mr Barnett's medical and Mrs Barnett's funeral costs read: Our dearest wife, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, grandmother and friend Tammy tragically left us while on the trip of a lifetime to New Zealand with her beloved husband Richard. 'Tammy had an incredible energy about her and will be sorely missed. We have the unique opportunity to make this time a little easier to bear. Family: Mr Barnett (left) is an orthodontist in the Utah town. The pair (pictured with their son Topher) were said to be well-known and respected within the community and were members of the Mormon church . Mr Barnett updated his Facebook status when they landed in New Zealand following a flight from Los Angeles. He is expected to be released from hospital this week . Couple: Mrs Barnett, pictured with her 'beloved' husband in 1980 was described as a woman who had an 'incredible energy' and will be sorely missed .

"Illinois Republican Rep. Aaron Schock, facing new pressure over lavish travel and redecorating expenses he charged to his official congressional budget, now says he's not sure if he broke any federal laws in the process. 'I ceratinly nope not,' he told an inside-the-beltway newspaper on Wednesday. 'I’m not an attorney.' The interview with Politico turnedconfrontational when a testy Schock insisted outside advisers would review his office accounts and determine what went wrong. 'That’s what we can all do, is our best effort,' Schock said. TROUBLE BREWING: Illinois Republican Rep. Aaron Schock is under fire for lavish office spending and potential accepting improper gifts, and now says 'I certainly hope' what he did was legal . DOWNTON OFFICE: Schock spent $40,000 in taxpayer funds redecorating his Capitol Hill office, but had to pay the money back . The litany of Schock's troubles seems to grow every week. First came the $40,000 in office expenses – later reimbursed after much public embarrassment – that Schock spent redecorating his office in over-the-top 'Downton Abbey' style. GEN Y: The buff, globe-trotting politician stated that he travels frequently throughout his district 'to stay connected with my constituents' and also travels to raise money for his campaign committee . 'Haters are gonna hate,' the 33-year-old Schock told ABC News as the scandals swirled, invoking Taylor Swift lyrics. Then news emerged that he had billed taxpayers for $10,000 in private jet travel including a November 2014 jaunt with staffers to see a Chicago Bears NFL game. The Associated Press identified another $40,000 worth of free air travel that Schock logged on aircraft belonging to his donors. Most recently he spent another $10,000 taking 10 staff members on a New York City trip when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in town. The congressional aides reportedly did hardly any official work, but they did attend a Global Citizen Festival concert featuring Jay-Z and Carrie Underwood. A political action committee associated with Schock, the GOP Generation Y Fund, spent $3,000 for the tickets. The same campaign fund paid a $1,440 invoice from a massage parlor it engaged for a fundraising event. Separately, Schock took his interns to a sold-out Katy Perry concert in Washington last June. He has also been accused of improperly accepting gifts without reporting them, another potential legal violation. Records show that those perks included dinners and presents during a 2011 London trip. He also hosted a 2014 fundraiser on a golf course without paying to use the facility. ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL? Schock and his entourage flew in an Eclipse 500 aircraft like this one to attend a November 2014 NFL game . The 33-year-old congressman later reimbursed the government $1,200 for the football trip . BEST BOSS EVER: Schock took his interns to a sold-out Katy Perry concert in Washington last June (pictured) Politico reported on Wednesday that Schock has hired two attorneys from the white-shoe law firm Jones Day – and a professional crisis communications firm – to help him wade through the legal and PR quicksand that now threatens to end his brief political career. He said he expects that he'll have to file changes to his spending reports. One of those will likely be a $3,245 expense for 'software' that turned out actually to be for the use of a plane by a software-company-owning donor. 'Well, I would say I take my compliance obligations seriously, Schock told Politico. 'So, to your point, you know, obviously there’s things that we’re going through and if there need to be amendments to my reports, there will be.' But has he taken gifts without filing the required paperwork to document them? 'I have not, uh – I would just leave it at that,' he said. He told reporters this week in a hastily called press conference that he has reached a 'point of reflection' about the scandals and vowed to change his ways, while acknowledging that at times that he may come across to his constituents as 'out of touch.' 'I have tried to balance being a young congressman and doing things differently ... with maintaining a level of seriousness on the issues of the day,' Schock said. 'I know some days I have failed at this.'","Interview with inside-the-beltway newspaper puts more pressure on Illinois Rep. Aaron Schock .

"Petty: Eldridge Dukes, 56, is facing attempted manslaughter charges after shooting his teen son in the buttocks in a fight over orange juice . Shots were fired at a Sunday morning breakfast after a father and son got into a fight when the orange juice ran out. Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, say 58-year-old Eldridge Dukes is facing a charge of attempted manslaughter after he confessed to shooting his 18-year-old son during the argument, according to The Advocate. Investigators say the squabble escalated when the victim broke a vase, and Dukes grabbed his handgun. They say Dukes chased the victim out of the house and down the street, firing at least three times. Police say the son was hit in the buttocks and suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Dukes was booked into the parish prison on counts of attempted manslaughter and illegal use of a dangerous weapon. Jail officials couldn't provide the name of a defense attorney to comment on the charges. Public records show Dukes was booked for the charges on March 22 and is being held on $60,000 bail .","Eldridge Dukes shot his 18-year-old son three times in the buttocks after an argument over orange juice at breakfast .

"The daughter of a man on trial for murder in the 1979 disappearance of six-year-old Etan Patz testified Monday about her father's unusual behavior in an effort to show that he is mentally ill. Becky Hernandez, speaking publicly for the first time about the murder case against her father, Pedro Hernandez, said she wasn't allowed out with friends as a youngster unless she had a written invitation and two weeks' notice — and her father held her hand crossing the street until she was 14. The 25-year-old described how he would clean their Maple Shade, New Jersey, home profusely, the court heard, and cook dinner starting at 2 a.m. — the same food every night: chicken, rice and beans. She said the case has caused a huge strain on her life - preventing her from getting a masters degree because the looming criminal proceedings meant 'she couldn't concentrate'. Harrowing testimony: Becky Hernandez (pictured arriving in court today) said her father Pedro (right), who has been accused of killing six-year-old Etan Patz, said she wasn't allowed to go out with friends unless she had a written invitation and he would hold her hand while crossing the street until she was 14 years old . The defense is trying to show Pedro Hernandez's 2012 confession to choking the boy is a delusion. She told the court her father was hours early for everything and would not allow her to be home alone. He would sleep for hours during the day, rarely socialized and insisted on sitting in the same church pew every Sunday, she testified. She also said he saw shadowy figures, a lady in white, and one time said he awoke to find a bald man choking him who then disappeared. She'd come home to find him talking to himself. But they didn't call the doctors. 'We knew he wasn't well, and we didn't want to hurt his feelings,' she said. 'You know how children sometimes believe in something? That's the type of response we had. My mom always taught me that what he sees and what he believes is not what we have to see.' Hernandez said stress over her father's case prevented her from getting a master's degree. 'I was studying and every single time I had to take a test there was something related to my dad,' she said, choking up.  'I couldn't concentrate.' She began crying when asked if she loved her father despite his behavior. Support: Pictured with her attorney Harvey Fishbein (left) and mother Rosemary (right), she told the New York court how she couldn't get a masters degree as a result of the case because she 'couldn't concentrate' 'He's protective because he loves me,' she said. '...It's the little things that show that he cares. And that's why I love him.' The defendant had no visible reaction as his daughter testified, but he smiled as she walked by during a break. Earlier, he turned around to wave and smile at his wife, who was sitting in the benches. Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon on cross-examination sought to show Hernandez was strict and abusive and that he still tries to control her from prison. Pedro Hernandez made a stunning confession in 2012 to choking Etan in the basement of a convenience store where he worked, after police questioned him on a tip. Over the years, he told a prayer circle, a neighbor and his ex-wife that he had harmed a child in New York. At least five people testified about what he said during the trial. Family: Stanley Patz, father of Etan Patz, and his daughter Shira Patz, left, arrive at Manhattan Supreme Court for another day of testimony . Etan vanished on his way to school on May 25, 1979. His disappearance helped galvanize the modern-day missing children's movement; his picture was one of the first to appear on a milk carton. Over the years, the case bounced around between detectives and units and from local police to federal agents and back. There's been no physical evidence. During his confession, Hernandez told detectives that he tossed the boy's bag up onto a freezer in the basement of the convenience store. 'If the freezer is still there, the book bag should be there,' Hernandez told detectives. But the shop was closed and cleared out in the early 1980s, its contents tossed, and it's not clear whether police were present at the time. No body was ever found. Hernandez's attorneys are trying to show that his 2012 confession (left) to choking Etan (right) following his disappearance in 1979 is a delusion .","Becky Hernandez, 25, described how her father Pedro was controlling .

"It has been the first port of call for aristocrats seeking reliable domestic staff for more than 125 years. The Prince of Wales and the Queen Mother are both believed to have recruited servants via the classified adverts section of The Lady. Less successful was the Duchess of York who once advertised for a dresser in Britain’s oldest lady’s weekly and appointed Jane Andrews, who was later jailed for murdering her boyfriend Tom Cressman. Scroll down for video . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured above with Prince George and their spaniel Lupo,  have placed a classified advert in The Lady for a housekeeper at their country home. The housekeeper will be based as the couple's Norfolk home Anmer Hall and the advert states that 'discretion and loyalty' will be paramount for the successful applicant . Now it seems that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have resorted to placing an advert for a new housekeeper at their country home, Anmer Hall, in the pages of the illustrious magazine. According to well-placed sources, the notice that appeared on the magazine’s online home page yesterday - and will today appear in print - seeking an ‘experienced housekeeper for a large family home in Norfolk’ is for the latest addition to William and Kate’s expanding domestic staff. The advert, which would have cost around £575 plus VAT to place, makes clear that they are looking for someone who is well versed in dealing with young children – as well as Prince George, who will turn two in July, the couple’s second baby is due later next month – and their excitable spaniel, Lupo. It reads: ‘Housekeeper sought for a large family home in Norfolk. We are looking for someone with previous housekeeping experience, ideally within a large private house, and preferably within a family environment with dogs.’ It says the successful applicant’s main duties will include: ‘cleaning all areas of the house to a high standard; caring for and maintaining the home owners’ clothing; cleaning silverware and glassware; purchasing groceries and general provisions for the house; and dealing with deliveries; assisting with childcare and caring for dogs.’ Unsurprisingly, the Cambridges are looking for someone who can fit into a royal household. ‘Discretion and loyalty is paramount,’ the advert reads, in addition to a valid UK driving licence. The couple are ideally looking for someone with experience in a large private house, and preferably within a family environment with dogs . Kate and William, pictured yesterday after leaving a service to mark the end of the conflict in Afghanistan, say that 'discretion and loyalty' is paramount for successful applicant . The new housekeeper will be required to work Monday to Friday, but must be flexible about working during the weekends. Intrudingly the annual salary on offer is not listed and applicants are invited to write in their ‘salary expectations’. It adds: ‘Self-contained accommodation will be provided (suitable for a couple). The partner may be offered ad hoc maintenance work, although there is no guaranteed work provided for them.’ Closing date for applications is Sunday April 5. The couple appear to have had some trouble in finding the right person to oversee their new ten-bedroom home on the Queen’s Sandringham estate and was given to them by the monarch as a wedding present. William and Kate have spent a small fortune renovating the Georgian pile to their exact taste – including the building of a new garden room with a glass ceiling so they can dine under the stars. The house already has its own swimming pool, tennis court and extensive grounds. The royal couple plan to move to Norfolk full time after their second child is born next month. Prince George, pictured above, is set to turn two in July . They had employed two of the Queen’s trusted employees, Amy Wood and her husband, Colin, to work at the mansion as housekeeper and gardener. They lived in a cottage in the grounds of the house with their five-year-old son. But earlier this month it emerged they had unexpectedly quit after less than five months to return to work for the Queen at Sandringham house, just two miles away. No reason has emerged for the move but it shocked locals who said: ‘It is the talk of the estate that they should be giving up their prestige jobs after such a short time. They appeared happy working there.’ The royal couple have been desperate to find a replacement as soon as possible as they plan to move to Norfolk full-time after their baby is born next month, coinciding with William’s new job as a pilot with East Anglia Air Ambulance. Now it seems they are placing their faith in The Lady. A spokesman for the magazine, first published in 1885, said yesterday: ‘I can't comment on any individual advertisement, but The Lady has been putting households and the very best domestic staff in touch for 130 years. ‘Princes use The Lady, paupers use The Lady, they've even used The Lady in Downton Abbey. I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if Mary Poppins herself called to place an ad.’ Kensington Palace declined to comment.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are adverting for a housekeeper .

"When James Corden was surprisingly chosen to host America’s top chat show, fans and critics alike wondered if the British star would flourish in such an unfamiliar role. Yet Corden’s first week in the hot-seat on CBS’s The Late Late Show has been so widely acclaimed that he is now being tipped as a front-runner to host the prestigious Golden Globes awards next year – the Hollywood party second only to the Oscars for star quality. ‘Out of nowhere, he’s suddenly a realistic contender for one of the most coveted awards-hosting jobs of the year,’ said a source close to the Globes. ‘He’s only been hosting The Late Late Show for a few days, but already Hollywood is sitting up and taking notice. Scroll down for video . Roaring success: James Corden's debut on The Late Late Show with Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks . ‘James has shown that he’s funny, can sing and dance, puts celebrities at their ease, and doesn’t dismiss stars with snark. ‘If he maintains this trajectory, he could find himself hosting the Globes – and that would really cement his position in Hollywood.’ Corden, 36, who made his name as co-writer and star of cult television sitcom Gavin and Stacey, has already proved his ability to host a major awards show by fronting the Brits for four years. If he took on the Globes, he would be following in the footsteps of fellow comedy actor Ricky Gervais, who hosted the ceremony from 2010 to 2012. Since Gervais stepped down, the awards have been co-hosted by American TV comedy stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Comfortable: ‘James has shown that he’s funny, can sing and dance, puts celebrities at their ease,' said a source. Pictured with Patricia Arqeutte and Chris Pine on his second night . A source within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which stages the Golden Globes, said: ‘Amy and Tina have finished their three-year contract and have stated that they won’t be back next year. ‘Right now, the field for a new Golden Globes host is wide open.’ Another insider said: ‘James Corden combines all the attributes of the ideal host. ‘He has enjoyed movie success this year, starring in Into The Woods with Meryl Streep, and of course he’s had TV success in Britain with his comedies. ‘He’s also won a Tony for his Broadway show One Man, Two Guvnors, and now he’s getting rave reviews in the States with The Late Late Show, giving him an international audience.’ While there are a string of chat show hosts who are better known in America, such as David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Ellen DeGeneres, none has Corden’s wide range of film, TV and stage success. Corden’s guests during his debut week included actors Tom Hanks, Mila Kunis, Will Ferrell, Chris Pine and Kevin Hart. Celebrities lined up for future shows include X Factor tycoon Simon Cowell, footballer David Beckham, chef Gordon Ramsay and actors Michael Douglas, Courteney Cox and Claire Danes. But not everyone might welcome Corden as the Globes host. He sparked controversy at the Brits in 2012 when he cut short Adele’s acceptance speech for winning the Best British Album after only 12 seconds, provoking a vulgar hand gesture from the angry singer. Theo Kingma, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, said: ‘We are exploring some very exciting possibilities regarding hosts.’ A spokesman for Corden declined to comment.","His first week on CBS’s The Late Late Show has been widely acclaimed .

"David Jubb, the artistic director of Battersea Arts Centre, said he was 'overwhelmed' by public generosity after a fire ripped through the Grade II listed building last night . The 'heartbroken' artistic director of Battersea Arts Centre said he was overwhelmed by public generosity after a fire ripped through the Grade II listed building last night. Donations began flooding in as soon as news broke that the 120-year-old arts building was on fire at just after 4.15pm yesterday, which engulfed the roof and destroyed the Grand Hall and Lower Hall. Nearly 1,000 people have now given money to an appeal set up by the charity National Funding Scheme which has raised more than £22,000 in just 24 hours. More than 80 firefighters battled to bring the blaze under control, some fighting the fire from above using aerial platform ladders. Billowing black smoke was seen for miles around the theatre while there were reports of people watching on in tears as flames engulfed the tower at the top of the centre, which then collapsed. London Fire Brigade were able to save half of the building, including the 'priceless' octagonal dome, and salvage artwork from the centre, while some crews remained at the scene yesterday damping down hot spots. The centre reopened parts of the building  undamaged by fire for performances last night. Battersea's artistic director David Jubb said: 'The most important thing' was that nobody was hurt in the fire. 'It's heartbreaking. But we will get through this. Brick by brick. 'Huge thanks are owed to all the emergency services, who literally saved the front half of the building, to staff, artists and volunteers at Battersea Arts Centre, and to everyone who has shown their overwhelming support online over the last 24 hours. 'The passion for the building and the organisation is extraordinary. Thank you all for being part of this. We really need you at this time.' The cause of the fire is unclear but investigators were continuing to sift through the ashes yesterday to look for clues. Station Manager Matt Burrows, who visited the scene, said: 'Firefighters did a great job to save large parts of the building including the octagonal dome which I'm told is priceless and salvaged valuable art work. 'The centre are hopeful that they will be able to open unaffected areas of the building to the public today. We'll continue to damp down and our fire investigators are inspecting the building to find the cause.' Scroll down for video . The aftermath: The remains of the Battersea Arts Centre in south London after a blaze ripped through the building last night, damaging half and destroying the 120-year-old structure's roof .

This incredible photo shows the flames of the inferno reaching up into the sky behind nearby homes who were warned to keep doors and windows closed against the smoke . Firefighters had advised people living and working nearby to keep doors and windows closed as a precaution after the fire broke out yesterday afternoon. By midnight on Friday, the fire service had scaled back the effort to four fire engines and around thirty firefighters who battled to get the fire under control. An ambulance service spokesman said crews had treated a woman for smoke inhalation at the scene but she had not required hospital treatment. Nicholas Bennett, a magistrate at nearby Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court, said yesterday that black smoke had been 'everywhere, engulfing the  area.' Rumours that the nearby Clapham Junction railway station had been evacuated were confirmed false by Network Rail but Lavender Hill was closed in both directions. Battersea Arts Centre had tweeted that yesterday's performance of Missing was cancelled due to the blaze. Fire destroyed the Grand Hall and Lower Hall but London Fire Brigade were able to save half of the building including the 'priceless' octagonal dome . Flames had engulfed the roof of the Grade II listed property which later collapsed into the theatre building which was surrounded by scaffolding . London Fire Brigade confirmed that half of the building was damaged by the fire with some parts being completely destroyed . 'Thank you to everyone for the kind words & well wishes,' a spokesman added. London Fire Brigade Station Manager John Snelgrove, who was at the scene said yesterday: 'This is a large, challenging fire and crews are working hard to bring it under control. We've got 12 fire engines at the scene, as well as an aerial appliance and an aerial ladder platform fighting the fire from above. 'Firefighters are working with a number of water jets around the building to contain the fire.' Twelve fire engines and around 80 firefighters were called to tackle the fire Battersea Arts Centre with two aerial appliances - similar to cherry pickers - used to fight the fire from above. At the outbreak of the blaze the Brigade's control officers took over fifty 999 calls from members of the public. Billowing black smoke could be seen for miles from the arts centre as the fire took hold, which needed almost 60 firefighters to try and tackle it . Officers make their way to the blaze in Lavender Hill which has now been shut in both directions as firefighters continue to battle the fire . The London Fire Brigade said that eight fire engines and more than 80 firefighters were dealing with arts centre blaze in Battersea . The arts centre had tweeted: 'There is a fire in our building. Everyone is out safe and the fire brigade are working hard to get the fire under control.' Comedian Paul Foxcroft, who saw the blaze, said: 'The first thing I saw when I came out of my house were several fire engines hurtling past, then I saw grey smoke in the sky. 'Crowds had started to gather. There were two ladies outside with tears in their eyes. I heard one saying 'Please save it' as more firemen arrived. 'It is an institution, not just for Battersea, but for the whole of the city of London. It is hugely popular so this fire will affect a lot of people. The back of the building was under renovation.' There was an outpouring of grief on Twitter as people expressed their horror yesterday at losing part of the Arts Centre. Dan Price tweeted: 'So sad. London Fire fighting bravely to save Battersea Arts. Everyone is out safely.' Senior Producer at the BAC Richard Dufty tweeted: 'Terrible news. Battersea Arts is on fire. The Grand Hall roof.' Tom Copley ‏said: 'Oh no! Battersea Arts, one of London's most wonderful theatres, is on fire. Hope that no one is hurt and that the building can be saved.' An ambulance service spokesman confirmed that crews had attended the scene but no-one was injured, while occupants nearby were warned to keep their windows closed against the billowing black smoke . The fire could be seen clearly from a nearby train station, sparking fears that Clapham Junction was being evacuated- the rumours were later confirmed as false . Fans of the centre also tweeted their support including James Phillips who tweeted about the 'tragic loss' of the building . Baylen Leonard wrote on Twitter: ' Awful news about fire at Battersea Arts Centre, one of the most innovative and forward thinking arts centres in UK.' Louise Allen-Jones posted: ' Devastated to hear Battersea Arts Centre is on fire. Love that building so much.' One twitter user said: 'Tower on the top of Battersea Arts Centre has just collapsed. People in tears. Police moving people back.' James Phillips added: 'The Battersea Arts Centre fire is apparently contained but large parts of the Grand Hall (which survived the Blitz) are gone. A tragic loss.' The building, which was designed in 1891 by E. W. Mountforcentre, was originally opened in 1893 as Battersea Town Hall. The space was converted to a community arts centre in 1974. The popular arts venue hosts a regular series of plays and dance shows. It is a registered charity, which raises 70 per cent of its own income every year.

"Norwegian killer Anders Breivik may have been driven to carry out his massacre because of an incestuous relationship with his own mother, a new book claims. The 36-year-old murdered 77 people and injured more than 300 - many of them teenagers - in 2011 after detonating a bomb in Oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on Utoya Island. At his trial, Breivik sought to rationalise his actions by saying he wanted to recreate the dominant Aryan race, claiming the killings were 'necessary' to protect Norway from Muslims. But a new book suggests that Breivik's shockingly warped mindset was forged by his abusive relationship with his mother Wenche Behring, perhaps even before birth. Scroll down for video . Incestuous? Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik pictured with his half-sister Elisabeth and his mum Wenche. A new book claims his killing spree was driven by frustrated sexual feelings towards his mother . Corrupted from birth? Breivik salutes during his trial. a new book suggests that Breivik's shockingly warped mindset was forged by his abusive relationship with his mother Wenche Behring, perhaps even in the womb . She is said to have sexualised her son from the age of just four and slept in the same bed with him with 'very close bodily contact', according to psychiatric reports compiled before his trial. Mrs Behring also revealed to police that he once bought her a sex toy to console her after she broke up with a boyfriend. Breivik, who was then in his 20s, proceeded to ask her a number of times whether she had used it, an interest she described as 'weird'. In One Of Us, The Story Of Anders Breivik And The Massacre In Norway, author Asne Seierstad even suggests that his dysfunctional relationship began in the womb. ‘It’s as if he kicks me almost on purpose, to torment,’ complains Mrs Behring, who admitted that she had considered having an abortion. She was later heard telling her young son that 'I wish you were dead' in a relationship that was described by social services as 'profoundly pathological'. It was recommended that he be taken into care, but that never happened. Warped: Breivik at a party aged around five. His mother is said to have sexualised him from the age of four and slept in the same bed with 'very close bodily contact', according to psychiatric reports  before his trial . Mrs Seierstad, who interviewed Mrs Behring in March 2013, six months after his conviction, said: 'Among many other things, he resented his mother. There's an aspect of revenge.' Mrs Behring died of breast cancer shortly afterwards. When Mrs Behring was informed of her son's atrocity, she replied coldly: 'How could he do this to me?' Mrs Seierstad believes that response suggested his mother felt she may in some way be to blame. 'It was clear their relationship was dysfunctional,' the author told Grazia magazine, explaining that Mrs Behring had traits of an abused child herself from her own mother. Breivik’s mother was a paranoid schizophrenic as was her mother, while his father was a cold and distant Norwegian diplomat, offering Breivik little comfort or protection. When Breivik was six months old, the family moved to the Embassy in London. But after another six months Mrs Behring had had enough of their  lifestyle and returned to Oslo with her baby and his half-sister. Breivik’s childhood might have been specially designed to create an adult monster. Deciding that she couldn’t handle her child seven days a week, Mrs Behring farmed him out to a young couple at weekends. Mass killer: The 36-year-old murdered 77 people and injured more than 300 - many of them teenagers - in 2011 after detonating a bomb in Oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on Utoya Island . ‘She asked if Anders could occasionally touch his weekend dad’s penis. It was important for the boy’s sexuality,' the book says. 'He had no father figure in his life and Wenche wanted the young man to assume that role... the young couple were speechless.’ Aged 13, he took up graffiti, and briefly became part of a gang. The name he gave himself – and which he spray-painted on every available wall – was Morg, after an executioner in a Marvel comic who murders his own people. But Breivik soon fell out with the rest of the gang and switched his allegiance to Norway’s Progress Party, a more strident version of our own Ukip – anti-immigrant, anti-socialist, anti-tax. By the age of 18 he had risen to the post of deputy chairman of the Oslo West Youth Wing. After five years, he graduated to anti-Muslim websites, full of conspiracy theories about Muslims taking over Norway, raping and murdering Scandinavian women. Lives destroyed: Mourners leave tributes to teenagers shot by Breivik on his gun rampage on Utoya Island . In his blogs, he awarded himself increasingly grand titles, all of them fostering the illusion that he had friends and followers: Knight Commander Of The Knights Templar, Distinguished Destroyer Of Cultural Marxism, Commander Of The Norwegian Anti-Communist Resistance Movement. He also posted tips for murdering socialists, such as acquiring a police uniform so you can move around unchallenged with weapons, and getting a job at a political youth camp. On July 22, 2011, he first killed eight people after setting off a bomb outside government buildings in central Oslo. He then shot dead 69 teenagers attending at Workers' Youth League summer camp on the island of Utoya, indiscriminately shooting students at point-blank range as he trampled over corpses . It was to became the largest killing spree by a single person in history. Later, awaiting trial, he was to be diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Breivik, a right-wing, anti-Muslim extremist, was sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment with preventive detention in 2012. Since his incarceration, Breivik has made increasingly desperate attempts to receive publicity, as well as issuing a number of bizarre demands. In February, he threatened to go on hunger strike unless prison authorities cave in to a list of demands for better conditions - including giving him a PlayStation 3. Despite the finite prison term, he is expected to remain in jail for the rest of his life.","Norwegian mass killer shot dead 77 and injured 300 in gun rampage in 2011 .

"A 600lb woman, whose eating spiraled out of control after she was molested as a child, was left fighting for her life after she developed a deadly case of pneumonia following her weight loss surgery. On last night's episode of the TLC obesity series My 600lbs Life, Laura Perez, from San Antonio, Texas, admitted that she was afraid she would die on the operating table – but it was actually her persistent refusal to address the symptoms of a lung infection that almost cost the 41-year-old her life. 'We got her just in time to keep her alive, but its not looking good right now,' Laura's surgeon Dr Younan Nowzaradan told the cameras. 'She is very close to dying.' Scroll down for video . Close call: Laura Perez's husband Joey held her hand as she battled pneumonia after her weight loss surgery on My 600lb Life . Personal nightmare: Before undergoing weight loss surgery, the 41-year-old cried that felt 'trapped in her own body' The Houston-based doctor explained that Laura's family said she hasn't been feeling well, but she never came to the hospital. Instead, Laura was later rushed to the emergency room, where she was placed in the intensive care unit and given a ventilator because she couldn't breathe on her own. 'A patient this size can't handle any sort of sickness,' Dr Nowzaradan said. '[Her] body has nothing left to give.' Laura's common law husband Joey tearfully watched her quietly battle the infection in her hospital bed. Mad love: Joey had to help Laura get out of bed in the morning because she was morbidly obese, weighing 594 lbs . Team work: Laura's mom Carmen and Joey had to help clean Laura's body and get her ready for the day . 'Laura is my life,' he said. 'She's been there with me through thick and thin.' Despite her severe condition, Laura miraculously managed to make a full recovery after spending two weeks in the hospital – but sadly her illness was just one of her many set backs. When Laura first traveled to Houston to meet with Dr Nowzaradan, she was told that she needed to shed 50lbs from her 594lb frame before being eligible for gastric bypass. 'She is physically in one of the worst shapes I have ever seen,' the doctor said of Laura, who was a diabetic and needed an oxygen tank and a wheelchair with her at all times. After Laura lost the necessary weight, Dr Nowzaradan proceeded with the surgery, only to find in the midst of the procedure that Laura's liver and spleen were far too large for her to actually undergo the gastric bypass. Emotional trauma: When Laura was a young child (L), she didn't have a problem with her weight. She started piling on the pounds (R) after an older cousin started molesting her when she was only five-years-old . Constant struggle: Laura continued to put on weight, and by the time she was in high school, she weighed more than 300lbs . Soulmates: Joey and Laura met when she was 27-years-old. He said he was attracted to heavier women at the time and liked the way she looked . Instead, he had to do a gastrectomy, in which he removed 80per cent of Laura’s stomach. Although the procedure wouldn't be as beneficial to her weight loss as a gastric bypass, it was all he could do. Laura, who almost cancelled the surgery the night before it was scheduled because she feared it would kill her, was devastated to learn that the doctor couldn't perform the gastric bypass. Weeks later she was deathly ill and fighting for her life, but battling pneumonia gave Laura even more determination to lose weight once and for all. 'It made me realize how much of my life I had wasted,' she said. 'I have taken all this pain and bitterness and all I have done was eat instead of dealing with it.' Major problem: Laura, who said she is addicted to sweets, can be seen eating candy that Joey had given her . Bad news: Weight loss expert Dr Younan Nowzaradan told Laura she had to lose 50lbs before being eligible for gastric bypass surgery . Panic mode: Laura's niece watched her aunt cry into her pillow the night before her surgery because she feared the procedure would kill her . She continued: 'I thought if I lost the weight, then I would start to get happy, but its really just been bringing everything to the surface and I don't want to run from it anymore.' As a young child, weight was never an issue for Laura, but after an older cousin began molesting her when she was only five-years-old, her eating habits dramatically changed for the worst. 'I never told my parents anything so the molestation went on for years,' she told the cameras while crying. 'My whole life just changed, so I turned to food, That was my comfort.' Being the heaviest kid in elementary school brought her even more pain. Family support: Laura's mom and sister spend time with her before her scheduled surgery . Change of plans: In surgery, Dr Nowzaradan learned that Laura's liver and spleen were too large for gastric bypass. Instead, he had to perform a gastrectomy, in which he removed 80per cent of her stomach . Filled with fear: Joe tearfully watched Laura as she battled pneumonia in the intensive care unit at the hospital . 'They would call me fat and say: ""You are going to break the desk,""' she tearfully recalled. 'And I took all that pain and kept eating.' Laura weighed more than 300lbs when she was in high school, and she was even heavier when she met Joey at the age of 27. 'I did like heavy set girls when I was younger,' Joey said. 'I liked the way she was.' But after gaining so much additional weight Laura confessed that she had started to feel more like a burden in his life. Joey and her mom Carmen had to do almost everything for Laura, including bathe her. Turing to God: Laura can be seen lighting a candle at church after recovering from her life-threatening bout of pneumonia . Listening ear: In order to move past her traumatic childhood, Laura began seeing Molly McCann, a therapist who could help her with her emotional issues . Final results: A year into her journey, Laura was weight and learned that she had lost 237lbs . Laura explained that she felt 'trapped in this body'. 'It's just humiliating to have to your family do everything for you like this,' she said. 'Some days I want to die, so they don't have to take care of me anymore.' She said she wants to get healthy, but admitted that she was battling an addiction to food. To make matters worse, Joey was often helping her sneak sweets behind her mother's back. 'She means the world to me. I love my wife a lot,' he explained. 'It's hard to tell her no because I love her.' Warm embrace: Laura hugged Dr Nowzaradan and thanked him for saving her life . Before and after: Laura first entered Dr Nowzaradan's office in a wheelchair with oxygen, and now she was able to walk out on her own two feet . But Joey also noted that his biggest fear is that she will just give up on herself. Laura's love for Joey, her mother, and her nieces, whom she calls her 'babies', is ultimately what drove her to see Dr Nowzaradan in the first place. 'I need to live for my babies,' she said, adding: 'I need to live for myself.' After her bout with pneumonia, it dawned on Laura that she needed to deal with her emotional issues and began to see a therapist. 'A new body won't matter if I still feel the same way,' she said. Special trip: Laura tried on a dress for Joey. It would become the first one that she would ever purchase and wear . Arts and crafts: Laura was able to go out with her nieces for the first time in their lives. They spent the day painting pottery . Dr Nowzaradan was concerned that she had only lost 18lbs since her surgery, and noted that she was on her way to gaining weight again. But slowly, Laura began to heal emotionally. She had a heart-to heart with her mom about the abuse she faced as a child and she was finally beginning to forgive those who hurt her. And it was this emotional closure that enabled her to really buckle down and lose weight. A year after she started her journey, Laura lost 237lbs and could do almost everything for herself. She was even able to go shopping, purchase her first dress and go out with her nieces to paint pottery. 'I feel like I new person,' she said of her dramatic weight loss.","Laura, from San Antonio, Texas, was rushed to the emergency room and put on a ventilator after she ignored the symptoms of her lung infection .

"It may not have the slick design of Apple's Watch - or the extortionate price tag - but Microsoft is hoping its Band fitness tracker and watch will rival the likes of Fitbit as well as the Moto 360. The Band features sensors that track distance, pulse rate, calories, sleep quality and even UV exposure, and it doubles up as a smartwatch to show notifications. It was released in the US last year but was only available in Microsoft Stores in select locations. Now its is available to pre-order in the UK and goes on general sale on 15 April. Scroll down for video . The Microsoft Band features sensors that track distance, pulse rate, calories, sleep quality and even UV exposure, and it doubles up as a smartwatch to show notifications. It was released in the US last year in select stores but is now available to pre-order in the UK. It goes on general sale on 15 April . The wrist-worn device has 10 smart sensors inside the band and a colourful touchscreen. In addition to tracking activity, it also offers guided workouts tailored to  a user's exercise goals and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have run or cycled. 'Microsoft Band makes it easier to reach your fitness goals. You can track your daily physical activity and review your stats with a glance at your wrist,' said the Washington-based company. 'Just like a personal trainer, Microsoft Band guides you to improved wellness by constantly learning about you, your current fitness level, and your future needs.' It doesn't let users make phone calls from the device, but like other smartwatches such as the Moto 360, they can read texts, emails, social media updates and see other notifications. The Microsoft Band (pictured) contains built-in GPS and 24-hour heart rate monitoring. It doesn't let users make phone calls, but like other smartwatches such as the Moto 360, they can read texts, emails, social media updates and see other notifications on the touchscreen . But unlike other smartwatches on the market, the Band's battery life lasts more than two days - despite having a coloured screen, vibrations and is monitoring heart rate constantly. The wrist-worn device (pictured left) works alongside a health app called Microsoft Health (shown on various devices) But unlike other smartwatches on the market, the Band's battery life lasts more than two days - despite having a coloured screen, vibrations and is monitoring heart rate constantly. And all of these features, stats and notifications can be customised on the Microsoft Health app that isn't tied to Microsoft's Windows Phone and works across Android and iOS as well. However, the Cortana personal assistant feature is only available for people using a Windows 8.1 device. Through Microsoft Health, all of the data is stored in the cloud and can be given to doctors, physiotherapists or used for other clinical reasons. Fitness functions: The band is primarily a fitness band. It features smart sensors that monitor pulse rate, measure calorie burn and track sleep quality. The device also offers workouts put together by Men's Health of Gold's Gym, for example, and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have ran or cycled. Smartwatch features: The device doesn't allow people to make calls directly, but does push notifications about calls, texts and emails from a user's smartphone to their Microsoft Band. It has Microsoft's Cortana personal assistant built-in so people can talk to the device to ask it to take notes or set reminders, for example. Appearance: The band is made of rubber and features a colour touchscreen. Users can change the background screen's colour and design on the Microsoft Health app. App: The Band syncs with Microsoft Health and works with iPhone, Android and Windows Phone handsets. It additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper. Sensors: It has 10 sensors that monitor everything from heart rate and sleep to UV, prompting wearers to apply sunscreen. Price: $199 in the US and £169.99 in the UK. Availability: It is available to pre-order today and goes on general sale on 15 April. For example, the sleep tracking function can highlight if someone is suffering from sleep apnoea - a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep - by tracking heart rate. Microsoft Health additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper. Data from these different devices and services, such as steps, calories and heart rate can then be combined, enabling an 'Intelligence Engine' which reveals which exercises were most effective during a workout and suggest a recommended recovery time. This also shows detailed information about when a person entered the aerobic and anaerobic states during a workout to help people more accurately track their fitness or boost weight loss. Over time, this data can be combined with a calendar to make the Intelligence Machine smarter and offer suggestions for workouts that fit with a user's schedule. The Band is available for pre-order from Amazon, Currys PC World and Microsoft Store or via O2 and goes on general sale on 15 April. All of these features, stats and notifications can be customised on the Microsoft Health app (pictured) which is available across Android, iOS and Windows Phone. This app additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper . There is a plethora of fitness trackers on the market, and an increasing number of smartwatches, but despite this competition Microsoft's Band still manages to stand out. It's not the best looking device, and by trying to cram in as many sensors as possible Microsoft appears to have forgotten that it needs to be worn for long periods of time. Its stiff rubber band is uncomfortable and bulky and its clasp is not easy to do up one-handed. Its green light, which reveals when the heart rate is being tracked, is also too bright - especially during the night, and when wearing it to sleep it ended up bruising my arm. However, its features more than make up for this shortcoming. The Band has many of the tools seen on other trackers and smartwatches but does them much better. Not only does it track heart rate constantly, which helps give a more accurate representation of calories burnt, respiration and sleep than other devices, it also gives more detailed insights into all of your activity. The Band (pictured) is available for pre-order from Amazon, Currys PC World and Microsoft Store or via O2 . For example, during sleep it reveals heart rate on a graph, tells you how long you slept and how much of this was classed as so-called restful sleep. It tracks your sleep efficiency and tells you how many calories were burnt as you were dozing. And during exercise this heart rate tracker plots when you entered aerobic or an anaerobic state, tells you how many calories were burnt during each stage and reveals how long you should recover before exercising again. The Guided Workout section lets you pick and choose for a list of exercise routines and the band gently vibrates to tell you to move onto the next activity. This is preferable to watching a video or having audio beeps. These vibrations are also used to alert a user to Facebook and Twitter notifications, emails and text messages and a Quick Read button will show the text of these notifications word-by-word so you don't have to scroll through on the small screen. The Band was the first wearable that stopped me reaching for my phone every 10 minutes or so. The only criticism of these sensors is that the pedometer, in particular, is a little sensitive and occasionally tracked single steps when driving in a car and hitting a pot hole or going over a speed bump. Microsoft claims the battery last for two days and during our tests it exceeded this. We ran a 5K on day one and walked an hour and 10 minutes on the second day, as well as received countless notifications and alerts and the phone lasted a staggering 53 hours on a single charge. This is even more impressive when you consider it is tracking heart rate constantly, and is used overnight during sleep. But the most impressive feature is the price. All of these features cost just £169.99 in the UK and $199 in the US. This is almost half the price of Apple's Watch and $50 cheaper than the Moto 360 in the US and £30 cheaper than the Fitbit Surge in the UK. It's not perfect, and the price reflects the poor design, but for a first foray into this industry its a decent effort.

"Shunning their reputation for harsh critiques and exacting high standards, the judges on a Belgium talent show have been won over - by a singing dog. The Belgium's Got Talent judging panel appeared delighted when a man revealed not his own talents, but that of his singing pet dog Lady Xena, on the TV show recently. Accompanied by a backing track of 'I Will Always Love You' by Whitney Houston, Lady Xena was broadcast crying in accompaniment to the signing. The pet dog named Lady Xena howls in accompaniment to Houston's singing during the live audition . Lady Xena's owner sits beside her as she cries along to the love ballad before a huge TV audience . It was during the song's crescendo that she received the biggest applause from the crowd and judges - letting off a loud and high pitched howl as the song concluded. Throughout the performance, two judges could be seen bursting into laughter while two more watched on in mild bemusement. In particular, Karen Damen, a singer and member of girl group K3, could be seen clutching her sides at the utterly bizarre audition. However, the audience applauded the pet's performance with enthusiasm - so much so that she has become a sensation in her home country. Her owners, Mick Depreytere, 32, and Daphnee Naessens, 28, from Ostend in Belgium's north-west, explained to HLN that they bought Xena when she was 12 weeks old. It was when they took her to a cafe which was playing the Whitney Houston song that they discovered her talent. 'When Xena heard the sound of the song, she began to cry. It was really weird,' Mr Depreytere said. Judge Karen Damen was seen in hysterics at the utterly bizarre performance . Niels Destadsbader also appeared to enjoy the performance, which lasted about two minutes .

"Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said Tuesday he wants new legislation clarifying that a new religious-freedom does not allow discrimination on his desk by the end of the week. The White House fired back hours later, calling Pence a 'previously defiant governor' who has suddenly decided 'to consider a position of changing the law' amid a 'bipartisan and even nonpolitical outcry.' Pence told reporters he has been meeting with lawmakers 'around the clock' to address concerns that the law will allow businesses to deny services to gays and lesbians. 'After much reflection and in consultation with the leadership of the general assembly,' he told reporters during a press conference, 'I've come to the conclusion that it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone.' Scroll down for video . Indiana Gov. Mike Pence now says he wants changes to a religious-freedom law he signed just days ago, as criticism mounts from gay rights groups . Protests have swirled around Indianapolis since the law took effect, with activists insisting it's a license to discriminate against gays and lesbians . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest unleashed a biting attack on Indiana lawmakers near the beginning of his briefing on Tuesday. 'This piece of legislation flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support,' he said. That, Earnest claimed, is why 'we've seen the governor and other Indiana officials in damage-control mode here.' The law Pence signed last week prohibits state laws that 'substantially burden' a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs. The definition of 'person' includes religious institutions, businesses and associations. Pence says the law has been 'grossly mischaracterized' and has put Indiana under a harsh glare – resulting in a 'perception problem' that he has to address. 'I don't believe for a minute that it was the intent of the General Assembly to create a license to discriminate,' he said. 'It certainly wasn't my intent.' But, Pence said, he 'can appreciate that that's become the perception, not just here in Indiana but all across the country. We need to confront that.' Supporters of the measure say it protects their ability to exercise their religious beliefs without shelving them when they enter the business marketplace. Opponents insist it gives Indiana residents and companies a legal loophole if they want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. The legal language itself doesn't specifically mention gays or lesbians . But the central controversy surrounding the law concerns whether or not Christians who run photography, catering or florist businesses should be allowed to refuse service to people who are planning same-sex weddings. Businesses and organizations including the NCAA – whose iconic 'Final Four' basketball tournament comes to Indianapolis this week – have voiced concern over the effect of the law, and some states have barred government-funded travel to Indiana. NASCAR, the stock-car racing circuit, joined the fray on Tuesday with a statement assuring fans that 'we will not embrace nor participate in exclusion or violence.' The organization pledged that it would welcome all fans in Indiana and elsewhere. Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post over the weekend opposing the Indiana law and a near-identical bill pending in Arkansas. At the White House, Earnest said it was no surprise that 'we see business leaders saying that they are reluctant to business in a state where their customers or even their employees could be subjected to greater discrimination just because of who they love.' White House press secretary Josh Earnest upbraided Indiana Republicans on Tuesday for the religious-freedom law, which bears many similarities to a federal law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993 . Are you being served? Gay weddings are ground-zero for religious-freedom laws, as some vendors' religious beliefs prohibit them from participating in same-sex ceremonies . Three states have banned taxpayer-funded travel to Indiana this week in response to the legislation, as well as the city of San Francisco, California, and the city of Seattle, Washington. Connecticut became the first state on Monday to introduce a travel ban and was followed by Washington and New York. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo today directed all state agencies to immediately 'bar any such publicly funded travel that is not essential to the enforcement of state law or public health and safety.' 'New York State has been, and will continue to be, a leader in ensuring that all LGBT persons enjoy full and equal civil rights. With this action, we stand by our LBGT family members, friends and colleagues to ensure that their rights are respected,' he said in a statement. Connecticut's governor, Dannel Malloy, accused Indiana of 'outright bigotry.' 'The reality is, the governor is not a stupid man, but he’s done stupid things. And signing this law and, quite frankly, promoting this law, knowing exactly what it was going to do, was an incredibly stupid thing for him to do,' said on MSNBC. 'But even there, if you get the picture from who was around him when he signed this bill, there were three homophobic men standing alongside the governor. One of them who equated being gay with bestiality. That’s who he invited to the signing ceremony. He knew exactly what he was doing, and when you see a bigot you have to call him on it.' The Family Research Council, an evangelical group based out of Washington D.C. that lobbies against abortion and same-sex marriage and promotes religious liberty, came to Pence's defense on Tuesday, saying that Indiana has been the target of 'bullying' and 'misinformation.' It said critics' claims about the law are a 'complete falsehood.' Indiana's religious  freedom law is not 'about denying people a seat in a restaurant or a room at a hotel,' the organization's president, Tony Perkins, said in a statement. 'Christians would never deny people these services but being forced to participate in a ceremony that violates religious beliefs is completely un-American and uncivil,' he added. Continuing, he said, 'We must ensure that religious business owners are not forced by the government to participate in a same-sex ceremony.' Perkins said his organization would back a clarification in the law explaining that it 'does not impact non-religious goods or services.' Best intentions: Pence said Tuesday that it was not 'the intent of the General Assembly to create a license to discriminate,' , and added that 'it certainly wasn't my intent' Loud and proud: Whether or not Indiana's new law actually makes it legal to discriminate, gay rights groups have been promoting the idea that it does . Pence says the backlash has been the result of a willful twisting of the law's meaning by its opponents. 'That's why I think we need to focus specifically on this perception that this creates some license to discriminate,' he said. The controversy has opened up the possibility that the pendulum Indiana lawmakers pushed into motion could swing in the opposite direction. Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a Republican, said Monday that state legislators should add gays to the list of groups specifically protected by the state's civil rights law. And Tuesday's edition of the Indianapolis Star included a special cover emblazoned with the words 'FIX THIS NOW' in giant letters, along with a scathing editorial. The newspaper's editorial board said the uproar sparked by the law has 'done enormous harm' to the state and potentially to its economic future. Pence seemed to be sticking to his guns on Monday, writing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal that blamed 'critics and many in the national media' for getting their facts wrong. 'The Religious Freedom Restoration Act reflects federal law, as well as law in 30 states nationwide,' he wrote.' 'I abhor discrimination,' Pence insisted. 'I believe in the Golden Rule that you should ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn’t eat there anymore.'","Gov. Mike Pence seemed to blink Tuesday in the face of withering pressure after he signed a 'Religious Feredom Restoration Act' bill into law .

"A Mississippi sheriff said Friday that a black man found hanging from a tree did not appear to have stepped off of anything before he died and that he had last been seen on camera leaving a casino. The man's identity has been confirmed as that of Otis Byrd, a 54-year-old ex-convict who lived just about 200 yards from the tree and had been declared missing by his family about two weeks ago. Claiborne County Sheriff Marvin Lucas Sr., who knew Byrd as he had to check in with the sheriff's department as a condition of his parole in 2006 after serving 26 years in prison for the murder of a woman during a robbery in 1980, also confirmed his identity earlier this week. Scroll down for video . What happened? Otis James Byrd, 54 (above), was found hanging from a tree in Mississippi after he was reported missing March 2 . Claiborne County officials prepare to leave a home in Port Gibson, Miss., where authorities were investigating the hanging death of Byrd . Lucas said that the body was found Thursday hanging by a bed sheet from a tree limb about 12 feet high, and that the man's feet were dangling about two feet off the ground. The hands on the body were not bound, he said. The results of an autopsy by the Mississippi Crime Lab to determine whether the death was homicide or suicide could take days, Lucas said. The hanging is being investigated by the FBI, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the United States Attorney's office as well as the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation. The feds are there to determine if it's a potential hate crime or other violation of federal law, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday. 'We simply don't know enough facts,' Holder told MSNBC. 'We do have a substantial federal presence to determine what the facts are.' Vicksburg Police Chief Walter Armstrong said Friday that after local authorities asked his department to check on a report that Byrd had been at a casino, video surveillance was recovered showing Byrd at the Riverwalk Casino on March 2. 'We didn't see anything of significance on the tape. He was just walking around the casino. We did not see him after that,' Armstrong said. The body was found by state wildlife officers and had obvious sign"" of decomposition, suggesting that it had been hanging in the woods for some time, said Jim Walker, a , a spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. The owner of the land, 87-year-old Johnie Baker, said that the area where Byrd's body was found is covered in pecan and black walnut trees. He added that hunters sometimes hunt in the area and that there are also wild boars on the land. Spotted: The last time Byrd was seen he was leaving a casino 30 miles north on March 2 . So far, authorities say it's too early to determine whether the victim's death was a homicide or a suicide. However, the NAACP is petitioning to have the U.S. Department of Justice involved in the investigation, fearing Byrd's death may have been a hate crime. The Claiborne County Sheriff's Department and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation are also involved in the investigation. Lynching was a common form of 'mob justice' in the late 19th century, particularly in the south. A report by the Equal Justice Initiative claims there were nearly 4,000 lynchings of African Americans in the Jim Crow era across 12 states of the US. Byrd spent 25 years in prison for the murder of Lucille Trim, the Clarion-Ledger reported according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. He allegedly robbed Trimm of $101 and then killed her. He was convicted of capital murder in February 1980 and then was paroled in November 2006. Trim is the mother of Martha Ranville, who was the first woman in the history of the National Guard to serve as State Adjuntant General. She became the Adjutant General in Vermony in 1997 and currently lives in Virginia with her husband, the Hon. Paul McHale. McHale is a former Pennsylvania congressman and assistant secretary of defense.

"It's only been a couple of weeks since Kim Kardashian revealed her shocking new platinum do amid the whirlwind of Paris fashion week. However, the  Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is already finding that she has to work pretty hard to maintain the look. Just this week, Kim posted a picture of herself having her dark roots touched up for the third time. Scroll down for video . Kim bleached her hair for the third time this week saying that being a blonde is a 'full-time job'... but a top celebrity hairdresser has warned Kim not to hit the bottle too often . Now celebrity hairdresser Andrew Jose, ambassador for Salon Science, has warned that if she's not careful, Kim could suffer from some serious breakage for her blond look. Andrew, who has styled the tresses of Alanis Morissette, Jamie Campbell Bower and Louise Redknapp, says: 'This type of bleach blonde look goes beyond fashion and if done well can look high-end and powerful. 'Be warned though, this look is definitely not for the faint-hearted. Not only does maintaining the regrowth take a lot of commitment but the chemical process of bleach on the hair can be incredibly damaging.' When Kim posted the picture of herself having her hair done again, she said: 'Being blonde is a full -time job!,' and it seems she's not far wrong. Kim has been showing off her bright blonde hair for the last couple of weeks after debuting her new look at Paris Fashion week . Andrew says: 'Of all the colouring methods, bleach is the most damaging, and should always be done professionally and slowly. 'Bleaching raises the cuticle on the hair, removing colour pigment permanently from the hair shaft, a process which is called oxidation. 'Bleaching can permanently raise the cuticle, leaving hair dry, brittle and porous. Overlapping bleach in the same place leaves hair feeling weak and elastic, which can then lead to hair breakage.' He added: 'Overuse and repeated application of bleach to the scalp can strip the hair of moisture and damage the follicle. 'This may cause the hair to either fall out from the root or to break at the weakest point along the hair shaft.' Any would-be blondes should think about trying a toner before giving the bleach a go, says Andrew. Kim showed off her newly-bleached blonde roots as she ran errands around Los Angeles .

Kim's hair has been getting lighter and brighter ever since she went blonde in Paris (right) Gentlemen prefer blondes: Kim's husband Kanye is thought to be a big fan of her blonde locks, the star  has previously said that he prefers her with lighter hair . 'Bleaching takes hair to a very raw colour state. Try to embrace the tones of your blonde and adapt the shade using a toner to bring out golds or introduce ash colour layers,' said Andrew. 'To achieve the bleached-blonde look and keep your hair as healthy as possible always ensure that it is done professionally. 'Your colourist will know not to overlap bleach on the hair. Depending on how quickly your hair grows, the purest of blondes will need to have root maintenance every two weeks.' Andrew recommends using protein-enriched products to strengthen the hair, which add strength to the hair shaft and prevent breakage.' He said: 'There are many benefits of using leave-in products that stay on the hair shaft and continue to work after application.' Having debuted her hair at Paris Fashion Week, Kim revealed that she was inspired to go for the look by Madonna. She said: 'I’ve always had this image of Madonna with platinum hair in my references folder on my computer and I’ve been waiting a long time to try the look. 'I thought what better time than right now for Paris Fashion Week?' But Kim says she may not keep her new look forever. She said: 'It was a really last-minute decision, and I loved taking this risk.

"David Acott (above) has died just weeks after being diagnosed with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder - a rare cancer that affects white blood cells . A talented athlete has died weeks after being diagnosed with a rare cancer that affects people who have had an organ transplant. David Acott had a transplant three years ago after doctors discovered his liver was not metabolising copper and he was being poisoned. He recovered so well that he had taken up competing in tough triathlons and regularly went running with his mother. But the popular 17-year-old student was told he had post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in January - a devastating cancer that affects the white blood cells in around one in 50 people. Medical staff were initially confident that chemotherapy would cure him. But he failed to respond to treatment and died on Monday surrounded by family. His mother Janet, from Bodham, Norfolk, said last night: 'David had a strength and depth that just amazed me. 'He was kind, good-natured, had a lovely smile, was very well-mannered, and caring and considerate to his younger brother Howard - they were best friends.' The 48-year-old added that David had become her friend as well as her son over the last couple of years. She said: 'We would walk and run together - he was someone who was really nice to hang out with and we are all going to miss him so much.' Hundreds of tributes from fellow athletes and friends have also been paid to David, who attended Paston College, North Walsham. Sheringham Parkrun athletes fell silent for a minute before their weekly event on Saturday as David often ran it with his mum. Karl Read, Parkrun director, said: 'David was a modest and very brave lad. 'He started walking on the run with his mum as part of rehabilitation, then began to run and ended up taking part in triathlons. 'He was a lovely guy who always had a smile.' PTLD occurs in one in 50 people who have had an organ transplant. The 17-year-old (right) had a liver transplant three years ago but had recovered well and regularly went running with his mother Janet (second from right) The creative media student also adored the family cocker spaniel, ironically named Copper by David long before he knew about his medical problems . Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a potentially fatal but uncommon complication of organ transplants. The disease affects the white blood cells and is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus. Some of the cells affected may undergo mutations that render them malignant, giving rise to a lymphoma, or group of blood cell tumours. There is no uniform consensus regarding the best treatment for the disease. Antiviral drugs can be used as can chemotherapy in more serious cases. It is mainly fatal in cases where it progresses to a lymphoma. Around one in 50 people develop the disease after surgery. Kevin Grieve, Paston College principal, said: 'We are very saddened by the news. 'David was a hard-working and diligent student. 'It is a very sad loss and we have been supporting staff and students, particularly those who were on the same course.' David began to suffer from depression and anxiety when he was 13 years old. Shortly after his 15th birthday in July 2012 Ms Acott spotted that his stomach looked swollen. Two days later the whites of his eyes turned yellow and he became very ill. Within a week, David was having a life-saving liver transplant in King's College Hospital, London, after being diagnosed with the rare Wilson's Disease. His family learned that a genetic defect had caused the illness, which prevented his liver from being able to metabolise copper. The deadly copper build-up was poisoning his liver, brain and other organs. Within weeks of the operation David was well enough to jog more than three miles with his mum. Ms Acott, who has now become one of the Parkrun organisers, said: 'We basically walked most of it the first time but it was such an achievement.' The keen athlete also began running, swimming and playing badminton. He took part in the 2013 Pinewood Triathlon in Sheringham and won three medals in last year's British Transplant Games in Bolton, Greater Manchester. He loved playing football and supported his native Ipswich Town as well as sharing the family passion for Arsenal. Ms Acott, a former teacher at Beeston Hall where her partner Richard Hamilton teaches, said: 'David had been lost in his illness but for two-and-a-half really good years I had my real son - and he was an absolute joy for me and the whole family. 'He was a really lovely boy.' In 2013 he travelled to the United States with his family where they visited Central Park (above). From left to right: mother Janet Acott, brother Howard, Ms Acott's partner Richard Hamilton and David . David also had a younger brother - Howard, 14 - and a half-sister - Clare, eight. And he adored the family cocker spaniel, ironically named Copper by David long before he knew he had Wilson's Disease. In the last couple of years he travelled to the United States with his family  and went to watch the Champions League Final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in Portugal last May, courtesy of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. While there David was thrilled to meet former Arsenal and France star Robert Pires. The brave teenager had recently started a creative media course. Ms Acott said she had been 'deeply touched' at the support shown by his friends there. Ms Acott said: 'David had been lost in his illness but for two-and-a-half really good years I had my real son.' David is pictured left at a triathlon and right with the family dog . They had managed to get an Ipswich shirt signed by the club's players to boost his morale. Although David never saw it, Ms Acott said she told him about it as he lay dying in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, and he had smiled with pleasure. She said: 'He definitely had a very good two-and-a-half years thanks to the selfless act of organ donation. David never complained - he just got on with it. 'Even when they were sticking needles in him and prodding him about, he always said thank you to the nurses.' Ms Acott is still organising David's funeral and hopes lots of his friends will attend. She will be asking for donations, instead of flowers, to the Ronald McDonald House Charity, Camberwell House, which provided accommodation and support for the family while David was at King's College Hospital.","David Acott diagnosed with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder .

"Lauren Blanning, 19, has been jailed for 16 months for drink driving after she pulled into the path of a biker having drunk a bottle of rose wine . A husband left crippled by a teenage girl who downed a bottle of rosé before getting behind the wheel has condemned her ‘totally insubstantial’ 16-month jail term. Motorcyclist Stephen Isaacs was flung 60ft and suffered severe pelvic injuries after Lauren Blanning pulled out in front of him while on the way home from the pub with friends. Newlywed Mr Isaacs, 49, has been told he is unlikely to walk again. But Blanning, 19, could be free in as little as eight months and will be let back on the road. Last night, wheelchair-bound Mr Isaacs criticised the sentence handed down at Bristol Crown Court. He said: ‘We were led to believe she would be charged with grievous bodily harm, with a 14-year maximum – a sentence in a decent range which she would serve as a result. 'I think the 16- month sentence is utterly and totally insubstantial.’ Blanning has said she is ‘sickened’ by her role in the crash. But Mr Isaacs said her remorse was not genuine, adding: ‘I think they are crocodile tears. It’s more about feeling sorry for herself.’ The teenager, who passed her driving test three months before the smash in Bristol last May, was nearly twice the legal drink-drive limit when she drove her Ford Ka into the biker’s path. When she was given a breath test she told police: ‘I know I will fail, I’ve had a bottle of wine.’ Mr Isaacs, an aircraft fitter for 26 years, is still being treated at hospital and is unable to return to work after the accident, which he cannot remember. He had been on his way home and stopped to pick up a takeaway. The next thing he recalls is waking in hospital two weeks later. Biker Stephen Isaacs (pictured with wife Susanne on his wedding day in September 2013) was thrown over the top of Blanning's car and 60ft down the road, suffering massive pelvis injuries . Surgeons had battled to save his life and he ‘died’ on the operating table before being revived. He lost so much blood that he received 60 pints in 48 hours, and has had multiple operations. Mr Isaacs' injuries were so severe he had to be resuscitated on the operating table in hospital, needed 60 pints of blood transfusions in 48 hours, and has been told it is very unlikely he will walk again . Blanning’s car was travelling at 12mph at the time of the accident, the court heard. But a collision investigator said Mr Isaacs did not have enough time to react and there was nothing he could have done to prevent the 1am crash. After the hearing the victim said his main regret was not being able to be there for his father who died after falling ill in December. But Mr Isaacs – who used to enjoy kayaking, hiking and skiing – said the crash had made him a better man and paid tribute to his wife Susanne, 45, whom he married in September 2013. He said: ‘I’m a determined person. I think I’ll do cross-country wheelchairing and world travel. This has changed me. But I would not be here without my wife.’ The first thing Blanning did after the smash was phone her mother in ‘desperation, fear, panic and shock’, the court heard. She later told police the motorcyclist was going a ‘bit fast’ but tests proved he was doing 32mph. Blanning was jailed for 16 months after admitting causing serious injury by dangerous driving and driving with excess alcohol. She had been found to have 62 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35. Judge Michael Roach, sentencing, said Blanning’s ‘stupidity’ had wrecked a life. He told her: ‘Nothing I can say can restore his good health. Nothing I can say can restore anything he and others had to suffer through your stupidity.’ Blanning’s lawyer Darren Burleigh read a note from his client which said: ‘I can’t begin to imagine what I put Mr Isaacs and his family through. It sickens me that I played a part in such a tragic accident. I can never make it up to them. I hope what happens today lifts a heavy weight off their shoulders.’ He added: ‘She made a foolish decision to drive a very short distance from the pub to her friend’s house. ‘For that she knows she will have to be punished. The impact will never be reflected in any sentence.’ Blanning was also banned from driving for three years and must take a test before returning to the road. Mr Isaacs has been bed-bound at Southmead Hospital since the accident in May last year and today branded Blanning's sentence 'utterly and totally unsubstantial' Blanning called her mother in a panic after the accident, and initially tried to claim Mr Isaacs had been travelling 'a bit fast', but later tests showed he was going at 32mph . Mr Isaacs has lost his job of 26-years following the horror crash after his injuries left him unable to return to work and now has to manage his spinal pain using an inflatable mattress .

"The two men charged with allegedly planning to carry out a brutal terrorist attack in Sydney will plead not guilty. Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25, were charged with planning to commit a terrorist act in February, allegedly hours before they planned to carry out the attack. Police allegedly seized a machete, a hunting knife, a homemade Islamic State flag and a video recording that detailed their planned attack. However, criminal lawyer Adam Houda - who is representing the men - said the video was 'not convincing', according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . Criminal lawyer Adam Houda tells media of his clients plans to plead not guilty to terror charges . 'The matter will be defended, there will be a plea of not guilty,' Mr Houda said . Mohammad Kiad, 25 (right), and his Iraqi born housemate Omar Al-Kutobi, 24 (left), were arrested on terror charges in their shared squalid granny flat at Fairfield on Tuesday . 'The matter will be defended, there will be a plea of not guilty,' Mr Houda said outside court. 'From what I've seen the central feature of this case is this video. 'I've seen the video and it's not convincing.' 'Mr Houda also the trial had been prejudiced by Tony Abbott, who read out details of that video in Parliament. 'He wants to milk this situation politically for all it's worth,' Mr Houda told media in February. 'The unfortunate result is that it will also bring unfair prejudice to the matters before the court and also undermine the court process.' The case will return to court in May. When the men were first in court, Commonwealth DPP prosecutor Kay Marenos said the brief of evidence against the men was four pages long 'but that is likely to change' and included photographs and a short video. Facebook pictures of  Kiad, who immigrated to Australia from Kuwait in 2009, revealed his fashion interest and showed him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as making some strange fashion statements . A keen weight-lifter, the 25-year-old removalist also shared selfies of himself at the gym . Mr Kiad entered Australia in 2012, where he had worked as a nurse - but when he arrived in Australia he found he could not transfer his skills. He was granted a visa under the family and spousal visa arrangements and recently took up a job as a removalist but was fired and was on the dole at the time of his arrest, it has been reported. Attorney-General George Brandis told parliament on Wednesday: 'Significantly, police also located a video recording of one suspect kneeling in front of an ISIL (IS) flag, with the knife and machete, making a politically-motivated statement, threatening to undertake violent acts with those weapons.' A Sydney police station and officers on the street were revealed to have been the the targets with attacks scheduled for just before midnight on Tuesday, Channel Nine reported. In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny  pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces . Mr Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse while Mr Kiad, originally from Kuwait where he immigrated from in 2009, was reported to have been recently fired from his removalist job. While some neighbours told Fairfax that he was 'friendly', 'open minded about religion' and 'never talked about Islam', others admitted he and Mr Al-Katobi had begun acting differently after the anti-terror raids in western Sydney last September. 'He began wearing a scarf, just like ISIS and Mohammad, he grew a long beard,' Neighbour Michael David said of Al-Kutobi. 'I heard them praying in there [the granny flat] and reading the Koran,' said Mr David, who speaks Arabic. Ms Jeisele-Brown said the pair had fallen out with another neighbour over the last month or two for 'speaking sharp' and that she had been upset with them after finding a religious picture of hers dumped in the rubbish bin. Pictured smoking shisha in mid-2013: The mens' neighbours said they mostly kept to themselves but admitted their behaviour had changed drastically in the last few months following police raids in western Sydney and the Martin Place siege . 'I had been in hospital having chemotherapy and when I came back home my picture of Jesus Christ was missing,' she said. 'I found it in the rubbish. I don't know who dumped it but I thought ... I didn't say anything.' Neighbours Teresita Heisele-Brown said she had noticed that after the Martin place siege, the two men had had lengthy discussions in Arabic and had watched a lot of television, perhaps coverage of the a siege. She said when the police came around to arrest the pair, Mohammad had pretended he didn't speak English. She said detectives had made the men lie on the ground while they handcuffed them. Their home, workplaces and cars were all searched by police.

"It's the call centre accused of plaguing Britain with an incredible six million calls a day. Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal the chequered background of the man responsible – involving disputes with famous names and a string of failed businesses. Russell Church is the main shareholder in a company that is currently under investigation for bombarding its victims, including the elderly and vulnerable, with unsolicited nuisance calls selling debt management and payment protection insurance (PPI) claims services. Earlier this month the cold-call 'factory' based at an anonymous business complex in Hove, East Sussex, was raided by the Information Commissioner's Office, which is responsible for the enforcement of the Data Protection Act. Russell Church is the main shareholder in a company that is currently under investigation for bombarding its victims, including the elderly and vulnerable, with unsolicited nuisance calls . The firm is reported to hold a staggering 90 million phone numbers that it repeatedly calls using sophisticated technology. Mr Church has a decidedly questionable past that includes: . Mr Church began his career as an entrepreneur in the mid-1980s in Brighton, where he lived until recently with his wife in a £1.6 million property. The 54-year-old has been the director of 19 companies, mostly relating to the publishing industry. But official records show that 18 of these firms have been dissolved, owing £3.4 million to creditors. In 2009 Mr Church was banned by the Department for Business for four years from setting up another business after it was discovered that four of his firms had failed to pay taxes and National Insurance payments totalling £120,000. Nuisance:  Anne Diamond took legal action against Church . Russell Church was the target of Anne Diamond's fury over a comic strip. Ms Diamond, left, and her then husband Mike Hollingsworth brought legal action against Church's company, Humour Publications, following a cartoon in Zit magazine. It imagined an affair between Ms Diamond and football legend Jack Charlton that resulted in a baby resembling ET – the infant was shown in a cot. The TV star took offence because it came out shortly after the tragic cot death of her four-month-old son Sebastian. Mr Church's lawyer, Matthew Higdon, said the cartoon went to press before the death of Ms Diamond's child, adding: 'The timing was therefore most unfortunate and entirely unintended by the editor. The action was settled on that basis and for the sake of expediency.' A spokesman for Church said: 'He was left mortified over the situation. 'The complaint was settled, and that decision was the correct course of action.' A representative for Ms Diamond confirmed that action was brought against the magazine. Mr Church has also been the subject of a number of legal actions involving high-profile names. The first of these lawsuits was brought by Ms Diamond and her then husband, TV executive Mike Hollingsworth, in 1991 over what they believed to be an offensive cartoon published in a magazine owned by Mr Church. In 1996, he landed in hot water again when his company Celebrity Publications brought out Boyzone's official magazine. The pop band's management said they planned to sue the firm when the magazine folded after one issue, leaving angry teenage fans who had paid a £30 subscription fee out of pocket. At the time, the band's manager, John Reynolds, said: 'We are disgusted with Celebrity Publications and their disregard for Boyzone fans. The whole matter is in the hands of our lawyers. Celebrity Publications were recommended to us because they also handled the official East 17 magazine.' Mr Church caused more controversy when he launched a monthly 'lads' mag' in 2004 called Sorted that offered advice on shoplifting and taking ecstasy. But this also proved to be a doomed venture and folded after four editions, owing thousands of pounds and unpaid wages to staff. Despite his financial troubles, Mr Church is now the majority owner of a call centre that the ICO says has cornered a sizeable proportion of the cold-call market. David Clancy, from the information regulator, said. 'It is astounding to think that this one small company has the ability to pester millions of people with unwanted calls on a huge scale.' The firm is based at the Gemini Business Centre in Hove and shares its address and directors with several other cold-call companies. For legal reasons, the company being investigated cannot be named. The ICO launched an investigation into the centre after receiving reports that its staff had been phoning people who had asked not to receive unsolicited sales or marketing calls. The watchdog suspects the firm used automatic dialling technology to make up to six million nuisance calls a day. These calls resulted in 'millions upon millions' of anonymous messages being left on people's home phones and mobiles with offers about debt management and PPI claims services. The ICO said the company invited victims to press 9 to speak to a call handler regarding a PPI claim, or 5 to stop the calls. But investigators for the watchdog said there was evidence that those who pressed 5 continued to be harassed. Mr Clancy added: 'I have never seen an operation of this size. Those targeted will have included the elderly or people vulnerable for other reasons. We received a vast number of complaints from hundreds of people who were frightened by these calls.' The ICO confiscated paperwork and computer equipment during its raid on March 12 and is considering what further action to take. Church once took thousands of pounds in subscription fees from teenage Boyzone (pictured, file photo) fans for a magazine that folded after one issue . Last night, Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price, who is a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on nuisance calls, called for firms to be 'named and shamed.' She said: 'You will then find out who is behind them and the chances are that anyone who's prepared to make nuisance calls is probably playing fast and loose with the law elsewhere. 'We also need to be taking action against those companies using nuisance calls to generate business.' Mr Church's lawyer, Matthew Higdon, insisted there had been 'no formal allegation, charge or complaint' received by his client or any companies associated with him. He said neither Mr Church nor his companies had 'received any notification as to any investigation by the ICO or any other regulatory authority'. The raid comes ahead of the introduction of new powers on April 6 that will make it easier for the ICO to fine rogue cold-call companies up to £500,000. Recent figures show that 30 million Britons receive up to a billion nuisance phone calls and text messages every year. The new powers due to come into force follow a sustained campaign by the ICO to make it easier to fine companies found to be making nuisance calls. The ICO has struggled to punish rogue firms because of the requirement to prove the business had caused 'substantial damage or distress'. But now the regulator simply has to demonstrate a firm has been a significant nuisance to apply fines of up to £500,000. An ICO spokesman said: 'This law change is a game-changer. The Mail on Sunday has exposed firms using cold calls in the past. In 2013, our undercover investigation revealed how one company, Lead Performance Limited, had phoned thousands of people to persuade them to release money from their pensions without warning of the risk of large losses. By Michael Powell . Nuisance calls are being taken to new levels of absurdity by firms that telephone the public uninvited – to offer services to stop cold calls. But what many people do not realise is that a safeguard against cold calls is already available for free through the Government-backed Telephone Preference Service (TPS). Two firms offering to block cold calls have recently been placed on a monitoring list of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The list features the 20 'worst' culprits based on the number of complaints and information from consumer organisations. Cold Call Elimination's director is Leah Masters (pictured), 31, who is pictured on Facebook enjoying holidays in Las Vegas and Marbella, . Cold Call Elimination has been warned it is on the regulator's radar amid allegations that staff gave the impression they were calling from BT to offer a Government-backed scheme. The firm offers services priced between £34.99 and £129.99 that include fitting a 'call-blocker' device to landlines to stopping unwanted calls from UK and foreign numbers. However, anyone can register for free with the TPS. Firms making calls without prior consent to people signed up to the TPS are breaking the law. Cold Call Elimination's director is Leah Masters, 31, who is pictured on Facebook enjoying holidays in Las Vegas and Marbella, and drinking from a bottle of champagne. The company denies any wrongdoing and says it follows all Trading Standards practices. It is not under investigation but is being 'monitored' by the ICO, which could order a full probe if it suspects illegal practices or non-compliance with cold-calling regulations. The firm denies its staff have alluded to being from BT or offering a Government service. It says it gets numbers from companies that sell data but intends only to contact people who have 'opted in'. Nuisance Call Prevention Service is also on the ICO monitoring list. It did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Double-glazing firm Zenith Staybrite has also been placed on the ICO list. The company is owned by HI Sales, whose chief executive is Ian Blackhurst, co-owner of Premiership rugby side Sale Sharks. A legal spokesman for Mr Blackhurst denied Zenith has had a 'significant number of caller complaints' or had 'acted in breach of the relevant regulations'. He added that Mr Blackhurst had no operational involvement in Zenith.","Main shareholder investigated for selling debt management and PPI claims .

"Saudi blogger Raif Badawi has spoken for the first time since being jailed and sentenced to 1,000 lashes to say it was 'miraculous' that he had survived the first 50. Badawi was arrested in 2012 for offences including insulting Islam, cyber crime and disobeying his father (a crime in Saudi Arabia). Last year, the father-of-three was sentenced to 10 years in jail, a fine of 1 million riyals ($266,000). His punishment also meant he would be flogged 50 times every Friday for 20 weeks - but after the first beating in January this year, these have been postponed each week on medical grounds. Scroll down for video . Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who was sentenced to 1,000 lashes for 'insulting Islam', has spoken for the first time from jail about his first flogging in January . His conviction sparked an international outcry and German weekly Der Spiegel reported Badawi's first remarks since being given the sentence today. Badawi recalled how he received the first round of lashes in Jeddah on January while surrounded by a cheering crowd that chanted 'Allahu akbar' (God is the greatest), Der Spiegel reported. In a letter which the magazine said was his first since being jailed, Badawi said: 'All this cruel suffering happened to me only because I expressed my opinion.' His wife Ensaf Haidar said her husband is in 'a poor condition', adding he had suffered from high blood pressure and was mentally very stressed. Badawi said a cheering crowd chanted 'Allahu akbar' during his first flogging session. Pictured: leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone showed the beating in January . Badawi's remarks form the preface of a book entitled '1,000 Lashes: Why I Say What I Think', which is due to be published in Germany on April 1. Der Spiegel said the German government had warned against the book's publication because it could put the blogger's life at risk, though Berlin and the publisher have denied this. A German diplomat told Reuters that Badawi was free to publish in Germany whatever he liked, but added: 'The ministry cannot predict the consequences of such a publication for him.' Publisher Siv Bublitz from Ullstein Buchverlage said that the company had 'confidential contacts' with the German government on the Badawi book project. 'At no time have we felt that the exchange was an attempt by the foreign ministry to prevent our publication or to complicate it,' he said on Friday. In another statement issued today, the publisher added Badawi had dictated his remarks to his wife on the phone and that the preface therefore should not be called a letter, as described in earlier statements. The father-of-three (pictured with his children) was sentenced to 10 years in jail and weekly floggings last year . Human rights groups and several Western governments have called on Riyadh to cancel the sentence of 1,000 lashes. Germany's economy minister and vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said during a visit to Riyadh this month that he had discussed human rights issues in Saudi Arabia and had suggested a pardon for Badawi. Badawi's floggings were paused after doctors ruled his scars had not healed sufficiently after his first beating for him to face another round, but the government has so far failed to come up with a long term solution. But earlier this month, it was revealed that he may now face the death penalty after his wife revealed the country's criminal courts want him to face a retrial for apostasy.","Raif Badawi has spoken for first time since being jailed for 'insulting Islam'

"Afghan police have arrested 26 people over the murder of a woman savagely beaten to death in the streets of Kabul after wrongly being accused of burning the Koran. Farkhunda, 27, was pushed from a roof, run over by a car and set on fire before her body was thrown in the Kabul River - in full view of several policeman - last Thursday. On Sunday, grieving women carried the religious scholar's coffin through the streets of the Afghan capital in a dramatic departure from local custom. Pallbearers are traditionally men. It comes as protesters wearing masks of  Farkhunda's bloodied face have marched on Kabul to demand justice for the young teacher. In unprecedented scenes grieving women in the Afghan capital of Kabul have carried the coffin of a woman savagely beaten to death after being wrongly accused of burning the Koran. Afghan women's rights activists carry the coffin of 27-year-old Farkhunda, who was beaten to death by an angry all-male mob in broad daylight in central Kabul on Thursday .

In the city, men are traditionally pallbearers and the sight of only women carrying a coffin marks an extraordinary break with custom . Afghan women's rights activists mourn during the funeral ceremony. Members of Farkhunda's family have denied reports that she was mentally ill, claiming this was a made-up defence to protect her reputation . Senior police officials have since confirmed that they believe the Koran-burning allegations that prompted the attack were false. Members of Farkhunda's family have denied reports that she was mentally ill, claiming this was a made-up defence to protect her reputation. Her father said the 27-year-old worked as an Islamic studies teacher studies and could recite the Koran by heart. He insisted she was not involved in burning the Muslim holy book. 'Farkhunda was a deeply religious girl. She used to recite the holy Koran and pray five times a day,' her brother Najeebullah Malikzada said today. Protesters who gathered near the Shah Doshamshera mosque today demanded the government prosecute all those responsible for the death of Farkhunda, who like many Afghans used only one name.

They carried a banner accusing the government of broking promises to end corruption and bring rule of law to Afghanistan . Afghan security forces stand guard as youth from the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan protest at the site where a mob beat to death Farkhunda . Farkhunda's body was dragged 300 meters (980 feet) along the road in front of the mosque and thrown into the river . Officials said that 26 people have been arrested, and 13 policemen based in the area of the mosque have been suspended amid allegations they stood by and did nothing to stop the attack. One policeman who was present during the attack said the police were overwhelmed by the size of the crowd, which grew throughout the attack. Sayed Habid Shah said that Farkhunda and a fortune teller at the small shrine next to the mosque began arguing, when the fortune teller accused her of burning the Koran. 'She said I am a Muslim and Muslims do not burn the Koran,' Shah  said. 'As more people gathered, the police were trying to push them away, but it got out of control. 'The people pulled her into a corner of the yard and beat her with sticks, and one man took a large stone and dropped it on her. That was the end,' Shah said. Farkhunda's body was then dragged 300 meters (980 feet) along the road in front of the mosque and thrown into the river, he said. Social activists on Monday planted a pine tree on the riverbank spot where Farkhunda's body was set alight. The demonstrators, many of them members of the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan, blocked the road outside the mosque and marched along the riverside route, starting from where the attack began. Many women in the crowd wore masks of Farkhunda's battered and bloodied face, which has appeared widely on social media. They carried a banner accusing the government of broking promises to end corruption and bring rule of law to Afghanistan. Palwasha, who described herself as a social activist, said: 'We demand that the government ensure that all those involved are arrested and that they face an open trial so that justice is implemented and they become an example for others.'

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who took office in September voicing support for women's rights, is currently in Washington on his first state visit to the United States.  Before his departure, he called the killing of Farkhunda a 'heinous attack,' and ordered an investigation. Ghani's wife, Rula, who has spoken up on women's rights, has yet to make a public statement — disappointing some rights activists including film director Sahraa Karimi. 'This is typical of the women in positions of influence in Afghanistan —talking talking no action. How can they be our representatives,' Karimi said . More demonstrations are planned throughout the week to maintain pressure on the authorities to ensure that women's constitutional rights to equality and protection from violence are respected at every level of society, activists said. Farkhunda's funeral was attended by dozens of women's rights activists, several of whom also helped carry her coffin, demanding justice for the young teacher. The mob could be seen stamping on the woman while some stamped on her repeatedly and battered her body with pieces of wood and bricks . Brutal: Mobile phone footage of the attack on Thursday began circulatin on social media this weekend . One of the attackers can be seen repeatedly striking the woman with a piece of wood while another was filmed hurling a brick at her as she lay on the ground . 'This is a crime against this family, a crime against a sister and a crime against humanity,' said Bari Salam, a human rights activist. 'All those involved and all those who supported her killing should be brought to justice,' he said. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the killing as 'heinous' and ordered a commission to investigate the incident. He said police, who play a crucial part in the war against Taliban insurgents, were not well-trained to contain such incidents. 'Almost 90 per cent of the duties of the police today are focused on fighting, which is not their constitutional role, it is not their legal role,' Ghani told reporters on Saturday. 'Focusing on civilian capabilities, on enforcement of the rule of law, is key to us.' In a statement on Sunday, the interior ministry said 13 police officers were suspended, including the police chief responsible for the area. Police separately said they arrested 21 people, including eight policemen. 'I will question the police... we have started our inquiry,' General Zahir Zahir, head of criminal investigation at the interior ministry, said today. 'Even If I get killed, I won't let any of her perpetrators get away with it,' he added.","Funeral for woman killed by all-male mob attended by hundreds .

"A brave rape survivor took the podium at a Maryland state Senate meeting this week and told the frightening tale about being stalked by a man she never met. Jacqueline Kahn was speaking in support of a measure that would allow residents in Maryland to carry concealed weapons for self-defense. The state is currently one of just a handful in the nation that doesn't allow residents to carry firearms on the basis of protection alone. Scroll down for video . Passionate: Rape-survivor Jacqueline Kahn spoke at a Maryland senate committee meeting last week in support of a measure that would allow residents to carry concealed handguns for self defense . 'I need you to know this is so incredibly difficult for me, but I feel like if I don't humanize this, if I don't make it clear how this legislation actually affects your daughters, your mothers, the women of this state, then it's all just a bunch of numbers,' Kahn told lawmakers. In her presentation, Kahn told the Senators about how a man was once arrested in her back yard with duct tape and a knife. 'I wish I could tell you that's the only time I've been stalked, or that's the only man who has stalked anyone in the state of Maryland. But there's a huge number of women, who like me have been raped, who like me have been sexually assaulted — and we want the right to be able to do what we would be allowed to do throughout the majority of the rest of the United States,' she said. Kahn didn't speak about the details of her rape. Right to bear arms: The above states in green allow residents to carry concealed weapons for self defense. Maryland is considering joining these states . Kahn says she enjoys spending her time in 'secluded places' like the beach or on mountain hikes, but that she doesn't feel safe going on these adventures alone, unarmed, in adherence to the current laws. On one outing, Kahn says she was sleeping in a tent, when woke up to a man trying to enter. 'When I'm in my house, I'm allowed to protect myself. But walking along the sidewalk, I'm not. So you make me into a criminal. You force me to decide, do I want to be judged by 12 or carried by six.' Kahn also pulled out a map that shows that most states allow citizens to carry concealed weapons for self-defense purposes. The Maryland State Senate is currently deciding whether to add self-defense to concealed handgun permits.",Jacqueline Kahn was speaking support of measure that would allow residents in Maryland to carry concealed weapons for self defense .
"Niall Boylan and his biological sister Fran Kavanagh, pictured during their first meeting last week, when they were reunited 50 years after being separated . A brother and sister who were separated as babies and put up for adoption five decades ago have been reunited after realising they grew up just 500 metres apart. Niall Boylan, 51, a  radio presenter in Dublin, met his biological sister who now lives in London, Fran Kavanagh, 49, for the first time this weekend after finding each other online last year. Niall, who has a show on Irish radio station 4FM, hit the headlines last year when he spoke about discovering that his birth mother had a little girl when he was just 13 months old in 1965. He said he only learned that he had a sister when the information was disclosed ‘casually’ in a letter from the adoption agency. Niall had been adopted from St Patrick’s Home on Dublin’s Navan Road by Frank and Lily Boylan, and grew up in Raheny with the couple’s biological daughter Geraldine and a younger brother Arthur, who was also adopted. His decision to speak out last year led indirectly to the reunion with sister Fran, who had begun the process of finding out more about the circumstances of her own birth. She was adopted in 1966 by Maria and Christopher Kavanagh from Glasnevin. In recent years, Fran’s sister told her that her birth mother had turned to the courts to try to keep her. ‘I felt I needed to know more,’ she said. ‘When I was given my birth weight and other basic details, I couldn’t believe it.’ Fran went on to meet her birth mother four years ago, an encounter she describes as ‘overwhelming’. However, her birth mother did not tell her about the existence of brother Niall. Last year, she was contacted by an adoption agency telling her they had received a letter from her older brother who wanted to get in touch.  They added that he had announced his wish ‘publicly’. ‘When I heard “publicly”, I was really confused, so myself and my partner Googled “Niall” and “St Patrick’s Home”, and up came this story about Niall. I knew it had to be him. I made contact immediately and we talked for hours.’ St Patrick's mother and baby home on the Navan Road in Dublin, where Niall and Fran's mother was living with them as babies and from where they were adopted .

Niall's original birth document, which registers his birth at St Patrick's Home on September 21, 1963 . She flew to meet her brother for the first time last weekend, along with her partner, and the pair went for dinner and a night out together. ‘It went really well,’ said Niall. ‘We are both delighted. We had spoken on the phone and on Facebook and then finally we met. ‘She’s very like me in many ways. I could hear her personality and we are very similar. You never know how these things will go but this went really well.’ ‘We were in the same crowd, we knew the same people, it’s crazy to think that,’ Niall said. ‘Imagine if we’d ended up going out with each other? This is why people need to know who they are.’ His sister, who has two adult children, said: ‘To meet Niall after all these years is wonderful.’ Both were struck by the fact that they grew up in close proximity to one another. Fran, who works as an estate agent and has a son, 27, and daughter, 22, said: ‘I was born in November 1965, just 13 months after Niall and we would have been in St Patrick’s at the same time. ‘We definitely overlapped, but we were never told.’ Fran’s adoptive family, the Kavanaghs, who she is no longer in touch with after her adopted parents died when she was a teenager, moved from Glasnevin to Raheny, where Niall lived, in 1969. ‘So we were only down the road from each other,’ she pointed out. ‘I went to Tamangos nightclub and Niall would have DJ’d there. We were definitely in each other’s company.’ Niall is a radio presenter on Irish station Classic Hits 4FM. It was through his high media profile that Fran was easily able to track him down and contacted him through his email on the station's website . The pair found out about each other after being sent a letter from an adoption agency. Fran was given the name of her brother and began searching for him online and came across the Irish DJ and got in touch . She pointed out that one of Niall's best friends even DJ'd at her 21st birthday party. Both Niall, a father of three, and Fran have met their biological mother in recent years. She gave birth to a third child, whose care she initially entrusted to her sister-in-law. She eventually married and had a fourth child, and raised her two youngest children with her husband, who was never told of the existence of Niall and Fran. They have considerable sympathy for their birth mother. Niall said: ‘I feel sorry for my mother: she’s old and doesn’t remember a huge amount. ‘She said they [the St Patrick’s home mothers] could be sent out to clean a church, and come back to find their baby gone. ‘She said the mothers would slip notes into their babies’ nappies in the hope that the adoptive parents would keep them and give them to the children later.’ However, Niall says he has drawn a blank in researching his birth father. ‘I asked my mother, “Who is my father?” She was really vague, and said he worked in a church. I asked her was he a priest and she wouldn’t say.’ Fran explained that she had little interest in discovering her background until recent years. Learning ‘basic details’ about her early days, such as her birth weight, made her curious. ‘It was, like, up until then, I wasn’t even born but here I was, on paper, with another life that I didn’t know anything about. ‘I was 46 when I met my mother, and she was 80. She is a frail woman and I had no axe to grind with her. I wasn’t there to beat her up, it was just to meet her. ‘I feel so sorry for those women: they were treated so badly and for her to have found us all means so much to her. Fran Kavanagh (right) with her 27-year-old son (centre) and her 22-year-old daughter (left) together recently . ‘I’m delighted now that I found out. I feel kind of guilty that I didn’t do more before I was 46 but I just accepted the situation. I believed I was a lucky child because I had been adopted. ‘But I could have met Niall a lot sooner.’ The pair plan to meet up again the future and Fran, who will be 50 this year, is holding her birthday party back home in Dublin.","Niall Boylan, 51, met his biological sister for the first time last weekend .

"The Princeton women's basketball team had some presidential support in the stands as they beat Wisconsin-Green Bay at their first NCAA tournament game on Saturday. Barack Obama was on hand to cheer for his niece Leslie Robinson, a freshman forward for the team. The president was joined by his daughter Malia and brother-in-law Craig Robinson, who is Leslie's father. Obama's mother-in-law Marian and other members of the Robinson clan were also in attendance. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama cheers on his niece Leslie Robinson at the Princeton game against Wisconsin-Green Bay women's college basketball game in the first round of the NCAA tournament . The president was joined by his daughter Malia and brother-in-law Craig Robinson, who is Leslie's father. Both first lady Michelle Obama and her brother Craig are Princeton alums . Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a former professional basketball player and a Chicago pal of the president, also attended. Although most of Obama's group wore orange 'Tiger Pride' T-shirts to support the Princeton team, the president kept it traditional with a dark brown sweater. Both first lady Michelle Obama, who is currently traveling in Cambodia, and her brother Craig are Princeton alums. It wasn't just family favoritism that got Obama cheering from the stands in College Park, Maryland. The president had selected Princeton to make it to the final four on his March Madness bracket. And although his niece didn't play in the game, there was still plenty of excitement to witness as the undefeated eighth-seeded Princeton team overcame a tight first half to win 80-70. It was the first time the women's team had won an NCAA game in Princeton's history. Obama (pictured with daughter Malia and nephew Avery Robinson) stood out in a sea of 'Tiger Pride' T-shirts in his brown sweater . Obama and Craig Robinson react to Wisconsin-Bay scoring against Princeton. Princeton won the game 80-70 and remained undefeated . Even the president couldn't distract Courtney Banghart, the team's coach, from the important tournament game. Banghart said she frequently saw Obama during the game because he was sitting right in front of her family. 'I'd be like, ""Oh my God. It's Barack"". But it certainly wasn't my focus,' she said. But Banghart said having the president in the stands will certainly 'go down as a highlight.' Even the opposing team's coach had to get it on the Obama action. 'The president came. I'm going to let my guard down for a minute and be excited about that,' said Green Bay coach Kevin Borseth. 'I shook his hand. And I got a picture.' A brief chant of 'Four more years!' rose from some spectators during the game's second half, drawing a chuckle from Obama. Security was increased due to the president's presence, with metal detectors and bomb-sniffing dogs present at the stadium's entrance. Obama's niece Leslie Robinson (pictured during a game against American University in November) is a freshman forward for the team. She did not appear in the NCAA game .","Obama attended the game with his daughter Malia and brother-in-law Craig Robinson, as well as his nephew and mother-in-law .

"Video has emerged of the LAPD pulling over the 20-year-old son of Taraji P. Henson that appears to refute claims made by the Empire actress that he was racially profiled by police. Henson hit headlines earlier this week by revealing in an interview that her son, Marcel Henson, was stopped in Glendale for no reason, then doing 'exactly everything the cops told him to do, including letting them illegally search his car'. 'It was bogus because they didn't give him the ticket for what he was pulled over for,' she told Interview magazine. However the just-surfaced dashcam footage, taken in October last year, shows that Henson drove through a lighted crosswalk as a pedestrian walked across. After being questioned, Henson admitted to having marijuana and Ritalin on him. He was also found to hash oil, a grinder and a knife. Scroll down for video . Traffic stop: Footage has emerged of police pulling over Marcel Henson, son of actress Taraji P Henson, in Glendale, California, in October. Henson said this week her son was racially profiled during the stop . New footage: Despite Henson saying her son was pulled over for no reason, he actually ran a lighted crosswalk as a pedestrain crossed and admitted to having marijuana and Ritalin on him . Sobriety test: Marcel Henson, 20, told the officer he had smoked marijuana two hours before driving, and the officer asks him to get out of the car to see if he is under the influence, but determines he isn't . Taraji P. Henson saaid her son Marcel was racially profiled by police in Glendale and at tje University of Southern California. The mother and son are pictured above at a film screening in Hollywood last April . The knife turned out to be legal. Henson said he had a prescription for the marijuana but could not find it. He said he did not have a prescription for the Ritalin and that a friend had given it to him. However the officer, who seems very generous when dealing with Henson, lets the teen off with a citation for marijuana possession only. The dashcam footage was obtained by The Los Angeles Times, which noted that race did not seem to be a factor when Henson was first pulled over. 'I am not going to give you a citation for running that yellow because that would actually put a moving violation on your driving license, and you are going to have to go to traffic school and all that stuff, so I am helping you by not giving you a violation on it. All I am going to do is take the weed from you,' the officer can be heard saying in the video. The officer told Henson he could go to court with the citation and show proof he has a prescription for medical marijuana. Otherwise he could just pay a fine. 'It felt like this was a little better than the other one,' the officer said. 'I am giving this to you too because you smoked weed about two hours ago… and a warning if you have Ritalin on you and you're not supposed to, don't do it. 'That's a big violation and I wouldn't want to do that to you.' The boy's mother made her controversial comments to Uptown magazine earlier in the week. The Empire star said that not only was her son pulled over by police, but was stopped by cops at the University of Southern California for 'having his hands in his pocket. Henson revealed she had planned to transfer Marcel to USC, but had now decided to send the 20-year-old to the historically black Howard University, her alma mater. Empire star Henson, 44, says her son was stopped at the University of California (file picture) for no other reason than having his hands in his pockets . A University of Southern California chief vowed to carry out his own investigation into the alleged incident Henson spoke about in the magazine. The school's Public Safety director, John Thomas, said he was 'disturbed' by the reports. After learning of the USC allegation, Thomas revealed that he too had experienced racial profiling as a teenager . In a statement, he said: 'I was deeply disturbed to read news reports about a prospective student who felt profiled on or near campus because of his race. 'We encourage reporting of allegations of bias and I hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother. Henson has revealed she has now decided to send her 20-year-old son Marcel to historically-black college . 'I would like to look into this matter further and better understand who was involved and what took place. 'As someone who personally experienced racial profiling as a teenager, I have a stake in learning more about this incident and doing all I can to reach a just resolution.' He said he was not yet clear on which police departments were involved and that 'any allegation of bias or unequal treatment by university officers would trigger an investigation that I would supervise along with the university's Office of Equity and Diversity'. He continued: 'It is my expectation and that of the university that our department uphold the highest standards of constitutional policing, affording equal rights and respect to all persons.' Marcel is Henson's only child, and his father was her high school sweetheart. New hit: Henson currently stars on Fox drama Empire as Cookie Lyon, the recently-released-from-prison ex-wife of a music mogul (played by Terrence Howard) After revealing her son's ordeal, the 44-year-old said in the interview: 'So guess where he's going? Howard University. I'm not paying $50K so I can't sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus. Also in the interview, Henson spoke about how happy she was to be one of now many black women leads on the small screen in shows like Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder. 'It feels good that there's not just one black person. I don't like that we get fixated on one or two at a time, or three at a time. If you look at Caucasian Hollywood, every year there's a handful of new faces you've never seen before, then after that, they got five movies coming out and they're introducing you to more talent. So I'm just so happy to see what's happening on television right now. We have options and that's how it should be,' Henson said. Proud mother: Henson and her son pictured on January 20, 2013 - attending a celebration for leading women in Washington, DC . Empire aired it's two-hour first-season finale last week, and has already been green-lighted for a second season. Henson plays Cookie Lyon on the show, the ex-wife of a rap music mogul (played by Terrence Howard) who was recently released from prison after taking the fall for his drug-dealing business. The show has had several guest starts in the music industry including Snoop Dog, Courtney Love, Rita Ora, and Jennifer Hudson.","Taraji P.

"It weighs just half an ounce and its natural home is a tree. But tiny songbird the blackpoll warbler routinely undertakes non-stop flights of up to 1,700 miles across open ocean, scientists have confirmed. The heroic journeys are 'on the brink of impossibility', according to one of the researchers who attached tracking devices to 40 birds. Long journey: The blackpoll warbler routinely undertakes flights of up to 1,700 miles, flying without stopping to rest, eat or drink across the Atlantic . Experts had long wondered about tantalising clues that suggested the warbler was capable of epic migrations between North and South America. Now they have proof that it really does fly without stopping to rest, eat or drink across the Atlantic. Unlike other migratory songbirds travelling south for the winter, the warbler ignores the safe option of hugging the coastline through Mexico and Central America. Instead it risks death by flying hundreds of miles from land even though it cannot land on water and live. Nice flight: A blackpoll warbler wearing a miniature tracking device . US scientists were astonished when they analysed data from some of the birds they tracked from New England and Canada to the Caribbean, Venezuela and Colombia. Dr Bill DeLuca, from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said: 'It was pretty thrilling to get the return birds back, because their migratory feat in itself is on the brink of impossibility. 'When we accessed the locators, we saw the blackpolls' journey was indeed directly over the Atlantic. The distances travelled ranged from 1,410 to 1,721 miles.' He added: 'For small songbirds, we are only just now beginning to understand the migratory routes that connect temperate breeding grounds to tropical wintering areas. 'We're really excited to report that this is one of the longest non-stop over-water flights ever recorded for a songbird, and finally confirms what has long been believed to be one of the most extraordinary migratory feats on the planet.' For the study, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, the scientists captured 20 birds in Vermont and another 20 in Nova Scotia and fitted them with geolocator packs. The devices, each about the size of a 5p piece, were attached using leg harnesses, much like a rucksack. Too small to house GPS receivers, they operated by means of 'solar geolocation' - a method used for centuries by mariners and explorers. It is based on the fact that day length varies with latitude and the time of solar noon - when the sun is at its highest point in the sky - varies with longitude.","Blackpoll warbler undertakes non-stop flights of up to 1,700 miles .

"Explosive new revelations of the police and establishment cover-up over Cyril Smith’s paedophile past emerged last night. A retired police officer said the 29-stone Liberal MP was protected by a sex-offender sergeant after he was caught at a sex party with two boys. Smith walked free and the retired officer – then a probationary beat bobby – was threatened with the Official Secrets Act and told to stay silent by his colleague Don Mackintosh, who himself turned out to be a paedophile. Paedophile: A detective says he was ordered to cover up Cyril Smith's crimes by senior colleagues . Yesterday, after 27 years, the former Greater Manchester officer broke cover to reveal his anger amid growing fury over how Smith repeatedly escaped prosecution during four decades of appalling abuse. His revelations mean Smith escaped possible prosecution at least eight times after orders were made at the highest level to cover up his crimes. Last year the Daily Mail blew the lid off Smith’s perverted past when it serialised Simon Danczuk’s book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith. The Mail revealed how the Rochdale MP had repeatedly escaped police and court action for decades despite leaving a trail of young victims in his wake. Don Mackintosh, who turned out to be paedophile, threatened the officer with the Official Secrets Act and told him to stay silent . The strong suggestion has always been that the establishment conspired – via the police and security services – to protect the MP who was seen as a useful bulwark against the hard Left. Last night Greater Manchester Police announced a new inquiry into the claims. They were made just days after it was revealed that Smith had been arrested at a similarly sordid event in London but was let off. And yesterday another police force, Northamptonshire, disclosed that it, too, was probing suggestions that it let Smith off the hook in the 1980s when it discovered child pornography in his car. Labour MP Mr Danczuk said last night: ‘More police officers are now coming forward to share their anger and disgust at how there was simply no appetite to prosecute Cyril for child abuse. ‘Cyril Smith was a prolific abuser of children and I’ve no doubt that he was on the radar of a number of police forces.’ Earlier this week the independent police watchdog revealed it is overseeing 14 separate claims of cover-ups and corruption in historic sex abuse case by Scotland Yard. Prime Minister David Cameron has already guaranteed that police whistle-blowers will not be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act if they come forward. The retired Greater Manchester officer was threatened with the Official Secrets Act after he discovered Smith at the party with a prolific sex offender and two drunk teenage boys in 1988. The officer said: ‘I had been in the force about six months. The occupier was about 70 and seemed an old granddad type. Earlier this week the independent police watchdog revealed it is overseeing 14 separate claims of cover-ups and corruption in historic sex abuse case by Scotland Yard . 'In the house was Cyril Smith and a police sergeant in civilian clothes. The officer identified himself and showed his warrant card, saying he was there “on other business”. ‘There seemed to be a party going on, with two young lads there. Smith and the officer left. The boys, aged about 14 to 15, were drunk. 'One was missing from a children’s home. I called for a van and took him back. The other lad walked off. ‘The old man was arrested and I took him to the main police station in Stockport.’ The following day, the officer says, he was called to a meeting by a senior officer and his mentoring officer, Sergeant Mackintosh, who was later exposed as a prolific child abuser and who was found hanged in his home last year. The officer said: ‘I was told I would break the Official Secrets Act if I told anyone. In no uncertain terms I was told to say nothing. They knew Smith was there and knew who he was.’ Greater Manchester Assistant Chief Constable Ian Wiggett said: ‘These fresh allegations will now be examined by Operation Clifton, a criminal investigation into how previous reports of child sexual abuse were handled or allegedly covered up. These allegations are concerning and will be treated seriously.’","Retired police officer said MP was protected by sex-offender sergeant .

Camilla listened attentively as Charles addressed guests on their last night in the U.S. At the gala dinner Prince Charles was awarded the ICCF Teddy Roosevelt Award for Exceptional Leadership in Conservation before offering his own pearls of wisdom from the stage. The gala is billed as the most important annual conservation gathering of U.S. members of Congress, foreign heads of state, ambassadors, corporate executives, conservation legends, celebrities, and NGO and civil society leaders to celebrate conservation successes. Addressing the gala dinner, Charles praised the United States for its long term commitment to the environment, citing President Franklin Roosevelt who sought to protect the nation's wildlife and open spaces. He said: 'The world has looked to the United States for leadership in so many challenging circumstances in the past. 'However, today we are faced by truly exceptional challenges and threats - a veritable ""perfect storm"" which, if not met by strong, decisive and far-sighted leadership, could overwhelm our capacity to rectify the damage and thereby destroy our grandchildren's future inheritance.' He listed his areas of concern from the continuing destruction of rainforests, to the threat to endangered animals like rhinos, elephants and tigers and the need for sustainable cities.

The Prince is presented with an award for his work as an environment leader for more than 40 years . Prince Charles accepts the award for his 'extraordinary' conservation leadership on a four-day visit to the US . The prince told the invited guests: 'I repeatedly hear it said - as I am sure you do - that looking after nature is too costly; a barrier to growth and a danger to economic competitiveness. 'So long as this perspective prevails, then I fear the destruction of natural systems will be seen as in some way rational and an unavoidable price of progress.' Today Charles and Camilla will proceed to Louisville, Kentucky, for the final stop on their trip. They will attend a cultural festival hosted by the Governor of Kentucky and Mayor of Louisville at the Kentucky Center for African American Heritage Center. Camilla will visit Neighborhood House, a community center serving Portland, one of Louisville’s oldest and most diverse, but also most impoverished communities.

The Brooke is an international animal welfare organisation dedicated to improving the lives of working horses, donkeys and mules in some of the world's poorest communities. They will then return to the U.K. in the evening. Earlier yesterday President Obama told Prince Charles that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting at the White House. A slightly awkward Prince Charles responded, 'I don't believe that,' before pausing and then quickly moving the topic on to his visit the previous day to Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington. The two men last talked face to face almost four years ago when Charles flew to America a few days after the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. This time he was joined by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Vice President Joe Biden made an appearance. The Prince and the President sat together while Camilla and Mr Biden sat nearby, opposite each other on sofas. President Obama joked this afternoon that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting with Prince Charles at the White House . The pair met in the Oval Office for the second time since Obama took office. Vice President Joe Biden was also present . Dozens of photographers, journalists and cameramen had been allowed into the room and the Prince looked around as camera shutters went off and boom microphones were pushed towards them. Charles looked a little bemused but he pointed out one of the British press corps out to the President - a veteran royal photograher from the British tabloid newspaper, the Sun. He told Mr Obama he had been photographing the Prince for more than 35 years and when he added that the first president he had reported on in the US was Ronald Reagan, the American leader replied 'Awesome'. Obama is the sixth American president to entertain the Royal, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last. Earlier in the day the Prince of Wales paid a visit to the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington D.C to meet veterans. His wife Camilla looked on admiringly as Charles tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself. The couple had begun their day by visiting President Abraham Lincoln's cottage and were met by Erin Carlson Mast who is in charge of maintaining the property. Mrs Mast also had presents to dispense: a book entitled Lincoln's Sanctuary for Charles and another called What Do You Do With An Idea for his grandson, Prince George. Afterwards, the royal couple were ushered to the Armed Forces Retirement Home and were whisked into the Scott Building which houses many of the residents.

"A groom who had a baby and got married on the same day has been spared jail after he glassed a guest at the reception. Karl and Jasmine Storey got married at Gretna Green, Scotland, in October last year - just hours after the 27-year-old gave birth to their baby boy Anthony. The family then returned to their hometown of Kielder, Northumberland, for the wedding reception at a local pub where a fight erupted, a court heard. Karl and Jasmine Storey married at Gretna Green in October last year, hours after she gave birth to their son Anthony (pictured) Newcastle Crown Court was told that the 26-year-old had spotted his brother Dale Storey, 20, being confronted by another guest and intervened by striking a pint glass over the other man. The guest had been leaving the reception with his daughter, who worked behind the bar but had been drinking after her shift, when he was told that Dale had possibly spiked her drink. He had returned to confront Dale when the row, which was captured on CCTV, broke out and resulted in the man, who has not been named, being taken to hospital. Prosecuting, Emma Dowling said: 'The victim's daughter works at the bar where the reception was taking place. 'She finished her shift and got very drunk very quickly leading to her and her father leaving the bar. 'As they were leaving, the victim heard whispers that Dale Storey had purposely got her very drunk with heavy spirits and potentially spiked her. He returned to the bar to confront him and pushed Dale. 'Karl Storey comes across and strikes him in the face with a pint glass before Dale joins in and gets the victim in a headlock before numerous punches are thrown. 'The victim describes being punched a number of times and had blood running down his face. The males were then split up.' The guest sustained six or seven small cuts to his eye and was taken to hospital for treatment that night. Miss Dowling read from the victim impact statement saying the victim was 'disgusted by the attack' and feels he could have been 'blinded'. At the wedding reception, the groom (centre with Mrs Storey) spotted his brother in an argument and intervened by smashing a glass on the guest's head . At 7.40am that morning, Mrs Storey gave birth to their son before they made the 45-mile round trip to Gretna for the wedding. They were chauffeured between the hospital, wedding and reception by Karl's other brother, Bryan. Speaking at the time, Karl said: 'He was as good as gold during the ceremony and it's turned out to be the most amazing day of my life. I can't take it all in.' Defending Donald Mcfall said: 'The defendant comes from a stable home, is a very dedicated family man and is a hard working individual. 'He has four children which requires a great deal of dedication. 'Karl and his brother were simply standing in the reception when Karl saw his brother being attacked and he's then reacted to it. 'The single punch he threw with the glass in hand was not intentional and he did not intend to use it as a weapon. 'He was trying to stop this man from attacking his brother. He regrets his actions and insists there was no bad blood previous and there is none now. He expresses full remorse.' Kate Barnes, also for the defence, said: 'He has no previous convictions and left school with a number of qualifications. He strongly denies spiking anyone's drink that night. 'It was supposed to be a happy day and on that occasion he had drunk in excess, something he does not normally do. 'He is not unintelligent and has a great deal of insight into what happened that evening. He expresses full remorse for his actions. 'His part in this was to deliver one or two blows which seemingly aren't responsible for any of the victim's injuries.' Karl Storey was given a suspended sentence at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) and his brother Dale was also given a similar sentence . Karl Storey pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and Dale Storey pleaded guilty to common assault. Ms Recorder Turner, sentenced Karl  to a 12 month suspended sentence, with an 160 unpaid work requirement and a compensation charge of £500. The judge sentenced Dale to a 12 month community order with an 100 hours unpaid work requirement and a compensation charge of £100. The judge said: 'The 31st of October should have been a very happy day because it was your wedding day and your wife had given birth to a baby boy. 'You had both enjoyed the wedding and were celebrating that and the new arrival of the baby boy to the family. You both had far too much to drink and this is something you must watch. 'I am not going to send either of you prison today but I still want you to realise this is a very serious matter. 'I have watched the CCTV and it seems something was troubling the complainant. What followed after that was an attack that lasted quite some time. 'You must understand that you can't keep acting like this and you're lucky that the victim did not have more injuries. 'Ordinarily, it seems you are both decent young men and I believe both of you do not pose a real threat to the public.' 'Let's hope this was just a minor blip in both your lives.'","Karl and Jasmine Storey got married at Gretna Green in October last year .

"Fit mom Maria Kang has launched a new campaign celebrating more than 100 'no excuse' parents who have overcome their reasons for not working out and made exercising a part of their daily lives. The 34-year-old mom rose to fame in 2013 when she shared a controversial photo of her toned body posed next to her three young sons with the tagline: 'What's Your Excuse?' Although she was accused of 'fat-shaming', among other things, she used her notoriety to form The No Excuse Mom Group, in which she started hundreds of free workout communities in more than 25 countries. Ms Kang, whose No More Excuses Diet book is debuting next week, is now prompting her fans and fellow exercise enthusiasts to share their own photos and stories as a part of her No More Excuses campaign. Scroll down for video . Inspiring mom: Maria Kang, 34 has shared her own image as a part of her new No Excuses campaign, which celebrates those who have overcome their reasons for not working out and are now living a healthier lifestyle . Amazing attitude: Jamie Goodwin refused to let being in a wheelchair stop her from exercising . The posters, which are being shared across a number of social media platforms, feature images of men and women who have incorporated fitness into their lives along with bullet points explaining their past excuses, their reasons for changing their ways and their current successes. While the 'stars' of the movement come in all shapes and sizes, they are all proud of their progress and the difficulties they had to overcome. Ms Kang has even shared her own picture, in which she notes that she has excess skin, stretchmarks and has been publicly criticized and even called a bad mother. Fitness fanatic: Vanessa Campos shared that she still works out despite having multiple surgeries . Fast moms: Best friends Lacy Anderson and Ashley Gentile train for races together as a part of their fitness routines . Pretty in pink: Kim Dolan Leto, 46, started taking gymnastics classes when she was 30, proving that age doesn't matter when it comes to fitness . 'Deep Breath...I don't like showing my ""flaws"", but I'm a hypocrite if I don't accept all of me,' she wrote on Facebook of the photo. 'You will notice hundreds of No More Excuses pictures flooding social media this week - so here is mine.' She added: 'I was called a lot of mean things in the past year, but one thing's for sure...sometimes the best response, is a revolution!' In addition to revealing her own photo, the new author has been posting others' images to her Facebook page and thanking them for sharing their inspirational stories. Happy family: Maria Lemontagne proudly bears the weight of her two sons while posing in the plan position for campaign photo . Family resemblance: Belinda Centeno and her daughter flexed their muscles for the No More Excuses movement . No fear: Cyndilou Brignac kept her balance as she posed holding a weight with her other arm flexed . 'Incredibly proud of some of the images flooding my timeline today,' she wrote earlier this week. 'It doesn't matter where you are, stop making excuses and change will happen. ‪#‎nomoreexcuses‬.' Ms Kang, who quickly worked off her baby weight after all three of her pregnancies, has been married to former marine David Casler since 2010. Their boys are now aged six, four and three. The busy mom is also the owner of elderly residential care homes and the founder of her nonprofit Fitness without Borders, which funds her No Excuse Mom Group.

And now she is sharing her 'long-term and sustainable' diet and fitness plan with her new book, which she called a 'labor of love'. But Ms Kang had her own body struggles throughout her twenties. 'I was bulimic,' she told Cosmopolitan. 'I was addicted to the endorphins in my body every single time I vomited. It went on from about age 23 until I was 27.' She eventually overcame her eating disorder and began to live a healthier lifestyle. During her first pregnancy, she started to love and value her body more than ever. Life changing: Ms Kang rose to fame in 2013 after she shared this controversial picture. Many people accused her of 'fat-shaming' other mothers . Big goals: She is now the author of her own No More Excuses Diet book, which hits shelves next week . Before and After: Ms Kang, who has three songs ages six, four and three, said it took her about eight months to lose the weight after each of her pregnancies . And while she lost the baby weight after each of her pregnancies, she doesn't expect new mothers to be back in their skinny jeans in a month. 'It's not like I snapped back - it took me eight months,' she explained. 'My average weight loss per week was half a pound, which is not a lot of weight.' Ms Kang maintained that it is 'just so annoying' to hear excuses. 'I think that you either want it or you don't,' she said. 'You really have to make that choice, take accountability, and own your actions.' Buckled up: The busy mom shared this photo of her and husband David Casler taking their sons on a drive . Body image: Ms Kang showed off her stretch marks and posed for this selfie with one of her sons .

"Three American teachers are part of a group of ten finalists from across the world who could win $1million dollars and a title that's considered to be the Nobel Prize of teaching. The winner of the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize, which is awarded to a teacher for his or her efforts in promoting global citizenship in the classroom, will be announced on Sunday in Dubai. Aside from committing to being a teacher for at least five more years, the winner can spend the $1million on whatever they'd like. The three American finalists together have almost 75 years of experience in classrooms, according to USA Today. Nancie Atwell, 63, is an English and writing teacher in Maine. She founded a private demonstration school in Edgecomb and is the author of nine books. She began teaching in 1973. Naomi Volain, 56, is a high school science teacher in Springfield, Massachusetts. Though she was originally a nutritionist - then a medical copywriter - her hands-on lessons in environmental science and outdoor education during her 17 years of teaching have won much praise. Nancie Atwell, 63, is an English and writing teacher in Maine. She founded an experimental private demonstration school in Edgecomb for kindergarteners through eighth graders in 1990 . Stephen Ritz, 52, is an elementary school teacher in New York City's South Bronx area. He created a low-cost and portable gardening and nutrition program which led him and his students to install more than 100 gardens throughout New York. Atwell said she's 'convinced that teaching language arts is one of the great careers', because it's 'demanding', but also 'meaning-filled' and 'interesting'. She said: 'I get to demonstrate what is possible, teach what is useful, establish conditions that invite engagement, support the hard work of literary reading and writing, and enjoy the kinds of relationships with adolescents that drew me to education in the first place. 'Because my students select the books they read and the subjects they write about, I'm able to help them discover what reading and writing are good for, here and now and in their literate lives to come. 'There is nothing more important than putting the right book in a child's hands at the right time.' Atwell founded the Center for Teaching and Learning in 1990, which uses experimental teaching methods on students in kindergarten through eighth grade. She built an 'excellent classroom library',  in hopes of letting her own students discover what they wanted to read on their own. 'I worry that educational bureaucrats have a problem with pleasure,' she told USA Today, 'that if kids are enjoying what they're doing, it can't be rigorous or worthwhile.' If Atwell wins the prize, she said she will donate 'every penny' to the Center for Teaching and Learning. Naomi Volain, 56, is a high school science teacher in Springfield, Massachusetts. She has been a teacher for 17 years and her hands-on lessons in environmental science and outdoor education have won much praise . Volain said when she heard about the $1million prize, she told herself, 'Forget it. There are all of these teachers who are presenting internationally and doing big, big things'. But her own colleagues were inspired by Volain and her desire to have her students take part in lab work and go outside. She has spread her environmental education knowledge into as many classrooms as she can. 'I love teaching, and teaching science, because it allows me to learn and work along with my students,' she said. 'It's the shared experience that is so meaningful to me. Science is curiosity based - finding out why - with eyes, hands and mind. Science is collaborative, science communicates, and science is just so cool.' Ritz, who calls himself the 'Chief Eternal Optimist' of Bronx County, was originally a high school special education teacher but moved into urban gardening after the September 11 attacks. He and his students planted 15,000 daffodil bulbs across the city and now his gardening program grows 37 different vegetables, fruits and herbs. With a goal of sending students home with 100 bags of produce every week, he has established a food production business that focuses on maintaining 'food security' for families in neighborhoods that have limited access for fresh produce. Stephen Ritz, 52, is an elementary school teacher in New York City's South Bronx area. He created a low-cost and portable gardening and nutrition program which led him and his students to install more than 100 gardens throughout New York to help families that have limited access to fresh produce . He is currently converting a library at Public School 55 into a 2,000-square-food greenhouse and library. 'I love teaching because every day I get to do something great. Every day I get to lead children and colleagues on a new quest, we get to do something new, we practice, we dream, we learn and we work together,' he said about his program. 'I'm also the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet; inherently, I too am very curious and easily excited - it's a perfect storm,' he added. The winning teacher will be chosen by a global academy made up of prominent individuals, including academy award winning actor Kevin Spacey; social activist Geoffrey Canada; entrepreneur Baroness Martha Lane Fox; and Carina Wong, Deputy Director of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Wendy Kopp, CEO Teach for all; Brett Wigdortz, Founder of Teach first; Grammy award winning musician Esperanza Spalding; Nigerian businessman Jubril Adewale Tinubu; and Vice-Principal, Tsinghua International School, China, are also on the panel. The prize, which was launched in March 2014, aims to 'raise teacher respect across the world' and unearth 'thousands of stories of heroes that have transformed young people's lives', according to a press release from the foundation. The top ten finalists were chosen from 50 shortlisted candidates that came from a pool of more than 5,000 nominations from 127 countries including the United States, UK, Italy, Kenya, Uganda, India, Afghanistan, Australia, Argentina, Mexico and Jordan. The remaining finalists come from the United States, UK, India, Haiti, Kenya, Cambodia, Afghanistan and Indonesia. The United States is the only country to have more than one finalist in the top ten.","Nanci Atwell, Naomi Volain and Stephen Ritz are three of ten finalists for the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize, which will be announced Sunday .

"Moments after last night's TV contest came off air, Labour's election chief Douglas Alexander was briefing journalists on how well his man had done. Without doubt Ed Miliband had won, he declared confidently. But he was cut off mid-sentence by news that the first poll was in, which told a different story. Some 54 per cent of people thought David Cameron had triumphed, which is a slender win for the Tory camp who have grown complacent about the idea that Mr Miliband's dire personal ratings will stop his path to Number 10. Two snap polls after the TV election contest gave David Cameron the lead - but only just . David Cameron and Ed Miliband were interviewed by Jeremy Paxman and questioned by an audience of voters as part of the first TV election contest of the campaign . Pollster ICM said its snap verdict giving a narrow victory for Mr Cameron in the first of the leaders' election broadcasts represented the company's 'best guess' of the nationwide response. In is survey for the Guardian it found that 46 per cent  felt that Mr Cameron had the best arguments, as against 44 per cent who said the same of Mr Miliband. The Prime Minister was judged marginally more convincing than the panel, by a difference of 48 per cent to 43 per cent. The ICM panel also felt Mr Cameron better answered the questions he was asked, winning on this measure by 44 per cent to 37 per cent. In a boost for Labour,56 per cent of floating voters said they were more likely to vote Labour, compared with 30 per cent more likely to vote Conservative. However, those in this section of the group were only a very small sub-set of the wider group. A separate YouGov App result found 51 per cent thought Mr Cameron won, with Mr Miliband on 49 per cent. The two men vying for the keys to Number 10 on May 7 did not go head-to-head but instead appeared separately to be interviewed by Paxman and questioned by an audience of voters. In an 18-minute grilling, Mr Cameron was forced to defend not cutting immigration while putting up VAT, questioned about the rise of food banks in Britain and his failure to spell out where £12billion in welfare cuts will come from. Jeremy Paxman appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing Prime Minister David Cameron . And he appeared taken aback when asked about the company he keeps, including a minister caught up in a tax scandal, a spin doctor jailed for phone hacking and being friends with Jeremy Clarkson, who was sacked from Top Gear after punching a colleague. But Mr Miliband faced a difficult ride time from both the studio audience and Paxman about whether he is tough enough to lead the country. The Labour leader insisted: 'Am I tough enough? Hell, yes, I'm tough enough.' The contest was played out on social media, with almost every TV-related tweet sent last night discussing the election contest. In a blog post, Twitter cited Kantar Media analysis stating the debate made up 94.7 per cent of UK Twitter conversation about TV over the evening, with more than 300,000 tweets sent by 10.15pm. There were more mentions of Mr Cameron than Mr Miliband but Labour saw more mentions than the Conservatives, while the moment that generated the most tweets came at the end of the debate as Mr Paxman asked the Labour leader: 'Are you OK, Ed?' Ukip leader Nigel Farage and media mogul Rupert Murdoch were among those whose eyes were glued to Sky and Channel 4's much-anticipated question and answer session with David Cameron and Ed Miliband. The debate accounted for 94.7 per cent of UK Twitter conversation about TV over the evening, with more than 300,000 tweets sent by 10.15pm . When the Labour leader declared he was tough enough to be prime minister by virtue of having stood up to Mr Murdoch, the News International owner tweeted: 'Thanks for 2 mentions, Ed Miliband. Only met once for all of 2 minutes when you embarrassed me with over the top flattery.' Former Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother star Katie Hopkins was not impressed with Miliband either, tweeting: 'If this man is Prime Minister I will leave the UK. This man is not Great Britain. This is Russell Brand in a chuffing suit.' And Ann Summer's CEO Jacqueline Gold said: 'This is not the same Labour Party that people voted for under Blair. Miliband is like Kinnock without the personality.' But Mr Farage had a kind word for his Labour counterpart, tweeting: 'Miliband is showing more humour and courage than Cameron! BattleForNumber10.' But he attacked Mr Miliband over Europe and immigration and mocked Mr Cameron for being 'smarmy'. The South Thanet parliamentary candidate said: 'His constant complimenting of audience for their questions is making Cameron look rather smarmy and lacking in sincerity.' Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell felt it was good night for Mr Miliband. He said: 'Good night for Ed, neutral for Kay, bad for Jeremy, dire for Dave.' Others questioned Mr Paxman's skills as an interviewer, with Apprentice boss Lord Sugar tweeting: 'I think Miliband made mincemeat out of Paxman.' Piers Morgan weighed in, tweeting: 'Paxman eviscerated Cameron with such masterful savagery ... that Cameron won all the debate polls.' But Match Of The Day host Gary Lineker backed the former Newsnight anchor, saying: 'Audience questions after Paxman is like when Spurs bring on Soldado for Harry Kane.' As did BBC presenter Andrew Neil: 'Paxo was superb tonight. But winging it towards end with Miliband. Seemed better prepared against Cameron.' And he added: 'Miliband was struggling at times but viewers will perhaps think he stood up better to Paxo than the PM.'","ICM/Guardian poll found 54% thought Cameron won with Miliband on 46% .

"A spate of motor accidents involving tourists have prompted concerned New Zealand motorists to confiscate the keys of foreigners to prevent them from driving. Following the death of eight people  in crashes involving tourists in the past fortnight, five incidents of key confiscation have been reported in the nation's South Island, an area  which featured heavily in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy films. New Zealand Prime Minister  John Key said that 'people taking the law into their own hands is not sensible'. Diesel mechanic Robert Penman, of Dunedin, took the keys of a Chinese couple when they stopped their car in the middle of a one lane road, and waited for police to attend the incident . Foreign drivers are involved in 37% of road crashes in the Westland District, on the South Island's West Coast, despite only 6% of crashes overall in the country involving tourists. 558 crashes involving tourists occurred in the past 12 months, with over 75% of the accidents found to be the fault of the foreign driver, reported The Mercury. New Zealand Police's Assistant Commissioner of Road Policing, Dave Cliff, told CNN that the incidents of key confiscation were hard to police as there was no specific law relating to the issue. He reiterated that violence, even to prevent a tourist driving 'dangerously' would not be tolerated, 'and anyone found doing so should expect to face the consequences'. Assistant Commissioner Cliff's comments follow the assault of a tourist driving on the West Coast by a man who was unhappy with his driving. The tourist was punched in the face and had his keys taken from him, with local police labelling the incident unnecessary and 'nasty', reported The New Zealand Herald. 'I have no problem with doing it again. If it saves people's lives I have no problem with it,' said Mr Penman . 30,000 people have signed a petition, currently before Parliament, to force tourists to sit a safety test before being allowed to drive on New Zealand roads . A family of four from Hong Kong collided with a logging truck, killing all in the vehicle . West Coast's Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn, said while there was definitely an issue in the area, he was worried that 'extremist behaviour' from local drivers were becoming more common. He labelled the violence 'disgraceful' and 'inappropriate', and called for greater driver education. The Assistant Commissioner assured the New Zealand public at the time that police were not complacent about driver safety, but urged people to contact police if they were concerned, rather than resorting to the confiscation of keys. Diesel mechanic Robert Penman, of Dunedin, took the keys of a Chinese couple when they stopped their car in the middle of a one lane road, and waited for police to attend the incident. 'I have no problem with doing it again. If it saves people's lives I have no problem with it,' he told The New Zealand Herald. 'I've been in a head-on crash before and I don't want to be in another one...Everywhere I have been people say 'good on you' for standing up,' Mr Penman said. 30,000 people have signed a petition, currently before Parliament, to force tourists to sit a safety test before being allowed to drive on New Zealand roads. However,  a Queenstown judge ruled on Monday that it was not the responsibility of rental car companies to assess the competency of drivers, and rather up to the individual driver to determine their own abilities. Earlier in the month a 39-year-old Taiwanese female teacher was charged with careless driving causing death and careless driving causing injury. 558 crashes involving tourists occurred in the past 12 months, with over 75% of the accidents found to be the fault of the foreign driver . Five incidents of key confiscation have been reported in the nation's South Island, an area which featured heavily in Peter Jackson's (above left) The Lord of the Rings trilogy films . She was driving to the airport in a rented van with six family members when she drove through a stop sign, causing the death of her father and seriously injuring her mother. Paul Whitmell, 57, and his wife Rosa, 54, were driving from Mt Cook to Te Anau, when they were involved in a head-on collision with Chinese driver Qian Li, 34, on Gibbston Highway on February 21. The British couple suffered serious injuries, and Li's passenger  Mingyue Shen was also injured, for which the judge sentenced Li on three charges of careless driving causing injury. Li was disqualified from driving in New Zealand for 10 months.","Motorists in New Zealand have confiscated the keys of foreign drivers .

"Suspect: Mark Speer, 44, from Indiana, faces three child molestation charges and federal child pornography counts . The live-in girlfriend of an accused child molester from Indiana allegedly had helped the suspect arrange sexual encounters with young girls, according to recently unsealed court documents. Mark Speer, 44, a plumber from Lafayette, was arrested in August on suspicion of molesting a 3-year-old girl and creating child pornography videos. In the course of the investigation into the claims, police received permission to access Speer's private messages on Facebook and the dating site Zoosk exchanged between him and his girlfriend, Rebecca Kaster. Search warrants released last month state that Kaster had assisted her boyfriend in scheduling his illicit encounters with children. One Facebook message sent from Kaster's account to Speer December 22, 2013, read: 'i think i have the best chance getting her or the younger [girl]...so far that’s all i got.' Speer reportedly replied that Kaster's update turned him on. Kaster, who has not been charged with any crime, told detectives that she and Speer had an open relationship, in which he was allowed to have sex with other women he met online, according to the court documents cited by Indianapolis Star. Speer was charged last September with child molesting, attempted child molesting and criminal confinement, along with federal child pornography charges, . The charges against the 44-year-old stemmed from the discovery of a half-dozen videos on his cell phone featuring a 3-year-old girl in his house wearing nothing but a pair of socks. Go-between: Speer's live-in-girlfriend, Rebecca Kaster, is suspected of helping the Indiana plumber (left and right) arrange encounters with young victims via Facebook and Twitter . When questioned by Indiana State Police in August about the videos, Speer claimed he recorded them because the toddler was 'acting goofy' and 'dancing around.' Court papers released last fall revealed that in one of the clips, Speer is heard saying about the child: 'This pretty little thing's mind, ' and, 'Oh my God, I’ve already got her naked.' The suspect told police the girl's mother took off her clothes after the 3-year-old had spilled ice cream of herself. Kaster, Speer's girlfriend, told detectives that she had been babysitting the little girl when she left her boyfriend alone with her for up to 30 minutes.","Mark Speer, 44, from Indiana, faces three child molestation charges and federal child pornography charges .

"James Heathcote, 26, was jailed for five months after admitting inciting two girls to engage in sexual activity whilst in a position of trust . A supply teacher tried to pester two teenager schoolgirls into a threesome despite being warned about his flirty behaviour by colleagues, a court heard. James Heathcote, 26, a former sports coach, was employed by St Helena School in Colchester, Essex, after being sacked from his previous job when a female colleague accused him of sexually harassment. While there he groomed two besotted pupils and pestered them to fulfill his fantasy of having a threesome. The supply teacher even exposed himself to the pair over a webcam as he traded explicit messages referring to bondage and strip tease fantasies. He was only caught when a fellow pupil reported the explicit messages before he could convince the impressionable girls to go through with his plan. Heathcote, from Felixstowe, Suffolk, fought back tears in the dock at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday as he was jailed for five months. He was also ordered to sign the sexual offenders register for seven years. Heathcote admitted two charges of inciting two girls to engage in sexual activity whilst in a position of trust  but denied a third charge of sexual touching, involving allegedly kissing a pupil, which will now lie on file. As he passed sentence Judge David Turner QC said: 'Young women in school are entitled to be protected - even from themselves. 'You were the subject of some attention from female pupils and you may have found that flattering, but you should not have acted on it. 'You exchanged messages that were plainly, openly and explicitly sexual. 'You made references to bed, sex, intercourse, tying up and 'banging'. 'The sexual nature of these messages is unmistakable. 'You had asked for a 'threesome' with the young women, which they refused. 'It needs to be understood that people in a school setting owe a duty of care to the young people in their charge. 'You have fallen far short in that duty.' Heathcote joined the school as a part-time supply teacher in Spring 2013 before taking up a full time role in September 2013 and moving into a house on school property. His flirty nature with pupils was noted by colleagues who warned him to discourage his young female admirers. He ignored the advice before swapping phone numbers with two female schoolgirls in October 2013 when they complained about struggling with exam stress. A judge said Heathcote had 'fallen far short' of his duty  when he groomed the two besotted teenagers . The messages soon spread onto social media sites, including Instagram and Facebook, where the exchanges became sexual in nature as he begged the girls to share intimate pictures. On one occasion he even exposed himself to both girls  whilst chatting to them on FaceTime as they sat in their nightwear. Allan Compton, prosecuting, said: 'Police went through some of the Facebook messages to one girl which did contain significant sexual content. 'The messages described fantasies about being tied up, strip tease, as well as fantasies about having a threesome.' By January 2014, Heathcote had suggested a threesome to both girls and bombarded one with a staggering 242 text messages over a seven day period. Both had admitted during the exchanges that they would have sex with him separately but refused his request of a threesome. The explicit messaging only ended when a fellow pupil reported her suspicions and police were called in. Heathcote joined St Helena School, Chelmsford, pictured, as a part-time supply teacher in Spring 2013 . Heathcote was arrested and contacted both girls asking them to delete all messages in a failed bid to cover his tracks. Mr Compton added: 'The aggravating features of this offending include the use of grooming behaviour and the soliciting of sexual images from the girls. 'There is, within the last text, an element of cover up when he invites them to delete text messages. 'It would appear that arrangements had been put in place to escalate to full sexual activity but, thankfully, it did not.' The court heard how Heathcote had been dismissed from a previous role as a school sports coach in October 2012 following an allegation of sexual harassment from an adult female work colleague. Peter Barlex, mitigating, said his client had been working as a cover supervisor at the school full-time since September 2013. He said: 'This was a situation that got out of hand. 'It is something he bitterly regrets ever getting involved in. 'This was a profession he had really set his sights upon but which has now gone.' Heathcote was jailed for five months and was made to sign onto the sex offenders register for seven years. He was also made the subject of a 10-year sexual harm prevention order banning him from unsupervised contact with under 18s without a guardian's consent. St Helena School is a secondary school in Colchester, Essex, with more than 1,000 pupils. A spokesman for the school said: 'Mr Heathcote is no longer an employee of St Helena School, having been dismissed in July 2014. 'The safety and wellbeing of students is the school's top priority and the school followed all the correct and required procedures in its pre-employment checks. 'As soon as a safeguarding concern was raised, the school alerted the police and local authority immediately and suspended Mr Heathcote.'","James Heathcote, 26, jailed for five months at Chelmsford Crown Court .

"A new exhibit focusing on Richard Avedon's celebrated photos of political and cultural newsmakers invites visitors to rethink the concept of portraits in the age of the selfie. Richard Avedon: Family Affairs opens Wednesday at the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia. The collection starkly depicts dozens of U.S. movers and shakers from the 1960s and '70s - including Edward Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Nelson Rockefeller and George Bush - in the artist's trademark black-and-white style. Also featured is a small biographical display on Avedon, who was raised Jewish in New York. Men in suits: A new exhibit focuses on Richard Avedon's celebrated photos of political and cultural newsmakers - (left to right) publisher Walter Annenberg, California governor Jerry Brown and 41st President George Bush - in the artist's trademark black-and-white style . Muses: Richard Avedon: Family Affairs is now on in Philadelphia (from left, Katharine Graham president of The Washington Post Company, Barbara C. Jordan the first African American congresswoman and Bella Abzug, a member of U.S. Congress and champion of women's rights) 'Avedon's work is generally shown in art museums as art, with very little historical interpretation,' said chief curator Josh Perelman. 'We invite Avedon in both as a creator and a character.' Avedon made his name shooting fashion models for magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, but 'Family Affairs' stems mainly from his work covering the 1976 presidential election for Rolling Stone magazine. Originally planning to spotlight the campaigns of incumbent Gerald Ford and challenger Jimmy Carter, Avedon soon realized he wanted to include a wider array of the era's most influential people, Perelman said. Men in suits comprise nearly all his subjects, distinguished by variations in their stances and expressions: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, consumer advocate Ralph Nader and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to name a few. We're looking at you: The collection starkly depicts dozens of U.S. movers and shakers from the 1960s and '70s - including Edward Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Nelson Rockefeller and George Bush - in the artist's trademark black-and-white style . Rise to fame: Avedon (seen in self potraits above) made his name shooting fashion models for magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, but 'Family Affairs' stems mainly from his work covering the 1976 presidential election for Rolling Stone magazine . Only a handful of the 12-by-15-inch framed images portray women or minorities, among them Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham and labor activist Cesar Chavez. Rolling Stone called the 69 portraits 'The Family,' though the only people with biological ties are Ted Kennedy and his mother, Rose. Visitors can also page through hard copies of the 40-year-old magazine issue, or look at a digital edition. Yet the exhibit space is dominated by a wall-size display of poet Allen Ginsberg's family. It's one of four featured group portraits that Avedon took between 1969 and 1971. Much smaller pictures include Andy Warhol and members of The Factory; the Chicago 7, who were arrested during the 1968 Democratic National Convention; and the Mission Council, who were key players in the Vietnam War. The exhibit notes Avedon stood next to his camera, not behind it, when making his photos. Added attraction: Museum officials have set up a computer to take Avedon-inspired pictures of guests against a white backdrop edged in black; the images can be both printed and shared via social media, blending the concepts of portraits and selfie . Second-time around: 'Family Affairs' is based on an exhibition held last year at The Israel Museum in Jerusalem . 'I am close enough to touch the subject, and there is nothing between us except what happens as we observe on another during the making of the portrait,' Avedon said. Museum officials have set up a computer to take Avedon-inspired pictures of guests against a white backdrop edged in black; the images can be both printed and shared via social media, blending the concepts of portraits and selfie. Avedon died in 2004, before selfies entered popular culture, but even he wasn't immune to the concept. As a teen, Avedon used a mirror to take a picture of himself and high school classmate James Baldwin, who later went on to literary fame. That photo is on display as well. 'Family Affairs' is based on an exhibition held last year at The Israel Museum in Jerusalem. The Philadelphia site will be the only U.S. venue for the images, which are on view through August 2.","Richard Avedon: Family Affairs is now open at the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia .

"A set of parents allowed their children to become so dirty they looked like 'urchins from Oliver Twist' with lice and rotting teeth. Jake Alderto, 22,  and Emma Louise Jones, 23, neglected their two-year-old son and three-year-old daughter so much the toddlers had lice growing in their hair and rotting teeth. The couple from Ulverston, Cumbria, kept no food in the family home where the children were within 'easy reach' of drugs, Furness Magistrates Court heard. Jake Alderto and Emma Louise Jones (above) were convicted of neglect after a court heard how the couple's two young children were so filthy they did not know what a bath was and had lice growing in their hair . When social services intervened they found the children 'starving' and their hair crawling with lice. Alderto and Jones were both found guilty of neglect and will be sentenced at Preston Crown Court later this month. Council workers described the case as one of the worst they had ever seen. 'When foster carers were handed these two children they described them as looking like street urchins from Oliver Twist,' said Lisa Hine, prosecuting counsel. 'They were filthy and there was no food in the house. They were both starving. It was a seriously dangerous house for children to be living in. 'There were drugs within easy reach of them both.' The couple's home in Ulverston, Cumbria, was described as 'dangerous'. The children were within easy reach of drugs . The little girl had to have 16 rotten teeth with the pair's mother telling officials she did not think providing dental care was her responsibility. 'In relation to dental care, the older child had not been cared for at all and had to have 16 teeth extracted because they were rotten. 'Her mother said she didn't think dental care was down to her,' added Mrs Hine. 'The children were filthy, they had lice in their hair and didn't know what a bath was or how to eat properly.' The pair admitted one count of the ill treatment and neglect of children in a manner likely to cause them unnecessary suffering or injury to health. Alderton also admitted possession of cannabis on the same date. Their lawyer made no representation other than to ask for preparation of reports before sentencing given their guilty plea. The couple admitted neglect at Furness Magistrates Court (above). Their case has been committed to Preston Crown Court where they will be sentenced next month .","Jake Alderto, 22, and Emma Louise Jones, 23, found guilty of child neglect .

"Britain's richest woman Kirsty Bertarelli and her husband Ernesto have left their neighbours 'apoplectic' with plans for their home . Britain's richest woman Kirsty Bertarelli doesn’t usually have to dig deep to get what she wants. When it came to extending the former Miss UK’s London home, however, excavating a vast two-storey subterranean extension seemed the perfect solution. But neighbours in the exclusive street have been left feeling angry – even undermined – by the plan to create a family home for her, husband Ernesto, a Swiss businessman, and their three children. They had raised concerns about the excavation possibly harming the property and adjoining buildings, and about the noise and upheaval caused by the work. Adding to their ire, the council is to restrict such developments by the end of the year because of the disruption they cause – but the Bertarellis got their application in just in time. Planners at Westminster City Council this week approved the application, which will add a dining room, family room and cinema area on one of its levels and a kitchen, gym and laundry area on another. Sketches show this would virtually double the size of the house in Belgravia. Staffordshire-born Mrs Bertarelli, 43, who was 17 when she was Miss UK and also runner-up to Miss World, is the richest woman in Britain, worth nearly £9.75billion thanks to her marriage to Ernesto, 49, a Harvard-educated biotechnology tycoon, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2014. They bought the Victorian house 15 years ago for £5.5million. Architects Boundary Space said the ‘double decker’ basement is required because the house is no longer big enough for the family, who divide their time between London and homes in Geneva and Gstaad, Switzerland. The upgrade will turn it into a ‘modern family home with appropriate facilities’. Dubbed ‘iceberg homes’, such extensions are the fashionable but controversial solution for rich residents with limited space. The likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Nicole Kidman and Roman Abramovich are among those who have all extended underground. According to the architects who designed the project, the 'double decker' basement is required because the house is not big enough for the couple . 'Iceberg' homes have become an increasingly popular way for the rich to expand their homes, without flouting planning restrictions (this image of the house has been altered to protect the owners' privacy) Some homes on the Bertarellis’ mews, one of the most affluent areas of the capital, already have basements, but several neighbours had instructed lawyers to fight the latest proposal. While it will be the third property to have a basement, the Bertarellis would be the first to excavate to two storeys. Staffordshire born Ms Bertarelli, who co-wrote girl band All Saints' worldwide smash Black Coffee, released her own album last year . Locals were also worried that the basement might be used as a recording studio – Mrs Bertarelli co-wrote girl band All Saints’ worldwide smash Black Coffee and released her own album last year – although the plans, approved on Tuesday, show otherwise. One neighbour who wanted to remain anonymous said: ‘Some of the owners around here are absolutely apoplectic about what’s in the pipeline. These kinds of developments cause huge disruption. ‘In the past few years there has already been one double basement conversion and a single basement. There will be hardly any earth left eventually. ‘The houses were never intended to be enormous family homes and the street is just about wide enough to fit two cars down it side-by-side. 'It's like we have rockstars coming to stay when they arrive, there's an army of drivers and minders for the kids, it's mayhem. 'They are obviously going to spend a huge amount on a place they hardly live in, it's staggering. But then the richest are oblivious to how your regular people live and we will have to deal with the consequences.' Another neighbour said: ‘This is going to be a three-year project, they are going to completely gut the building and dig down, I have no idea how that’s going to be done without seriously disrupting us and affecting our day-to-day lives.’ According to the architects who designed the project, the 'double decker' basement is required because the house is not big enough for the couple. The planned upgrade, which will apparently take three years to complete, will turn it into a 'modern family home with appropriate facilities', they said. The architects added: 'The proposals reflect the client's family has grown, and the accommodation is no longer conducive to modern family living.' Ms Bertarelli, 43 (right), who won Miss UK in 1998 (left), bought the house with her husband 13 years ago for £5.5million . In a report considered by the council, it emerged that there had been 'a large number of objections' from residents in the mews, who were concerned the basement may be used as recording studios. The complaints were backed by local Conservative councillor Rachael Robathan, who said: 'The size of the extension is disproportionate.' John Walker, the Wesminster City Council's operational director of development planning said in a report: 'There have been a large number of objections from other residents within the mews. 'Concern has been raised by residents that the use of the basements has not been specified, and that they might be used as recording studios. 'They are concerned that the excavation of new basements is a risky construction process, with potential harm to the property and adjoining buildings.' 'Iceberg' homes became an increasingly popular way for the rich and famous to expand their homes, without flouting planning restrictions. Ms Bertarelli, 43, who won Miss UK in 1998, bought the house with her husband 13 years ago for £5.5million . But the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea became the first local authority in the country to introduce restrictions on the controversial subterranean developments. If the couple lived just a few streets away, their  plans would not have been approved because of the ban on 'excessive' two storey extensions. Westminster City Council is to introduce a similar policy to limit the size of basement extensions by the end of this year. Speaking about the approved plan, council spokesman Nick Thompson said: 'This application was approved by committee on Tuesday night. 'We have a basement policy that is coming in very shortly which will restrict this type of development, as we recognise the disruption that residents in Westminster are having to live with.' Planning permission was granted with conditions that the excavation work can be carried out only between 8am and 6pm Monday to Friday. Nobody was at the Bertarellis’ home for comment yesterday.","Kirsty Bertarelli, 43, is building the basement at her three-storey mansion .

"After years of experiencing prejudice  in the fashion industry simply because she wears a hijab, Muslim designer Frida Deguise has made a public stand against racism at her fashion show. The 37-year-old Sydney mother-of-four, who was born into a Lebanese family, has been selling and making dresses in Australia for the past 12 years and consistently feels discriminated against due to her cultural attire. On Tuesday, while debuting her first ready-to-wear evening clothing line called Roxcii, Frida made her entrance on to the catwalk wearing a controversial T-shirt emblazoned with the logo: 'I'm a fashion threat, not a terror threat,' aimed at silencing her critics. Scroll down for video . 37-year-old fashion designer Frida Deguise (pictured) has hit back at racism in the fashion industry by wearing this T-shirt at her fashion show . Frida said she made the fashion statement to show her fellow designers that she 'has a good eye for fashion' and isn't a terror threat just because she wears a hijab. 'I was sick of the pretentiousness within the fashion industry towards Muslim dress designers,' Frida told Daily Mail Australia. 'I put on that T-shirt because when people see me they always say ""so do you make pretty scarves?"". Because I'm Muslim, they think all I do is Islamic wear.' On the night of her fashion show, one of the designers who was showcasing their collection asked her if she had any strapless gowns in her show, or if all of her dresses were covered up. The Muslim designer says she is constantly discriminated against due to her clothing and believes she should be judged on her talent . Her new clothing collection showcases her designs and she says people were shocked that a Muslim woman could design these dresses . Gobsmacked at the audacity of his question, Frida told him: 'You have to be half-naked to wear my collection'. Minutes later as her models walked out onto the catwalk showing off her beautiful designs, Frida said he couldn't believe she could actually design and create elegant gowns that show skin and legs. 'You've got to look the part in fashion, you've got to have the body you've got to look good,' she said. 'One of my teachers from Ultimo introduced me to somebody on the night of the show and he said ""This is Frida, she has a collection tonight, she’s a fashion designer, you wouldn't think so would you?"".' Her T-shirt read: 'I'm a fashion threat, not a terror threat' Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Frida said she made the fashion statement to show her fellow designers that she 'has a good eye for fashion' and isn't a terror threat just because she wears a hijab . Frida admits that the fashion world is tough to crack and says she 'feels attacked all the time' because she does not conform to the conventional image of a fashion designer. 'I can be funky and edgy but I’m a mother-of-four and I'm overweight,' she said. Frida, who is also a stand-up comedian, believes people should respect her for who she is and what she does as opposed to her attire and her religious beliefs. 'When I do stand-up comedy I don’t get it. I used to, I would get it once or twice but in the fashion industry they’re so naive,' she said.

While living in America, Frida won $4,000 on a radio show. She immediately rang her mother and told her she wanted to start up her own  Islamic clothing store in Sydney. 'The new trend at that time was Islamic clothing stores so I came back and I opened one,' she said. She went back to school to study pattern making and design . Frida also designs custom gowns for Muslim women . The shop went bust within a year after a massive flood but Frida was determined to make her plan work and went back to school to learn about pattern making and draping. She started to understand what the customer wanted and how exactly a dress was made and has been in a thriving business for the past 12 years. Frida has also been designing dresses for the Miss Universe contest for nearly six years. However, racial labelling was never far away and one year, while sitting at a table watching the contest, as woman asked her if she had been responsible for the catering at the event. 'Just because I'm a Muslim she taught I was a caterer,' Frida said. Frida has been designing for the Miss Universe contest for the past 6 years . The designer's evening collection debuted on Tuesday to rave reviews . Her elegant collection is affordable and  available in nine countries around the world . 'When I told her I did the dresses she said ""What are you serious?"". They sound like such idiots because they don’t know how to recover.' Her dresses are now sold in nine countries around the world and she is also a custom designer for Muslim girls looking for someone who is able to create a gown suitable to their culture. 'I create dresses for a lot of Muslims girls because I know what they want and I know how to cover it and they don’t get embarrassed,' she said. 'You go to any other store and they will intimidate them. A lot of girls don’t like to go to those places.' 'When girls come to me they don’t have to explain what needs to be covered. I can put a dress together and know that it follows the Islamic culture.' Frida is also a custom designer for Muslim girls looking for someone who is able to create a gown suitable to their culture .

Above, police at the scene . Seconds before the incident, the driver had struck a Subaru, which was parked around 100 feet south of 170th Street, causing minor injuries to the woman driving it, police told CBS New York.

"Founder: The charity was set up by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996 . A leading children’s charity is facing a crisis after three of its directors resigned amid an apparent row over funding, it was revealed yesterday. Kids Company has received around £30 million of public money since 2008 and has celebrity backers including rock group Coldplay, businessman Sir Richard Branson and Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Set up by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996, it supports 36,000 vulnerable children in London, Bristol and Liverpool and has been championed by Prince Charles and David Cameron. But concerns about the way the charity is run are understood to have led some senior managers to raise issues with its board of trustees. The resignations of interim finance director Diane Hamilton, human resources chief Adrian Stones and director of development Mandy Lloyd then followed. A statement from Kids Company said: ‘It was with great regret that they felt unable to continue working within the organisation because of the uncertainty of funding, which led to high levels of stress in the workplace which was unsustainable.’ But a source close to the directors reportedly said: ‘These departures are a direct result of these employees’ doubts about the future of Kids Company ... The trustees were told of their doubts but they don’t seem to have reacted at all.’ Miss Batmanghelidjh, a trained psychotherapist, became known as ‘Mother Camila of Camberwell’ for her work with some of South London’s most disadvantaged children. Michael Gove is said to have tried to prevent a grant of up to £8 million being given to the charity in 2012 . Born in Iran, she is known for her colourful style. In 2013 she was named one of Britain’s 100 most powerful women by Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour and appointed a CBE. The Sunday Times reported that the resignations were revealed as she denied persuading Mr Cameron to intervene after then education secretary Michael Gove tried to prevent a grant of up to £8 million being given to the charity in 2012. Miss Batmanghelidjh said that an independent audit in 2014 showed ‘the charity was well run but lacked funding’. But critics have questioned whether it is over-staffed – it employs around 600 people.","Kids Company has received around £30m of public money since 2008 .

"A rare white lion received a six-hour dental operation to remove the broken roots of its two rotting canine teeth. Aslan, a resident of the Kevin Richardson Wildlife Sanctuary on the outskirts of Pretoria, had been in pain since his canine teeth broke a year ago. The pain had resulted in the nine-year-old male becoming isolated, aggressive and agitated by its inability to bite down. Animal behaviourist Kevin Richardson notes that Aslan had become isolated, aggressive and agitated . The video produced by denture company Fixodent, captures the operation and features lion whisperer and animal behaviourist Kevin Richardson. He says: ‘A lion without its bite is not really a lion, it’s really important for a lion to have a full set of teeth that are usable.’ Filmed interacting with the pride, Kevin speaks of the special place he has in his heart for Aslan, who he remembers was bitten by his father after being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The white lion is placed under anaesthetic and stretchered to the  makeshift, onsite surgery by a number of people . Lion whisperer Kevin Richardson stays by the lion for the duration of the surgery while it gets fragments of its rotten canine removed . Dr Adrian Tordiffe operates on the lion for six hours and removes the entire root of the rotten canine . He says: ‘I couldn’t imagine anything better than having a white lion and it was quite an incredible thing to see this really pure white ball of fluff amongst all these brown lions.’ In preparation for the long procedure, which Kevin predicted could take up to four hours, the lion is placed under anaesthetic and stroked in reassurance. The video then fast-forwards to the day of the operation as three cars transport the lion to the makeshift, onsite surgery. Kevin Richardson states that the lion is a 'real tough character' after going under the knife for six hours . Dr Adrian Tordiffe removes all the rotten fragments of tooth from where the lion's canine used to be . The operation took a lot longer than Kevin had anticipated and a total of four teeth were worked on . Aslan is then laid out on the table and the animal anaesthetist, Dr Adrian Tordiffe, points out the order in which he will attend to the teeth – the gaping hole left by the broken canine tooth is visible. Kevin stays by the lion’s side for the duration of the operation as the rotten fragments of the canine tooth are pulled from its mouth. After the last piece of tooth is removed, the doctor sews up the hole and notes that the animal will soon be without the pain and as a result a much happier lion. The fragments of the broken and rotten canine teeth were removed and the doctor later sewed up the holes . After the operation Aslan returned to his big cat ways and was once again able to eat comfortably with the rest of the pride . Later in the video Kevin notes that the six hour operation was a lot longer than he had anticipated and that a total of four teeth – instead of two – were worked on. He says: ‘He’s a real tough character to endure that. Now with hopefully no pain in the mouth and the ability to bite nicely he’s not going to feel so insecure.’ Aslan is then shown being seamlessly reintroduced to the pride, despite Kevin’s fears that it may not go entirely smoothly. Kevin strokes Aslan's chin and notes that he has not been able to do that for a long time on account of the pain the lion was in . Despite Kevin’s fears that it may not go entirely smoothly, Aslan is welcomed back to the pride after his operation . The king is back! Kevin notes that the other lions are pleased to see Aslan and that they are once again a happy pride . ‘I think the other lions were happy to see him back,’ says Kevin . ‘Within a short period of time they’re all lying together and licking each other and sleeping amongst each other.’ ‘We are going to have a happy pride. The king’s back.’ Since the operation Aslan has been able to return to his big cat ways and is once again able to eat comfortably with the rest of the pride. More information on Aslan can be found on his official website and the original video can be viewed here.","The lion is place under anaesthetic and has four teeth worked on .

"Wisconsin lawmakers voted Friday to make their state the 25th to enact 'right-to-work' legislation, pushing a fast-tracked bill through the Assembly after an overnight debate and sending it on to Gov. Scott Walker for his promised signature. The Assembly passed the bill 62-35 after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate. It was a straight party-line vote, with no Democrats backing the contentious measure that will ban unions from forcing non-members to pay dues. A likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago, Walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on Monday. 'Today is the day we have solidified the regressive era in Wisconsin,' Democratic Rep. Terese Berceau, of Madison, said minutes before the vote. A likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on Monday . Mary Will, left, with Local 68, and Corey Smith, right, with Local 113, chant 'Union Strong' during a rally inside the Wisconsin State Capitol as the state Assembly debates the right-to-work bill in Madison, Wisconsin on Thursday. The Assembly passed the bill 62-35 on Friday after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate . Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, walks off the floor after passage of right-to-work on Friday. The bill passed on a party-line vote, with Republicans in support and all Democrats against. The Senate passed it last week . The proposal would make it a crime punishable by up to nine months in jail to require private-sector workers who aren't in a union to pay dues. Supporters argued it would make Wisconsin more attractive to businesses looking to move in or expand. But opponents said the goal is to destroy unions, which tend to vote Democrat, and a right-to-work law would depress wage and create more dangerous workplaces, in turn hurting the economy. Twenty-four other states have right-to-work laws. Michigan and Indiana were the two most recent states to enact it, both in 2012. The protests from unions in Wisconsin were not nearly as large as they were four years ago when Walker and Republicans in the state legislature pushed through reforms to public sector unions, growing only as large as about 3,000 people compared with 100,000 in 2011. And only a handful of protesters were on hand for Friday's deliberations. Two people were arrested Thursday for refusing to stop screaming profanities, a spokesman for Walker's administration said. The vote came after Walker said in September, during his re-election campaign, that right-to-work was not a priority and wouldn't come up this session. Walker called it a distraction and feared that protests would grow as large as those in 2011 when he effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers . Legislative leaders, including Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, also said right-to-work would not be debated. But two weeks ago, when Senate Republicans said they were going forward with it, Walker said he would sign it . Pointing out that 'the bill would be dead if he opposed' it, Arnold Shober, a political science professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, told TPM last week that Walker had to side with his party on the issue. 'He knows that it will court controversy, but he cannot afford to lose potential GOP primary voters,' Shober said. A protester chants  outside of the Assembly chamber during debate on right-to-work legislation at the State Capitol on Thursday. Opponents say the goal of the proposal is to destroy unions, which tend to vote Democrat . Opponents of the Wisconsin legislature's 'right-to-work' measure rallied at the state Capitol last Saturday. The proposal, due to be signed next week by Walker, would outlaw the mandatory payment of union dues from workers . 'Legislative leaders know this, and see now as an opportunity to pass right-leaning legislation while the state political climate is very favorable.' Walker is scheduled to be in Iowa for an agriculture summit on Saturday that's attracting other likely Republican presidential candidates. The Wisconsin executive's well-established intentions to compete for the Oval Oval next year had state Democrats accusing their Republican colleagues of pressing the issue to help Walker's likely presidential campaign, even though Walker had said he didn't want the fight as he turned his eye to national politics. They called on Walker to veto the bill. 'It's the workers in this state that are suffering through the politics of our governor's ambitions,' said Democratic Rep. Cory Mason of Racine. Vos accused Democrats of having 'Walker derangement syndrome,' and said the bill was about giving workers the freedom to choose whether to pay union dues. 'I'm not going to apologize about using the word freedom,' said Republican Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt of Fond du Lac. 'I'm going to use it over and over again because that's what this is about.' Democratic Rep. LaTonya Johnson of Milwaukee, and a member of AFSCME, said she cares about people more than freedom. 'It just angers me to know that we come here and we pass bills that affect people's everyday lives and we don't have a clue as to how those everyday people live or how they survive,' Johnson said. 'This bill is a bunch of crap.' The national campaign arm of state Democrats, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that 'Wisconsin Republicans should be ashamed of this savage attack on unions and the hard-working men and women.' It called on Wisconsin lawmakers to put aside their 'right-wing ideology aside to promote policies that actually help the state’s middle class.' A crowd protests outside the Wisconsin Senate during an extraordinary session on the right-to-work bill last week. The group much smaller than the one in 2011 against Walker's law stripping public sector unions of much of their power and 100,000 protesters camped out. Still, the largest rally attracted roughly 3,000 people . 'Instead of addressing the real problems facing Wisconsin,' DLCC Executive Director Michael Sargeant said, citing a $2.2 billion budget deficit, 'Republicans decided instead to speed the passage of legislation that lowers wages, interferes with the operations of private companies, and satisfies the demands of the right-wing special interest groups that seem to have been calling the shots in Scott Walker’s Wisconsin since he took office.' Americans for Prosperity, a conservative non-profit with chapters across the country that spent $7 million to defend Walker after the 2011 spat with unions said Friday afternoon that 'every American deserves the right to work where they please without being compelled to pay dues, just as they have the right to join a union if they choose.' 'We’re pleased that Wisconsin is once again leading the way when it comes to worker freedom,' AFP Chief Operating Officer Luke Hilgemann said in a statement. AFP-Wisconsin State Director David Fladeboe said in a secondary statement that his chapter is 'excited to see this commonsense legislation move the state forward and finally bring relief for workers who simply want to do their jobs.' 'No longer will the Badger State’s employees be compelled to join a labor union or surrender union dues as a condition of employment,' he said and thanked the organization's volunteers for writing letters to lawmakers, calling their offices and going door-to-door in support of the campaign.","Assembly passed the bill 62-35 after a marathon  that included about 20 hours of debate; the straight party-line vote that attracted no Democrats .

"A 26-year-old man has been found guilty of sodomizing and strangling to death his girlfriend's four-month-old baby daughter in a horrific 2012 attack following just four hours of jury deliberations. Jordan Lafayette Prince was convicted on Thursday of brutally sexually assaulting and murdering little Ashlynn Lillith Peters at his mobile home in St Charles, Missouri. He is now facing life in prison. At a hearing earlier this year, Prince's girlfriend and Ashlynn's mother, Jessica Lynn Howell, 27, was jailed for 25 years after admitting felony murder and child abuse in relation to the infant's death. Howell had encouraged her boyfriend to sexually assault Ashlynn in the sickening attack, authorities said. The helpless baby was then beaten and strangled by Prince, apparently to silence her crying. Guilty: Jordan Lafayette Prince (pictured in his police mug shot) has been found guilty of sodomizing and strangling to death his girlfriend's four-month-old baby daughter following four hours of jury deliberations . On Thursday, Prince showed no emotion as he was convicted of first-degree murder, child abuse and forcible sodomy in the  killing of Ashlynn in December 2012, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch. His attorney had  argued that prosecutors had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Prince had hurt Ashlynn, claiming  no DNA belonging to the suspect had been found to support their claims. Ashlynn was rushed to hospital on the morning of her death after being discovered lifeless and alone inside Prince's home in Deerfield Village. Despite medics' best efforts, she later died of her injuries. Although her cause of death was ruled to be asphyxiation, prosecutors said the forcible sodomy - carried out with an unknown object - had caused enough internal bleeding to have killed her. Shocking: Prince was convicted on Thursday of brutally sexually assaulting and murdering little Ashlynn Lillith Peters (pictured with her mother, Jessica Lynn Howell, who has been jailed in relation to her death) Scene: On Thursday, Prince showed no emotion as he was convicted of first-degree murder, child abuse and forcible sodomy in the killing of Ashlynn at his mobile home (pictured) in St Charles, Missouri, in 2012 . During Thursday's hearing,  assistant prosecutor Phil Groenweghe said Ashlynn's future hopes, dreams and achievements had been 'snuffed out' for 'one morning of sexual fun by this defendant'. Earlier in court, forensics expert Dan Fahnestock had testified that bloodstains found on the infant's blanket on the day of her assault and death were consistent with both the victim's and Prince's DNA. But he admitted he did not know how or when the blanket had been stained. Meanwhile, medical examiner Dr Mary Case told the court Ashlynn's neck bruises were consistent with strangulation. She also detailed the horrific injuries that Ashlynn had suffered during the sexual assault. They included severe blood loss that totaled around one-third of the infant's blood volume, STL reported. Convictions: At an earlier hearing Howell (pictured, left, in her mug shot), 27, was jailed for 25 years after admitting felony murder and child abuse in relation to Ashlynn's death. Right, Prince in a previous mug shot . During an interview with police, Prince, who had been dating Howell for around five months, reportedly told officers he had become frustrated with the baby because she wouldn't stop crying. Howell, who was apparently sleeping at the time, pleaded guilty in January to her involvement in her daughter's death. She also has two older children, a boy and a girl, St Charles Patch reported. Shockingly, court documents said she had sent a series of text messages to her boyfriend - when Ashlynn was just one month old - encouraging him to have sexual contact with her baby daughter. Prince  - who is not Ashlynn's father and was previously convicted in 2007 of lewd conduct with a minor under the age of 16 - will be sentenced by Circuit Judge Nancy Schneider on April 30.","Jordan Lafayette Prince, 26, found guilty of killing Ashlynn Lillith Peters .

"Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has demanded full details of the reports be published, after they were leaked to the Mail On Sunday . NHS bosses have been accused of covering up plans to close A&E units and cut hospital beds – after paying £10million for reports they are now refusing to publish. They have paid management consultants including KPMG a total of £10,282,593 for advice on ‘improving long-term affordability’ across 11 regions that cover 13million people. The Mail on Sunday has seen a leaked copy of one of the secret reports, recommending the closure of all emergency services at one hospital and the removal of potentially hundreds of beds, sparking fears of plans for widespread cuts in other areas. Such concerns are stoked by an official, watered-down summary of the project, which mentions the need for ‘tough decisions’ to balance the books in the 11 ‘challenged’ areas, where budgets are being overspent. Using business jargon, it speaks of ‘service reconfiguration’ – which critics say is code for cuts – and ‘rationalising the [NHS] estate’, or selling off hospital buildings and land. But nowhere in the Making Local Health Economies Work Better for Patients paper, partly commissioned by NHS England, are any details spelled out. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham last night demanded the full details be published before the Election, saying: ‘The public, who have paid for these reports, have a right to see them before they go to vote. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt likes to lecture the NHS about transparency, but it is clear he doesn’t put his money where his mouth is. He must make immediate arrangements to publish all of these reports or people will conclude he’s a hypocrite.’ KPMG, whose advisers include former NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson, was paid to produce two of the 11 reports last year. The Mail on Sunday has seen the one covering Staffordshire, which was leaked to a Labour MP. It said NHS managers should ‘investigate the feasibility’ of stripping Stafford hospital of all its emergency services – including the A&E department – and turning it into ‘an elective and rehabilitation centre’. KPMG also recommended closing hospital beds there and in Stoke, Tamworth and Burton to plug a potential £217million black hole. If similar suggestions have been made for the other ten areas, NHS managers will be considering plans to close numerous A&Es and potentially thousands of hospital beds. However, NHS England has refused to publish the 11 reports, despite admitting there is ‘in general a strong public interest in information being made as freely available as possible’. A leaked copy of one of 11 secret reports recommended the closure of all emergency services at one hospital and the removal of potentially hundreds of beds . Instead, it has answered a freedom of information request from The Mail on Sunday, which has campaigned for more than two years to save casualty departments, by arguing that releasing them now would ‘prejudice the outcome’ of work to draw up five- year plans for the areas. ‘For these reasons, we believe withholding the information outweighs the public interest in releasing the information.’ In the same response, NHS England admitted how much it spent. Stafford hospital supporter Richard Duffy believed it highly likely that management consultants had recommended closures elsewhere too. ‘That seems to be the remit they were given,’ he said. Despite the terrible history of Stafford hospital, where hundreds are thought to have died in the 2000s due to poor care, the town has rallied to save its departments from the axe. The other ten areas are: Cumbria, Eastern Cheshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Cambridge & Peterborough, Mid Essex, North-East London, South-West London, East Sussex, and Devon. KPMG confirmed it worked on two reports. A spokeswoman added: ‘Any further enquiries on the recommendations should be directed to the client.’","KPMG paid for advice on ‘improving long-term affordability' in 11 regions .

"Celebrity chef and paleo enthusiast Pete Evans has announced his controversial diet book for babies will be published independently, after it was dumped by its publisher. Evans' book, which he wrote along with his co-authors Helen Padarin and Charlotte Carr, will get a worldwide digital release in April, according to a post on the chef's Instagram page. He said a print version of the book would also be published. Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Pete Evans has been embroiled in controversy over his paleo diet book designed for children . 'Charlotte, Helen and I are thrilled to announce that ""Bubba Yum Yum The Paleo Way” will be a proudly independent digital worldwide release in April with print to follow,' Evans' post read. 'We didn’t want to wait, too many people are wanting this beautiful treasure trove of nutritional recipes and we are extremely thankful to all our followers and colleagues for their support. 'A huge thank goes out to all the media for helping raise awareness about this over the last week, we hope you continue to do more of the same.' The book's publishers, Pan Macmillan Australia, cancelled the release of the book amid growing concerns from health experts and dietitians. Evans and his co-authors announced they would be releasing the book independently, and it would get a digital and print release . Earlier on Monday, publisher Pan Macmillan Australia announced it was ditching plans to publish the book. The cookbook, which was supposed to be released last Friday, was delayed before being cancelled Monday. 'The authors of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly, and will, therefore, no longer publish the book, in any format, with Pan Macmillan Australia,' the statement read. Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, which is co-authored by My Kitchen Rules judge Evans, nutritionist Helen Padarin and blogger Charlotte Carr, has been panned by dietitians and doctors over the past week. The Public Health Association of Australia said the book could lead to the deaths of children across the country. 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . One recipe in the book - a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth - was said to have the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. The criticism came as it emerged Evans' Facebook page was being scrubbed clean, with comments that were negative towards the paleo lifestyle were being deleted. After accusations from readers that their feedback was being erased, a rival Facebook page called Blocked By Evans was started, where people could raise their concerns freely. There was also a Twitter hashtag #blockedbypete. Just this week, in the wake of the cookbook controversy, comments questioning the safety of the broth were removed and the posters blocked from the page. Kirstie Cubbins, 31, a stay-at-home mother, had several comments she posted about the health concerns authorities has raised removed from the page. 'I linked to a News article about it [the bone and liver broth] and pointed out what the particular concerns about the formula was, and that it was by the public health authority,' Ms Cubbins told Daily Mail Australia. 'My comments were met with being told I was not welcome on the page as I was not going to support the paleo lifestyle.' Ms Cubbins comments were deleted and she was blocked from responding, though replies to her comments were left on the page. 'I haven't even commented on Pete Evans' page before but had been aware he is prone to deleting comments and blocking people,' she said. Evans visited a primary school in Ballarat, Victoria, last week to promote the paleo diet to children . The cancellation of the book comes as critics of Evans and the diet have claimed the chef deletes negative comments from his official Facebook page . 'My comments were never abusive, derogatory, rude or full of swearing. They just put the factual information across about why the baby formula recipe and other recipes in the new book were dangerous to babies.' Daria, a Paediatric Occupational Therapist, had a similar experience on the page when Evans posted to his Facebook page comments linking the modern Australian diet and the rise of autism. 'I was disappointed to see yet another celebrity making an incorrect judgement about the developmental disorder. I commented to say that his statement was incorrect and that ASD [autism spectrum disorder] has multiple causes of which we are still discovering many,' Daria told Daily Mail Australia. Despite the criticisms, Evans has been a passionate defender of the paleo lifestyle . Daria said she was surprised to see that Evans was advocating the elimination of entire food groups, including grains, and posted a further question regarding how the celebrity chef came to the conclusion 'despite good scientific evidence to show their nutritional benefit, particularly in wholegrain form.' Both of her comments were deleted and she is now blocked from commenting or liking any post on the page. Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Pete Evans, pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts Luke Hines (left), and Wes Carr, wife of fellow co-author Charlotte Carr, has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day . A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.'","Publisher cancels the release of celebrity chef's pro-paleo recipe book .

"CDC officials have arrived at a Louisiana research center to try to determine how at least seven monkeys became exposed to a deadly bacteria used in bioweapons. Three of the monkeys had to be euthanized after showing signs of the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500-acre Tulane National Primate Research Center, USA Today reported. Despite thorough investigations by authorities, the cause of the contamination is still unknown. Questions also remain over how far the bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has spread around the complex and surrounding areas. Concerns: Monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened . Reach: Worryingly, the center is close to a river (top left), homes and a school. Although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria, further tests are required . Animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas. The bacteria may not cause an illness until days or years after the exposure, but the illness can be fatal in humans and animals. The monkeys, rhesus macaques, had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages, where around 4,000 macaques are kept. It is not yet known if the bacteria have colonized in the cages. Worryingly, the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes. And only yards behind the facility, there is a river that leads to a lake surrounded by wildlife refuges. The contaminated primates were all at the center's veterinary hospital at the same time last fall, leading to speculation that they could have been exposed there. Infected: At least seven rhesus macaques (file picture) have shown signs of exposure and three have died . Potentially deadly: Burkholderia pseudomallei . The bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis. Melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a range of symptoms including fever, headache, appetite loss, muscle and joint pain. The illness may not develop for days to years. It is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis, and if left untreated, it is fatal. Several countries have looked into using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. The overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in Thailand, where the bacteria is endemic, it is up to 50 per cent. The bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has never been found in nature in the U.S. Last week, tests by the CDC determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria, bring the number of infected monkeys to seven. The CDC will now be looking at safety and health practices at the veterinary hospital, the agency said. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert from Rutgers University in New Jersey, previously told USA Today that the release was worrying. 'The fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning,' he said. 'Human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident. 'The easiest way to transfer something from one place where it's supposed to be, to another where it isn't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other.' State officials are planning to test wildlife and domestic animals around the facility to see if they have been exposed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners, veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed. Authorities have previously said they are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk. Only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds and 13 from water - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in Thailand. Those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area, suggesting there was no public health risk.","At least seven rhesus macaques at the Tulane National Primate Research Center have been exposed to the potentially deadly bacteria .

"The body of a British holidaymaker has been found floating in the sea off a paradise party island in Thailand. Sebastian Palin, 31, was discovered by a tour boat  in the water near Coral Island, off the coast of Phuket. The charity fundraiser was due to leave the coral atoll on the day his body was recovered. Seb Palin, pictured on a Phuket beach, drowned after a night out on the holiday island last month . Mr Palin, pictured, was planning to run the Plymouth half-marathon next month for two charities . A speed boat was sent to the island at 1.30pm on February 23 and his body has been flown home for burial. Thai police said there was no suspicion of foul play and Sebastian, known to friends as Seb, had been dead for at least 12 hours when found. Lieutenant Wuttiwat Leangboonjinda said Mr Palin was believed to have drowned after drinking late into the night at a beach bar. Local reports said he had got 'very drunk' at a hotel bar and staff had tried to escort him back to his room before he told them he wanted to continue drinking. A bar worker told police: 'He drank until the bar closed and seemed stressed.' After the bar closed no one saw Mr Palin again until they were notified of the body floating in the sea around midday the following day. Mr Palin was born in Liverpool but grew up in Tenby, West Wales, and completed a media degree at Swansea University before settling in Plymouth with his wife of three years Victoria. He was a committed fundraiser for the charity MIND - and had pledged to run 10 marathons this year. He said he wanted to run for the Plymouth branch of the mental health charity who helped him though 'a very troubled year'. He was also planning to raise money for St Luke's Hospice in the city who helped his father-in-law during his illness. His friends have paid tribute to a man who had 'the biggest heart' and always had time to help others. Friend Ross Helmich said: 'In memory of my our best friend we have decided to carry on his legacy by running the Plymouth half marathon for him and carry on his selfless fund raising efforts. In Seb's own words, ""donate or don't, but be nice, be happy and keep laughing!""' Seb Palin, pictured here on his wedding day to Victoria Louise, got married in June 2012 . Seb, pictured here with Kelly Jones from the Stereophonics, was going to run for Mind Plymouth who helped him through 'a very troubled year' and St Luke's Hospice who 'did so much' for his father-in-law Nic . In a tribute paid to him on his marathon fundraising page, they said: 'For any of you that had the absolute pleasure of meeting this little guy, you will know what an amazing guy he was and how he always had time to help others out, putting himself second. 'He may have been little but he had the biggest heart out there. If there was anyone in the world who deserved to live a full, happy life it was Seb!'

"Pharmacists will be drafted into GP practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors, under plans to be unveiled today. The proposals could see pharmacists stationed in surgeries to help meet the day-to-day needs of patients with long-term conditions, including diabetes and asthma. Instead of seeing a GP, those patients could be given an appointment with a pharmacist. They would also liaise with hospitals, community pharmacists and care homes to ensure patients received seamless care. Experts said the move would cut the time patients have to wait for appointments, while also addressing the chronic shortage of GPs at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists. Pharmacists are to be drafted into GP practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors in the NHS, under new plans . Many GP surgeries already work closely with pharmacists, and the proposals would see them working as part of the general team, in a similar way to practice nurses, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) said. Maureen Baker, chairwoman of the RCGP, said a 'hidden army' of pharmacists could provide the solution to the pressures facing family doctors. She said: 'Waiting times for a GP appointment are now a national talking point - and a national cause for concern, not least amongst GPs themselves. 'But, even if we were to get an urgent influx of extra funding and more GPs, we could not turn around the situation overnight due to the length of time it takes to train a GP. 'Yet we already have a 'hidden army' of highly trained pharmacists who could provide a solution. 'Practice-based pharmacists, working as part of the clinical team, would relieve the pressure on GPs and make a huge difference to patient care. 'This isn't about having a pharmacy premises within a surgery, but about making full use of the pharmacist's clinical skills to help patients and the overstretched GP workforce.' GP surgeries are predicted to make 370 million patient consultations this year - 70 million more than five years ago. An ageing population and an increase in those patients needing treatment for long-term and complex conditions, including diabetes and heart disease, is, in part, the cause of the mounting pressure. The RCGP said according to their research, there will be 67 million occasions when patients will have to wait a week or longer to see a GP or practice nurse this year. Pharmacists train for five years, one year less than a doctor and a year more than a nurse. As such, the RCGP, which is being backed by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, has argued they are ideally placed to treat patients directly within GP practices. The RCGP is calling for general practice funding to be increased to 11 per cent of the NHS budget by 2017 - currently it stands at just over eight per cent. Furthermore, the College is calling for 8,000 more GPs in England by the end of the next Parliament. David Branford, chairman of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society English board, said: 'General practice is the foundation of the NHS but it needs proper resourcing and support. Experts said the move would cut the times patients have to wait for appointments, while also addressing the chronic shortage of GPs at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists . 'Having a pharmacist as part of the team can make a huge difference to both patients and clinical colleagues. 'Pharmacists should be working in GP practices all over the country.  It's a win-win situation for everyone concerned. 'We must be more strategic and change the services on offer to make best use of the NHS workforce. 'Patients deserve access to high quality care and services wherever they live and pharmacists are central to providing this.' Dr Chaand Nagpaul, GP committee chairman at the British Medical Association, said:  'Placing more pharmacists into GP practice teams is a move the BMA has been advocating for some time. 'This proposal has the potential to improve the skills mix in local GP services and raise the number of healthcare professionals on hand to provide help to patients. 'This will be a welcome step forward,given that GP practices are currently under unprecedented strain from rising patient demand and falling resources. 'The implementation of this programme will be key. For it to work properly, there will need to be additional resources to enable enough pharmacists to be placed in GP surgeries. 'A further limiting factor at present is that many GP practices are struggling because their buildings are inadequate or don't have space to expand staffing.'","Pharmacists could be stationed in GP surgeries to help treat patients .

"Campaigning MP Simon Danczuk and his selfie-loving wife Karen have been spotted dining together on a 'date night' - but the couple seemed more interested in checking their phones than in engaging in conversation. The Danczuks both had their handsets out as they waited for their dinner to arrive at an Indian restaurant in Victoria, not far from the House of Commons in central London. Mrs Danczuk is known for sharing a vast number of revealing selfies on her Twitter account, chronicling every aspect of her life for her online fans. Plugged in: Karen and Simon Danczuk were seen checking their phones during dinner at an Indian restaurant . Engrossed: The couple appeared to be more interested in their screens than in each other . But her husband has been less successful in his social media usage - last work, it emerged that he had accidentally favourited hard-core porn using his iPhone. The Rochdale MP blamed the gaffe on a faulty phone charger, but freely admitted that he has watched porn in the past because he is a 'man of the world'. Mr and Mrs Danczuk dined at Paradise, an Indian and Pakistani restaurant where main courses cost around £8, on Friday night. They sat in the window as they both used their phones, before Mrs Danczuk jokingly tried to apply lipstick on her husband's face. Typical: Mrs Danczuk is known for her love of selfies, while Mr Danczuk last week got in trouble for accidentally favouriting hardcore porn on his phone . Affection: The couple were seen kissing as they enjoyed dinner at the Paradise restaurant in Victoria . Mrs Danczuk did not appear to share any selfies from her evening out, even though she is usually keen to let followers know what she is up to. The Rochdale councillor frequently posts photographs of herself after exercise sessions, trying on new clothes and attending events. Mr Danczuk, who is seeking re-election to his seat in the upcoming general election, was embarrassed last week when a 'technological accident' led him to click on a pornographic tweet with his iPhone. But yesterday, he insisted that the mistake was not a big deal, saying: 'Let's be truthful about this. If I am being asked have I ever used porn, then the answer is yes. Couple: They posed for photographers outside the restaurant during their date night . Notorious: Karen Danczuk frequently takes revealing selfies which she shares with fans on Twitter . 'I am a man of the world. I wouldn't deny that sort of thing. I think we should not be too sanctimonious about this.' His wife joked on Twitter: 'Anyone seriously offended by a bit of porn favouriting?? Come on, if you're not watching it yourself you really need to. It's healthy.' Mr Danczuk has a reputation as a maverick voice within the Labour party, and caused a stir last week when he suggested that Ed Miliband was seen as being more out-of-touch than David Cameron.","Rochdale MP and his wife went out to Indian restaurant in central London .

"When it comes to working out, there could be no better partner than your brother, or even better your twin. Which is precisely why James and Tom Exton, from South West London, the super hot co-founders of LDN Muscle decided to go into business together. Spurring each other on in the gym as they share a mutual love for exercise, these two could easily be contenders for the UK's hottest twins. Scroll down for video . Tom (left) and James (right) are twins who have set up their own fitness business called LDNMuscle . James said: 'Tom and I have obviously grown up together, and have a long shared a passion for keeping fit, healthy and in shape. 'From this we, alongside the Bridger Brothers [Tom and James' business partners], created LDNMuscle - to share our unbiased advice, support and knowledge, to help as many people as possible to transform.' The LDNMuscle website provides premium health and fitness guides online. And Tom says that working together is surprisingly easy. Speaking to Femail he said: 'Working together is great and works surprisingly efficiently as we know each other so well there’s rarely any second guessing about the others opinions on things. 'That said, as with all brothers, and business partners there’s always disagreements. It hasn’t ever got physical though since we were kids, it wouldn’t end well these days if it did!' The brothers say they enjoy working together and although they disagree sometimes they never fight . James shows off his impressive muscles, and tan, in this picture . But James says that the brothers still try to take some time out to enjoy themselves. '[Keeping fit] is obviously a massive part of our lives, but neither of us let it get in the way of enjoying ourselves – be it going abroad or going out with friends,' he said. 'We are firm believers that you can be in the shape you want, whilst balancing an enjoyable sustainable lifestyle.' And when they hit the gym together they can rely on one another for support. Tom said: 'We rarely find time to train together now, with full time work commitments in different places. 'But we are fairly competitive when we do, and means neither of us can let ourselves slip as inevitably we are compared to the other. Nobody wants to be the worst twin!' Tom and James share their top tips for getting bikini ready this summer... 1. Manage Your Time . Tom says: 'Strike the balance between achieving your goals and living a healthy balanced life.' 2. Preparation . James says: 'Plan your week in advance, that's both your diet and training. With the correct preparation it really doesn't need to be intrusive or laborious.' 3. Be Realistic . Tom says: 'Be realistic from the outset. Set goals which are achievable and not idealistic. This will keep motivation high and reduce the risk of becoming despondent and losing interest.' 4. Track Your Progress . James says: 'Try to use photos, and don't get caught up on scale weight. The scales don't tell the full picture and in many cases lead to undue criticism, you will be amazed when you look back through your photo log.' 5: Enjoy It! Both the twins say: 'Ultimately enjoy your transformation & fitness journey. You’ll certainly get a lot more out of it, and are much more likely to succeed. Don't resort to extreme short-term measures as these can put you back to a worse position than where you came from in the long run. Healthy, maintainable and sustainable is the way forward. Tom looks down at his impressively toned muscles as he poses in the gym . Although James says he has the edge on his brother when it comes to fitness. 'I would say I am technically 'fitter' than Tom. 'I commute by bike and rack up 100-150 miles on an average week, while he sits on varying modes of public transport for a couple of hours a day. 'Unlike some, I actually enjoy cardio, and of course there are many associated health benefits too.' And Tom says that unsurprisingly the pair do attract some attention from the ladies: 'I would be lying to say we didn’t get any, I can’t yet work out whether my hideous beard or James’s ridiculous haircut help or hinder though!'","James and Tom Exton could easily be the UK's fittest twins .

"Two men have been charged with a spate of offences after a failed break-in attempt on a motorbike shop was caught on camera early Monday morning.

"Guilty: Loretta Burroughs, 63, murdered and cut up her husband then hid the body for six years . A 63-year-old grandmother has been found guilty of murdering her husband, chopping up his corpse then moving it from house to house for six years. Loretta Burroughs pretended her husband Daniel had run off to Florida with a younger woman from the home they shared in Mays Landing, NJ. She was found guilty yesterday of first degree murder for stabbing her husband to death, chopping up his body with a knife and a saw, packing it into two plastic totes, and dragging it with her as she moved three times in six years. Loretta was about to move for a fourth time on May 17, 2013, from Ventnor, NJ to Villas, NJ, when authorities arrived at the door of her new home with a search warrant. They were investigating her for fraud in relation to the disappearance of her husband, Daniel S. Burroughs, 63, who was reported missing on September 1, 2007. 'She asked if we were also searching the Ventnor house,' testified Sgt. Lynn Dougherty of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office. When told that they were, Loretta's physical demeanor 'changed completely. Her whole body sunk. She lost the color in her face, she was wringing her hands, very nervous.' In the guest bedroom closet of Loretta's Ventnor home, Detective Caroline MacDonald of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office discovered two large boxes wrapped in multiple plastic garbage bags. As she started to open the bags, she smelled the distinct odor of decomposition and called the medical examiner. The boxes were transported to the morgue. Scroll down for video . Victim: Daniel Burroughs was missing for six years before his remains were found at his wife's home . Graphic: The jury was shown how the dead man's remains had been systematically taken apart . Gruesome: A woman's handbag, soaked in decomposition fluid, was found in one of the plastic totes. It contained the victim's skull and jawbone. Dr Charles F Siebert Jr, a forensic pathologist, began opening the boxes. Both were surrounded by nine layers of plastic bags in alternating directions, Siebert testified. He also found dryer sheets, air fresheners, and scented beads to mask the odor of death. Inside the first container, Siebert testified, he found a woman's handbag. 'I described it as olive but I didn't know the color, because it had been sitting in decomposition fluid,' he said. Inside the handbag were a 'cranium and mandible' — a skull and jawbone. The second, larger plastic container contained more bones, including the left upper arm and lower legs. Siebert testified that he saw cut marks on the ribs that were consistent with stab wounds. He determined that the person had died by homicide. Dr Stuart Alexander, a forensic odontologist, or dentist, from Cranbury, NJ, testified that he positively identified the remains in the plastic tote as being Daniel Burroughs. Alexander compared Burroughs' dental records to the teeth in the skull. Donna Fontana, a forensic anthropologist with the New Jersey State Police, testified about the condition of the bones in the boxes. 'There was no gnawing from animals and no bleaching of the bones,' she said. 'That means the bones were in a protected environment, with no sun exposure, and not exposed to the environment where they were attacked by animals.' Fontana then used a replica of a human skeleton and photographs to explain to the jury what had happened to the bones. She said the right tibia, which is the large bone of the lower leg, had been cut with a knife and a saw. Because the cut edge was the same color of the bone, she said it had been sawed at the time of death. Several vertebrae were missing, and others showed signs of trauma, including 'linear cuts as if produced by a knife.' Demonstration: Donna Fontana, forensic anthropologist with the New Jersey State Police, uses a replica skeleton to show the jury where the bones of the victim's leg had been sawed. Forensic anthropologist Donna Fontana testified that all the wounds to the victim's ribs were made with a knife. The third rib on the left side was completely fractured. Fontana testified that several of the body's 24 ribs were also missing. Of the ribs that showed trauma, the injuries were consistent with knife wounds. One was completely fractured. 'There is a pattern of dismemberment,' Fontana testified. Dismemberment, she explained, is usually done 'to hinder identification and for ease of transport.' Chief Assistant Prosecutor Seth Levy argued that Loretta Burroughs murdered her husband, Danny Burroughs, for money. Danny disappeared on August 3, 2007. A few days later, Loretta told friends and family that he had left her. She said he drove off with a younger woman in a yellow Hummer with Florida license plates. In reality, the prosecutor said, Loretta had killed him, and her gruesome plot had begun months before the murder. Loretta worked at the Mey House Assisted Living Facility in Egg Harbor Township, NJ, now called Somers Place. In early June 2007, she asked attorney Enid Hyberg, whose mother was in Mey House, to draft a power of attorney. Loretta told the attorney that she and her husband were selling their home, but Danny was going out of town. With the power of attorney, Loretta could complete the sale. Hyberg drafted the document. She did not charge Loretta, 'in gratitude for the attention she was paying my mother,' Hyberg testified. A power of attorney needs to be notarized. In June 2007, Loretta asked Edward T. Dwyer, whose mother was also in the Mey House assisted living facility, if he knew anyone who could notarize it. 'She said her husband had left her, the house was sold, but the deal wasn't finished because he left,' Dwyer testified. 'I agreed to help her out,' he said. 'She was overly good and generous with my mother.' In June 2007, Dwyer asked his sister-in-law to notarize the power of attorney. Although Danny Burroughs was supposed to sign the document, he did not. Instead, the prosecutor said, Loretta signed Danny's name to it. Loss: Ray Wantorcik had to sit through the trial but said he believed the graphic images of his brother's remains were what had convinced jurors of his sister-in-law's guilt . Ray Wantorcik, right, was finally able to hold a memorial for Danny Burroughs on May 10, 2014, almost seven years after he reported his brother missing. 'My brother won this case for himself,' Ray said. Nicole DiDomizio, Loretta's daughter by another man, testified that her mother frequently signed Danny Burroughs' name. In fact, she saw her do it between four and six times. After Danny's death, the prosecutor said, Loretta used the forged document to sell their home. The profit was $77,101. But the money was locked up in escrow, and Danny was entitled to at least half of it. 'She can't get the money if she is married,' Levy, the prosecutor, said. 'But she can get it if she is divorced.' Loretta filed for divorce on February 28, 2009, 18 months after she killed her husband. She told her divorce attorney, Daniel Alsofrom of Northfield, NJ, that her husband had moved to Florida and did not give an address. Alsofrom published a notice of her divorce complaint in the Press of Atlantic City. Loretta received half of the money when she filed for divorce, and the other half when the divorce was finalized, Alsofrom testified. As a result, the prosecutor said, between the profit from the house, and selling Danny's possessions, such as his tools and his collection of remote controlled model airplanes, Loretta received close to $100,000. 'The defendant has gotten away with it for over eight years, with nothing left but the bones,' Levy said in his closing statement. 'The story ends with the defendant being $100,000 richer and Danny Burroughs in the defendant's closet.' After two hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Loretta Burroughs of murder and hindering her apprehension. For Danny's grieving half-brother, Raymond Wantorck, of Glenolden, PA, the conviction was bittersweet. 'Since they found my brother in May of 2013, I was kicking and fighting that I wanted it to go trial,' he said. 'I wanted my brother's remains to be shown to the jurors. 'I have to think to myself, it is my brother that brought justice to this case. He brought justice to himself. Pictures of his dismembered, horribly mutilated body, won the case.' 'My brother won this case for himself,' Ray said, 'and maybe for me.' Donna Andersen is author of Lovefraud.com. http://www.lovefraud.com/ .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A 72-year-old woman is set to go on trial for shooting dead her second husband, nearly 30 years after she was acquitted of murdering her first husband in eerily similar circumstances. Colleen Ann Harris, whose case is expected to open on Wednesday, is accused of shooting dead her estranged husband, Robert 'Bob' Harris, in their Placerville, California home in January 2013. Decades before, in 1985, she shot dead her first husband and the father of her three children, 46-year-old James Batten, after claiming he had been abusive towards her. Both killings were carried out in the same home with the same type of gun, and in both cases, after pulling the trigger, she claimed she had temporary amnesia and could not remember doing it. Accused: Colleen Ann Harris, left, is about to go on trial for the 2013 death of her husband, Bob Harris, right, whom she shot dead nearly 30 years after she shot dead her first husband . 'In each case, she kills her husband in the bedroom. In each case, she uses a shotgun,' said El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander, wrote in court papers, the Sacramento Bee reported. 'In each case, she is going through marital difficulties. In each case, she delays reporting the crime... In each case she claims a loss of memory as a defense.' She was acquitted in her 1986 trial after claiming she had acted in self defense when her husband, whom she was divorcing, held a pistol to her head, threatened to kill her and sexually abused her. She said she couldn't remember killing him and a psychiatrist testified during the trial that she suffered from limited amnesia. The prosecution told a very different tale. They claimed she had shot her husband as he read a newspaper in bed and then killed him with another shot at close range, before putting a pistol in the bed to make it look like self-defense. She waited an hour before calling the Sheriff's Office. Scene: She allegedly shot him dead in the couple's Placerville, California home (pictured) as they were going through marital problems. They had separated but he had returned to care for her after surgery . The jury ultimately said there was insufficient evidence that she intended to murder her husband and she was acquitted of murder. Then in 1990, she married Bob Harris, who had two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 2004 but then married again a year later. Then in 2012, as Harris took a trip to Mongolia, where he taught environmental conservation to students, he met another woman and began a relationship with her, the Bee reported. When he returned to California, he and his wife separated and he moved out. But when Colleen Harris was house-bound following hip-replacement surgery, he returned to the Placerville home to help her. 'My dad, bless his heart, was there taking care of Colleen despite whatever circumstances were going on between them,' his son Andy Harris told the Sacramento Bee. Then on January 5, 2013, she overheard her husband making a call to his love interest overseas and later that night or the following morning, she shot him as he slept, prosecutors claim. She then allegedly drove to San Francisco and stashed her husband's cellphone, a handgun - not the same one used in the murder - and his coin collection, in her son's garage. After returning home, she called the lawyer who won her previous case and told him that she had shot her husband, prosecutors say. The lawyer then contacted the Sheriff's Office. Harris, who married Colleen in 1990 despite her previous case, left behind two sons and a daughter, right . Beloved: He worked in the Forest Service and as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department . El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander said that Harris claimed she had been in a 'gray fog' but insisted she would never shoot her husband. Mr Harris' family said they remain devastated by the loss. 'The death of your father is devastating enough,' Andy Harris said. 'And then there is the person who is brought into your family and loved as a family member. 'There is a real sense of betrayal and wondering if this person had the capacity to love.' His father had worked with the Forest Service for 30 years before retiring in 1997, according to his obituary. He umpired baseball, from Little League to semi-professional teams, and worked as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department. A judge has ruled that prosecutors may talk about the first case in the upcoming trial. Attorney Eric Schlueter had fought the decision, saying in court papers: 'The prior incident has ZERO relevance to the current action especially in light of the fact that Mrs. Harris was ACQUITTED of the charge.'","Colleen Ann Harris is set to go on trial for murder after shooting dead her second husband, Bob Harris, in their bedroom in 2013 .

"A cheating wife shot dead her husband so that she could be with her lover, police have said. Cindy Reese, 40, and her boyfriend Jeffery Brown, 36, have been charged with murder nearly a month after Michael Earl Reese, 40, was found killed in the couple's kitchen in Morris, Alabama. Cindy Reese had called Morris police at 8pm on February 18 to say that she had arrived home and found the house in disarray, indicating there had been a robbery, AL.com reported. But when police arrived and checked the home on Banks Street, they found Mr Reese fatally shot in the head. Arrested: Cindy Reese, 40, and Jeffery Brown, 36, were arrested on Wednesday for the murder of Reese's husband at their Alabama home last month. Police say the pair plotted the murder so they could be together . The department called the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office for help investigating a homicide, and detectives found that there were no signs of forced entry at the home and nothing was missing. The day after the murder, Jefferson County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Randy Christian said it was unusual for a burglary to happen that time of night and there was 'a good possibility that was staged', WSFA reported. He said that the killing did not appear random and that the victim likely knew his killer. Investigators then learned that Cindy Reese, who married her husband in 2009, had been having an affair with Brown. Property records indicate that Brown lives with a woman. Killed: Mrs Reese, pictured with her husband Michael Reese on their wedding day in 2009, called authorities to her home on February 18 saying that it was in disarray. Officers searched the house and found his body . Murdered: Detectives said they found no signs of a forced break in or anything missing at the home when they discovered Mr Reese's body. Investigators later discovered Mrs Reese was having an affair . The duo had plotted to kill Mr Reese so that they could be together, Chief Deputy Randy Christian of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office told AL.com. He said the murder was the result of 'dark hearts, stupidity and extreme selfishness'. 'I think we all understand matters of the heart and the ups, downs, ebbs and flows of relationships,' Christian said. 'What we can't understand and will never understand is someone getting so twisted, dark and lost that they believe cold-blooded murder is the answer.

"A ‘deceitful’ businesswoman has been left with a £100,000 bill for tricking her husband into believing he was the father of their son born after IVF treatment. Minutes after the ruling, the victim of the con was reduced to tears as he read a statement in which he described the actions of his ex-wife as ‘absolutely appalling’ and pleaded to remain part of the boy’s life. ‘I live in hope that when he is 18 he looks for me… and be part of my life again,’ he said. ‘He is truly missed.’ A lecturer who said his former wife deceived him into thinking her son born via IVF was his has won £100,000 after a court heard the boy, who is now nine years old, was conceived using another man's sperm . The man – a lecturer in his sixties who cannot be named for legal reasons – thought the boy was his after the couple visited a fertility clinic. But the woman, who is in her 50s, had returned a few months later with an ex-boyfriend and was impregnated with his sperm. 'I wanted my former wife, and her former boyfriend, to realise the consequences of their deceitful actions practised over almost six years. It has deeply affected me and my family, but most importantly their own son and my ex-son, which is absolutely appalling. This four-year litigation has been incredibly difficult and stressful and I have sometimes felt: “I think I am in the wrong film”. Not only did my ex-wife commit the deceit but she misled her own child too. I can’t imagine what my then “son” must have felt to have had a loving father substituted by another man – how can she (and he) sleep at night? They used me to ... support him economically whilst maintaining a secret little family life behind my back. I live in hope that when he is 18 he looks for me, and I and my family can show him how much we loved him and he can be part of our lives again. He is truly missed.' Her deceit was only revealed when, following their divorce, the man sought further contact with the boy. Central London County Court heard that the couple married in 2002 and two years later they went for IVF treatment in Barcelona. The boy was born in 2005 but the pair separated when he was just six months old and their divorce was finalised in 2008. At no time did the man know that the boy was not his, said his barrister, Thomas Brudenell. ‘It is hard to imagine a more cruel deceit,’ he said. The court heard that the man had looked after the child when the woman was working away from their London homes and had paid more than £80,000 in maintenance over the following years. But in 2011 a dispute arose over the amount of contact he was having with the youngster – and the woman then dropped the ‘bombshell’ that he was not the biological father, which was confirmed by a DNA test. It led to her ex-husband claiming damages for the ‘distress and humiliation’ he had suffered along with the return of maintenance and compensation for loss of earnings. The court heard the pair had a troubled marriage when they had IVF in 2004. They then fell out, so when the woman returned to the IVF clinic in 2005, she took an ex-partner, whose sperm was used to conceive . The woman said there had been no deceit, no fraud and no misrepresentation, but Judge Deborah Taylor found in favour of her ex-husband. The judge accused the woman of being an ‘untruthful witness’ after finding much of her account ‘highly improbable and inconsistent’. Judge Deborah Taylor said she did not believe the woman's testimony, adding that she had 'deliberately misrepresented' the facts . She said she was satisfied that the woman intended her ex-husband to believe that he was the boy’s father and rejected her suggestion that she believed the boy ‘may’ not be his child. Judge Taylor said the woman had been guilty of ‘deliberate fraudulent misrepresentation’, and added: ‘She presented herself as a victim of circumstances rather than a participant.’ The judge was told that the man had lost almost all contact with the boy, who is now nine. She ruled that he should get £10,000 damages for the distress he had suffered, £4,000 for loss of earnings and more than £25,000 as compensation for the maintenance he had paid. Legal sources suggested she would have to pay a further £60,000 in costs. The lecturer said he sometimes felt he was taking part ‘in the wrong film’ and had been ‘used’ by the woman and her lover. ‘I can’t imagine what my then “son” must have felt to have had a loving father substituted by another man – how can she (and he) sleep at night?’ he said. The ex-wife left court refusing to comment. During the hearing it emerged that she could have settled the case last year for £12,500 but decided to press on with her defence.","Court heard man and woman, who had troubled marriage, had IVF in 2004 .

"The father of a 14-year-old who was killed by a cannabis-smoking driver as she walked to school has told of his devastation as it is claimed the man was texting when he hit her. Liberty Baker died after being hit as she walked to school with friends in Witney, Oxfordshire, last June. Robert Blackwell, a 19-year-old drug user, was behind the wheel of the speeding Citroen C2 which mounted the pavement where Liberty was walking. Liberty Baker, 14, was killed when Robert Blackwell's speeding car mounted the pavement she was walking along on her way to school last June . Liberty's father Paul Baker (left) said he wished he had been killed instead. Her mother, Maureen (right with Finley, Liberty's 10-year-old brother) broke down in tears after today's hearing . The schoolgirl's father today described the 'living nightmare' her death has become as prosecutors claimed Blackwell had been distracted by his phone at the time of the crash. He was told to expect a custodial sentence after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving at Oxford Crown Court today. Liberty's mother, Maureen Baker, broke down in tears after the hearing with her husband describing the minutes before her death. 'As parents, my wife and I are going through a living nightmare which has come true,' said Paul Baker. 'There is not a single day that goes by that I wish the driver had killed me not Liberty. We've gone from a happy family to a sad family. 'We are totally devastated that our daughter was killed in an avoidable way. A child has been killed by an adult. The teenager's mother wept after the hearing today where a court heard how Blackwell had smoked cannabis the day before the crash . Robert Blackwell, pictured arriving at court today, said he had been under pressure from work and had smoked cannabis the day before the crash . Prosecutors told how Blackwell was 'distracted' by his mobile phone when he mounted the pavement and struck the teenager . Mr Baker said the 14-year-old's death had 'devastated' his family which was once happy but now sad . 'We hope sentencing reflects this. There is a mobile phone driving culture on our roads, combined with a speeding culture. 'This is a recipe for further avoidable road deaths. 'I do not want another family to go through this nightmare and feel like we do. 'My last words to Liberty on that morning as she left for school at 7.55 was 'Bye, have fun'. She was dead by 8.15.' The court heard how Blackwell had been smoking cannabis the day before the crash with traces of the drug still in his blood. 'There are studies that suggest it can impair driving for up to 24 hours,' said prosecutor Ian Hope. He was 'distracted' at the time of the crash, said lawyers, with phone records revealing he received a text message five minutes before the first call was placed to 999 to report the crash. '(He was) distracted for what must have been a period of time of 10 seconds or more,' Mr Hope added. Friends of the schoolgirl described her as 'beautiful and popular' after the incident which took place around a mile from her school . The teenager's death shook pupils at Henry Box School where Liberty studied. Her parents said they were 'devastated' their child had been killed in 'an avoidable way' Following her death campaigners fundraised for a tree to be planted in Liberty's memory. Above, the grass verge where she was run over . Flower tributes were left at the scene where Liberty was run over. David Cameron was among those to share his grief online . 'The prosecution say is it fair and proper inference to say from the evidence... at the time the telephone was the source of distraction.' He denied the accusation, insisting his phone was still locked at the time of the crash and that he had been under pressure from his job. 'He genuinely cannot say what was distracting him,' defence barrister Claire Fraser told the court. 'He did not realise or see that a text had come. He is adamant that the mobile phone is not the cause of this accident but his inattention and his speed.' She added his phone was connected to a charger and was sitting on the front seat. Mr Hope rejected claims he had not seen the text message which would have flashed up on his screen even if locked. Addressing the teenager, Judge Ian Pringle told Blackwell said: 'The most probably outcome in this case is a significant prison sentence for you.' He was released on bail on the condition that he does not drive and will be sentenced next month. After Liberty's death last June fundraisers campaigned for a memorial tree to be placed in Henry Box School grounds, around a mile from where she was hit. David Cameron sent condolences to the schoolgirl's parents and 10-year-old brother, Finley. The Prime Minister, who is the MP for Witney, wrote on Twitter: 'My thoughts are with friends and family of the 14-year- old girl killed by a car in Witney this morning.’ Liberty was on her way to Henry Box School in Witney, Oxfordshire (above) when she was hit by the car .

"The girlfriend of an off-duty police officer has been charged with shooting him to death inside his home after she originally contended it happened accidentally when she removed a gun from their dog's mouth, authorities said. Tyaina Finch was charged with murder, aggravated assault and possessing instruments of crime in the death of Mark Hudson in Darby Township, near Philadelphia, on Saturday. Hudson had worked part-time for the Darby Borough Police Department for four years. The dog did it: Slain Darby Borough Patrolman Mark Hudson’s girlfriend, Tyaina Finch, initially told investigators he was mortally wounded as she tried to retrieve his duty weapon from their yellow Labrador retriever’s mouth . Tribute: Funeral arrangements are set and a vigil was also held Wednesday night for the Darby Borough police officer who was killed allegedly at the hands of his girlfriend . District Attorney Jack Whelan said Finch's statements to police had been 'inconsistent.' He described the couple's relationship as 'tumultuous' and said officers had been called to the home before for domestic disturbances. 'We believe she acted on this particular day with specific intent to kill (Hudson),' he said. Finch, who was held without bail, couldn't be reached for comment by telephone on Tuesday. The county public defender's office couldn't be reached for comment on her behalf. The story: While Finch told investigators she does not recall pulling the trigger in their Darby Township row home, the affidavit of probable cause indicates she remembers dropping the firearm after Hudson’s body jerked back and his shoulders hit the wall in a bedroom, where he was found lying in a corner, unresponsive . Authorities allege in a criminal complaint that Finch, who's from Glenolden, at first said the shooting occurred accidentally: She saw their dog with a gun on the floor and took the gun from the dog's mouth, and as she turned toward Hudson the gun went off. The following day, police allege, she told officers she fired the gun in self-defense after Hudson attacked her. Authorities said a caller identifying herself as Finch on the day of the shooting told an ambulance dispatcher 'we were playing and I didn't know that his gun was right there and it went off.' Finch told a police officer arriving at the scene 'it was an accident,' the criminal complaint says. Finch was arrested Monday on threat and assault charges stemming from a dispute last summer during which authorities allege she threatened Hudson with a knife. History of arguments: Last summer, the two were in the middle of a break-up and Hudson had told her to leave his home. During the argument, Finch allegedly grabbed an 8-inch kitchen knife while screaming at him. Hudson hid in an upstairs bedroom, locked the door and called police, investigators said .","The girlfriend of an off-duty Pennsylvania police officer who was shot and killed over the weekend is in custody .

"Babysitters may have once just been the teenager next door, but nowadays parents in some states are willing to pay over $16 an hour for a caregiver their children adore. A new survey has revealed that the average pay rate for a sitter has increased more than 28 per cent in just five years - rising by more than a dollar to $13.44 since just 2013. By contrast, babysitters in 2009 made an average $10.50 an hour. Average babysitter wages have increased by 28 per cent in the last 5 years, as the graphic by Care.com reveals . But the cost for care has risen much higher than a couple of dollars for certain cities. The Care.com survey, which had more than one thousand respondents, revealed that babysitters are most expensive in San Francisco, where they make an average of $16.65 per hour. That's five dollars more than the city's minimum wage. Boston and Silicon Valley hub San Jose are not far behind, with rates clocking in at $15.37 and $15.63, respectively. New York City, unsurprisingly, still made it in the top five with a $15.09 rate. Costs significantly drop further from the coast. Babysitters make, on average, $11.31 an hour in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the cheapest of the rates. Cities in South Carolina, Utah and Ohio round out the top five least-expensive babysitter wages with costs in the $11 rage - with Rochester, New York, also making a surprise appearance. Although one in four parents said they believe they're paying their babysitters too much, the survey found they also have no problem upping the costs. Eighty-seven per cent of parents give their sitters an annual raise, and 26 per cent will tip them. And one in 10 parents is willing to throw in an extra $5 an hour if they booked their caregiver on short notice. Only three per cent of families said they choose their sitter based on expected wages. Forty-nine per cent of families select a sitter loved by their children. A new survey by Care.com has revealed that the average pay rate for a sitter has increased more than 28 per cent in just five years - rising by more than a dollar to $13.44 since just 2013 . According to Care.com's senior managing editor Katie Bugbee, parents today expect more from their sitters - and are willing to pay the price. 'Parents want experience,' she told Yahoo! Parenting. 'They value that. It's not longer the kid down the street who will just sit there and eat Doritos all night.' That means, according to the survey, that the babysitter is between 20 to 25 years old, doesn't smoke and is certified in First Aid or CPR training. Bugbee said that, on the flip side, sitters are likewise working harder to make more of child care. 'Millennials are graduating college and becoming nannies or babysitters and the interest is there to perfect the profession,' she said. 'We're seeing the evolution of the field on both sides.' Surprisingly, over half of the surveyed parents said they've hired a babysitter without running a background check or checking listed references. But a whopping 94 per cent of families said they have complete trust in their child caregivers. And many parents will go to incredible lengths to keep them around. Twenty per cent of parents said they'd be willing to poach another family's babysitter and 16 per cent said they wouldn't share a great sitter's contact with their own friends. But that's hardly shocking. According to the survey, 31 per cent of parents think of their sitter as family.","Average babysitter wages have increased by 28 per cent in the last 5 years .

"It's an argument that has plagued most households at least once, but now the age-old question of whether toilet paper should sit under or over the roll has finally been solved. How? By a 124-year-old patent from 22 December 1891 which clearly illustrates an 'over' arrangement for toilet paper. Writer Owen Williams discovered the toilet paper patent online, and wasted no time in sharing his new-found information with his 8,000 followers on Twitter. The in-depth patent created by New York businessman Seth Wheeler clearly shows an 'over' arrangement . The patent was created by the inventor of perforated toilet paper sheets, New York business man Seth Wheeler. Wheeler, who was also the owner of the Albany Perforated Wrapping Sheet Company, undoubtedly innovated the way toilet paper is created and used in this way. Included in the patent, are Seth's declarations on his new product: 'Be it known that I, SETH WHEELER, of the city and county of Albany, and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Toilet-Paper Rolls.' Although there's no specific mention of the 'over' arrangement of the toilet paper, the diagram is a solid confirmation of the correct use. And it's not just the over-under toilet paper debate that gets homemakers agitated; it's the state of the entire bathroom. Other key things to consider? Cleanliness. Etiquette expert William Hanson said as well as making sure toilet rolls sit 'over', other bathroom tidiness is important: ‘I very much judge a house, and the house owner, by the state of their guest bathroom. ‘I would question the hygiene of the person's kitchen if the loo wasn’t spotless upon arrival. Finally, the age-old argument about which way a toilet roll should sit in a bathroom has been resolved . ‘My own facilities for guests are half bathroom, half temple. ‘There’s no streaky chrome, or chipped wooden loo seats for heaven-knows what germs to fester. ‘If a guest doesn’t come out the lavatory and comment on its condition then I feel I have failed as a host; so many over-worry about their food, spending hours faffing with reproducing some stack, tower or jus they saw in an over-priced nouvelle cuisine joint, when really they should have spent the time having a whizz round with the Harpic.’","The argument that usually divides households has been settled via Twitter .

"Several people are unaccounted for after a fire gutted out two five-story apartment buildings in upstate New York on Friday, authorities said. With temperatures in the area reaching below freezing in Schenectady, firefighters - and the buildings - were left covered in ice as they tried to hose down the fire. The fire broke out at about 2am on Friday and left seven people injured - one who jumped from the fifth floor to escape the fire, emergency officials said. Firefighters continued to hose down the smoldering remains of the fire throughout Friday during since-digit temperatures. Scroll down for video .

The blaze that broke out at about 2am in below-freezing temperatures. The cause of the fire is unknown . Though authorities don't have a specific number of missing people, they said 60 have been displaced, according to WNYT. The fire first broke out in a building across from city hall and spread next door. Both buildings had apartments on upper levels and commercial space on the ground floor. The cause of the fire is unknown. Fire Chief Ray Senecal said three Schenectady firefighters were injured as they fought the fire, according to the Daily Gazette. He added that the cold weather did not help put out the fire. Seven people were injured in the fire, one of whom jumped out of a top-story window to escape the blaze, emergency officials said . Firefighters worked through the night to put an end to the flames the broke out in two five-story buildings across from the Schenectady's city hall . The buildings in which the fires broke out have commercial space on the ground level and apartments on the remaining levels . 'With the heavy ice, shoveling out hydrants ahead of time paid off. But we had some problems with some hydrants,' he told the Daily Gazette. And while the firefighters got covered in ice as they battled the fire, it appears that winter is holding up in much of the country. Temperatures of ten to 30 degrees below average were expected from the South to Northeast, along with heavy snow in the Mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service. The late-winter storm means school is canceled yet again for students in several states, and many households found themselves without power. A fire engine is encased in ice as it sits at the scene of the multi-alarm fire that displaced about 60 people . Fire Chief Ray Senecal said three Schenectady firefighters were injured as the fought the fire and that the crew had trouble with a few of the hydrants because of the cold temperatures . State offices and legislatures shut down, too. In the Washington area, federal offices were open but on a two-hour delay, and workers were given telecommuting options. Residents hoped the storm would be this tough winter's last wallop, with spring bringing relief soon, but across the country it doesn't look like that's the case. Record-breaking cold gripped the United States from Texas to New York on Friday, causing school closures and snarled traffic, as a storm that dropped roughly two feet of snow on some eastern parts of the country moved out to sea. Firefighters work to put out flames at the rear of the buildings on Friday. Though the fire broke out around 2am, the crew worked throughout the day on Friday to put an end to any smoldering flames . Schenectady firefighters work to douse the smoldering remains of a blaze that gutted two apartment buildings . Forecasts called for temperatures ten to 30 degrees below normal through Friday in the eastern and southern United States, with unusual cold continuing through the weekend. Snowfall and blustery weather forced public schools in the metropolitan areas of New York and the District of Columbia to cancel classes. Just shy of 800 flights had been canceled and nearly 2,300 delayed nationwide as of Friday afternoon, according to FlightAware.com. On Thursday, there were 4,957 cancellations and 4,528 delays. The National Weather Service warned of flooding and told commuters from the lower Mississippi valley to the mid-Atlantic to be wary of dangerous road conditions created by the snow, ice and slush. Though it's been a cold start to the weekend with lots of snow, warmth will build in the west and central states in the upcoming week . Temperatures could reach as high as 47 in Chicago and 86 degrees in phoenix. Winter is finally showing signs of ending as cold air is remaining north . Temperatures are dragging at around 30 degrees below average across the country and snow is still falling in most states . Low temperatures shattered records in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York, said NWS meteorologist Bruce Terry. 'Even in the deep South, it's very, very cold,' Terry said. 'It will be another cold night tonight. But we are at the end of this record-breaking cold spell.' Saranac Lake in New York's Adirondack Mountains was the coldest spot in the country on Friday, with the mercury registering minus 29 degrees Fahrenheit, he said. Cities reaching new lows for the day included Detroit at zero degrees, breaking the previous record of two degrees, set in 1901. Make way! This man shovels a path for himself near his home in Lexington, Kentucky, which is being pummeled by snow . Snow plows kept up their fast pace as dropping temperatures created the risk of icy and snow-covered highways in Kentucky . The temperature in Austin, Texas, reached 21 degrees, breaking the previous record of 28, set in 2011. In Kentucky, where cities were buried under as many as 23 inches of snow, Governor Steve Beshear declared a state of emergency on Thursday as traffic was halted on interstate highways and motorists were stranded. Stalled tractor-trailers were removed from Interstate 65 overnight, and traffic was inching along the major commuter route by Friday morning. Parts of Massachusetts got up to 12 inches of snow, but Boston only received trace amounts, NWS meteorologist Bob Oravec said. The city would have needed two inches to break its annual snowfall record of nearly 108 inches set in the year that ended in June 1996. In the upcoming week, however, central and western states are expected to warm up, with cold air remaining north in Canada and a few northern states. Temperatures could reach as high as 47 in Chicago and 86 degrees in phoenix. Winter is finally showing signs of ending as cold air is remaining north in the upcoming week.

"A jeering mob encouraged a suicidal man to ‘get on with it and jump’ before he plunged to his death from a car park. Some in the crowd of around 30 even took ‘selfies’ and filmed the drama on their phones as the man stood on a ledge 60ft above ground. Their actions were last night condemned by police. Officers said that those who took the offensive photographs and posted footage of his death on social media could face prosecution. A jeering mob encouraged a suicidal man to ‘get on with it and jump’ before he plunged to his death from a car park in Telford, Shropshire (above) The victim, who was in his 40s, had spent two hours on the top of the car park in the town of Telford, Shropshire, before he fell on Saturday afternoon. He has not yet been formally identified. Witnesses told how cries including ‘How far can you bounce?’ and ‘Go on jump’ could be heard as he stood on the ledge at the Southwater One car park. A man of 57 who was in a building opposite said: ‘I saw a crowd of people of all ages, some with small children, gathered outside watching this poor man. Many were taking pictures.’ The onlooker, who did not want to be named, said the man had waited on the ledge for more than two hours while a crowd of around 30 gathered below. He said that, although police had cordoned off the scene, some of the mob ducked under the tape to see more. ‘I just felt for the guy,’ the witness said. ‘I can’t imagine what frame of mind he could be in to want to do this. As for those who did take pictures and posted them – they should be ashamed.’ Another witness, Kelly-Anne Taylor, 35, said: ‘People were recording it with their phones and yelling at him to jump. ‘I can’t stop thinking about it. I could have tried to help him. I am so heartbroken for him and his family. Onlookers were yelling at him to jump.’ Others took to social media to tell of their disgust. One woman wrote: ‘The fact people were shouting for the man to jump from that building in Southwater and filming it make me worry for our generation. Scum.’ West Mercia Police has hit out at the 'appalling' actions of the crowd who gathered outside Southwater Shopping Centre in Telford (pictured), and said anyone who chanted should be 'unequivocally condemned' Another Twitter user, Georgia Wade, wrote: ‘RIP to that poor man who jumped off the Southwater multi-storey today hope those people feel ashamed of themselves telling him to jump.’ A petition has been launched on campaigning website Change.org calling for those who ‘encouraged’ the victim to be arrested.

The people who goaded him are despicable.

"Some were sickly Cambridge University scholars, others homeless wayfarers or simply the infirm. Having fallen on hard times, and being too poor to care for themselves, they all ended up receiving spiritual succour during their last days in the medieval Hospital of St John the Evangelist, set up in 1195. After they died they were buried in the hospital's own cemetery whose exact site and scale were a mystery for centuries – until a lecture hall belonging to a Cambridge college needed refurbishing. Incredible find: Archaeologists digging under a building owned by St John's College, University of Cambridge has unearthed the cemetery of a medieval hospital and the remains of 1,300 people . To their amazement, archaeologists digging under the Old Divinity School – a Victorian building owned by St John's College, which was founded in 1511 on the site of the hospital and which takes its name from it – unearthed the cemetery and the remains of 1,300 people. Details and photographs of the eerie find are made public for the first time today. Experts said it is one of the largest medieval hospital cemeteries ever discovered in Britain and, with on-going DNA analysis of the remains, will help to cast fresh light on life and death in medieval times. The archaeologists broke out the floors of the Old Divinity School and the team of 20 dug down inside each room. In a six-month dig they found some 400 almost perfectly preserved human skeletons and the partial remains of up to 900 more, all dating from the 13th to 15th centuries. Medieval mysteries: Archaeologists digging under a building owned by St John's College, University of Cambridge has unearthed the cemetery of a medieval hospital and the remains of 1,300 people . Big dig: Containing about 1,300 burials - including about 400 complete skeletons - the cemetary was found as part of the refurbishment of the Victorian building three years ago but details have only now been made public . History uncovered: Experts say it's one of the largest medieval hospital cemeteries ever discovered in Britain . As well as the 400 skeletons 'disarticulated' and 'fragmentary remains' of what could be as many as 1,000 more individuals have also been found . New light: With on-going DNA analysis of the remains found in the cemetary, experts hope the skeletons will help to cast fresh light on life and death in medieval times . Craig Cessford, of the Cambridge Archaeological Unit, said: 'It was known that the cemetery was in that area, but we didn't know for definite it was where we were working. 'It was a quite amazing find.' Most of the skeletons are of 25 to 45-year-old men. The hospital was run by Augustinian monks, and pregnant women were excluded. Mr Cessford, 45, said the skeletons were buried in neat rows and once the cemetery was full, more were buried on top. The names of the dead are a mystery, but the cemetery was found to have had gravel paths, suggesting that people visited their deceased loved ones. The bodies did not exhibit many serious illnesses and conditions. The Archaeological Journal, which reports on the findings in its latest issue, says this reflects how medieval hospitals' main role was 'spiritual and physical care of the poor and infirm rather than medical treatment of the sick and injured'.","Medieval cemetery of hospital set up in 1195 found under college .

"A man who murdered a sheriff's deputy years after doctors removed part of his brain will be put to death in Missouri next week - but his lawyers are fighting for him to be saved. Cecil Clayton, from Purdy, will be executed at the state prison in Bonne Terre at 6pm on March 17 for the November 1996 shooting of Barry County Sheriff's Deputy Christopher Castetter. But his attorneys are making a last-ditch attempt to save him by calling for a competency trial - saying a traumatic brain injury makes it impossible for him to understand his death sentence. In 1972, 24 years before he killed the officer, Clayton was using a sawmill when a board splintered and a shard went into his head above his right eye, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Facing death: Cecil Clayton is scheduled to die in Missouri next week but his lawyers are calling for a competency hearing. Twenty years before he murdered a cop, he had part of his brain removed, they say . Doctors were forced to remove 20 per cent of his frontal lobe, the area of the brain that controls decision making and emotions, the newspaper reported as it called for Clayton to be spared. Following the accident and before the arrest, Clayton frequently went to mental health facilities, spending up to 15 months at a time under psychiatric care. Then the evening before Thanksgiving in 1996, Deputy Castetter responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle parked outside Clayton's girlfriend's mother's home. Earlier that night, Clayton and his girlfriend had been arguing, and prosecutors said he then took a loaded gun to her mother's house. Clayton walked up to the deputy's patrol car window and shot him in the head at point-blank range. Castetter, a 29-year-old married father-of-three, died in the hospital later that day. He was convicted of the murder in October 1997 and sentenced to death later that year. His attorneys argued that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial but despite their appeals, state and federal appeals courts have upheld the conviction and the death penalty. His lawyers are now seeking a competency hearing to determine whether he understands his death penalty. Mental health professionals who have examined him agree that he is mentally impaired and has mental health issues, including dementia. Killed: Barry County Sheriff's Deputy Christopher Castetter, pictured left, was shot dead by Clayton, pictured right in an old mug shot, as he responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle in 1996 . His most recent IQ test found he had an IQ of just 71 - 29 points below the average. 'He is not simply incompetent legally; he would be unable to care for himself or manage basic self-care, were he not in a structured environment that takes care of him,' according to a doctor who examined him, the Kansas City Star reported. 'He can shower, groom, eat, walk; it is his comprehension, judgment, memory, limited intelligence and social deficits that plague him.' But there is no agreement on how much he understands his death penalty or his other options. 'If you can prove mental retardation, you can get exempted, but mental illness alone is not an exemption to the death penalty,' Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the New York Times. In Missouri, the director of the Department of Corrections is the only one with the authority to order a competency hearing, and last year, he called on a doctor to examine Clayton. Dr. James Reynolds of the Missouri Department of Mental Health concluded that Clayton is mentally ill, but could not be certain that he doesn't understand his death sentence. Execution: He is scheduled to be put to death at the state prison in Bonne Terre, pictured, next Tuesday . Death: His family and lawyers are arguing that he is child-like and does not understand the significance of his death penalty. They are calling for his execution at Bonne Terre (pictured) to be stopped . But Clayton's lawyers say, while he may have conversations in which he understands he is about to be executed, he will later forget that conversation ever happened. His family have also called for a fair hearing on the issue. 'He is brain-damaged, and talking with him is like talking to a child,' Clayton's daughter, Jena Clayton, said during his clemency petition, the Kansas City Star reported. 'I do not believe we are the kind of country that executes the disabled.' Clayton, who is the state's oldest death row inmate, will be put to death between 6pm on March 17 and 5.59pm on March 18. He will become the second person put to death in the state in 2015, after a record 10 executions in Missouri in 2014. Last month, Walter Storey was put to death for slitting his neighbor's throat 25 years ago.","Lawyers for Cecil Clayton are seeking a competency trial to halt his execution, which is scheduled for March 17 at 6pm .

"Last November the home secretary, Theresa May, described the widespread scale of abuse as 'shocking' Crime cartels are in control of thousands of modern day slaves within Britain, a government regulator has claimed. There is thought to be more than 13,000 people in the UK who are being exploited as cheap foreign labour by organised criminal gangs. Last November the home secretary, Theresa May, described the widespread scale of abuse as 'shocking'. Paul Broadbent, chief executive of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, said that trafficking human beings for labour exploitation offered high profits while the risk of prosecution was fairly low. The authority is currently investigating 300 gang leaders suspected of trafficking foreign workers, although it's feared the number of could be much higher. Anyone found supplying illegal workers can be jailed for up to ten years and fined, while people employing from an unlicensed gang leader can be fined and jailed for a year. But Mr Broatbent critcised the sentences which had been handed out to those convicted of using modern day slaves. The report for the Centre of Social Justice found that law enforcement had left an 'open goal' for organised crime to build up around immigration. This had led to crime syndicates using fake universities, sham marriages, forged documents and a network of solicitors and accounts to illegally traffic people. Once in the UK, the victims, many of whom were from the European Union, were trapped in 'debt bondage'. The gangs would claims their victims owed them for their travel fee and documents and would force them to work by deducting money for food and accommodation. Mr Broadbent told The Times: 'Slavery was abolished 200 years ago but it's alive and thriving in the UK,' he added. 'People are being forced to work against their will. 'There are physical threats and intimidation as well as psychological abuse. It's systematic coercion and control.' The site where police found 13 workers housed in caravans, sheds and even a horse box belonging to James John and Josie Connors who were sentenced to a total of 15 years . The government's Modern Slavery Bill, launched by the home secretary last year and currently going through Parliament, aims to provide new powers to protect people who are trafficked and held against their will. 'The first step to eradicating the scourge of modern slavery is acknowledging and confronting its existence,' she told the Guardian at the time. 'The estimated scale of the problem in modern Britain is shocking and these new figures starkly reinforce the case for urgent action.' The modern slavery minister, Karen Bradley, told the BBC previously the issue was a hidden crime. 'It's going on in streets, in towns, in villages across Britain and we need to help people find the signs of it so we can find those victims and importantly then find the perpetrators.' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Labour would crackdown on modern day slavery to stop immigrants being exploited and local workers being undercut. Last year a Sheffield family were jailed for keeping a man with learning difficulties as a slave. Craig Kinsella, 34, was beaten and made to work 19-hour days for no money by a couple and their son. Ice cream man David Rooke subjected Mr Kinsella to repeated violent attacks during the six weeks last summer when he was beaten, starved and held captive in his garage. His wife Donna and son Jamie also took part on the campaign of abuse. The three were jailed for a total of 11 years. Police were alerted by a neighbour and when they searched the home they found Mr Kinsella emaciated and covered in bruises. The Rooke family were caught on their own CCTV camera attacking the man they kept enslaved in their garage. Married couple James John (left) , 34, and Josie Connors (right) 31, who are cousins, were convicted of controlling, exploiting and abusing the men for financial gain and were jailed for 11 and four years respectively . In 2012, the Connors family, a gypsy gang, were jailed for forcing  homeless men to work as slaves. A 'vulnerable' man said he was forced into unpaid labour by the Connors family, and was beaten, shoved into the boot of a car and made to sing to his captor's child, . He said he was treated 'like a slave' during the six months he spent with the travellers family at the Greenacres site near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, and was told he would be murdered if he tried to leave. He eventually escaped by flagging down a police car while he was out canvassing for the Connors' block paving business. When police raided the site they found 13 workers housed in caravans, sheds and even a horse box. The tiny, grubby living quarters of one of the caravans on the Green Acres site near Leighton Buzzard . The court heard the group would recruit at centres for the homeless, soup kitchens or simply on the street with the promise of well-paid work. The men would have their heads shaved, paid little or nothing, worked seven days a week and were verbally abused and beaten. Married couple James John, 34, and Josie Connors, 31, who are cousins, were convicted of controlling, exploiting and abusing the men for financial gain and were jailed for 11 and four years respectively. The sentencing judge said they had 'brutally manipulated and exploited' destitute men. Saeeda Khan, 68, was convicted of trafficking the victim into the UK for exploitation . In 2011, a former hospital director was convicted of keeping an African woman as a slave in her London home for four years and ordered to pay her £25,000 in damages. Saeeda Khan, 68, was convicted of trafficking the victim into the UK for exploitation. The judge in the case also slapped her with a suspended nine-month prison term, and said she was guilty of the most appalling greed. Mwanahamisi Mruke, 47, originally from Tanzania, was flown to Britain in 2006 and forced to work 18-hour days for Khan at her home in Harrow, northwest London. However, Rivlin declined to give Khan a custodial sentence, citing her advance age, poor health and the fact that she has two adult disabled children. According to media reports, Khan would order Mruke around by ringing a bell. Mruke was also denied her passport and liberty and suffered the trauma of slavery in order to support her daughter who is studying in college in Africa. Initially, Khan gave Mruke an allowance of £10 a month to work around the clock at her beck and call, stated court documents. However, within a year she stopped paying her altogether. Among other revelations from the trial, Khan fed Mruke only two slices of bread a day and forced her to sleep on the kitchen floor. Mruke was also forbidden from leaving the house and she never learned English because the family only watched Pakistani TV.","Paul Broadbent warned there are 13,000 people exploited as cheap labour .

"Playing again: Paul Gray says years of loud music shattered his hearing . Musician Paul Gray first suspected he might have tinnitus while mid-way through a tour with punk band The Damned more than 30 years ago. ‘I was in my hotel room one night, and I’d turned the TV off, but could still hear a high-pitched whiney sound,’ he says. ‘I wondered where it was coming from, looked all around the room, opened the windows, and then figured that it might just be tinnitus.’ This was in 1981, and back then few, if any, musicians wore earplugs when they played live. ‘The yellow foam ones looked uncool and the wax ones were totally unsuitable for musicians as they cut out too much sound,’ says Paul. Besides, a lot of musicians — not to mention young fans — saw temporary hearing loss after a gig as something of a badge of honour. ‘Back then, it was a case of “Oh, it must have been a great gig, my ears are still ringing”, ’ says Paul, who first found fame as a bass guitarist with Eddie And The Hot Rods before going on to join The Damned and then later working with former Wham! star Andrew Ridgeley. Tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree, according to the British Tinnitus Association. Many have hearing damage as a result of being exposed to loud noise, be it in industry, the armed forces or the music business. Last month, the World Health Organisation said people should listen to music for no more than an hour a day, to prevent damage to their hearing. Tinnitus can also be triggered by conditions such as Meniere’s disease, or in older people it can occur as a result of age-related hearing loss. Sufferers experience a constant whirring or whistling in their ears and many struggle to find an effective treatment. At first Paul, now 56, experienced ‘a whine in my ears that was louder in my right ear, a bit like the sound of a jet turbine cranking up.’ It was worse after gigs, but it would come and go, until one night in 1995 while Paul was on stage with Captain Sensible (who topped the charts with his cover of Happy Talk in the Eighties). ‘There was this deafening screech of feedback, so loud that it physically knocked me several feet back,’ he says. ‘I ran off before the next song and stuffed toilet paper in my ears, but the damage had been done.’ Afterwards any sudden noise — doors banging, car breaks, shouting — would make him jump. Back home in Cardiff, Paul’s doctor referred him to a specialist at the University Hospital of Wales Ear, Nose and Throat Department, who diagnosed ‘high-frequency hearing loss’ after acoustic trauma, and advised him to limit his exposure to noise — and to get a new career. But for Paul, being a musician was more than a job. ‘It was my life. So I carried on for a couple more years.’ However, the tinnitus gradually worsened. ‘It was exacerbated by extraneous noises I had no control over, such as knives on plates, glasses clinking, children shouting — and I was hugely stressed.’ Tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree, with many suffering from hearing damage . By 1997, Paul had to admit defeat and call time on his musical career. He returned to the hospital and was prescribed maskers — a hearing aid-type device that played a hissing noise in his ears, now more commonly known as white noise generators. ‘We were trying to retrain his brain into not focusing on the tinnitus — it was a distraction technique,’ says Tim Bord, a senior audiologist at the hospital, who has been treating Paul since the mid-Nineties. Paul was supposed to wear maskers for eight hours a day for a year. ‘But I couldn’t follow conversations or hear the television properly, because I had great big pieces of plastic in each ear,’ he says. By now, even the click of a light switch aggravated his condition. ‘I pretty much became a recluse for the next few years, which contributed to my divorce,’ he says. In the late Nineties Paul was referred for counselling with a clinical psychologist, but this didn’t work. He turned to alternative treatments, from the Alexander Technique (a method of relaxation) to acupuncture. At one stage he tried ‘laser pen therapy’ — shining a torch into your ear to stimulate the growth of hair cells in the inner ear, as tinnitus has been linked to damaged hair cells. ‘You name it, I threw money at it, but they were all useless,’ says Paul, who resorted to hiding earplugs around the house to cope with the noise when his young son Jeff had friends round to play. Nowadays, one of the most common treatments is cognitive behavioural therapy — a psychotherapeutic approach that tries to get the patient to change how they think about tinnitus. While this was some help, Paul concluded he was just going to have to learn to live with his condition. He carries custom-fitted maximum protection earplugs ‘which keep the frequencies down and cuts external noise by about 25 decibels’. Basic sets can be bought from most music shops, while Specsavers charges between £50 and £100 for a made-to-measure pair. Paul also avoids noisy places as, like for many sufferers, background noise makes the problem worse. ‘If I’m in a pub or restaurant I always try to position myself against the wall, so I only have sound coming from one direction,’ he says. There have been some advances in treatments since Paul was first diagnosed — such as the introduction of smaller ‘in-ear’ white noise generators, and devices that combine a hearing aid and sound generator in one. Paul  has now learned to live with his condition and is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music . A new treatment, neuromodulation — an earplug-type device designed to target the specific frequencies that distress an individual — is available privately, but is still undergoing trials. Recently, researchers at the University of Western Australia said they’d identified a drug that blocks ‘hyperactivity’ in the area of the brain that processes sound — although they are yet to test the effect in humans. Meanwhile, Paul is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music. ‘We run a scheme called the Musician’s Hearing Passport, which gives comprehensive tests and advice on hearing protection by an audiologist,’ he says. ‘Often when I ask students to raise their hands if their ears have ever rung, eight out of ten will put their hands up. These kids are 18, 19 years old, and don’t realise the damage that’s already been done. ‘There’s still the attitude that I had, that noise is fun and that “if it’s too loud, you’re too old”.’ Paul, who has recorded a new album, A Postcard From Britain, with his old bandmate Captain Sensible, is able to play again for up to an hour at a time, so long as he wears his earplugs. He says his father had always warned him being in a rock band would ‘make me go deaf’ but he had ignored him. ‘If I knew then how my life was going to be affected by noise damage — I’m pretty deaf now — I would definitely have taken steps to protect myself. After all, a musician needs ears . . . they’re pretty vital tools of the trade.’ thesensiblegraycells.co.uk .","Musician Paul Gray first suspected he might have tinnitus while on a tour  more than 30 years ago .

A new interactive visitor guide aims to bring the property to life, with film recreating how a swinging 1930s cocktail party would have looked in the party palace, along with expert views on the restoration of the medieval great hall, stories of the house and games. There is also a children's tour, which explores the animals that lived there - including Mah Jongg, the Courtaulds' pet lemur who had his own heated bedroom, accessed via a pole ladder which gave him the run of the house. Work has also been undertaken to recreate the 1930s garden, which sits among the ruins of the medieval palace. Andrew Hann, English Heritage property historian, said: 'Eltham Palace was the ultimate grand designs project of its day boasting state of the art mod cons including under-floor heating, multi-room sound systems and a centralised vacuum cleaner. It has undergone a series of transformations over the years from a grand hall used by royals to a millionaire's party palace. But the first record of a settlement at Eltham was in the Domesday survey of 1086 which said the manor belonged to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror. It changed hands a number of times until 1295 when Anthony Bek, Bishop of Durham, acquired it and rebuilt the manor house before presenting it to the future Edward II in 1305. The King then passed it on to his queen Isabella. Successive monarchs lavished large sums on the palace. In the 1380s Richard II created a walled garden to the south beyond the moat while Henry IV  spent 10 of his 13 Christmases as king at Eltham. Historic: Work has also been undertaken to recreate the property's 1930s garden, which sits among the ruins of the medieval palace . It was a favoured residence of Edward IV who built its great hall and from the 14th to the 16th century it was an important royal palace, often used by monarchs who stayed there for hunting trips in the surrounding parks, according to English Heritage. Henry VIII passed much of his boyhood at Eltham, English Heritage says, and was the last monarch to spend large amounts of money on it. It was at Eltham in 1515 when Cardinal Wolsey took the oath of office of lord chancellor . In the decades that followed, it was poorly maintained and Elizabeth I and the early Stuarts only visited rarely. Over the following two centuries it was used as a farm and a substantial villa was built in the early 19th century. At one point the great hall was being shored up with props and was being used as a barn even in 1903. In 1933 millionaires Stephen and Virginia Courtauld took up a 99 year lease from the Crown. Social circles: Among the guests to have visited Eltham after the Courtaulds took up their lease was composer Igor Stravinsky (left) and actress Gracie Fields (right) They set about building a stylish house that incorporated the great hall which English Heritage calls 'a masterpiece of 20th-century design'. The couple transformed the grounds, which are now a mix of 1930s design and medieval remains. Keen horticulturalists, the Courtaulds also created a variety of garden features including a rock garden, formal rose gardens and a series of garden ‘rooms’, the latter being more typical of the Edwardian period or Arts and Crafts style. According to English Heritage, the building provided enough space for entertaining a broad social circle which included Queen Mary, composer Igor Stravinsky, actress Gracie Fields, conductor Malcolm Sargent, film producers Basil Dean and Michael Balcon, band leader Lew Stone, and politicians including Rab Butler and Leo Amery.

Before the makeover, 'it was beautiful, but it was very static, so you didn't get the sense of the people and fun and parties, which was really what it was about', she said.

Visitors will also get to see heritage conservation in action, as work continues to uncover restore a recently discovered map-room, whose maps of the world, the UK and London and themed wall paintings have been buried under many layers of paint and wallpaper. English Heritage is appealing for the £35,000 needed for expert conservators to fully restore and protect the room, which gives a glimpse into a bygone age of luxury travel that saw the Courtaulds heading abroad for months each year, often on their yacht.","Eltham Palace and Gardens in south east London is undergoing a major refurbishment led by English Heritage .

"Politicians in California are demanding millions in funding to add more cells to the state's death row - because it has run out of room. The wing at San Quentin prison has continued to fill up with condemned men because there have been no executions in nine years. There are 751 convicts awaiting their fate, but a moratorium was put on lethal injections in 2006 following complaints of inadequate anesthesia and cramped conditions inside the dated death chamber - which has since been updated. Overcrowding: Governor Jerry Brown is demanding $3.2million in funding because California's death row at San Quentin prison (pictured) has run out of room - even though there have been no executions in nine years . Yet more than 160 people have been sentenced to die since. The delay was lengthened in 2014 when a federal judge ruled that the capital appeals process in the state is so slow that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment - because executions were so unlikely and random. But with plans to appeal the ruling, Governor Jerry Brown is asking the state legislature for $3.2million so he can add 100 cells, The LA Times reported. California Department of Corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton told the Daily Mail Online: 'State law mandates that male condemned inmates be housed at San Quentin State Prison. 'This project is to ensure that San Quentin will have enough beds to accommodate a growing condemned inmate population.' The demand for more space comes despite the dramatic fall in the Californian prison population. Low-level drug offenders and thieves are being released because of new legislation introduced last year - meaning more cells are being made available. Condemned men are held in San Quentin in California's bay area, which has a capacity of 715, while the 20 women awaiting execution are housed at the Central California Women's Facility near Chowchilla. Update: The state's new and  execution chamber in San Quentin was opened in 2010, but it is yet to host an execution following a string of legal decisions . The men are housed separately to the general population, but would have been overflowing if a 25-cell psychiatric ward for death row inmates hadn't been added last summer. A budget proposal seen by The Times predicts 20 new death row inmates arrive every year. The funding would go towards the revamping of a block inside the main prison - beefing up security and updating the showers so inmates can be cuffed while they wash. The last person to be executed in California was frail 76-year-old Clarence Ray Allen in January 2006. He was legally blind, used a wheelchair and suffered from diabetes and chronic heart disease, had been sentenced to death for ordering the murders of three people in 1980 while serving a life sentence for murder in California's Folsom Prison. Two guards assisted a frail Allen, wearing an Indian headband, from a wheelchair  into San Quentin's cramped death chamber and he was gently scooted onto the gurney where he would die. In September 2010, a judge ruled that Albert Greenwood Brown's execution would go ahead. But his death has since been delayed because of the state's falling supply of sodium thiopental.","751 convicts are currently awaiting their fate in the state's prison system .

"A couple have been accused of mentally and emotionally abusing their 16-year-old adopted son by isolating him from the rest of the family, forcing him to live alone in the uninhabitable basement and even feeding him different food to their biological children. Eric Corcoran and Angela Corcoran of  Livingston County, New York, are charged with second-degree child abuse, reportsDetroit Free Press. The pair, both 43, are accused of years of abuse, beginning when the teen was aged 12 and they forced him to eat different meals than the family and only being allowed to 'sit in corner of one room of the main home.' Eric Corcoran (right) and Angela Corcoran (left) of Deerfield Township, Livingston County, are charged with second-degree child abuse . Angie Corcoran is accusing of slapping the teen's legs while he slept as well as hitting him with a a hanger, which broke. Eric Corcoran, admitted to protective services that the door separating the basement from the main level of the home is locked so the teen can not access the home. He said that the boy, who can not be named for legal reasons, uses the camper toilet when no one else is home, according to court documents. The teen's room in the basement was sparse according to a CPS worker. It had a twin bed, but no sheets, blankets or pillows despite the basement being 'colder than the rest of the house.' Protective services noted the boy's meals were left on the top of the stairs for him, court documents alleged. The teen, who is now in foster care, was so lonely he even created a family for himself using stuffed animals. He told protective services that his brother punched him and his sister threatened him with a gun, according to court documents. Eric Corcoran told protective services that his then-adopted son lashes out at people and steals things throughout the house, court records show.","Eric Corcoran and Angela Corcoran of Deerfield Township, Livingston County, are charged with second-degree child abuse .

"Airport officials have revealed that throwing knives, samurai swords and even a grenade launcher were among the 300 illegal weapons seized at Perth Airport, in only the last two months. The deadly haul, brought into the country by passengers arriving in Australia, included flick knives, knuckle dusters and a crossbow. The grenade launcher, believed to be from Russia, was one of the more alarming finds. Heavily armed: Knuckle dusters, nunchuks and a grenade launcher were among the weapons seized from January 1 to March 4 . Figures released by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service state that over 30 real and imitation firearms were seized from airline passengers. Passengers could face a $425,000 fine or 10 years in prison for importing dangerous goods without permission. Authorities say that people must be starting to understand these kinds of weapons won't be let into the country after they saw a drastic decrease in the number of weapons seized from 2013 to 2014. Last year 1,318 illegal weapons were discovered, a significant drop from the 3,075 seized in 2013. Assistant Minister for Imm­igration and Border Protection, Michaelia Cash, told Perth Now that it's overseas vendors that are to blame for selling the weapons to Australians under the guise they will make it across the border. Authorities say Australians are being deceived by international vendors who lead them to believe the weapons will make it home . 'People may think that items such as laser pointers, flick knives, and shock devices make for an impressive souvenir but they could end up costing you more than you bargained for,' Senator Cash said. She recommends that travellers make sure they understand the restrictions placed on what comes through customs so they don't end up throwing their hard earned cash away. 'Every year, travellers are losing their hard-earned money by bringing items and gifts back into Australia that they can't keep. 'If you bring these things back they'll be seized. You'll lose the item, waste your money and may face a ­penalty.' Airports aren't the only target with reports claiming firearms are being trafficked through the mail . In an annual report, by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, it was found that the number of undeclared handguns detected by customs had skyrocketed by 60 per cent. The report advised people are using the mail to conceal and deliver handguns in illicit firearm trafficking networks. Authorities maintain that identifying and dismantling these networks is a 'high priority'. 'We have strengthened our targeting regimen and enhanced opportunities to increase detection of illicit firearms,' the report said.","Over 300 illegal weapons have been seized from Perth Airport since January 1 .

"UNIVERSAL MAN: THE SEVEN LIVES OF JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES . by Richard Davenport-Hines . (William Collins £18.99) Keynes is a great name from our past, yet a vague one. An economic guru between the wars whose radical ideas helped to end the Great Depression and who then fought the Americans for us in the harsh, ungrateful bargaining after the end of World War II about who should pay for it. Keynes (right) with his Russian ballerina wife, Lydia Lopokova (left) No one but economists read Keynes’ books and the controversies they created — because nobody but economists can bear to read about such ‘a technical and difficult subject’, as he called it himself. Daringly but sensibly, this renowned biographer, Davenport-Hines, has studied Keynes from seven points of view — not one of them as an economist. There is so much more left to say about him with this left out. He was a man who simply simmered with alpha qualities, and could have done just about anything. He settled for being a great economist, a pillar of Cambridge University, a distinguished higher civil servant, a successful market speculator, a popular writer and journalist, a dealer in modern art who helped to restock the National Gallery, a theatre impresario who provided Cambridge with its Arts Theatre, a restorer of Covent Garden Opera House to ballet from a wartime dance hall. Oh, and he farmed on his estate in Sussex. Presiding over his versatility was Keynes’ amazing mind. To quote no lesser an authority than Bertrand Russell: ‘Keynes’ intellect was the sharpest and clearest I have ever known. Annihilating argument darted out of him with the swiftness of an adder’s tongue.’ For recreation away from all this cerebral activity, Keynes was an active and unapologetic homosexual for his younger years. Then he converted spectacularly to become the devoted husband of a glamorous Russian ballerina. He didn’t disapprove of making money, but he saw it as something to spend. Money spent oiled the capitalist system; hoarding it gummed up the works and caused recurring crises. On himself: ‘I have a clever head, a weak character, an affectionate disposition and a repulsive appearance . . . I am so physically repulsive that I’ve no business to hurl my body on anyone else’s.’ But he did — and some of the most surprising pages of this book are devoted to Keynes the lover and sexual cruiser on the pick-up. You would not have guessed it, because the cover-up was so careful, but the Cambridge of Keynes’ pre-World War I years was a hotbed of sexuality of the most refined kind. A secret society called The Apostles (of self-elected alpha minds) held meetings at which they prided themselves on learned papers rejecting conventional moral values. ‘We are the Immoralists,’ said Keynes. Keynes' (pictured) radical ideas helped end the Great Depression and he then fought the Americans at the end of World War II about who should pay for it . Returning after two years’ absence, he commented, excitedly: ‘The thing has come on by leaps and bounds to the point where practically everybody in Cambridge is an open and avowed Sodomite!’ The Apostles were responsible for distinguishing between the Higher and the Lower Sodomy. Of the Higher kind, to which they aspired, the feelings of the lovers were so intense that they precluded any physical carryings-on. Keynes entered into ‘love’ triangles with such Bloomsbury names as Lytton Strachey and his brother. The spectacle of two men who both hated their appearances equally — Lytton was tall, ungainly, with a tuft of red beard, glasses and a shrill voice, matched by Keynes, whom Virginia Woolf described as ‘a gorged seal, double chin, ledge of red lip, little eyes, central, brutal, unimaginative’ — well, it is hardly appetising. Keynes’ encounters in Cambridge were all discreet and confined within the colleges, but he took rooms in Bloomsbury for adventurous sallies on the streets. He kept accounts of his pick-ups. There was none of the Higher Sodomy here. They would read: ‘Stable Boy of Park Lane, Swede of the National Gallery, The Soldier of the Baths, the young American near the British Museum.’ Also listed were the clergyman, the Baron, the Irish nobleman of the Whitechapel Baths, the Grand Duke Cyril of the Paris Baths. No names, you’ll notice. Anonymity was part of the attraction of the pick-up. The other thing missing from his notes is any kind of guilt. Keynes enjoyed his hazardous sex life. He compiled statistics of his encounters, which averaged about 60 a year, with obvious satisfaction, as if they were cricket scores. They came to an end when he fell seriously in love with Duncan Grant, the painter of the Bloomsbury Set who had long been the lover of Lytton Strachey. Strachey let out a hyena scream of pain when he found out. With his brother, James, he set about demolishing Keynes’ reputation. Strangely enough, it was Keynes’ love for Duncan Grant, who then had a love affair with Virginia Woolf’s sister, Vanessa Bell, that changed him in the same direction. He started paying court to Lydia Lopokova, who had arrived in London as a star of the Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. It was three years before they got together at a country house party and were swiftly married with Duncan Grant as best man. Keynes never slept with a man again. His wife, known as Loppy to his friends, proved an ideal companion — intuitive instead of intellectual, slightly dotty, full of unexpected charm and pranks. She looked after Keynes, who began showing symptoms of a weak heart. Although Keynes was an active and unapologetic homosexual during his younger years, he never slept with a man again after he married ballerina, Lydia Lopokova . He overworked at the Treasury throughout World War II, but his great contributions were still to come as it ended. The first problem was the chaos of world trade now that it was dominated completely by a reinvigorated America. This was averted by setting up the Bretton Woods trade agreement, a World Bank and an International Monetary Fund — all Keynes’ ideas. It took the Americans some little time to appreciate that, in Keynes, they were not dealing with another English grandee, like his fellow negotiator Lord Halifax, but with the fastest brain in the West. Keynes knew that Britain was broke, having sold our assets and cleaned out our reserves to survive the war. The welfare plans of the Attlee government were at stake if the U.S. didn’t provide the finance. There was no American inclination to go easy on their ally, who had held the fort against Hitler. They still saw Britain as the hated imperial power they had rebelled against in 1776. So no cancellation of our debts was forthcoming. At last, the loan that Keynes was working for would be granted — but at interest of 2 per cent for the rest of the century, which is what it took us to pay it off. Worn out by meetings and speeches, Keynes limped home to England with Loppy on the Queen Mary, only to die in her arms at their country house a few weeks later. His last services to his country were made. Seven views of a man do not always add up neatly. Much as one must admire Keynes, there lingers a suspicion that he was, with reason, very arrogant and impatient with inferiors, never really at home either with his club men in Whitehall or disreputable Bloomsbury circle. Nevertheless, a rewarding and fascinating book.","John Maynard Keynes' radical ideas helped end the Great Depression .

"Weapons, vehicles and equipment worth more than $500 million that the United States gave to Yemen to help them fight terrorism has gone missing. Officials fear that the military hardware - thought to include 160 Humvees, four Heuy II helicopters, four hand-launched drones, two Cessna aircraft, a specialist surveillance aircraft and four patrol boats - may have fallen into the hands of an Iranian-backed militia or al-Qaeda. Small arms and other equipment, such as M-4 assault rifles, Glock 9mm pistols, body armour, pairs of night vision goggles and 1.25 million of rounds of ammunition, may also have vanished. Missing: U.S. firearms supplied to the Interior Ministry in Yemen, many of which may have gone astray . Violent: Members of the Houthi militia walk in front of the scene of a drive-by shooting in which one Houthi official was killed . The hardware has gone missing since 2007. The Pentagon has now suspended several other packages of military aid to the country. Requests from Yemen for heavy weapons, including fast jets, tanks and artillery, have also been rejected. Keeping track of military aid has become more difficult since the U.S. closed its embassy in the capital Sana'a in February after the city fell into the hands of Shia rebels, according to the Washington Post. Yemen's government was ousted by Shiite rebels who are supported by Iran. The Houthi rebels have seized many buildings around the capital and in the northern part of the country. President Obama tasked US military advisers to train Yemeni anti-terror forces. The US began shipping military aid to Yemen in 2007. It is feared that some of this weaponry may have been looted by powerful families in Yemen but much of it is feared to have made its way to Jihadis. Meanwhile, the Houthi rebel group, which has been in control of Sana'a since September, has released members of the government from house arrest. Horror: A Yemeni boy stands next to bloods stains at the site where Abdul Karim al-Khiwani, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Huthis who control Sanaa, was shot dead . Violence continues to plague the country. This week, one of Yemen's top journalists and activists close to the Houthi militia, Abdul Kareem al-Khaiwani, was gunned down by motorcyclists in front of his son, according to the group's official television channel al-Maseerah. Yemen is torn by a power struggle between the Iranian-backed Houthis in the north and the U.N.-recognised President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has set up a rival seat in the southern port city of Aden with Gulf Arab support.","America has given large amounts of military aid to Yemen since 2007 .

"A father who had to make an emergency delivery after his partner went into labour on their living room floor has revealed he knew what to do after watching One Born Every Minute. Charlie Willcocks, 24, acted quickly when Kirsty Reynolds went into shock following the birth of son Teighlun, who wasn't breathing and had started to turn blue. The father said he recalled a recent episode of the Channel 4 series, as he watches every week as it's Kirsty's favourite programme. Charlie Willcocks delivered his partner's son when she went into labour on their living room floor . Charlie says that it was watching his partner Kirsty Reynold's (left) favourite programme One Born Every Minute that had helped coach him through the delivery of their son Teighlun (pictured) When Kirsty, a mother of six, began having contractions, she simply thought it was Braxton hicks, or a false labour, and decided to wait it out until she was sure it was the real thing. But as the contractions began to get more intense a couple of hours later, her niece phoned for an ambulance - which only came 15 minutes after Kirsty and Charlie's son had arrived. As Kirsty began to feel the baby's head starting to emerge, she moved to the couple's sitting room floor and told Charlie to fetch clean towels. The delivery wasn't a smooth ride and required Charlie to act quickly when the birth took a dangerous turn. Moments after he delivered his own son, Charlie realised the tiny baby wasn't breathing and was starting to turn blue. Teighlun joins Kirsty's other five children. Pictured clockwise from left: Kirsty with  Larrae-Esmee, Charlie with Teighlun, Shannae, Charlie, Irelyn and Skye . Panic-stricken Kirsty went into shock but Charlie began to recall scenes from a recent episode of One Born Every Minute. He started to firmly rub the newborn's entire body until he choked up mucus and finally began to breathe and change to a healthy colour. Charlie, who works full-time at Fishers Services, recalls being shocked by his own actions and says the documentary saved their son's life. 'I think adrenaline just kicked in after initially being terrified. I just went into speed mode. If I hadn't seen that programme I wouldn't have known what to do,' he said. 'I would have just been doing what Kirsty was telling me to do. We watch it every time it's on as it's one of Kirty's favourite programmes. I'm still quite traumatised by it all.' After delivering his own son Charlie ran into complications when his baby began to turn blue from not breathing but the new father recalled a recent episode of the Channel 4 documentary and his actions saved their son . Kirsty, who has six children, Skye, nine, Shanae, eight, Charlie, six, Irelyn, five and Larae-Esmae, 16 months and now baby Teighlun, said she was in shock when she realised that she was in labour and the pair had to act quickly. 'I sat on the toilet and tried to feel for the baby's head and it was right there! 'I shouted at Charlie to get towels,' she said. 'Once my waters break, the babies don't take long to follow. I started to feel scared because I knew it wouldn't be much longer. 'When the baby came out he wasn't breathing and I just went into shock. I think Charlie is still traumatised from the whole experience!' Kirsty said despite her partner's shock, his quick reactions made the difference between life and death. 'The only thing he knew was from me watching One Born Every Minute. He just did the right things because he'd heard it on TV and knew what to do when the baby wasn't breathing.' Despite the difficult birth, the couple say they were extremely lucky that there were no more serious complications. Kirsty said: 'There is just so much that could have gone wrong. 'We feel incredibly lucky that everything worked so well. We'll be watching One Born Every Minute next Tuesday, that's for sure.'","Charlie Willcocks had to deliver his son when his partner went into labour .

"A Russian man who killed his estranged wife by throwing petrol over her and setting her alight while she was at work in a supermarket has been jailed. Shocking CCTV images  of the attack that shows the 25-year-old victim going up in flames and running through the store caused outrage across Russia, and led to widespread calls for a crackdown on violence against women. Murderer Alexander Efimov, 33, had drunk a bottle of vodka and was three times over the drink driving limit when he was arrested - and initially said the attack was his wife Ana's fault, because she refused to get back together with him. Scroll down for video . Ablaze: Harrowing CCTV footage captured the moment that Alexander Efimov doused his ex-wife in petrol while she was working in a supermarket, after she refused to get back together with him . The couple split up in 2011, and a Russian court heard that Efimov constantly pestered her, accusing her of sleeping with other men, of cheating on him when they were together and pleading him to get back together with him. In March 2014 Efimov went to the Magnit superrmarket where she worked, and asked again if she would get back together with him.

"Kylie Evans, 30, is apparently due to appear on Big Brother. She previously caused controversy with an appearance on This Morning, pictured . The sister of convicted football rapist Ched Evans is set to appear on the next series of Big Brother, it has been reported. Kylie Evans, 30, who has drawn public condemnation in the past after appearing on television to defend her sibling, was apparently selected after being fast-tracked through the early phases. Ms Evans, a mother, allegedly plans to use the appearance to try to convince the public of Ched's innocence after he served time in jail for rape. She caused outrage when she appeared on ITV's This Morning alongside Ched's girlfriend Natasha Massey, to claim her brother was innocent while he was still behind bars. According to The Sun, Ms Evans was fast tracked through the early auditioning phases after securing the services of a professional agent. Endemol, the TV production company behind the Channel 5 reality show, could not be reached for comment on the controversy. Ched Evans has been trying to restart his career as a footballer ever since he was sacked by old club Sheffield United after being convicted of rape in 2012. Evans was found guilty after he went to a hotel room in Rhyl, south Wales, after being messaged by fellow footballer Clayton McDonald saying he had 'got a bird'. Once there Evans had sex with the girl, who says she has no memory of the incident. Evans claims the sex was consensual, but a jury ruled otherwise. McDonald was acquitted, but Evans was jailed for five years. He was released late last year while continuing to protest his innocence. It was believed that Sheffield United were planning to sign him again for £500,000, but after a public outcry the club said it had no plans to hire him again. A proposed move to Oldham Athletic also fell apart due to negative media coverage, and Evans has yet to find another club which will take him. Evans pictured in Cheshire yesterday with his fiancée Natasha Massey, apparently wearing a solid gold Rolex . He continues to protest his innocence, largely via a website set up and funded by the millionaire father of his girlfriend, to whom he is now engaged. The footballer's sister has been one of his most outspoken supporters since his conviction, and has publicly challenged high-profile figures who oppose his return to football. After Sky Sports presenter Charlie Webster threatened to resign as a patron of Sheffield United if they took Evans back, his sister called her a 'hypocrite' because Ms Webster had previously written positively about convicted rapist Mike Tyson. Big Brother has a history of seeking out controversial contestants - two years ago the show signed up Dan Neal, a former police officer involved in the Jimmy Savile investigation, provoking warnings from Scotland Yard.","Kylie Evans, 30, fast-tracked through the audition process, it is claimed .

I’d been apprehensive, not liking the idea of scuba-diving with skeletons. 'No, no', Yannis, my deeply-tanned curly-haired guide had insisted. 'There’s nothing more down there than nuts and bolts and the odd bit of rotted cargo.' As I was about to discover, there was far more down there than that. Spectacular: The bright blue waters of the Messinia coastline hide a spectacular underwater world . I had arrived a few days earlier, touching down at Messinia's Kalamata airport after a particularly grim 5am red-eye from Gatwick. I’d stumbled out of the typically tiny airport to be confronted by a flat concrete car park blotted with bollards and a whiff of hot tar and thyme. Back in Greece for the first time in years, I was headed for a place called Costa Navarino, a tiny clump of hotels perched on a round bay that had, over the years, been fought over by the Spartans, Persians, Turks, British and latterly, the Italians. But while this might have been the stomping ground of Spartans Leonidas, Helen, latterly of Troy, and Menelaus, there was very little that was Spartan about it. I was staying at the Westin, one two hotels at Costa Navarino, a pretty spot that sprawls across 346 acres of scrub and thyme dotted land that, along with a seashell-shaped beach, also includes a golf course and an on-site olive grove. It’s not cheap but neither are the rooms: mine boasted a large private pool, trails of shocking pink bougainvillea and a bedroom the size of the average London flat. Wonderful: Travelmail explored one of the 89 wrecks littering the seabed in the Bay of Navarino . Luxe: The Westin Hotel at Costa Navarino proved the perfect base for an undersea adventure . Private: Each suite has a private pool and stunning sea views . Tempting though spending most of my time ensconced beside the pool was – and believe me, that’s what most do – I had a date with a diving instructor to attend. Greece, although much-loved as a sun-dappled family holiday destination, isn’t known for its diving. In reality, there’s plenty to see beneath the Grecian waves, whether shoals of tropical fish or the wrecked seabed remains of the many cultures and peoples who have passed through. Navarino Bay, a scallop-shaped stretch of gleaming cobalt water freckled with azure patches of coral is no exception. The bay has been the site of several naval battles, the first in 426BC when an Athenian fleet destroyed a defending Spartan fleet in a bloody encounter. More recently, a combined fleet of British, Russian and French ships joined forces to defeat a Turkish-Egyptian war group in the bay during the Greek War of Independence. Later, during the Second World War, Navarino Bay was the site of Italian attacks on Greek shipping – among them the ship I was about to see, 30ft below the waves of the bay. One of 89 wrecks that litter the sea bed, the Greek merchantman was the victim of an Italian bombing strike, albeit a spectacularly cack-handed one. Having managed to miss the ship on its first run and instead destroying a rocky outcrop, the rubble of which can still be seen, the bomber was forced to circle around – providing the Greek crew with ample time to jump ship. Timeless: Away from the beach, the landscape looks much the same as it did during Spartan times . Wildlife: As well as wrecks and tropical fish, the clear waters are famous for sea turtles . The second run hit the target, breaking the ship’s back and consigning it to a watery grave. The fishermen who risked their lives to save the sailors returned to Navarino Bay’s main harbour of Pylos to a heroes’ welcome. Today, the men of Pylos, a picturesque little village set around a honey-stone square dotted with cafes, are largely employed in the tourist trade – including as dive masters. One such was Yannis, a genial six-footer with curly hair and a penchant for cigarettes who ferried us out into Navarino Bay. The ship we were heading for was tucked away in a quiet cove, a scalloped spot surrounded by asperous rocks blotched with lichen set above a small stretch of bright white sand. It was from there that we headed into the sea – no backwards roll off the side of the boat here – and plunged into an underwater world of trailing seaweed and fish in every shade from delicate blush pink to bright nasturtium yellow. Then the wreck itself hoved into view, dappled with sunshine from above and rusting gently in its watery grave. Salt encrustations thickened its rails and bows, while brightly coloured fish dipped in and out of its portholes. Broken-backed, it sat in two pieces with debris scattered around the seabed around it. A compass. A coil of rope. A mysterious collection of cans, burst open with their contents gone. All the essentials, in short, for life aboard ship. Stunning: Navarino Bay is dotted with beaches, including the scallop-shaped Voidokilia Beach . Further out, the debris gave way to rocks and fish and as the land sloped away, to delicate shells and vast grassy stretches of seaweed. Small clumps of coral littered the seabed, as did chunks of rock gouged by the sea from the sloping cliffs of the cove. A starfish. A purple conch. A school of transparent, tiny fish. It wasn’t the vivid world of the Caribbean or the Red Sea but it was beautiful: a shimmering symphony of azure, palest pink and lemon yellow. Back on the boat, we took a detour on the way back to Pylos to inspect a smattering of Spartan graffiti etched onto the pink rock of another small cove – a reminder, if ever there was one, of the long history of this spot. Ancient villages and an even older landscape surround Costa Navarino, a harsh, barren and ultimately beautiful place pocked with olive groves that still looks very much as it would have to the Spartans. Diving in Greece might not have the glamour of the Caribbean but for beauty, history and some of the best food in the world, it’s hard to beat. And getting there takes less than four hours - even if you do have to brave early morning easyJet. Can’t say fairer than that. easyJet flies from Gatwick to Kalamata up to twice a week, with prices starting from £21.99 per person (one-way, including taxes and based on two people on the same booking).

"A Penn State fraternity has been suspended for sharing offensive pictures. According to police, several members of the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity posted photos to a secret Facebook page that showed mostly nude women who were 'sleeping or passed out,' drug sales and hazing rituals. Authorities were able to obtain some of the photos with a search warrant, but by the time they arrived at the fraternity house all of the computers had been wiped clean. Scroll down for video . Members of Penn State's Kappa Delta Rho fraternity(above) posted photos to a Facebook page that showed mostly nude women who were 'passed out' The Daily Collegian reports that the page had about 144 members, which included current students and past alumni. The first page, called Covert Business Transactions, was shut down after a female saw the page on a computer at the fraternity when one of the members left his computer on, and realized there was a topless photo of her that had been posted. She threatened the men, though unknown to her the page was moved to a new group, this one called 2.0. A former member who was invited to join gave police his account so they could gather evidence, and from this they were able to get 20 photos posted, that should nude photos and drugs including 'marijuana, edibles, concentrates, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication and some cocaine.' He said in a statement to authorities; 'This is the type of stuff that happens at KDR.' Now, the fraternity has been shut down while it is being investigated by law enforcement. 'In response to the discovery of the two Facebook pages allegedly hosted by Kappa Delta Rho, the chapter was immediately placed on full chapter suspension by Penn State’s Interfraternity Council,' the IFC said in a statement. 'Upon completion of all investigation into this matter, Kappa Delta Rho will be summoned by the IFC to undergo a conduct review session.' Police are now going through the photos they obtained and trying to identify the victims, though no arrests have been made at this time. 'The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent with the university community's values and expectations,' Damon Sims, Penn State's vice president for student affairs, said in a news release. Joseph S. Rosenberg, executive director of Kappa Delta Rho, said in a statement; 'Kappa Delta Rho stands for the values of contributing to our campus and broader communities, enhancing the character of our members, and respecting the rights of all who interact with our fraternity through any of our chapters. 'Upon learning from officials at Penn State that the KDR chapter at the university had been placed on full chapter suspension, our national leadership immediately examined the facts available to us at this time. In accordance with that review, we have placed the chapter on suspension for the remainder of this semester and we are conducting a full membership review and reorganization. 'We have informed the appropriate agencies and the university’s investigation and disciplinary process. Upon the completion of that investigation, we will evaluate these further findings and make a decision regarding the Penn State chapter that is appropriate for all parties. 'The national leadership of Kappa Delta Rho is committed to hold our brothers accountable for their actions. We embrace the principle of respect for all persons and we will adhere to that principle in this matter.'","Members of Penn State's Kappa Delta Rho fraternity posted photos to a Facebook page that showed mostly nude women who were 'passed out'

"An Ohio couple are pleading with authorities not to take their 41-year-old toothless black bear Archie away from them. Jeffrey and Debra Gillium failed to apply for a permit on time to keep the caged animal on their property outside of Akron and now the Ohio Department of Agriculture say they are going to confiscate Archie. The Gillium's have launched a change.org petition to drum up support and to date have garnered more than 5,500 signatures. Legal fight: Archie the 41-year-old bear is at the center of a legal tug-of-war between his owners and the Ohio Department of Agriculture . Home: Archie the bear has lived with Jeffrey and Debra Gillium for the past 35-years but could be taken away from them because of red tape . Indeed, animal rights group Renegade's Run have come out in favor of the Gillium's keeping the bear and said that to take Archie away is not in his best interests. However, the Ohio state authorities have told CBS News that they will deny the tardy permit submitted by the couple because it was entered on February 27, one year after the supposed deadline. They also claim the Gillium's have failed to ever properly register Archie and have the bear microchipped. Despite this, it was hoped that Archie would be given special dispensation and allowed to live out his days with his owners on their 2.6 acre rural and secluded farm near to Lodi, which is 30 miles away from Akron. Owner: Jeffrey Gillium squats near Archie's cage where his toothless black bear is caged on his Ohio farm . Mother: Debra Gillium has been campaigning for the past 18 months to keep Archie from being confiscated from her . Support for Archie: One of the thousands who have signed up to support the old bear protest the Ohio Department of Agriculture . The couple have said that they have had the bear for 35-years and never had one incident and their attorney has said the couple will build a new cage for him. If they do not get a new permit for Archie the Department of Agriculture will most likely take him away in the next month. The Gillium's have filed a civil complaint and claimed they were not notified about the new rules which came into place when a suicidal owner released dozens of tigers and lions from his Ohio farm in 2011. The state has said that the law is the law and they can't approve any new permits for anyone who didn't apply before January 1 2014. A hearing is scheduled April 9.","Jeffrey and Debra Gillium did not apply for a new permit for Archie in time .

"Arrest: Joe Lawton was found dead at home two days after being accused of drink-driving by police . A ‘perfect son’ killed himself two days after being arrested for drink-driving because he believed he had ‘ruined his future’. Joseph Lawton, described as an ‘exemplary student’, was found in his family’s farmhouse alongside a shotgun and a police charge sheet. Joseph, 17, was caught drink-driving on his way home from a party just four weeks after passing his driving test. He was kept in the cells overnight at Cheadle Heath police station in Greater Manchester without his parents’ knowledge. Two days later he used his father’s shotgun to kill himself at the £850,000 family farm in Disley, Stockport. The charge sheet and a letter were at his feet when his father found him. Following his death, his parents Nick and Jane Lawton successfully lobbied the Government to change the law so that 17-year-olds are treated as children in custody. An inquest into Joseph’s death heard the model pupil – who had recently gained one A and four Bs in his AS-Levels – was working on his university application and travel plans and had shown no signs of depression or anxiety. But the note found next to his body said he feared being a ‘constant disappointment’ and felt his arrest had ‘ruined his future’. The jury at Macclesfield Coroner’s Court heard that Joseph was kept in a police cell overnight after being arrested in August 2012. The youngster was driving his new Peugeot 107 home from a party with his friends when he was stopped by police and breathalysed. He was over the legal limit and was taken to a police station, where he was detained for more than seven hours overnight. His parents were unaware he had been arrested. Mr Lawton, 53, who runs a building supplies company with his wife, said: ‘He was 17 and had been treated as an adult and I said straight away that was wrong. There was an anomaly in the system.’ CCTV showing Joseph arriving at the police station and undergoing further searches and tests was shown to the jury. As the footage was played, Mrs Lawton, 49, left the courtroom. Mr Lawton said of Joseph’s letter: ‘What he means by that is he can see himself being a disappointment in the future. He had never been a disappointment – he was a very high achiever, he did everything that was asked of him. Father: Nick Lawton told an inquest that Joe was a 'perfect son' who had never disappointed the family . ‘He was a perfect son and loved by everyone. He thought he’d ruined his future and he wouldn’t be able to reach the standards he wanted to reach.’ Joseph’s family did not know of his drink-driving arrest until after his death because he was treated as an adult in custody without the need for a parent or guardian. His parents have successfully campaigned for a change in the law to see anyone aged 17 or under treated as a child in custody. The previous age limit was 16. In a statement, the Lawtons said Joseph had made a ‘bad decision’ to drive after the party. They added: ‘We were not called when he was arrested or given the opportunity to give him the support he needed. Campaign: Joe's parents Nick and Jane outside the High Court after winning a change in the law . ‘The fact that a 17-year-old is treated as an adult while in custody is an anomaly of British law. Once they are charged, they are then treated as children. This simply does not make sense. For someone of any age, being held and charged in a police station is a traumatic experience. ‘Few 17-year-olds could make a rational judgement about contacting family or legal advice in that situation without support. Perhaps most importantly of all, they are fearful of disappointing and letting down their families. We believe if the law had been different, Joe would still be alive.’ The inquest continues.

"Twitter's latest attempt to tackle the site's problem with trolls is a 'Quality Filter'. The tool works in a similar way to its 'tailored notifications' and involves scanning tweets for abusive or offensive words, threats or signs of harassment. It will automatically remove these tweets from a user's notification timeline and repeat offenders may be suspended from the site. Twitter's 'Quality Filter' will scan tweets for abusive or offensive words and threats. It will automatically remove these tweets from a user's notification timeline and repeat offenders may be suspended from the site. It was spotted by Twitter user Anil Dash (pictured) and is only currently available to verified users . The tool was first spotted by Twitter user Anil Dash who wrote: 'Well, that's an interesting and welcome addition, Twitter! (Was prompted about this on opening the app.)' Mr Dash is a verified Twitter user, meaning he has a blue tick on his account. These blue ticks are to confirm that the accounts of high-profile, influential people and celebrities are real and not parodies, for example. A Twitter spokesman said the feature is only currently available for these verified users and did not reveal if it will be rolled out further. It is likely due to the fact such celebrities fall victim to more abuse and harassment than regular users, but Twitter did not confirm this. From Mr Dash's tweet it appears the filter is opt-in. Last week the site took aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the social network. Its new rules (pictured) say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. The site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users . Reports recently claimed Twitter will  start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. When people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number (pictured). In the future, Twitter may  ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number . Twitter already lets people block, report or mute people who are sending them abusive messages. Last week the site took aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the social network. Its rules now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. Twitter said an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent. Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father's suicide. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games. In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note. Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year. Under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can, in theory, distribute it as they see fit but Twitter's rules additionally considers the people in the footage. It will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission. Twitter said 'agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy', including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders. The changes follow reports Twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking  email addresses and phone numbers. This means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details Twitter will be able to intervene. Last month an internal memo sent by Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site 'sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls'. In the memo, Mr Costolo said  he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future. Mr Costolo's comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information. It has also improved the ways in which abuse can be reported to law enforcement.","Twitter is currently trialling the feature on accounts of verified users only .

One local station has identified the man suspected of being behind the mass shooting as 41-year-old Ryan Giroux, but authorities have not confirmed that information. According to online records, Giroux spent more than six years behind bars for aggravated assault. Mesa police closed off an area around the East Valley Institute of Technology on Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, Mesa Community College issued an emergency alert, saying its campus was on lockdown and anyone already there should proceed to the safest location. The Mesa Police Department said on its Twitter page there was an active shooting in the city, which is less than 15 miles east of Phoenix. The shooting scene was near a light rail line that travels through the metro Phoenix area. Just before 1pm local time, Mesa police announced that the alleged shooter was caught in the area of 8th Avenue and Dobson Road. Television cameras captured the moment the alleged perpetrator was led by a throng of armed officers in handcuffs. The man was wearing a white hazmat suit, likely because police had removed his clothing to collect DNA evidence. Detective Flores told reporters just before 2pm PT that the suspect was taken into custody after a SWAT team spotted him standing on the balcony of a vacant condo in the 1700 block of West Emelita Avenue. The man had to be Tasered before officers could put him in handcuffs, Flores said during the media update.

A man was pronounced dead at the scene and two women suffered injuries, Flores told reporters, according to AZ Central. Tanya Ehrig, a 27-year-old mother from Mesa, said the slain victim was her sister's boyfriend. She was photographed sobbing outside the motel swarming with police. The gunman then moved to nearby Bistro 13, an off-campus restaurant run by EVIT, where he shot a student who was able to go across the street to get help. The victim was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries, but he is expected to survive. Detective Flores said the gunman then carjacked an EVIT teacher in the parking lot and drove the stolen car, a grey Honda Accord, to the Emelita Avenue and South Longmore area. Shortly after, police got a call about an attempted home invasion in the 900 block of South Dobson Road. Officers who responded to the apartment building found a man suffering from a gunshot wound. He is expected to recover. Flores said the suspect carried on the crime spree critically wounding another man, described as a maintenance worker, in the 800 block of West Emelita Avenue. The Mesa Fire and Medical Department confirmed that it was treating multiple patients linked to the crime spree.

The pair were able to get their hands on an unknown amount of cash before they fired two 'warning' shots and left the post office. However, the robbers' plan was foiled by brave passers by, who tackled them as they left the post office, causing them to drop their haul in the street. A  member of staff was injured trying to stop them from leaving the premises on the village's high street.
