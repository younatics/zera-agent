"Modern humans have been blamed for killing off the Neanderthals by out competing them, breeding with them and even outright murdering them. But new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of Africa that finished them off. Scientists studying the latest genetic, fossil and archaeological evidence claim that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today. Scroll down for video . Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the Natural History Museum in London, may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to Europe by modern humans as they migrated out of Africa . They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. Another recent genetic study by scientists at the University at Buffalo has suggested that Neanderthals may have suffered from psoriasis and Crohn's disease, a condition that affects the digestive system. They speculate that pathogens like Heliocbacter pylori, the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers, were brought to Europe by modern humans from Africa and may have infected Neanderthals, who would have been unable to fight off these new diseases. However, Neandethals may have also helped modern humans by passing on slivers of immunity against some diseases to our ancestors when they interbred. Dr Simon Underdown, a principal lecturer in anthropology at Oxford Brookes University and co-author of the study, said: 'As Neanderthal populations became more isolated they developed very small gene pools and this would have impacted their ability to fight off disease. 'When Homo sapiens came out of Africa they brought diseases with them. 'We know that Neanderthals were actually much more advanced than they have been given credit for and we even interbred with them. 'Perhaps the only difference was that we were able to cope with these diseases but Neanderthals could not.' The findings add to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were not as different from modern humans as was originally thought. Recent discoveries have suggested that rather than being brutish cavemen, Neanderthals had sophisticated culture, were master tool makers and may even have had their own language. The new study suggests that Neanderthals also suffered from many of the same afflictions and complaints that modern humans experience. Indeed, there is some evidence from caves that early humans may have burned their bedding in a bid to rid themselves of infestations of lice or bed bugs. Dr Underdown and his colleague Dr Charlotte Houldcroft, a researcher in infectious diseases at Cambridge University and University College London, analysed recent genetic studies on Neanderthals and other early humans. They also examined recent genetic research on common human pathogens that have aimed to trace their origins and combined it with fossil and archaeological evidence. Infectious bacteria like those that cause tuberculosis, shown above, may have been common in Neanderthals . Most evidence from the fossil record suggest that Neanderthals tended to suffer traumatic injuries as a result of their hunter gatherer lifestyle, but there are also signs of inflammation and infection. Their study, which is published on the open source database bioRxiv, contradicts the common view that infectious diseases only really became a problem for humans in the Holocene about 11,000 years ago when humans began living in dense settlements and farming livestock. Instead, they say many of the diseases we see around us today were common during the pleistocene when Neanderthals dominated much of Europe and Asia between 250,000 and 45,000 years ago, when they disappeared. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies . They say pathogens like TB, typhoid and Crimean fever that were thought to be zoonoses caught from herd animals may have actually originated in humans and were only passed to animals during the rise of farming around 8,000 years ago. Genetic sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan - another early human ancestor - DNA has shown that modern humans have inherited a number of genes from these extinct species. These include genes that provide immunity to viral infections such as tick-borne encephalitis. Dr Underdown said this virus would probably have been common in the forested areas of northern Europe that Neanderthals inhabited and so immunity would have been an advantage. Other genes found in modern Papua New Guineans that are involved in the immune response against viruses like dengue and influenza may have come from Neanderthals. The fossilised remains of Neanderthals, like the skull above, are revealing more details about their lifestyles . Analysis of ancient DNA has also shown that Neanderthals carried genes that would have protected them against bacterial blood poisoning, or sepsis. Dr Underdown said: 'There are genetic signals in the Neanderthal genome that suggest quite clearly that they were exposed to these types of diseases but also developed some resistance to them. 'It had been thought that many of these diseases began infecting humans with the population increases that came with domestication of animals and permanent settlements. 'Be here we have got Neanderthals being infected by these diseases long before those developments.'","Anthropologists claim that Neanderthals suffered many modern diseases .
DNA analysis has shown that they had immunity against common illnesses .
But they believe modern humans brought new infectious pathogens such as Heliocbacter pylori with them out of Africa and infected Neanderthals .
This suggests infectious diseases are much older than previously thought ."
"When Clare Hines found out she was pregnant she was faced with an agonising choice – cancel an operation to remove the tumour growing on her brain or terminate her unborn baby. Ms Hines, then 27, from Darra in Brisbane, had suffered epileptic seizures for 10 years but had recently noticed that her balance was gone and she was struggling to hear out of her right ear. After a number of tests doctors discovered she had a benign tumour that had wrapped itself around her acoustic, facial and balance nerve – and told her she had have it surgically removed or she risked the tumour turning malignant. Scroll down for video . Clare Hines, who lives in Brisbane, was diagnosed with a brain tumour after suffering epileptic seizures . One week before brain surgery she found out she was pregnant. She went against doctors' warnings to keep the baby and give birth to her son Noah . But in February 2012, one week before she was due to go into surgery, she took a pregnancy test that turned out positive. 'I went to doctor booked and told her I've been the pill for 10 years - this wasn't planned,' Ms Hines told Daily Mail Australia. 'She asked me 'What do you want to do, do you want to carry on with pregnancy or have your surgery?' 'I felt sick - how can you ask somebody that?' Doctors warned Ms Hines that the baby would not survive being under general anaesthetic for 12 hours if she had the operation. They also warned her that if she kept the baby, her pregnancy hormones would likely cause the tumour to grow significantly. Her baby was also at a higher risk of being born with birth defects, but she decided to push ahead with the pregnancy. Seven weeks after Noah was born, Ms Hines and their newborn flew back to her home of Manchester in the UK to finally undergo surgery to remove her brain tumour, which had almost doubled in size . Ms Hines is pictured seeing Noah for the first time in three weeks, after her brain surgery . 'I'm a strong believer in fate – I thought this is meant to happen and maybe this baby is going to be my strength to get me through,' she said. 'All my friends were really shocked - friends said 'How could you be so stupid?' 'But I thought you know what, it's nothing to do with you it's my choice.' Ms Hines' pregnancy was difficult and she suffered from exhaustion, stress and anxiety – but the real test came when she went into labour. 'It was the worst labour ever, I had three seizures in the middle,' she said. 'When you seizure all your muscles contract and they could basically squash the baby.' Doctors made the decision to perform an emergency caesarean and Ms Hines gave birth to her son Noah on October 16, 2012. 'He wasn't breathing when he was born he had to be resuscitated, that was the shock of the birth,' she said. 'At first we didn't hear any cries. Doctors had to perform an emergency caesarean after Ms Hines suffered three seizures during labour . Ms Hines said she and her husband Marcus were very worried about Noah, but tests showed he was healthy . 'But then he opened his mouth and his vocal cords started working. He only cried for like 30 seconds and he didn't cry for five days afterwards.' Ms Hines said she and her husband Marcus Hines were very worried about Noah, but tests showed he was healthy. 'He had 10 toes, 10 fingers, his hearing and eyesight were good - everything seemed to be fine,' she said. Seven weeks after Noah was born, Mr and Ms Hines and their newborn flew back to her home of Manchester in the UK to finally undergo surgery to remove her brain tumour, which had almost doubled in size. 'I wanted to go back to the UK to have the surgery done there – I thought that if something happens to me I don't want to die here I want to be around family,' she said. 'My husband took me to hospital and I just remember feeling nauseous, dizzy and just really, really frightened.' After returning to Australia following her surgery, Ms Hines suffered another accident at the gym . In January 2103, after a 10 and a half hour operation, she woke up in terrible pain and had completely lost hearing in her right ear. She also contracted bacterial meningitis forcing her to stay in hospital for four weeks without seeing Noah. But Ms Hines said the moment they were reunited made it all worth it. 'I wasn't supposed to hold him but I just wanted to see him,' she said. 'As soon as I did the pain just went away. 'I thought ""This is why he happened. He happened to make me better."" The young family returned to Australia and Ms Hines returned to work. B . But in an effort to get healthy again she went to the gym, where she had another seizure while running on a treadmill causing massive injuries to her face. She had to undergo more surgery to have a metal plate put in her cheek and eye socket. Ms Hines is now 30 and has been seizure-free for two years. She has started a new job as an account manager at a marketing company but she struggles to communicate with her colleagues without hearing in her right ear . Ms Hines and husband Marcus (pictured with Noah) arein tens of thousands of dollars' worth of debt due to the cost of flying to the UK for her operation, her medication and the multiple specialists she sees regularly .

Ms Hines - who is in tens of thousands of dollars' worth of debt due to the cost of flying to the UK for her operation, her medication and the multiple specialists she needs to see regularly - is trying to raise money to buy a hearing aid. 'I need a hearing aid to help me – I can't hear Noah in the night when I lay on my side,' she said. 'I can't drive because can't hear traffic coming on the right side, I can't get a bike because can't hear cars.'

"Celebrity chef Pete Evans has lost yet another profitable deal after being dropped as a celebrity ambassador by the national salad chain, Sumo Salad. The food chain are strongly denying that this move is related to Evans' recent paleo controversies, and maintains that the decision to not renew his two-year contract was made a long time ago. This comes at the same time that Evans announced that his disputed baby cookbook 'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way' will become a self-published digital book to be released this month. Scroll down for video . Pete Evans has been dropped as the celebrity ambassador for popular salad chain 'Sumo Salad' This has come after his paleo cookbook for infants was delayed due to fatal health concerns . The head of marketing for Sumo Salad, Petra Orrenius has told news.com.au that they had a positive collaboration with Pete Evans but had been with him for too long. They have decided to take their marketing in a different direction and this does not include Evans. Sumo Salad maintains that their decision was not due to Evans' paleo controversies . 'I think often when you’re trying to make a difference you have to be a bit radical and stand out. We’ve always been very supportive of Pete and we’re happy with that,' Orrenius said. Pete Evans' paleo cookbook for infants  had been delayed over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth. 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the Public Health Association of Australia. However, the book is reportedly set for release online amidst the controversy. 'We now know that [Bubba Yum Yum] will be released by the end of the month,' Evans posted on his Facebook on Thursday afternoon.

"Scientists believe life on Earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago. But while they have been able to put a date on when life appeared, they are still far from knowing how it appeared. Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago. Scroll down for video . Scientists believe life on Earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago, but they are still far from knowing how it appeared.  Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago . RNA, which stands for ribonucleic acid, is a molecule made up of one or more nucleotides. It is one of three major biological molecules that are essential for all known forms of life, along with DNA and proteins. The main job of RNA is to transfer the genetic code to create proteins from the nucleus to the ribosome. This prevents the DNA from having to leave the nucleus, and protects it from damage. It also acts as an on-and-off switch for some genes. The researchers believe these fragments used their innate self-evolving abilities to grow into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life. The study, by the University of Milan and University of Colorado Boulder, is based on a discovery in the 1980s that RNA can chemically alter its own structure. RNA is similar to DNA, and carries out a number of jobs in our cells, including acting as an on-and-off switch for some genes. Scientists believe that when life was in its early stages, RNA played a leading role in creating complex organisms before DNA and proteins were developed. Many origin-of-life researchers say that RNA chains are too specialised to have been created as a product of random chemical reactions. The new study, however, claims to provide an alternative theory by arguing primordial DNA-like fragments evolved in this way instead. The researchers found the self-assembly of DNA fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds. These connect together short DNA chains to form long ones, without the need for a separate biological process. The image shows a droplet of condensed nano-DNA and within it smaller drops of its liquid crystal phase which show up in polarised light on the left. The liquid crystal droplets act as 'micro-reactors' where short DNA can join together into long polymer chains to evolve into more complex life . 'Our observations are suggestive of what may have happened on the early Earth when the first DNA-like molecular fragments appeared,' said CU-Boulder physics Professor Noel Clark, a study co-author. The study suggests that the way in which DNA emerged in the early Earth lies in its structural properties and its ability to self-organise. In the pre-RNA world, the spontaneous self-assembly of fragments of nucleic acids – the building block of life - may have acted as a template for their chemical self-assembly. 'The new findings show that in the presence of appropriate chemical conditions, the spontaneous self-assembly of small DNA fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favours their binding into longer polymers, thereby providing a pre-RNA route to the RNA world,' added Professor Clark.","Scientists say early DNA-like fragments guided their own growth .

"A Miami University of Ohio student killed by her boyfriend in February was shot in her own bed in a locked bedroom as she slept fully clothed, according to a grisly coroner's report revealed Tuesday. Rebecca Eldemire, 21, was shot repeatedly in the face with a .357 Magnum by her boyfriend, 27-year-old Larry Tipton. After shooting Eldemire twice, Tipton laid down face up beside her and fatally shot himself. 'On a desk within (Eldemire's bedroom) is a two-page (suicide) note written by him,' reads the report obtained by the Cincinnati Enquirer. Scroll down for video . Killed: Larry Tipton, left,  fatally shot his ex-girlfriend, 21-year-old Rebecca Eldemire, right, before taking his own life in her off-campus apartment in Oxford, Ohio on Sunday morning . When Rebecca Eldemire called 911 the night before her murder for help getting away from her boyfriend, one painful excerpt reveals how naive the 21-year-old was to what her older boyfriend was capable of. Eldemire: I'm having a bit of an issue with my boyfriend...He's coming in from out of town and wants to talk to me. He obviously knows where I live and I'm just a little nervous about the situation. I broke up with him today . 911 Operator: OK, do you know, does he have any weapons or anything? Eldemire: He does own guns, yes, but I don't think he would bring any with him. Police officers left after Eldemire told them she was okay to handle Larry Tipton on her own. He murdered her the next morning before turning the gun on himself. Source: WCPO . Eldemire was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to the report. She was shot at 'intermediate' range, the report says--meaning close enough to cause powder burns but not point blank. Investigators noted that they found no signs of struggle, the Enquirer reports. Tipton left a suicide note. Another note was found at his Columbus home. According to their Facebook pages, the couple had been dating for a few years and were pictured smiling together as recently as last month. The day before she was murdered, Eldemire contacted Oxford Police to say that she wanted protection from her ex-boyfriend, Sergeant Jon Varley of Oxford Police said at a press conference on Monday. Officers arrived and stopped Tipton in the parking lot of the apartment where Eldemire lived and on her request, they took him up to the home, Varley said. 'After a brief conversation, Eldemire told officers they could leave as they were no longer needed,' he added, and the officers left. But at 8.45am on Sunday, her roommates called police, who arrived and found the bodies and one gun inside the room, they said. Tipton, who was from Columbus, was not a student at the university. Eldemire, a double major of geography and geographical information systems, had one parent living in Maineville and another in Columbus, as well as a brother. Together: Eldemire, who started dating Lipton in 2012, had called police to her apartment the day before her murder to protect her when he arrived. But after speaking with him, she sent the officers away, police said . She worked as a student supervisor at the library, and had spent a previous summer teaching students English in a remote village in Tanzania, the college said. Eldemire's uncle, Stephen Wright, released a statement on behalf of her family. 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of our beautiful daughter Rebecca,' it read. 'We appreciate all of the thoughts and prayers, but ask that you respect the family's privacy at this time. 'The Rebecca C. Eldemire BEEPS (Betterment for Environmental and Earth Protection) Foundation will be created in her honor, striving toward Rebecca's lifelong goal of creating a more sustainable planet.' Tipton's parents, who are often pictured with Eldemire on their Facebook pages, also released a statement following the deaths, WCPO reported. 'As you can imagine, this horrible tragedy has left our family in shock and absolutely heartbroken,' Larry and MaryBeth Tipton said in a statement.

"Death: Gillian Nelson was 'delirious and spaced out' following the birth, according to her husband . A widower told an inquest today how his wife was ‘delirious and spaced out’ when she lost a large amount of blood after giving birth. James Ramirez, 37, said he has concerns over the care of his wife Gillian Nelson, 34, who died after complications arose with the birth of their son Wesley at a hospital in Bromley, Kent. He was called to the Princess Royal University Hospital at about 3.45am on January 28, 2014 after she had gone in to labour. She had given birth by the time he arrived at 4.25am. Asked about how he found his wife after birth, Mr Ramirez told London’s Southwark Coroner’s Court: ‘I would say she was delirious, spaced out, obviously tired. She was pale. 'Somewhat reassuringly she had blood on her T-shirt which would suggest she had the chance to hold Wesley. She was babbling a little bit.’ He stayed in the room with his wife until she was taken to theatre at about 6.30am. Mr Ramirez could recall there was ‘a blur’ of staff - but although he felt their manner was professional, there were ‘no alarms going off’. There had been blood loss and there were about nine people in the room, he said. The court was told that Miss Nelson, a businesswoman, had been admitted for an induced delivery at Princess Royal University Hospital, where she gave birth but was suffering bleeding. Baby: Wesley Ramierez (pictured), whose mother Miss Nelson died after complications arose with his birth . She had multiple cardiac arrests and was taken to theatre for a hysterectomy. Mr Ramirez told the court that it was only about 30 to 40 minutes after his wife left the room to go in to theatre that he realised how serious the situation had become. Evidence: James Ramirez (left), husband of Miss Nelson, leaves Southwark Coroner's Court today . He noted that at one point his wife was turned on her side and ‘there was a flood of blood on the bed’ which left a stain the size of a double A4-sided sheet of paper on the covers. It was ‘clear she was bleeding heavily’, he claimed, adding ‘she was quite pale and clammy, paler than usual’. She was later moved to King’s College Hospital in Denmark Hill, south-east London, where the family was told she needed a liver transplant. The family were later told that they ‘were out of options’ and Miss Nelson died on February 2. Mr Ramirez, who had gone to the family home in Sydenham, south-east London, to await a call to say that his wife had gone in to labour, told the court: ‘From my understanding of the documents and statements we have seen, it does seem there was some gaps in her monitoring which obviously does leave me with the question of what would have happened if I had stayed?’ He said that he hoped the inquest would not become a ‘forum for belittling’ all of the care that his wife received. He said: ‘Both Gillian and myself have been strong supporters of the NHS. It would be my hope that this is not a forum for belittling the intention of the care that she was provided. 'Certainly the family has seen excellent care in King’s College Hospital where she was transferred, and seen a real intention to make sure that Gillian survived. We have seen some excellent support. 'But we are really concerned about understanding what happened to Gillian rather than casting blame on any particular member of staff or anything of that nature.’ Place of death: Mr Ramirez was called to the Princess Royal University Hospital (above) in Bromley, Kent, at about 3.45am after his wife had gone in to labour. She had given birth by the time he arrived at 4.25am . Miss Nelson's condition went downhill between 4.25 and 5.45am. She had told a staff member that she had lost some blood while she was in a toilet, before giving birth at around 4am. Midwife Cathy Lowther told the inquest that Miss Nelson was being regularly observed. She recalled: ‘There was a lot going on in the room with the baby. I think our team was tied up with the care of the baby to start off with.’ Miss Nelson was given fluids probably to try to raise her blood pressure and it was spotted that her haemoglobin had dropped, meaning there was not enough oxygen going around her body, the inquest heard. Ms Lowther suggested ‘you would put it down to blood loss’. Then Miss Nelson later appeared to be short of breath and, from being ‘awake and alert’, she was ‘very sleepy’, according to Ms Lowther. She was ‘very pale’ and was given a blood transfusion. Ms Lowther said she did not remember Miss Nelson's skin being ‘cold and clammy’ - the description earlier given to the inquest by Mr Ramirez. Miss Nelson was taken to theatre for surgery by 6.40am. The inquest was adjourned to tomorrow at 9am.","Gillian Nelson had complications with birth before being taken to theatre .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in Saddam Hussein's army. Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late Iraqi dictator's military. Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became involved with ISIS either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator's 2006 execution.

One former Syrian rebel who became an ISIS regional commander told the Washington Post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group's day-to-day business were ex members of Hussein's Baathist army. During one meeting in which he dared to disagree with fellow commanders at an ISIS meeting, the man calling himself Abu Hamza was placed under arrest on the orders of a masked man who had sat silently and almost unnoticed at the side of the room, listening and taking notes. Although the enigmatic commander's real name was never revealed to him, Hamza said that he later discovered that the man had been an intelligence officer for the Iraqi army before joining ISIS. The same went for the other ISIS commanders Hamza met, who either used code names or no names at all in the hope of concealing their past as members of Hussein's army. As well as their extensive military expertise, another key element of the commanders' appointments has been the fact the ex-Baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to Hussein's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s. Crucially, oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income. Leader: Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured), played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Experience: Former Iraqi Army colonel Haji Bakr (left) was al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of Syrian rebels in January 2014. Pictured right is Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member . The former Iraqi Army generals' connections with oil smugglers are crucial to ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income . Middle East analysts and experts believe one key reason why so many former Iraqi army commanders have joined ISIS is due to the de-Baathification law brought in L.­ Paul Bremer - the American who served as temporary head of the Iraqi state following the ousting of Hussein. The law effectively meant that 400,000 members of the defeated Iraqi army could no longer be employed in government roles and were barred from drawing their military pensions. Many of these highly-trained commanders joined the insurgency in the country in the mid-2000s, which was dominated by ISIS who at the time were known by the name Al Qaeda in Iraq. When al-Baghdadi took control of the group in 2010, many of these commanders were given prominent leadership roles in the hope they might win the support of the Sunni tribes who dominate Western Iraq and who have been largely ignored by the country's Shia-led Baghdad government. The process had, however been started by al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi who was himself a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted by the military than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Past: The process of giving former Iraqi commanders senior roles was started by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi (left) who was a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (right) Heartbreaking: The highest estimate for the number of recruits killed in the Speicher massacre is about 1,700 . Discovery: The graves were found last Wednesday on the late Saddam Hussein's presidential compound . One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, who used the code name Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, and was in charge of all the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November. He had previously been a colonel in military intelligence and served in Hussein's Republican Guard. Other senior figures include Abu Ali al-Anbari, who currently acts as Baghdadi's deputy leader in Syria and is a former military general in Hussein's Iraqi Army, and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence and now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council. Less prominent militants with an Iraqi Army backgrounds include Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member, Abu Kassem - a former Iraqi officer and now in charge of ISIS suicide bombers and foreign fighters. Another former Iraqi Army colonel was Haji Bakr, who is widely considered to have been al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of a rebel group known as the Syrian Martyr's Brigade in January 2014. It is widely believed that all of the senior ISIS figures killed over the past year - including Haji Bakr - have been replaced by former members of the Iraqi Army. Horror: Images like this one of the soldiers being led through Tikrit shocked Iraq and the world . This morning Iraqi forensic teams in the newly liberated city of Tikrit have started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of the hundreds of soldiers killed by ISIS last year. Kamil Amin, from Iraq's Human Rights Ministry, said the work on eight locations started yesterday inside Tikrit's complex of presidential palaces, where much of the killing is thought to have occured. ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing around 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher, an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit. The fall of Tikrit was part of the ISIS onslaught that stunned Iraqi security forces and the military, which melted away as the militants advanced and captured key cities and towns in the country's north and west. Later, ISIS group posted graphic images online that showed gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after forcing them to lay face-down in a ditch with their arms tied behind their backs. After weeks of bitter clashes, Iraqi forces and allied Shiite militias, succeeded in retaking Tikrit from ISIS. Their victory was helped by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes.","ISIS leadership is dominated by former members of Hussein's Iraqi Army .

"A couple have been spared prison for felony child neglect after admitting to locking their three young children in a room with urine and feces for 24 hours a day - and feeding them through a gate. Scott Suggs, 28, and Brandy Kangas, 36, were arrested after police received an anonymous tip regarding the welfare of their children, a 17-month-old boy and two girls, aged three and four. When police arrived at their home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, last December, they discovered the youngsters locked in a 'sparsely furnished' room, where they had seemingly 'remained at all times'. The room was stained with human urine and feces and had a homemade 'gate', which the children appeared to have been fed their meals through. Authorities immediately removed the youngsters. Guilty: Scott Suggs (left), 28, and Brandy Kangas (right), 36, have been sentenced for child neglect after admitting to locking their three children in a room with urine and feces - and feeding them through a gate . Horrific: The couple were arrested after police received an anonymous tip about their 17-month-old son and two small daughters. Above, the messy room (right) and the gate through which the children were fed (left) On Monday, Suggs and Kangas pleaded guilty to three counts of felony child neglect in relation to their children, who consequently lack social skills and are fearful of closed doors, according to NBC. However, the parents have now escaped jail after being handed six-year suspended sentences, 10 years of 'good behavior' and indefinite supervised probation by a judge at Spotsylvania circuit court. They are also not allowed unsupervised contact with the trio. Spotsylvania County Sheriff Roger Harris said on Friday: 'This was an abhorrent situation that the children were living in and it breaks my heart to see this kind of treatment of small children. 'Saving these kids from this type of neglect is why all of us are involved in public service.' Following the anonymous tip last December 16, police arrived at the Fleming Street home and removed the children from the locked room using a 'key that was located in the residence'. Children The baby boy (second right) and one of the two girls (front), who are aged three and four, are believed to be pictured with their two older sisters, who have not been mentioned in the shocking child neglect case . Scene: The room in Fleming Street (pictured) in Fredericksburg, Virginia, was stained with urine and feces . 'The room was in disarray and had stains to include urine and feces. The children were fed through an opening in the gate,' Captain Jeff Pearce, of the sheriff's office, told Frederciksburg.com. In the immediate aftermath of the discovery, members of the sheriff's office reportedly offered to provide bedding and clothing for the children, who are not being identified for legal reasons. The youngsters were later placed with a foster care family, where they are said to be thriving. According to their Facebook pages, Kangas, who works at a Holiday Inn Express, and Suggs have several older children. It is unknown whether these children have also been placed into care. Neglectful: On Tuesday, Suggs (pictured, right, in a Facebook photo) and Kangas (left) pleaded guilty to three counts of felony child neglect in relation to their children, who were fed their meals through a homemade 'gate' Suspended sentences: Suggs and Kangas (pictured in a 2009 Facebook photo with two of their older children) have both been handed six-year suspended sentences, 10 years of 'good behavior' and supervised probation .","Scott Suggs, 28, and Brandy Kangas, 36, locked three children in room .

"Illicit operation: Chiropractor Gertrude Pitkanen would sell newborn babies to adoptive parents for as little as $100 in Butte, Montana . For as little as $100, chiropractor Gertrude Pitkanen took babies from their mother's arms seconds after they were born and handed them to their adoptive parents. As the infants were driven to their new homes, the families were sometimes forced to throw their afterbirth out of the window because they were removed so quickly. These transactions formed the basis of a lucrative, illicit market that started in Butte, Montana, in 1920s, and grew until Pitkanen decided to stop in the 1950s. Most of the children who were victims of this horrific crime have now aged, have families and have forged their own lives - but they are still looking for answers. They have joined together to form a group called Gertie's Babies who have been using DNA to trace their biological families and search for their estranged siblings that are still alive. Only a six of them have come together, but they believe there are many more people who were given up by Pitkanen out there, and simply do not know it. Heather Livergood, 69, was purchased for $100 in a motel room in 1946.  Now 69 she lives in Coeur d'Alene, northern Idaho, with her husband Steve. This May she will have been married for 47 years, has three children and is expecting a grandchild this month. Last year, while using sites such as Ancestory.com and 23andMe.com, she was able to track down two half brothers Bob and Gary, who live in Grantsville, Utah. Her birth mother was called Violet Weyland Sandberg, and discovered the circumstances which forced her to abandon her as a child. While her husband, Evan Sandberg a member of the Army Air Corps, had been fighting in the Pacific, she got pregnant with another man's child, prompting her to take desperate action. She told the Daily Mail Online that her biological aunt, Julia, had told her children before she died that Violet had spent two months with a man in Montana while her husband was fighting. On a night in 1946, Violet traveled 450 miles from Grantsville to give birth in Butte. That decision forged a certain future for Mrs Livergood, . She moved into a good home with her adoptive family. Her mother died when she was three and she was raised by her father, a man who she said was 'great, very funny and outgoing', and a stepmother. Heather Livergood (center), now 69, was given up for adoption in 1946 but has been reunited with brothers Gary (left) and Bob (right) following a trip to Grantsville, Utah, last year . However she has sympathy for her birth mother, because she had gotten herself into trouble. She told the Spokesman-Review in an interview last year: 'I couldn't give up a child, but I don't blame her for that. And you know, things weren't very good when the war got out. People didn't have a lot of money.' Her adoptive father also shared a detail from the night she was born which prompted her to dig further into her family history. Mrs Livergood told the Daily Mail Online she visited her brothers last year after tracking them down and keeps in contact with them on a regular basis. She plans to return for another trip as she continues to build a relationship with them. Some others however have been unsuccessful in their search. Mrs Livergood discovered her birth mother was called Violet Weyland Sandberg. She got pregnant with another man while her husband was away at war . Bonnie Gower told the Daily Mail Online that when she was born, she was given to parents who couldn't have children through traditional methods. They had already adopted two boys and wanted a girl  but they were told they couldn't have anymore. 'A friend of theirs who had a adopted a son through Gertie got a call from the local go between asking them if they wanted a baby girl,' she told the Daily Mail Online. 'They said no but called my mom and asked. My parents said yes and they drove to Butte to get me. My birth certificate is filled out in my Dad's handwriting.' Her adoptive parents were told what to write and they handed over $500 to complete the transaction. She added: 'He [her father] said he couldn't remember if they went the day I was born (probably not), but the date they were to write down was the day they got me. Throughout her childhood, Mrs Gower was always told she had been adopted and lived a good life. Her parents always said she was 'special' because they picked her. 'I did not know the black market baby stuff until I was ready to get married and decided I wanted to try to get my medical history, ' she said. 'In contacting the state they said there was no adoption papers and that I wasn't adopted. Then I got the story from my parents. 'My mom's words were...""we were never going to tell"". But they knew nothing of the birth mother and asked no questions. 'I think they knew what they were doing was illegal, but they just wanted a baby and put that little fact away.' Mrs Gower has since completed the checks on Ancestory.com and has only found connections to third cousins. She has contacted them but is yet to receive a reply. 'I suppose I will continue my search for many more years...but not aggressively as I did when we all connected,' she added. Sue Docken was also sold for $500 in 1951 from on office building in Butte. The transaction was expected to last just a few minutes, so her adoptive's mother's husband was told to leave the car running as he waited outside. She went back to the empty office building about a month ago to see where the exchange unfolded. Mable Deane, 65, who runs the Gertie's Babies website, was given up in 1949, and is yet to learn much about her past. Pitkanen was never held accountable for the black market scheme which tore families apart. She was born in 1878 and trained as a nurse and chiropractor before moving with her husband Gustave Pitkanen to Butte. She died in 1960, but escaped criminal prosecution. It's not known how much money she made from the scheme or how many of the adoptions she organised over at least three decades. According to The New York Times she worked with the political and business elite and had a 'black book' with intelligence she could use as blackmail. She was charged with botched abortions on multiple occasions, but each time a judge threw out the case, fearing the repercussions of what she might do. Pitkanen also made her service available to prostitutes, an industry that was thriving in Butte at the time of her operation. Others who got pregnant out of wedlock or through affairs also used the service.","Gertrude Pitkanen started the illicit scheme in Butte, Montana in the 1920s .

"Luckless: Huw Davies, 34, has been searching for permanent employment for almost 13 years . A geography graduate has applied for more than 500 jobs - but has not been called for a single interview. Huw Davies, 34, has been searching for permanent employment for almost 13 years since graduating from the University of Glamorgan in 2002. As well as his BSc (hons) degree, Mr Davies, who lives in Merthyr Tydfil, also has three A-levels and 10 GCSEs on his CV. Despite his strong academic background, he has been unable to secure a job and says he 'hasn't got the foggiest' about what he is doing wrong. Although he has worked over the 13-year period, all the jobs have been on short, fixed-term contracts. He has also spent time teaching in South Africa, Kuwait and the desert kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but says he returned home as he wants to live in the UK. All this has meant he has been forced to dig deep into his savings to pay the rent and other bills. Scroll down for video . He said: 'It's unbelievable and no-one can understand it. 'Everyone I've spoken to - people in business, the job centre, my friends and family just don't know why I don't even get interviews. 'The sheer fact I have moved three times to work should imply I am eager to work. 'It's hard to blame anyone without being able to put my finger on the issue in the first place.' Searching: Mr Davies has a geography degree and three A-levels, but has not even been called for interview . Mr Davies initially wanted to find a job related to his degree, specifically employment within the environmental or town planning sectors. But after his numerous setbacks, the 34-year-old is now willing to settle for almost anything. He has put his name forward for roles including office jobs, administration, factory work - and even a position as a train driver. Mr Davies, who spends his spare time writing and has published three poetry books and is currently working on two novels, has also registered with job agencies in Cardiff and Swansea. He says he is not fussed about where he is based. 'I drive, I am willing to travel a decent distance,' he said. 'I have the will, I have the drive. I would understand if I had bad interview technique but I am not even getting calls back. 'My CV has been redone by three or four different people. 'All my friends cannot believe it. They say I must be the most unfortunate person. 'I can't think of anyone else who would leave Britain three times to find work. I even applied for a job as a train driver, just because it was there. 'I feel awful thinking I have a lot to offer but no one wants to use me. It's frustrating, upsetting. If I was very blasé it would be a whole different story.' He added: 'My job centre told me ages ago I was caught in a catch-22, saying I was over-qualified for a factory-type job but under-experienced for the kind of job I wanted to do.' Struggle: The 34-year-old will work anywhere in Britain, but despite his flexibility, he has not secured a job . Mr Davies is not the first luckless candidate to struggle finding a job. In 2011, Leanne Shipley, 18, from East Yorkshire, applied for 300 jobs without hearing back from a single one. In the same year, 19-year-old Bob Jewers, from County Durham, said he had been rejected from 400 jobs, only getting replies from four. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said employment in Wales went up in the last quarter by 24,000 people. The spokesman added: 'Unemployment fell in the last three months by 13,000 so there are just 92,000 people out of work in Wales. 'The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance in Wales has also fallen by 17,000 in the last year.'","Huw Davies has been hunting for a permanent job for almost 13 years .

"I am not vain, rich or brave enough to face plastic surgery, when my mother rang for her weekly chat and I was feeling ancient after spotting a new wrinkle, I probed her for beauty advice. If I was feeling old, she, with a nearly 40-year-old daughter, must be feeling ancient - yet she looked great. At 65, she could easily pass for ten years younger. Scroll down for video . Sarah's face was transformed after the exercises. She's pictured before (left) and after (right) 'I thank my genes, the fact I've never tried a cigarette and the facial stretches I've been doing for 30 years,' she said. Ah, those. I remember my mum slathered in Vaseline, gurning in a Club Sport tracksuit while I ate my Coco Pops, invariably wearing the Deely Bobbers I insisted on sleeping in between 1983 and 85. So they worked? My mother swore they did. Facial exercises have been around as long as youth has been considered the hallmark of beauty, with some claiming Cleopatra was the first celebrity fan. The first official guide, however, was published in Paris in 1710, outlining the beauty routine of Ninon de L'Enclose, a courtesan famed for her lasting beauty. Nearly two centuries later, Sanford Bennett - a notoriously wrinkle-free San Franciscan 70-year-old - released his book, Exercising In Bed, which gave away his facial secrets. From then on, facial exercisers came thick and fast. Jack LaLanne, the funny Hollywood guy permanently in tight Lycra was the visage visionary of the Fifties, right up to the Eighties. Today, however, the go-to expert is Carole Maggio, the LA-based creator of Facercise, with a celebrity and royalty-packed client list. The Furrow Smoother . This involves spreading my fingers across the centre of my forehead, then pulling my fingertips down while pushing my brows up so I look very confused. I had to hold this tension for 30 seconds while staring at the ceiling. The Furrow Smoother involves spreading the fingers across the centre of the forehead for 30 seconds . Sarah pulls her fingertips down while pushing her brows up to work her forehead muscles . The Lip Lift . This is an exercise which requires a Joker smile that moves up and down an inch using visualisation. 'Imagine a plumber bent over in low-slung Levi's,' Maggio encourages. 'Now move your mouth to express that - ew - and hold it.' Maggio encourages exercises to form an 'ew' expression of disgust and hold it to lift the lips . The Nose Transformer . This isn't pretty either. It requires me to push up the tip of my nose with my index finger while pulling my upper lip down for a count of 40. All of these exercises are performed while looking at myself so I can see that I resemble a tired-looking Miss Piggy with a hangover. But I feel the burn. The burn! The burn that means it's working! The next day, after my first facial workout, I wake up to a face as sore as my glutes were after I took my first spin class in 2004, but I push on with my exercises. The Nose Transformer was so tough that Sarah's face muscles were still and sore the next day . 'After six days of doing her exercises twice a day, I could see significant improvement,' a gorgeous gal pal, also in her 50s, told me. Her nickname is Maggio the Magician and I needed her to work her magic on my ageing face. Luckily, her books and DVDs are available on Amazon and ship within days. Carole's first foolproof tips seem easy enough to do: sleep on your back without any pillows under your neck and try to avoid carbs after 5pm. She also advises drinking more water and eating more protein. These things instantly help everyone's appearance as they get older, apparently. The DVD and guidebook then go through a series of exercises that Carole promises will take the years off and plump up my ageing skin. So. Now my new gym routine is less about getting sweaty in Lycra and more about sitting in front of a mirror pulling a series of scary, exaggerated expressions, working my 57 facial muscles while sitting with my butt clenched and back straight. I work my way through the exercises without any problems - although it hurts more than I thought it would. I am a sit-down-with-a-cheese-sandwich-and-a-Jane-Austen-novel kind of girl rather than a natural gym bunny, but even I'm shocked my face aches this much. I am feeling the desired burn in places I never knew I had. Facial exercising is not for the lazy - it takes about 20 minutes a day and it really does hurt in places - but after two weeks my husband is convinced he can see a difference, and I feel a bit more plumped up; more ruddy farmer's wife than aging, old crone. My upper lip is definitely fuller and for the first time in my life I feel bee-stung enough to try red lipstick. Do I look younger? I'd say so. Fresher? Indeed. Perhaps face exercise really are the key to facing forward? www.facercise.com .","Sarah Ivens, 39, tries the 'furrow smoother', 'lip lift' and 'nose transformer'

"The family of conjoined twin sisters who died 19 days after they were born have been left mortified after they arrived at their gravesite to find cemetery staff had cleared the baby section of all mementos and tossed them in the rubbish. Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus. They died in hospital less than a month after they were born and their parents, Simon Howie and Renee Young, laid them to rest at Pinegrove Memorial Park in Sydney's west. Scroll down for video . Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus . Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when Mr Howie and Ms Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare. 'We took Renee's aunts to see the girls for the first time and we found everything had been stripped away,' Mr Howie told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were devastated and mortified. We've had a little shrine set up and we've been adding to it since the funeral. 'It's heartbreaking to know we've set this up and it has been treated like rubbish.' Faith and Hope were buried in a pink coffin and their family and friends released doves and pink and white balloons at their funeral. Their family and friends had built up a small memorial with pink and white statues, flowers, pebbles and toys over the past 11 months. When they arrived on Thursday, everything had been removed apart from a bunch of flowers. The twins were buried at Pinegrove Memorial Park in western Sydney after they died after just 19 days. Their family and friends had built a small shrine at their gravesite, which they have added to since the funeral . Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when parents Simon Howie and Renee Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare . Faith and Hope's parents confronted staff from the cemetery and were told they were supposed to have been notified they are would be cleaned. They found their daughters' belongings in nearby rubbish bins, but were only able to retrieve about 25 percent of their memorabilia. 'There was no warning, it was just manhandled and thrown in the rubbish. It was through the entire baby section.' The couple retrieved what they could find and returned later in the afternoon to see what else they could salvage - by then everything had been laid out on shelves for people to collect. 'We've gone down there and maintained it. We make sure either side of the girls is clipped with scissors to (workers) don't need to go near it,' Mr Howie said. He said there was no reason for the items to be taken away.

'We got to those places to grieve - we're only one month out from the girls turning one... and it's been stripped naked. We have to start again. 'It obviously meant nothing to (the workers). I understand they have a job to do, but this is somebody else's loved one.' Pinegrove has offered an apology to the families affected. Faith and Hope were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and organs but have separate brains and two faces . The girls were transferred to Westmead Children's Hospital shortly after their birth on May 8 where they were closely monitored by doctors and nurses . They passed away just 19 days after they were born - their condition was so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none survived . 'The collection and storage of ornaments, especially photos, should have been handled much more respectfully and our goal is to improve it for the future,' Pinegrove's communication manager Karl Wolfenden said. 'We do understand the emotions of affected families. We have apologised to those we have spoken to and we have invited them to meet so we can find a solution that is agreeable to all. We are inviting other affected families to make contact also.

"More than 3,000 students are facing an unexpected decision after they received acceptance notices from the University of Florida - only to find they would have to spend a year taking online classes. The 3,118 unidentified applicants were presumably delighted when they were accepted as freshmen by the university in Gainesville for the fall after sending in applications for traditional first-year slots. But after reading their congratulations notices, they apparently realized they would need to agree to spend their entire first year taking classes on the Internet in order to attend the public college. The classes are part of a new program - the Pathway to Campus Enrollment (PaCE) - which started in 2015 and aims to accommodate a higher number of students, The Washington Post reported. New program: More than 3,000 students are facing an unexpected decision after they received acceptance notices from the University of Florida (pictured) - only to find they would have to take online classes for a year . The students who were accepted to the university - on the basis they agreed to undertake online classes for a year - had not applied to the program, which will likely help expand enrollment in the university's new $15million online undergraduate program, created by state legislators in 2013. They were also in addition to the estimated 12,000 students offered traditional freshman slots. Steve Orlando, senior director of UF's media relations, told the newspaper the move 'allows us to offer admission to additional qualified applicants with academic potential and demonstrated success'. Joe Glover, who has been the university's Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs since July 2008, added: 'The market for freshman is by no means clear anywhere in the country. 'We are trying different things to identify that market. That is one of the motivations.' On its website, UF says that PaCE helps deal with the 'limited space of campus' and gives students 'the chance to start [their] degree online and then transition to campus in order to complete it.' It adds it 'offers an excellent academic experience, combining online and campus-based learning'. New iniatitive: The classes are part of a new program - the Pathway to Campus Enrollment (PaCE, pictured) - which started in 2015 and aims to accommodate a higher number of students at the flagship university . Extending space: On its website , UF says that PaCE helps deal with the 'limited space of campus' and gives students 'the chance to start [their] degree online and then transition to campus in order to complete it' It tells students: 'Because of limitations to our freshman enrollment on UF's residential campus, we are unable to accommodate every capable student who applies to the university. 'However, because of your demonstrated potential, we are offering you a pathway to UF's residential campus different from our traditional transfer program.' With legislators keen to expand online learning at Florida universities, UF's online graduate program became available to students in 2014, with a huge $15million assigned to start-up and initial costs. But PaCE 'didn’t fully exist' last fall for the 2016 admissions season, Mr Glover told the newspaper, describing the initiative as 'an experiment' that some of the 3,118 students may not wish to accept. Provost: Joe Glover (pictured), the university's Provost, said: 'The market for freshman is by no means clear anywhere in the country.'We are trying different things to identify that market. That is one of the motivations' He admitted that many parents were surprised to find their children had been accepted to UF on the condition they took online classes - and had bombarded him with calls asking questions about it. On its website, UF states that to be achieve a degree through the PaCE program, students must be willing to 'enroll for at least two semesters and a minimum of 15 credits through UF Online'. It adds: 'After earning a total of 60 credits and meeting program requirements, students may submit a transition form to move from online learning to a guaranteed place on the UF residential campus.' The program offers 60 majors in seven colleges, including psychology and telecommunication. Students in PaCE  receive a 25 per cent tuition discount, the website says. They will also not have to pay some of the fees required for residential students.","3,118 applicants accepted as freshmen by University of Florida, Gainesville .

"Islamic State militants infiltrated a Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus today, marking the terrorist group's deepest foray the Syrian capital and seat of President Bashar Assad's power. ISIS entered the Yarmouk camp as Jordan closed its only functioning border crossing with the country following heavy clashes on the Syrian side between rebels and government forces. The militants, who already control large swaths of territory in northern Syria, reportedly entered the camp from the nearby Hajar Aswad neighborhood in southern Damascus in a coordinated attack with their rivals in the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. According to the the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, ISIS managed to take control of large parts of the Yarmouk camp following clashes with a Palestinian group. Jihadis: ISIS militants (pictured) entered the Yarmouk camp as Jordan closed its only functioning border crossing with the country following heavy clashes on the Syrian side between rebels and government forces . If ISIS manage to gain full control of Yarmouk, the jihadis can potentially use the camp as a base from which to threaten the heart of the capital as possibly challenge Assad himself. The Palestinian-run refugee camp  has been under government siege for nearly two years. U.N. aid workers have been sending food parcels into the camp, where thousands of civilians remain trapped and in desperate need of food and medicine. The camp had witnessed fighting in the past between government forces and militants who control much of the camp. The Observatory reported heavy clashes in the camp between IS fighters and members of the Palestinian faction called Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis. Residents of the Palestinian-run Yarmouk camp are seen queuing to receive food supplies last year . Anwar Raja, the spokesman for the pro-Assad Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said ISIS fighters entered the camp from nearby Hajar Aswad where they have been based for months. He added that today's push came was coordinated between ISIS and their rivals in the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's branch in Syria. 'The Nusra Front opened the road for them in order to infiltrate the camp and several hours ago they entered Yarmouk,' Raja said by telephone. It was not immediately clear why Nusra - who have repeatedly fought against ISIS over the past year - would facilitate the entry of the group into the camp. A Syrian foreign ministry statement today said it holds Jordan responsible for 'obstructing the movement of trucks and passengers and any ensuing economic or social repercussions.' U.N relief workers with blue helmets and vests stand next of residents of the Yarmouk camp one year ago . Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said that the Nasib crossing was temporarily closed late last night because of clashes nearby. 'It is important for us to keep the safety for the passengers and those who are trying to cross between the two countries,' he said. 'So we decided to close the border temporarily, until things calm down. Then we will open it again.' A spokesman for rebels in southern Syria, Issam al-Rayess, confirmed that rebel fighters were trying to take control of the border crossing from Syrian authorities. The Nasib crossing is the only functioning crossing between Jordan and Syria and is considered a crucial gateway for Syria's government and for Syrian, Lebanese and Jordanian traders and merchants. Gruesome new images have emerged showing Islamic State militants stoning a blindfolded and bound man and woman to death in Iraq after they were accused of having sex before marriage. Taken in the ISIS-stronghold of Mosul in Nineveh province, the shocking images show a large crowd gathered to watch the jihadis murder the defenceless couple. Young boys clamber onto their fathers' shoulders to get a better view of the man and woman being charged with 'fornication', before the familiar white-bearded face of ISIS's elderly Mosul-based executioner-in-chief Abu Ansar al-Ansari orders their stoning to death.

In the background of the image, women wearing black niqabs are seen gathered together. An Islamic State militant with a yellow scarf covering his face is then seen using a microphone and PA system to read out the charge of 'fornication' against the couple, suggesting they have been accused of having sex without being married, not of committing adultery. A large pile of stones are then seen heaped in the middle of the road, before the barbaric ISIS militants began throwing them at the defenceless and blindfolded couple, who have had their hands bound to prevent them getting away. As stones rain down on the victims' bodies, large pools of blood appear in the road, before eventually the man and woman die of their injuries and the savagery finally comes to an end.

"A 32-year-old woman was harassed and intimidated last week when she tried to pick up her four children from the fundamentalist Mormon sect she bravely left to escape an abusive husband. Sabrina Broadbent Tetzner, 32, fled the sect headed by convicted rapist Warren Jeffs eight years ago and finally gained full custody of her children (ages 8 to 13) last week. But when she tried to pick up her children from the Colorado City, Utah community where they have been living, she was physically stopped by hundreds of cult members hell bent on keeping the kids. 'Lots of members from the community started showing up. They surrounded her vehicle, the home, fences and the yard. They were kicking the van. They even tried to put a cow and chickens into her vehicle,' ex-cult member Flora Jessop, who helped Tetzner through her legal battle, told KSL. Scroll down for video . Intimidation: An ex-fundamentalist Mormon tried to get her four children back from the sect and was met by 600 cult members physically barring the reunion . Surrounded: Sabrina Broadbent Tetzner, 32, is seen inside her van as she waits to be reunited with her children on Friday . Escaped: Tetzner (left) left the FLDS sect headed by Warren Jeffs eight years ago and was granted full custody of her children ages 8-13 last Thursday . Visitation: Since leaving the sect, Tetzner remarried and had another son, who is now a toddler.

Victory: Ms Tetzner pictured outside the Mohave County court after winning custody of her children . Cell phone footage shows swarms of polygamists surrounding Tetzner's van, the women dressed in conservative floor-length dresses in varying pastel colors. A Mohave County judge ordered the sect to turn over the children at 5pm Thursday, but Tetzner says that when she got to the compound at the arranged time her kids were nowhere to be seen. It was only at midnight that they returned, and were quickly shepherded into their aunt Samantha Holm's house where several dozen fundamentalists kept them from seeing her mother. 911: Tetzner eventually had to call police, who took out a search warrant to pry the children from their aunt's home. Pictured above in photos posted to Facebook . Tetzner spent the night in her van, fearing the vehicle would be torn apart if she left it unattended. When even about 600 cult members surrounded her vehicle in the morning, and kept her from reaching the home where her children were staying, Tetzner called police to intervene on her children's behalf. Sheriff's deputies had to take out a search warrant to pry the children from the house and into their mother's waiting arms. New life: Tetzner pictured above with her new husband and their toddler son in a photo posted to Facebook last year . Reunion: Tetzner and the four children she won in a custody battle last week pictured above on a visit in February 2014 . The style: In December, Tetzner showed off both of her daughters long hair and how she braided it into the plait sported by most fundamentalist girls and women . Allegedly, the children were not so happy to leave, since cult members had scared them into believing their mother was taking them to hell. Deputies escorted Tetzner and her children all the way back to their home in northern Utah, and reportedly FLDS members tailed them the whole way there. Feared leader: Tetzner left the cult a year after leader Warren Jeffs (pictured)  was arrested for organizing marriages between men and underage women in the religion. He is currently serving a life sentence but continues to head the church from behind bars . Some allegedly beat the family there, since they found the home completely trashed with with animal feces smeared on the walls and several pieces of furniture broken when they arrived home. Fearing further attacks from the FLDS community, the family is living in a safe house for the time being. 'We want to thank all of you for your love and support these last few days. We have the children they are safe and we're heading home,' Tetzner wrote on her Facebook page Friday evening. Photos on Tetzner's Facebook show she has been able to visit with her children in the past, spending time at home and taking them out to a creek for fishing. In one set of photos, Tetzner shows off her daughters' long hair and how she braids it into the traditional plait worn by most fundamentalist women. Since leaving the sect, she has remarried a man named Chase Tetzner and the two appear to have a toddler son together. A photo posted to her Facebook in August 2012, shows her in a half-white, half-camouflage wedding dress. Defenders of Children, a non-profit group that has been aiding Tetzner through her custody battle, said they fear for her safety and are raising money to pay for a security system and new clothes for the woman's children. Tetzner left the FLDS church eight years ago, about a year after the cult's leader Warren Jeffs was arrested for organizing marriages between men in his cult and underage girls. He is currently serving a life sentence in prison, but continues to head the church from behind bars. Custodial interference charges are pending against Samantha Holm, the aunt who initially wouldn't hand over Tetzner's children.","Sabrina Broadbent Tetzner escaped the Colorado City, Arizona fundamentalist Mormon sect headed by Warren Jeffs eight years ago .

"Who can resist Boden’s bright knits and floral prints? I most certainly can’t writes Clare Goldwin. Well, not when it comes to my seven-year-old, Ella, anyway. For years, I’ve happily forked out on pricey but irresistibly cute items for her from Mini Boden. But when it comes to buying clothes from Boden for myself, I’ve always steered clear. Their traditional and instantly recognisable staples of cotton shifts and ‘mumsy’ jersey dresses, not to mention ‘jaunty’ prints in eye-catching colours, have always been a big no-no for me. Clare Goldwin (pictured) admits that she will sometimes fork out for Boden's brightly printed clothes for her daughter but not herself as she doesn't want to be labelled a Boden 'yummy mummy' Who wants to be labelled a Boden ‘yummy mummy’ at 50 paces, and bump into countless other mothers in identical uniforms on the school-run? For many years, Boden — which launched in 1991 — made a success of its appeal to the ‘Sloane’ market. But recently, the company has experienced more challenging times. Profits plummeted 42 per cent in 2011 and, while they rose again in 2012, they remained flat for 2013. Now, however, Boden seems to have finally cracked it, and the fashion world is raving about their latest collections. Glossy magazines have praised their spring/summer shoe range for its nods to designer brands. And they’ve even seduced the notoriously difficult U.S. market, where sales are soaring. Experts are putting the success down to the use of luxury fabrics, with more cashmere and silk mixes, plus more limited-edition pieces — so there’s less chance of bumping into someone wearing the same outfit. They’re also attracting customers by toning down their colour palette, so the look is not so ‘sweet shop’, and making many of the prints more sophisticated and subtle. So, can this latest collection keep its core, middle-class customers happy, while appealing to the more fashionable woman? With the mid-season sale now on, I tried a selection of their latest outfits to see whether this Boden sceptic could be persuaded . . . TOP TROUSERS . Colour-block coat, WAS £179, NOW £107.40; jumper, WAS £89, NOW £53.40; trousers, WERE £69, NOW £48.30; suede-heeled sandals, £119 (all boden.co.uk) I usually avoid Boden, fearing it will make me look frumpy. And on the hanger, these trousers look like a case in point — with their elasticated waist, they look like shapeless tracksuit bottoms. Once on, though, they’re bang on trend, with slim legs tapering to an elasticated cuff. I’d even wear them for an evening out — though perhaps in a plain colour. The jumper has three-quarter sleeves and cute French-knot decorations like little flowers. Meanwhile, the two-tone coat has been carefully considered, down to contrast stitching in the lining. The darker blocks are slimming, too, though the green is a bit insipid for my taste. 3/5 . FAB... IF I WAS 20! Dress, WAS £199, NOW £119.40; mules, WERE £119, NOW £89.25 . At first glance, this dress looks like classic ‘yummy mummy’ Boden. And it does me no favours — making me look mumsy, busty and frumpy. That’s not because the dress is dowdy, but because it’s too fashion-forward — and I’m too old to be wearing it. With its A-line Sixties silhouette and alarmingly thigh-skimming length, this is the sort of frock that might be found in Topshop. It would look fantastic on a lithe 20-year-old or someone more flat-chested. Sadly, it doesn’t flatter this 42-year-old mother-of-two. It’s hard to work out if this is a miss by Boden, or the company taking aim at a younger crowd. The mules are very on-trend, though, and, with their teetering heel, far from the sensible-heeled shoes I associate with Boden. 2/5 . PERKY PRINT . Geometric print dress, WAS £99, NOW £69.30; suede T-bar heels with green tassels, £119 . This purple and tangerine geometric shift is a world away from Boden’s usual floral prints. It would work well on bustier women, as the smaller pattern on the upper half helps minimise larger breasts, while the plain band accentuates the waist. The length is just above the knee, so it’s not too daring for those over 40 — though I wouldn’t want it any shorter. Meanwhile, the shoes are fab. The T-bar heels are right on trend and come with a twist: contrasting purple toes and quirky green tassel detail. Usually, ankle straps make legs look shorter by cutting them off — but here, the strap sits lower down the foot, lengthening and flattering the legs. 3/5 . FIFTIES WONDER . Floral dress, WAS £139, NOW £97.30; mules, WERE £119, NOW £89.25 . On first sight, this look screams old-style Boden — a cotton shift dress in a flower print. But, unlike the shapeless floral shifts of old, this one is cut in a very fashionable Fifties shape, with a square neckline and tulip skirt. The viscose/cotton fabric has a sheen to it, which gives a luxurious feel, and the flowers are big and bold — almost abstract — with flashes of lime that stop it all from looking too girly. It’s chintzy, but in a good way. This is also a slightly longer, more flattering, length and would be great for a wedding or summer party. The mules — this time in lime — are the perfect finishing touch. 5/5 . SLIMMING SKIRT . Cashmere jumper, WAS £99, NOW £49.50; print pencil skirt, WAS £89, NOW £62.30; suede-heeled sandals, WERE £119, NOW £95.20 . I would never have guessed this pink and green, diamond-print, cotton pencil skirt was from Boden. It’s a more eye-catching look than I’m used to wearing, and I’d usually shy away from crew-neck jumpers, too, as I think the high neckline accentuates my broad shoulders. But once on, the warm, pink sweater suits my pale colouring and the effect of the skirt is eye-catching, sharp and very slimming. The length is on the knee for me — but I’m 5 ft 10 in, so for most women, this would come in just below the knee. With 3 per cent elastane, there’s also a little forgiving stretch. I pair it with the suede sandals, this time in pink. Still love them. This look is a surprise hit. 4/5 . FLOATY DREAM . Cream silk shirt, £99; floral skirt, £99; sandals, as before . Oooh, this silk shirt and full skirt combination looks like the sort of outfit I remember my mum wearing in the Eighties. But will I look like a mumsy frump? While the skirt is in a traditional floral print, it’s not made from plain cotton, as you might expect from Boden, but has a gorgeous organza silk overlay, so it’s floaty and delicate. While the full skirt style isn’t very slimming, it’s a Fifties shape that’s right on trend and swishes nicely. The blouse is very similar to those made by chic French brand Equipment, even down to the breast pocket detail. Except there, blouses will set you back over £200, while this is half that. Again, I love the shoes. These suede sandals are simple, elegant and very comfortable. 3/5 . EIGHTIES HORROR . Blouse, WAS £69, NOW £48.30; skinny pants, £49; pointed slingback flats, £79; leather bag, WAS £110, NOW £82.50 . This is my least favourite look. The floaty, geometric top has a very Orla Kiely-esque print, but I think it makes me look dowdy. Meanwhile, the stretchy, navy pants give me nasty flashbacks to the leggings I used to wear as a teenager in the Eighties, and they make my legs look stumpy and lumpy. However, the slingback flats in a pretty aqua are very fashion-forward — designers ranging from Jimmy Choo to Antonio Berardi have brought out pointed, flat slingbacks this season. And the aqua bag is very ladylike. 2/5 . So, am i convinced? Ok, there’s a lot that will keep faithful Boden fans happy, but I’ve been reassured there are enough new pieces to make even sceptics like me look past its mumsy bright prints. In particular I love the shoes. They’ve definitely persuaded me to put in an order.","Clare Goldwin has forked out for pricey Boden clothes for her daughter .

"A family of four was enjoying a day out together in Portland, Maine when a white man yelled a racial slur at them before speeding off. The family consisted of a black mother and a white father who were with their nine-year-old daughter and 23-year-old son. The man was in a car filled with a group of young white men when he screamed 'Hey n*****s!' at them on Friday and drove away. Several bystanders witnessed the incident, including a local news reporter for WCSH 6 and WLBZ 2, Jackie Ward. She shared her account of the story on Facebook, as a 'reminder for us to be kinder to each other.' The story has since caused a stir in Maine - shocking some residents of the state. News anchor Jackie Ward (left) shared the story of Shay Stewart-Bouley (right), a blogger who writes about race, and her family when the racial slur was shouted at them on Friday. She said she shared her account of the story as a reminder to be kinder . The mother, Shay Stewart-Bouley who runs a blog called Black Girl In Maine and writes about race, has told her story of how the incident unfolded that day. She wrote in her blog: 'As a mixed-raced family in a white space, the reality is that anytime we leave our house as a family, we risk incurring the wrath of the ignorant and hateful. 'To partake in the joys of the first treats of spring can turn ugly without notice and, sadly, a visit to Maine’s most populous city yesterday was the day when the ugly became personal and my nine-year-old daughter learned that there are people who will never know her essence but instead will reduce her to nothing more than a n*****.' Ward who was with in the Old Port when she watched the incident, and said in the moment she had become frozen and was unable to comprehend what was happening. She wrote on Facebook: 'Yesterday in the Old Port, an adorable family of four was walking down Fore Street enjoying the day, popping in and out of stores along with everyone else in downtown Portland. 'I was waiting outside of a store with my dog when they were walking on Fore Street. Suddenly, a man driving by screamed the n-word at them as he sped off. As the girl's brother chased after the car, Ward said she saw the child become visibly upset. She wrote: 'What happened next is what made me the most sad. As the dad crossed the street to see if he could see how far his son was running, the little girl started getting visibly upset with what was going on. 'But the mom remained calm and stern. She told the girl her brother is a grown man who can stand up for what he believes in. ""People are going to use that word and you need to know how to stand up for yourself."" Ward shared the story on Facebook (the post above) which went viral and prompted Stewart-Bouley to write a blog post with her account of the racist incident . After the man shouted the slur, Stewart-Bouley's son (above) ran after the car filled with anger after 'enduring such language with regularity as a grown man' his mother said . 'My heart broke for that little girl as she harshly learned how our society has such a long way to go when it comes to racism.' After sharing her post, several readers asked if anyone traced the car or got the license plate number, while others asked Ward if she took action in the moment. Stewart-Bouley wrote on Ward's post that she was upset following the incident but that was not the time and place to be emotional. 'I have lived in Maine 13 years now, I write about race and I head up an anti racism organization Community Change Inc in Boston. 'In that moment, my only concern was the safety of my children specifically my son who after spending his childhood in Maine and enduring such language with regularity as a grown man is no longer willing to have his humanity denied.' Stewart-Bouley wrote: 'I was upset but that was not the time and place to be emotional' She added in her blog post that while she was grateful for Ward's observations she was saddened that she was not comfortable enough following the exchange to come over to the family and ask if they were okay. 'Racism is a system, and that silence upholds that system even when we don’t believe we are actively creating harm,' wrote Stewart-Bouley. In a follow-up post on Sunday, Ward hit back at critics clarifying that her intentions with sharing the story was to remind people to respect one another, while addressing the questions surrounding what she did during the incident. She wrote: 'First, I'm glad so many people are talking about a real issue in Maine, but I also want to clarify a few things. 'For those people questioning my motives, I didn't share the story for personal attention or to try to stir up controversy. Stewart-Bouley wrote in her blog that she was saddened Ward did not feel comfortable enough to ask if the family was okay. Ward wrote a follow-up post on Facebook apologizing for her lack of action during the incident while clarifying her intentions . 'I was trying to make a positive out of a terrible incident by opening people's eyes to the fact that these incidents do still happen and reminding people to respect one another.' She added: 'I understand now that my inaction was hurtful to the family and for that I'm very sorry. It was not due to a lack of outrage or sympathy but simply that I didn't know whether the family would appreciate someone interjecting themselves into the situation. 'I thought that the way I could help would be by bringing awareness to it by writing about it.' As for Stewart-Bouley and her family, she said on Friday during the car ride home the mood of the day had been destroyed. She said her family was reminded that the world can be an utterly ugly place. As her daughter asked if they could move away, she told her 'ugly can live anywhere'. 'If I felt there was a place that was safe and where we could be assured that we would never hear that word again, I would move heaven and earth to get us there,' she wrote.","Jackie Ward witnessed the family of four have racial slur shouted at them while they were out for the day on Friday .

"A Texas university that booked Matthew McConaughey as its May commencement speaker has broken the silence on the Texas-born actor's speaking fee. The University of Houston said in a statement Tuesday that it was paying McConaughey speaking fees totaling $135,000 plus travel expenses, as well as a $20,250 commission to the Celebrity Talent International booking agency engaged by the university. Meanwhile, the statement says McConaughey is donating his fees to his jk livin Foundation, which the actor started to provide tools to help high school students lead active lives and make healthy choices for the future. Got $135,000: A Texas university that booked Matthew McConaughey as its May commencement speaker has broken the silence on the Texas-born actor's speaking fee . The university initially balked at revealing McConaughey's fee, citing a confidentiality agreement with the booking agency. However, the university says its business with the agency is now finished. 'The university has concluded its business with CTI and, therefore, is no longer bound by its confidentiality agreement with the agency,' the university said in a statement. It was CTI, however, that initially opposed the disclosure after the Houston Chronicle filed a FOIA request concerning the fee--which will be paid through taxes and tuition. The booking agency argued a 'reporter or someone' might create 'unfair negatives online,' the Chronicle reports. The university will also pay a 15 percent booking fee to CTI, or $20,250. The university did not divulge the fees it's paid to previous speakers, though it is not uncommon for schools to pay celebrities and other biog name speakers top dollar. According to the UH release, jk livin 'serves more than 2,000 students at 24 programs in California, Texas, Louisiana and Washington, D.C.' 'I've had the instincts to help since I was a kid,' McConaughey says. 'I was raised that way. As a kid I was pushed to go give time in my community, and it felt good. You learn as a kid.' The University of Houston is a public institution and one of Texas's largest colleges. Officials there initially balked at revealing McConaughey's salary but has since said a confidentiality agreement is no longer binding .","The public Texas university first balked at disclosing the actor's fee but has since caved, saying a confidentiality agreement is no longer binding .

When content sharing website Bored Panda asked users to post their grey haired images online, the response was overwhelming and the page has been viewed half a million times and counting. For the younger granny trend followers, going grey takes serious effort in the beauty department, but for others it means emancipation from timely and costly hair dying regimes. Either way, the look has an air of defiant feminism. Men have always enjoyed grey emancipation - the salt and pepper look is often deemed distinguished - whereas women's grey hair is rarely viewed in a flattering light. But whether it's a feminist statement or a quirky fashion fad, the look has feel good factor. One user, known as angexla, uploaded this picture of grey hair and dark routes .

The trend can be tracked back to Jean Paul Gaultier's catwalk show at Paris Fashion Week featuring silver haired models earlier this month. The statement to embrace older models and leave their natural hair untouched was applauded by fashion fans. And it's not the first time the designer has experimented with the grey-haired look. At his Autumn/Winter 2011 show the models sported eye-catching grey beehives.

Since then Lady Gaga and Nicole Richie have dared to go grey as has Rihanna, who posted a silver-haired image of herself on Instagram. And Dame Judi Dench and Jamie Lee Curtis both let their natural tones shine through. Sibi Bolan, creative colour director at top hairdressers Hershesons advises thinking carefully before you try the trend at home. ‘Find out what your options are and remember using your skin tone to find the right colour is key. Going grey on the Jean Paul Gaultier catwalk in Paris on March 1 . Angela Le posted this image on Bored Panda which shows dark hair dyed a stunning shade of silver . 'For the grey hair trend, option one is to slowly reduce the amount of colour and gracefully allow the grey to appear (if you are going grey naturally) and option two is to add lighter ash highlights to enhance and complement the grey tones. 'A great haircut is key to going grey so you don't end up looking like you have given up on yourself!' Sibi also advises using a silver shampoo. 'It helps brighten the hair and remove yellow unflattering tones that grey hair has a tendency to do. 'Often grey hair is more dry therefore absorbs things like pollution cigarette smoke dulling down the silver fox making it look like tarnished brass.'

"The founder of Bikram yoga, who has been accused of sexually assaulting multiple students, has said women love him so much he wouldn't need to rape them to get sex. Speaking out for the first time since six women filed civil lawsuits accusing him of unwanted sexual advances, 69-year-old Bikram Choudhury strongly denied the accusations. 'I never assaulted them,' he said as he spoke to CNN. 'The answer is I feel sorry for them... They're entranced by somebody - lawyers.' Choudhury, who pioneered the practice of working out in a room heated to 105F, has his name attached to 720 yoga schools in 220 countries. Chelsea Clinton, Madonna and Demi Moore are among his followers. Scroll down for video . Denial: Bikram Choudhury, who has been accused of sexual advances by six separate women, has denied the allegations in an interview with CNN - the first time he has spoken out about the accusations . Choudhury told CNN that his success means he would never need to assault anyone. 'Women likes me. Women loves me,' he said. 'So if I really wanted to involve the women, I don't have to assault the women.' When asked how his wife of more than 30 years, fellow yoga instructor Rajashree Choudhury, had responded to the accusations, Choudhury became emotional. 'My wife never look at me anymore,' he said. 'Twenty-four hours a day, I work harder than any human being in this Earth... and this is my reward? I'm a rapist? Shame [on] your Western culture.' 'Targeted': Sarah Baughn, pictured speaking to CNN, said Choudhury told her they should be together and that she needed to have sex with him if she wanted to advance her career. She no longer practises . At work: He pioneered Bikram yoga, in which followers practice 26 yoga moves in temperatures of 105F . Bikram yoga,  devised by Bikram Choudhury, is based on regular hatha yoga, but performed in 105F temperatures for 90 minutes. Fans claim that it not only leaves them stronger and more flexible than standard yoga, it also helps them shed weight quickly. Choudhury began practising yoga in Calcutta at the age of three, spending up to six hours a day perfecting his poses. At 13 he won the National India Yoga Championship and went on to devise the 26 'asanas' (poses) and two breathing methods that form the core of Bikram yoga. He claims to have been invited to the U.S. in 1973 by President Richard Nixon to help him improve his health through yoga. After moving to Los Angeles, he started teaching Shirley MacLaine, whom he credits with spreading his name. He also claims to have taught yoga to Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and has a legion of celebrity fans . including Lady Gaga, Madonna, Jennifer Aniston and tennis champion Andy . Murray. Choudhury says Bikram works because the  heat loosens the muscles, helping them to go further than they would otherwise. Since 2013, six women have stepped forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances, and studios have started to drop his name, signalling that his empire is crumbling. Sarah Baughn, one of his accusers, told CNN that Bikram yoga was 'life changing' and as soon as she took part, she knew she wanted to teach the practice. But when she joined Bikram's teacher training course in the mid-2000s, he quickly targeted her, she claimed. 'I was asked by him to come into his office and he sat down,' she said. 'And immediately went into, ""What should we do about this? What should we do about us? We need a relationship"".' She was shocked - 'I felt like my whole system just sort of imploded' - and was advised by another staff member to avoid being alone with him. But on another night, he cornered her after the group watched a movie together, she said. 'He crawled on top of me,' she said. 'He put his hand on the inside of my thigh and the other hand he wrapped around me, and he was holding me there.' He told her that he needed someone to massage him, brush his hair and have sex with him, she said - and made it clear that she would only advance in her career if she slept with him. 'Struggle': He said his wife, Rajashree Choudhury, no longer looks at him because of the accusations . Emotional: When asked about his wife's reaction, Choudhury became emotional and questioned why he was being accused of sexual assaults after working so hard. 'Shame on your Western culture,' he said . 'I looked him in the eyes and pushed him off of me and I said, ""I can do this by myself"",' she said. 'And he said, ""No you can't, there's no way"". I got up and I left the room.' Baughn has previously likened the atmosphere in the Bikram community to a cult and said she had endured Choudhury's sexual assaults as just something that went with the territory. Others told her to separate the man from the teacher, she said. Baughn's lawsuit is scheduled for trial in August. She no longer practices yoga. Most recently, a Canadian woman, Jill Lawler, filed a civil case against him on February 13, alleging that he raped her during a nine-week class when she was just 18. In her suit, Lawler said she went into the class elated to learn from the master, but things quickly soured as she was expected to massage him while watching Bollywood movies late into the night. As they watched the films, he groped her, she said. He apologized but weeks later, he asked Lawler to come to his hotel room where he sexually assaulted her, it is claimed. Accusers: Larissa Anderson, left, and Jill Lawler, right, have both filed civil lawsuits against Choudhury . 'Throughout the sexual abuse, defendant Bikram Choudhury offered multiple explanations and justifications for his behavior,' her lawsuit said. 'He would say ""I'm dying, I need to you to save me. If I don't have sex I will die. You are saving my life, you are helping me"".' The lawsuit states that Lawler continued doing Bikram yoga for years and that Choudhury's abuse continued on multiple occasions, the most recent being in February 2013. At the time, Choudhury's lawyers  and his Yoga College of India said he never sexually assaulted any of the women and that prosecutors declined to bring charges. The Los Angeles district attorney declined to bring charges in a case against Choudhury in 2013 for lack of evidence, spokesman Ricardo Santiago said.

"Tousled hair. Check. Five o'clock shadow across a lantern jaw. Check. A hint of fresh sweat? Check. The current crop of male leads smouldering all over our television screens are rocking a 'pretty but gritty' look that makes Colin Firth's erstwhile Mr Darcy look positively hygienic. Shows such as Poldark, Vikings, Outlander and Game of Thrones are dressing up their key actors in breeches, leather and chain metal and asking them to get down and dirty for their art, much to the delight of watching female fans. Battle of the breeches! Actor Kit Harington (left), clad in leather, plays Jon Snow in the hit HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones . And the dimly-lit period setting - think candlelight and flaming torches - only serves to accentuate the mean and moody looks. Aidan Turner is leading the way as Captain Ross Poldark in the BBC's much talked-about Sunday night offering. So enthralled are the viewing public by the Irish actor's good looks and rippling physique - which he shows off in plenty of topless scenes - that several Twitter handles have been dedicated to parts of Poldark's anatomy. Ongoing HBO success,  Game of Thrones has caused a similar loin-stirring frenzy among those watching with characters such as Jon Snow and Jaime Lannister perfecting the tender but rugged look. Time travel drama, Outlander, based on the books by Diana Gabaldon, flings main character Claire Randall into the arms of 18th century Highland warrior Jamie Fraser, played by Sam Heughan. The handsome Scotsman admits he has found the ensuing attention overwhelming. And flying the flag for Nordic hunks is Travis Fimmel, who stars in the show Vikings, which charts the tumultuous rise of Viking king Ragnar Lothbrok. With his shaved hair, beard and quiff, Fimmel could be mistaken for a London hipster were he not pretending to be a Norse seafarer. So who are the actors behind this new breed of slightly grubby yet thoroughly enticing sex symbol? And do they ever wash their hair? We dig a little deeper below: . Scroll down for video . Stubble and swashbuckling: 2015 is all about the unkempt hunk. Leading the way is 'Poldark and handsome' Aidan Turner . POLDARK . Aidan Turner continues to get the nation's ladies a little breathless in his role as Captain Ross Poldark for the BBC. The star, pretty much an unknown before the hit show, has been catapulted into the spotlight with his 'Poldark and handsome' appeal responsible for soaring viewing figures. Irishman Aidan has stoked the fires somewhat himself by offering up some of the BBC beauty secrets that have transformed him into Winston Graham's hero. Aiden admitted to using baby oil to show off his well-honed pecs and even a slick of eyeliner to make his deep brown eyes stand out. Although the actor won't be drawn on his chest hair, his man rug does appear to have been pruned... ensuring Poldark is pretty but still gritty. The other Jon Snow: With his wild locks and leather outfits, actor Kit Harington has stolen hearts in Game of Thrones, pictured above with co-star Rose Leslie . Hot metal: Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau played wild-man Jaime Lannister  in Game of Thrones . GAME OF THRONES . Actors Kit Harington and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau have brought this  medieval fantasy epic to a whole new audience with their wild man antics. Not entirely dissimilar to Aidan Turner in looks, Kit Harington plays Jon Snow (no, not the tie-sporting Channel 4 news presenter)   in the HBO fantastical series and matches a smattering of stubble with dark curls and puppy dog eyes. The star has admitted to having a 'baby face underneath all of this fuzz' and that he has to stay away from the shampoo for the role, sometimes for as long as up to six weeks. Describing his less-than-attentive hair regime, he told GQ magazine last year: 'I like it to look greasy and medieval.' He admits his locks get 'very tangled' and by the end of a six-week shoot, they look 'pretty horrible.' Co-star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays bearded brute Jaime Lannister, has something of the Sean Bean in Lady Chatterley's Lover about him. Until series four when Jamie lost his right hand, his character was known as the best sword fighter in the world, cue lots of swashbuckling and rolling around in mud... all usually by torchlight. The disheveled, combative image may have been toned down a little but fans continue to trip off his every word...all of which seem to be spoken in perfect English, despite the fact that Coster-Waldau is Danish. Tartan has never looked so good: Sam Heughan plays Scottish warrior Jamie Fraser in Outlander, the adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's time-travel novels . Not a hair product in sight: Sam's looks are left free to curl any which way they choose in Outlander . OUTLANDER . Sam Heughan plays fierce-yet-tender Scottish warrior Jamie Fraser in Outlander, the adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's time-travel novels. With a thick Highland accent, Jamie wears a kilt and faces all that a Scottish soldier living 300 years ago might have had to, from being flung from a horse to having the skin flayed from his back. As a laird-turned-fighter,  Jamie's key look is 'mucking out the horses', all while wearing a skirt. His knees seem to permanently covered in mud. Of his kilt-wearing, dashing actor Sam has admitted that he liked the experience. He said previously: 'I thoroughly enjoy it. When I do have to put trousers on now, I sort of refuse and stomp my feet because riding a horse in a kilt is very liberating, very freeing actually. 'And very comfortable. Also, should you ever need to do a nature relief, go to the restroom behind a tree, it's very quick, it's very easy. I recommend it for everyone.' Swoon! Australian actor Travis Fimmel in Vikings has come a long way since his days modelling underwear for Calvin Klein...but would you mistake him for a hipster if was wearing a tight, white t-shirt? Travis first shot to fame in 2002 as the face of Calvin Klein's famous men's underwear range. His billboard posters were said to have caused traffic pile-ups in America, while the then 23-year-old became the first male model to be signed exclusively by Calvin Klein for an entire year, earning him a six-figure sum . VIKINGS . Former Calvin Klein underwear model Travis Fimmel, 35, might not look out of place wandering down Shoreditch high street when he's dressed up as Viking king Ragnar Lothbrok. With his hair shaved on the sides, a full beard on his chin and a greased-up quiff atop his head, there's certainly a distinct whiff of the hipster look him about when in character. If the clang of chain metal floats your boat then this Viking family saga is brimming with rugged idols. Not that Fimmel particularly cares for his looks. Previously known for his long hair, perfectly groomed appearance, six-pack and bulging underpants in the Calvin Klein days, the actor doesn't mind how he looks onscreen these days. He told FEMAIL: 'I don’t give a s*** about that. We’ve got a whole team to make us look good.' If anything the actor finds the deliberate dressing up something of a chore. He said: 'My hair takes 40 minutes and the costume takes 20 minutes to get into. It means I have to get up an hour earlier in the morning.'","Female fans captivated by new breed of 'pretty but gritty' male leads .

"A Canadian man found a novel way to take in the sights while travelling across country, by taking an rocking chair with him. Kalman Kallai enjoyed the spectacular Canadian scenery from the comfort of a green chair while journeying from Borden, Ontario to Comox, British Columbia for work purposes. Calculating that the drive would take him across a colossal 2,796 miles (4500km) of land, Mr Kallai believed that his journey would be more interesting if he used it as an opportunity to see more of his country. The traveller sits before corn, a café, boats and water, before he is featured rocking and making gestures with his hand . Mr Kallai and a friend mimic the planes that fly past at the beginning of the traveller's adventure . After picking up a green rocking chair that he acquired for free from online advertisement site Kijiji, the traveller attached his trailer and set off on the nine-day journey. The video begins with Mr Kallai carrying his chair to a wooded area, before placing it down and taking a seat. He wears a green hoody, blue jacket and hat – clothing items that remain a running theme throughout the course of the video. Mr Kallai travelled from Borden, Ontario to Comox, British Columbia for work purposes . Sat rocking on his chair watching a number of aeroplanes taking off – perhaps at this point wishing he was on one himself – the traveller is joined by a friend. The pair sit and mimic the plane’s wings before shaking hands and waving goodbye to one another, to allow Mr Kallai to continue his adventure on his own. The traveller is then sat before corn, a café, boats and water, before he is featured rocking and making gestures with his hands. The traveller wears a green hoody, blue jacket and hat in every clip of himself in the video . Mr Kallai takes time to pose precariously on a river bed while journeying across Canada . He momentarily leaves the chair to chase some birds on a beach before making his way through a field and waving at some cows. Later in the video the traveller is met by his dad, who humorously steals the rocking chair before he is swiftly removed. Continuing a good portion of the journey together, the pair dance and jump around in front of rapids and tease a number of large statues. Creature comfort! Mr Kallai makes a number of hand gestures in the video and even waves at cows . Despite hauling the rocking chair around in a trailer, the traveller is also featured carrying it on his head . Mr Kallai said: ‘I brought my dad with me for part of the trek. It was a great bonding experience, as we shared many laughs. ‘I heard some pretty interesting stories about his youth that I hadn't heard before, especially since my mother wasn't on the trip with us.’ The pair reach Manitoba together before they meet with some people and the traveller’s father leaves his son to journey on by himself.

"A young boy has been scarred for life after coming home Tuesday afternoon to find his parents dead - their bodies hacked with a chainsaw. Police in Lower Moreland, Pennsylvania received a call from the unidentified juvenile around 12:50pm and rushed to the home on the 100 block of Country Lane. While authorities have not yet officially identified the couple, family and friends say they were Chris and Nicole Peppelman, the owners of a local excavating company. Scroll down for video . Gruesome: Chris and Nicole Peppelman were found dead inside their Lower Moreland, Pennsylvania home Tuesday afternoon by one of their juvenile sons . Who's the killer? While both Mr and Mrs Peppelman had chainsaw cuts to their body, Montgomery County District Attorney says only Mrs Peppelman's death is being classified as a homicide currently. That suggests that the incident may have been a murder-suicide . The bodies of the 48-year-old husband and his 43-year-old wife were cut with what appears to be a chainsaw, but  so far only Mrs Peppelman's death has been classified as a homicide- suggesting that it may have been a murder-suicide. 'The death of the female seems to be an apparent homicide, however, the investigation is continuing. This is preliminary at this point,' Kevin Steele of the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. While friends and neighbors remembered the couple as outgoing and friendly, others admitted that the Peppelmans were going through a rough patch and that Mrs Peppelman had moved out of the house with their three sons. 'I know they've had some troubles, I've heard that from mutual friends and people that were closer to them recently than I have been, but they have been together I guess for 15-20 years,' Eric Shallcross, who went to high school with Mrs Peppelman, told WFMZ. Marital issues: Eric Shallcross (pictured), who attended high school with Mrs Peppelman, says the two 'had some troubles' Police also confirmed that they had been called to the home before for domestic issues.

"Images revealing the shocking extent of gender stereotyping in toy shops have been posted online under the hashtag #NotAnAprilFools. The pictures show a wide divide between the aspirations set out for girls and boys, with females offered pink beautician's outfits while males are offered doctor's uniforms. Products intended for infants are equally polarised, with babygros for girls emblazoned with a slogan that reads: 'I hate my thighs'. The fancy dress options for girls and boys hint at very different future careers . Babygros reading 'I hate my thighs' and 'I'm super' left customers in one store feeling cross . By contrast, the boy's effort offers up the much more pleasant: 'I'm super'. The #NotAnAprilFools feed, which was launched by campaign group Let Toys Be Toys, is based on the idea that the toys are so ridiculous that they must be a joke. The images sparked a furious response from Twitter users, with several getting in touch to complain about the gender stereotyping. Bethany Usher's angry Tweet was typical, with the journalist writing: 'When I was little @ELCtoys were actually about Learning. Now about learning gender stereotypes?' Other examples included separate cookbooks, with boys getting to make gourmet burgers and giant chocolate sundaes, while girls make small pink cupcakes. Girls' cookbooks include recipes for delicate cupcakes, while boys are encouraged to make burgers . Pink has become the colour of choice for companies marketing products for girls . Many more of the boys' words evoke action and bravery whereas the girls' ones focus on looks and fluff . Let Toys Be Toys, a campaign group set up by a group of British parents two years ago, is petitioning retailers to end the practice of labelling products by gender. One of the campaign's founders, Tricia Lowther, 46, a self-employed copywriter from Durham, told MailOnline: . 'It does bother a lot of parents, we seem to have tapped in to a huge and growing sense of frustration with the way toys are promoted according to outdated, illogical and sexist stereotypes. 'I can't speak for any of the others but what pushed me to make a stand was the realisation, after my daughter was born, that gender stereotyping in children's products had become worse than when I was a child myself back in the Seventies. 'It's something that has become almost impossible to escape and is very limiting for children.' Boys will be learning to draw warriors while women draw faces and flowers . Wizards and werewolves are favourite subjects for boys' books - but not for girls . Many parents responded to the images of the sexist toys by posting pictures of their children playing with 'the other gender's toys'. They included two girls playing with a train set, a little boy pushing a pram and a little girl covered in mud playing in the garden. The campaign has gathered momentum in response to what Let Toys Be Toys describe as the increasing gender stereotyping of toys and the dearth of neutral playthings. Not all, however, are so keen with many parents arguing that pink and blue toys are harmless. But campaigners point to the domestic nature of the majority of girls' products and say that by contrast, boys are encouraged to play with science sets, cars and action heroes. But most items that relate to being domesticated are aimed at girls. In contrast boys are encouraged to play with science sets, cars and action heroes. Not even food is immune as these differently coloured crisp packets reveal . A blue and green slide marketed at boys also roused the ire of campaigners . One mother who is throwing her weight behind the campaign is psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos, 44, who told MailOnline that it is essential to challenge these stereotypes. 'I think any toy or any activity that dispels the idea that a girl's value lies just in the way she looks; that shows she can be more than that, that she can do more, is a positive idea. 'Sadly female scientists or business leaders aren't celebrated in the same way that males are, so [the launch of a range of female scientist Lego figurines] is fantastic. 'The younger you can get girls to see these things as the norm the better. Getting them to see that it's just as normal for a woman to wear a white doctor's or scientist's coat as it is for a man; that's such an important thing. 'The whole idea that there is the whole idea that there is just one section for girls - the pink section - reinforces gender stereotypes. 'Of course, there's always going to be evolutionary differences, but so many more toys aimed at girls have to do with being pretty and looking a certain way, whereas those all about having fun and action heroes are for boys. 'Girls need to be seen as doers rather than passive, to subvert the objectification of women. The object is someone acted upon; ""how can I make my hair curlier, my lips pinker, my eyes brighter"". 'I think there's a problem here.' #GirlsLoveTrains is also a hashtag.

"Harper Lee was not manipulated into publishing her sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, and is not an elder abuse victim, according to an official probe. State authorities were suspicious that the 88-year-old author, who is reportedly deaf and blind, was somehow pushed into publishing the forthcoming Go Set a Watchman, and launched two investigations into the circumstances surrounding the launch. Many feared outside influences were at play as Lee, who lives in an nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, had said for decades she wanted To Kill a Mockingbird to be her only published novel. Scroll down for video . Of sound mind: Investigators concluded that Harper Lee, pictured above in 2009, is in a fit state to make decisions about the future of the forthcoming novel Go Set a Watchman . Officials at the state's Department of Human Resources confirmed Monday that their investigation had been completely closed. Earlier Alabama's Securities Commission had sent an investigator to speak with her, and said that she answered their questions well enough to convince them she made her own decision, and knew what was happening with her book. The DHR investigation remained open for a time, but spokesman Barry Spear has confirmed that they are now also satisfied that nothing is amiss. Earlier suspicions had in part been fired by the fact that Lee's attorneys had announced the release, due in July, and that publishing house HarperCollins had not had any direct contact with her. Elderly: Lee lives in this nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, and has reportedly been deaf and blind since 2007 . Bobby Segall, a lawyer representing Lee's attorney Tonja Carter, confirmed Monday that they received a letter saying that DHR was closing the investigation with no findings. HarperCollins has announced a July 14 release date for Go Set a Watchman, and will print an initial run of 2million copies. The book is high on Amazon's best-seller list despite some concerns about the novel, which Lee wrote before To Kill A Mockingbird. Lee had long expressed that she's happy to have 1960's Mockingbird' - which won a Pulitzer, was adapted into a movie and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide - as her only published book. Go Set a Watchman, a 304-page novel, is a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, although Lee actually wrote it in the mid-1950s, before Mockingbird. Old and new: Go Set a Watchman is a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird - though Lee actually wrote it before the best-selling novel which secured her reputation . The new novel will feature Scout, Mockigbird's protagonist, as an adult woman returning to Maycomb, Alabama from New York City 20 years after the events of To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee thought she had lost the novel's manuscript - but her attorney Tonja Carter found it recently. A statement from Lee, released by HarperCollins, said: 'In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called Go Set a Watchman. 'It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became 'To Kill a Mockingbird') from the point of view of the young Scout. 'I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. Not happy to see him: Reporter Connor Sheets received this blunt, handwritten 'Go away!' from Harper Lee when he asked her repeatedly for an interview .

"Michael Schumacher's son has returned to the racing circuit just weeks after he was involved in a 100mph crash - and once again ended up going off the track. Mick Schumacher made his pre-season test debut in Formula 4 at the Oschersleben circuit in Germany - but at one point was pictured accidentally driving through gravel. The 16-year-old, whose father won the Formula 1 championship seven times, reached the new category after seven years of karting in what is seen as a stepping stone for junior drivers hoping to reach the top.

"A church will hold its Maundy Thursday service today instead of tomorrow to allow a weekly drop-in session for prostitutes to go ahead. All Saints Church in Wolverhampton re-scheduled the service, which marks the start of Easter celebrations, so that vulnerable women can attend their regular Thursday sessions tomorrow. The decision comes after prostitutes were left disappointed when the drop-in sessions were cancelled on Christmas Day and New Year's Day because they both fell on a Thursday. Outreach: All Saints Church in Wolverhampton, pictured, re-scheduled the service, which marks the start of Easter celebrations, so that vulnerable women can attend their regular Thursday sessions tomorrow . Religious leaders have praised the initiative, which has been running since last August, as reflecting the core values of Christianity. All Saints Church, which is in the middle of Wolverhampton's red light district, is the only place where prostitutes can receive the support offered by the sessions, Reverend Sarah Schofield said. The programme is run alongside national charities Changing Lives and the Terrence Higgins Trust. Service: All Saints Church is the only place where prostitutes can receive the support offered by the sessions, Reverend Sarah Schofield, pictured, said . Reverend Schofield, team vicar at All Saints Church, said: 'We throw open our doors and offer support as well as going out on the streets with hot drinks to invite women in. 'We want to be a reliable, safe and loving place for women, it is important to honour our promise and it has had a real impact on the whole church here. 'There is conversation, there is advice if any woman wants advice about employment or health or other issues. 'It is well received and it is appreciated. Christmas and New Year were on Thursday and we know we had disappointed people by cancelling the session for services. 'We had to take a vote in the congregation in January and it was 100 per cent in favour of moving the service. 'The story of Maundy Thursday is Jesus meeting with a number of people and he meets with women who are outcasts. 'One of the stories we tell on Maundy Thursday is about Jesus being anointed by a woman of low status and it felt wrong to cancel it.' The Bishop of Wolverhampton, Reverend Clive Gregory, said the decision to move the religious event forward was made by the church council and people should go elsewhere for a traditional Thursday service. He said: 'This decision wasn't taken lightly and there are other churches very close by where people can go to worship. It doesn't come across as strange to me that All Saints would do this. 'I am very well aware of this project for street workers, it has been a great success in the last six months. 'It performs a very important service for vulnerable women and is exactly what Christian churches should be doing to help their community.' Reverend Graham Smith of The Good Shepherd Church in Low Hill, added: 'It is a long-standing tradition to have a Maundy Thursday ceremony and an important part of the Christian calendar. 'On the other hand, if we remember what Jesus was all about, he would always remember the outcasts in society. 'For some of these drop-in sessions it can be quite hard to let people know what is going on if there is a change. 'So if people turn up to see it isn't on one week, they may not come again.' Custom: The Queen hands out Maundy money during last year's Maundy Thursday service in Blackburn . Maundy Thursday, also known as Easter Thursday, is the beginning of the three-day celebration of Easter. The original version of the Maundy Service involved the sovereign giving money to the poor and washing their feet, a tradition which ended with James II in the 18th century. The custom of washing feet is an an ancient one and commemorates the last supper of Jesus with the Apostles, echoing the story of Christ washing the extremities of his disciples shortly before his death. Although foot washing is no longer part of the ceremony, the tradition of giving 'alms' continues, albeit symbolically. The Maundy gift, which the Queen hands to members of the congregation at a church service, is made up of two purses, one red and one white. Many Christians commemorate the Last Supper in a special Eucharist. In some churches, they may wash each other's feet. Some Christians may hold an all night vigil in church, remembering Christ's time in the Garden of Gethsemane.","All Saints Church, Wolverhampton, hosts Thursday session for prostitutes .

Some 3,000 French forces are taking part in the mission to stabilize Mali, which was overrun by Al Qaeda -linked extremists until French troops came to the aid of Malian soldiers in January 2013. Rijke was abducted by extremists in November 2011 from a hostel in Timbuktu along with two other people . A German died in the attack. Officials in France and the Netherlands did not say whether there was any news of the other two. However, it is thought they are still being held.

Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Rijke is being cared for by Dutch embassy staff and troops in Mali, and is doing well under the circumstances.

"Mike Whitehead was standing against Labour's Alan Johnson in the Hull West and Hessle constituency in Yorkshire . Nigel Farage today insisted the Tories had suffered a 'hammer blow' after a former parliamentary candidate defected to Ukip - only for it later to emerge that he had already been sacked from the party last week. Mike Whitehead, who was standing against Labour's Alan Johnson for the Tories in Hull, claimed he was joining Ukip after becoming 'disgusted' at the behaviour of the ruling Conservative group in his area. But the Tories this morning revealed they had already dropped Mr Whitehead as their candidate  after he revealed he was planning to stand as an independent against a Tory councillor. A spokesman for the Tories said: 'This man is not our candidate for Hull West and Hessle. He was sacked last week. 'We wrote to him last week to say that his position was untenable and could not stand for us at the General Election. We were already selecting a new candidate for this constituency. This is typical Ukip – cynical, misleading and utterly calculating to try and score political points.' Mr Whitehead, speaking on BBC 5 Live this morning, confirmed he was sacked last week. He said: 'I got an email on Wednesday evening to say that if I didn't stand aside from my intentions to stand in the local elections, they would remove my candidacy in West Hull and Hessle. 'I said I wasn't prepared to do that and so as I wouldn't give them that guarantee they terminated my candidacy in West Hull & Hessle.' Mr Whitehead said he had been increasingly worried about the behaviour of the controlling group of Tories in East Yorkshire since 2011, when seven Conservative councillors from Haltemprice and Howden resigned, citing bullying and intimidation. He added: 'In my opinion, the behaviour of the ruling group has only gotten worse since then.' Mr Whitehead said he could no longer carry on 'in good conscience'. Scroll down for video . Responding to the news, Mr Farage said: 'I am delighted to be welcoming Mike to the party at this exciting time. 'His move to Ukip just underlines that today the real party of opposition to Labour in the north is Ukip. It is another hammer blow to Tory pretensions in the north of England'. Ukip Yorkshire and Humber MEP Mike Hookem said: 'Mike has shown himself to be a man of principle in standing up for what he believes in and I am looking forward to working with him in the near future.' Nigel Farage claimed the scalp was 'another hammer blow' for David Cameron, just a month before the general election . Fellow Ukip MEP Jane Collins said: 'Both Mike and his colleague Mick Burchill, who defected earlier this week will be standing for Ukip in the local elections. 'I think they will both be a great addition to the Ukip team in this area and I am also looking forward to working with them closely.' Hull West and Hessle is safe Labour territory - former home secretary Alan Johnson is defending a 5,700 majority from the 2010 general election when the Conservatives finished third.","Mike Whitehead was standing for the Tories in Hull West and Hessle .

"As the final episodes of Poldark approach, men across the nation have longed for respite from the hysteria over heartthrob Aidan Turner. But the bad news – for them, at least – is that any well-earned break won’t last for long. TV chiefs yesterday announced the Cornwall-set drama will be coming back for eight more episodes after it helped BBC1 deliver its strongest start to a year for a decade. Scroll down for video . Fans, rejoice! Aidan Turner has been signed up for a second series of BBC period drama Poldark . BBC1 boss Charlotte Moore confirmed that Turner’s broody Ross would return for another series, alongside actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays love interest – and now wife – Demelza. ‘I can exclusively announce that Sunday night’s new phenomenon Poldark that has captured the nation’s hearts has been commissioned for a second series,’ Mrs Moore said, adding that the series had helped BBC1 to an ‘outstanding start’ this year. About 8.1million people on average have watched each episode, helping the flagship BBC channel attract more than a quarter of television viewers in evenings, when the battle for attention is most competitive. The series, based on Winston Graham’s novels, follows Ross Poldark after he returns from the American War of Independence only to find that his father has died and his former fiancée, Elizabeth, has married another man. There are 12 Poldark books in total, seven of which are set in the 18th century. The other five then follow Poldark’s children through the 19th century. The first series of Poldark, written by Debbie Horsfield, covers the first of Mr Graham’s two novels, named after Ross Poldark and Demelza. Successful role: Aidan has won legions of dedicated fans since stripping off as the swoon-worthy Captain Ross Poldark in the revival of the 1970s TV show . The second series will move on to the third and fourth books, named after their child, Jeremy, and scheming banker George Warleggan. Women up and down the country watched on tenterhooks as Poldark’s affections shifted to his kitchen maid Demelza. But it is the scenes featuring Turner in a state of undress which sent them into the biggest frenzy. Many have taken to Twitter to express their approval whenever he appears without his shirt – working with a scythe in the fields or swimming naked in the sea. ‘If Poldark gets any hotter we’ll have to call the fire brigade,’ one viewer commented. The current show, with the sixth episode of eight this weekend, has not reached the popularity of the 1970s adaptation, which brought in 15million viewers. Hard worker: The 31-year-old actor recently admitted that working on his honed physique came as a challenge to him, so he'll have to get back to the gym ahead of the second series .

"A young mother has described her  hotel nightmare that included seeing her and her partner invited to a late-night party with escorts in the room next door. Following a hospital stay, Lindsey Walker booked in for an overnight stay at Rex Hotel, a once highly-regarded coastal getaway, in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside. Ms Walker, her partner and two-year-old son from Darlington set out for their only holiday of the year – only to have it ruined. Lindsey Walker, from Darlington, spent a holiday from hell at the Rex Hotel in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside . Tiles were broken and loose in the bathroom, which could have easily caused injury, while right, the wallpaper had come loose as well . At 4am, to the sounds of pounding bass from the nightclub below, the family, upset with the standard of their £82-per-night room, decided they would rather sit in the reception of the hotel than attempt sleep. Ms Walker's room included wallpaper hanging in shreds, holes in the walls, broken tiles and lingering filth from previous occupants. Ms Walker, 23, said: 'The hotel looked lovely online but when we got there we found it was over the biggest nightclub in town and we were in the room above it. 'We went downstairs at 4am and stayed in reception because next door were trying to drag us into their room for a party – they had escorts and were asking if we wanted to join in. The wall in Ms Walker's room had a deep hole in one of the panels . 'I was in my pyjamas with a two-year-old and was shaking and scared – we didn't feel safe. 'This holiday meant everything to me. I've been in and out of hospital with anxiety issues and it was a get well present from my mother.' She added: 'We only realised what the room was like when we came back after a day out and it was too late to change it. 'We just want to warn others – this is a reveller place, not for families and that should be advertised.' Criticising staff's handling of complaints, Ms Walker said the family had been refused a full refund and accused of making up their story. Rex Hotel's manager, Karen Carmedy, said the issues were being investigated and that refurbishments were underway. Ms Carmedy also said the hole in the wall was not big enough to see into the next room, the damaged wallpaper was only visible because furniture had been pulled away from the wall and that the nightclub was mentioned on their website. The hotel was taken over by Malhotra PLC in January this year, who bought it after it went into administration. A spokesperson for the Newcastle-based company told MailOnline Travel: 'The hotel had become rundown under its previous ownership but will be the subject of a massive refurbishment and is about to enjoy substantial investment. 'The Malhotra Group PLC is renowned for its ability to take run down operations and turn them round into successful and stylish venues, as it has done many times over the years. 'The Rex Hotel has remained open to protect the jobs of the employees and work will begin in the near future on its upgrade. 'We're sorry Ms Walker has a bad experience and although our website does say that there is a nightclub on site which operates at weekends, clearly this has been upsetting for her.' The Rex Hotel was taken over by Malhotra Group in January, who have plans for major refurbishment . The Darlington family are not the only ones to have lodged complaints against The Rex, according to popular review website, tripadvisor.com. One former guest said the bathrooms at the hotel were like a scene from gory horror film Hostel while another claimed a 'tsunami from the sea would be the best option for this hole.' One visitor renamed the hotel Guesthouse Pardiso, Whitley Bay edition while yet another disgruntled traveller rated the hotel as terrible and said: 'If you have the choice of Chlamydia or a stay at The Rex, choose the STI. 'The hotel's 70 'terrible' reviews are peppered with comments from management, showing staff taking a hard line on criticism, calling one guest obnoxious, commenting on another's vivid and peculiar hair and accusing another of covering their room in pizza and hanging a condom from the door. Rex Hotel also enjoys ten excellent reviews, with happier visitors complimenting the friendly staff, location and breakfast. One guest described it as quirky and fun while another said: 'I visited Rex hotel in October in an Erasmus+ project and I find it very nice and welcoming. The atmosphere is like in old English movies, it is very traditional and nice decorated...makes you feel exactly like in a movie.' Another said: 'I was so impressed with this grand old lady of a hotel. The staff were so helpful and I had a wonderful stay. Its an old fashioned hotel, full of beautiful paintings and reminding you of the grandeur of an era long gone.'","Lindsey Walker booked one stay with partner and child at the Rex Hotel .

"A series of billboards posted around New York City are seeking to encourage residents to consider a move east to Detroit. The ads are the brainchild of a trio of people opening a new Thai restaurant in the Motor City who not only want exposure for their new business but also to promote Detroit as an alternative for New Yorkers who feel that city has got too expensive for them. ‘The idea really is to spread the word about Detroit as far as we can. We love the idea of Detroit being appealing to talented people from New York or anywhere,’ said Detroit native Courtney Henriette told The Detroit News. A series of billboards posted around New York City - including this one in Bushwick in Brooklyn - are seeking to encourage residents to consider a move east to Detroit . The people behinds the ads not only want exposure for their new restaurant but also to promote Detroit as an alternative for New Yorkers who feel that city has got too expensive for them . She, together with chef Brad Greenhill, live in Detroit while a third partner, Philip Kafka, owns the New York-based boutique billboard company responsible for the ads. There are four billboards — two in Manhattan and two in Bushwick in Brooklyn — which went up about a month ago. The posters say things like ‘Detroit: Just west of Bushwick,’ another says, ‘Detroit: Be left alone’ below a rainbow and a third states ‘Detroit: Now Hiring.’ Katoi, which opens in June, is hiring staff, but the billboards are more about advertising Detroit's entrepreneurial and creative opportunities, explains Henriette. She says she has been encouraged by the response the campaign has received so far and that while NYC offers an established culture, Detroit offers people the opportunity to start from scratch.

In 1950, Detroit was America's fifth largest city and one of the most prosperous on the back of its booming motor industry. But almost 55 years on, a dwindling motor industry and a dramatic fall in blue collar jobs has caused people to leave the Michigan city, abandoning their homes and businesses. For decades blighted by financial troubles, Detroit is currently undergoing a program of revitalization and with low rents and plenty of space it can offer opportunities for people increasing being priced out of NYC.

"The body of a missing University of Minnesota student has been pulled from the Mississippi River five days after she plunged from a bridge during a night out, medical examiners have said. Jennifer Houle, 22, vanished from a bar in Minneapolis in the early hours of Friday and was later captured on surveillance footage as she walked alone on the 10th Avenue Bridge. Authorities have not said whether she fell or jumped from the bridge, which is 110ft above the river. Following days of searches, a body was recovered on Wednesday. The medical examiner's office identified the body as Houle's on Thursday. Loss: A body believed to belong to Jennifer Houle (pictured left, and left with a friend) has been found in the Mississippi River in Minneapolis after she was last seen on a nearby bridge early on Friday morning . She died of freshwater drowning the medical examiner's office said in a press release, according to the Star Tribune. 'We want to thank law enforcement, all the Hennepin County sheriff's [deputies], the Minneapolis police ... and all the compassion they've shown to us,' John Houle told the Star Tribune. 'They've done such an amazing job keeping us informed about the investigation. We sincerely appreciate their tireless efforts to figure out what happened to Jennifer and to bring her home to us.' Houle was last seen inside a Dinkytown bar, Blarney Pub and Grill, between 1am and 2am on Friday, police said. Her friend Brooke Laven told KSTP that they had gone bar-hopping on Thursday evening but that while they were out, they ran into one of Houle's ex-boyfriends. Discovery: Teams of rescuers are pictured on Monday as they searched the Mississippi River in an effort to recover Houle's body. It was found on Wednesday - five days after she vanished . Last seen: Police said video evidence showed she entered the Mississippi River from this bridge on 10th Avenue, which is just several blocks from the bar. It is not yet clear whether she fell or jumped . 'That kind of set off some emotions,' Laven told KSTP. She said she had become separated from Houle in the bar and was unable to find her. Laven said that Houle's purse and phone were found in the street near her apartment just a few blocks from the bar at 3am on Friday, suggesting she had tried to walk home. But police told DailyMail.com that they believe she had already entered the water by the time the purse was found. 'We extend our deepest condolences to the Houle family and all of Jennifer's many friends,' the police said in a statement. Houle studied management at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and was a Phi Beta Phi sorority member and part of the Women in Business group on campus. On Tuesday evening, more than a thousand friends and well-wishers - many dressed in purple, Houle's favorite color - paid tribute to the student at a vigil at the University of Minnesota. Missed: Fellow students gathered for a vigil for Houle at Stillwater Area High School on Sunday . Loved: Friends have remembered her as a fun, bubbly student who 'had such a great impact on so many' Scene: Houle and a friend had been drinking at this bar before she vanished between 1am and 2am Friday . Speaking to the Minnesota Daily, student Madie Eckstrom, one of Houle's friends from high school, recalled her 'infectious smile and bubbly laugh'. 'She had such a great impact on so many people,' Eckstrom said. The family was overwhelmed by the show of support, her father said. 'Jennifer would have been pleased to see the outpouring for her,' he told the Star Tribune. 'As a family, we certainly feel that love from the community.' He said that they also plan to have a ceremony to celebrate her life on April 12 at the university. University vice provost Danita Brown Young said counseling is available for the University of Minnesota community. 'We are deeply saddened to learn of the news about Jennifer Houle,' the University of Minnesota said in a statement. 'Our thoughts are with her family, friends, classmates, and sorority sisters.'","Jennifer Houle went missing between 1am and 2am on Friday during a night out with a friend in Minneapolis .

"A father has discovered that Facebook photos of him and his seven-year-old daughter were used to set up a fake account and scam an Austrian woman out of $4,000. Antonio Valente, from Dallas, Texas, first learned of the ruse when he received a message from Marianne Heinrich, who lives in Vienna, two weeks ago, he told NBC DFW. She told him that someone using the name 'Johnson Michael Lynn' had created a fake Facebook profile using photos of him and his daughter before befriending Heinrich online. Scroll down for video . Shock: Antonio Valente, from Dallas, Texas, learned that his Facebook photos were being used on a fake account - and ultimately scammed an Austrian woman out of $4,000 . After a few weeks of friendly conversations with Heinrich, the man said he wanted to marry her and move to Austria to be with her and his daughter, she told Valente. When he said he needed money to pay taxes in England, Heinrich wired him $4,000. She soon realized she had been conned and used an image from the profile to search Google photos and discovered they had been stolen from Valente. Among the photographs shared by 'Johnson Michael Lynn' was also a photoshopped image showing Valente's face oddly placed on another person's body in hospital. Fake: The profile used his pictures but the name 'Johnson Michael Lynn' and claimed he was from Ohio . Scam: The profile showed photos of Valente's head pasted onto another person's body in hospital, left, and images of his seven-year-old daughter, right. The scammer told the woman he wanted to marry her . The Texas dad was stunned. 'It's very scary to think someone could do this,' he told NBC. But he also realized it was just the start of the battle. He wanted to report the problem to Facebook to get the fake profile removed but, because the scammer had blocked him on the website, it did not allow Valente to file a complaint. 'If you're blocked, it's circular,' Valente said. 'You can't do anything.' After being contacted by NBC, Facebook removed the profile. Victim: Marianne Heinrich, who lives in Vienna, said she does not expect to get her $4,000 back . The company's help page  gives instructions on how to file reports about a user who is pretending to be someone else; the reports can be filed even if the victim does not have a Facebook page. The section can be found on the Help Page under 'Report Something' and 'Report a Violation', which then gives a list of the violations, including how to file reports in a similar situation to Valente's. A Facebook spokesperson told NBC that the process is being reviewed to make it easier. Heinrich has contacted authorities in England but said she does not expect to get her money back.

"By the time she turned five, Amber Rachdi, now 24, from Troutdale in Oregon, weighed 11st - the same as the average adult woman. 19  years later and Ms Rachdi hit rock bottom: virtually housebound and in constant pain, she was ashamed of her enormous 46st (657lb) frame. But after doctors warned that she would be dead by the age of 30, the 24-year-old plucked up the courage to make a change and has since lost 20st in a year. Scroll down for video . Obese: At her heaviest, Amber tipped the scales at an unhealthy 46st (657lbs) 'Sometimes I think to myself I'm never going to change,' she admitted in the run-up to life-saving bariatric surgery. 'Everything hurts. I am so limited in what I can do and where I can go. 'I feel trapped. I'm miserable. I don't like being this person. I don't like being this size. Sometimes I feel so hopeless, I feel that it's not worth it. That maybe it would be better if I'd never been born.' Despite her hefty frame, Ms Rachdi says she has always eaten healthily - and puts the excess pounds to eating more healthy food than she should. She also says she used food to control feelings of anxiety and to deal with her fear of failure but says all the comfort eating just made things worse in the end. 'My relationship with food is unhealthy,' she explains. 'I spend a lot of the day stressing about what I'm going to eat and when I'm going to get it. Comfort eating: Ms Rachdi, pictured with parents Patty and Abe, said she used food to deal with anxiety . Deadly: Ms Rachdi had become so heavy, she was warned that she risked dying by the age of 30 . 'There's anticipation before I eat but it's not enjoyable. It's a feeling of desperation and sadness. Food is a comfort and it's helping me avoid reality. I have a lot of anxiety and I don't like it. 'I'm at peace while I eat. I don't have to think about how I have let everyone around me down. It's a distraction.' As a result of her overeating, her parents were left in a state of panic, with mother Patty admitting that she was sure her daughter would die. 'She always felt she didn't live up to our expectations,' she says. 'She just became a typical underachiever. 'We were told that if she doesn't lose weight, she will die before she's 30.' 'I see a lot of pity in my mum's face when she looks at me and I can't handle that,' said Ms Rachdi, ahead of her surgery. Support: Ms Rachdi has been supported throughout by her boyfriend Rowdy who also moved to Houston . Getting there: Ms Rachdi had to lose 17lb before being allowed to have weight loss surgery . Slimmer: Ms Rachdi has now shed 20st and tips the scales at 26st - half her former body weight . 'Sometimes my dad would make snide comments about my size and that would hurt me. I wish I could be self-sufficient and successful and show the world I'm made of so much more but as long as I'm big, as long as I'm obese, I will never be able to be that person.' The turning point came when the Rachdi family relocated to Houston in Texas to be closer to bariatric specialist, Dr Younan Nowzaradan. Last autumn, Ms Rachdi finally went under the knife for life-saving gastric surgery and has since lost a staggering 20st. But with another 9st to go, there is still a long way to go before Ms Rachdi becomes the 'successful, independent woman' she wants to be. Even so, things are finally looking up. 'I'm now able to shop for myself,' beams the 24-year-old who has also learned to drive. 'I have hope. Now the world is open to me. I'm no longer Amber of one room, one house. I'm no longer using food to cope with my anxiety.'","Amber Rachdi, 24, weighed an unhealthy 46st at her heaviest .

"A mother-of-two lost more than ten stone after she became concerned that her size was causing her to look like a man. Kim Callaghan, 39, piled on the pounds after the birth of her two children, reaching a worrying  20st 3lb. However, the determined slimmer has now shrunk down to a slender 9st 10lb after taking up exercise and swapping starchy meals for smaller portions. Kim Callaghan became so worried that her weight was causing her to look like a man that she went on a dramatic diet that saw her lose half of her body weight . Kim's weight loss saw her drop an incredible ten dress sizes to slim down to a slinky size eight. Before she slimmed down Kim's wardrobe was limited to size 28 figure-hiding garments, and she was afraid she was losing her femininity. Kim who lives in Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, says she turned to masculine clothing as a way of hiding her shape. 'I only wore baggy trousers and flappy shirts when I was fat - I was trying to cover up my body because I was embarrassed. I stopped looking like a woman. 'Now I've slimmed down and I feel confident enough to wear dresses again. I feel healthy and very feminine.' Kim married her husband Sean Callaghan, 41, in 1999. After the pair got married they splashed out on a double deep-fat fryer. Kim piled on the pounds after giving birth to her two children, as she became heavier she worried that her husband Sean would not see her as the 'sexy' woman he married . Before her weight loss Kim was limited to a wardrobe of size 28 clothing she is now a slinky size 10 . The housewife's diet consisted mainly of convenience foods like chicken kiev, deep-fried chicken, potato croquettes and burgers. She said: 'We loved pizza, chips and chicken kievs. The deep fat fryer was my favourite thing in the house.' Soon after Kim gave birth to her children Owen, now 14, and Shannon, 13, and her weight gain accelerated. Eventually she tipped the scales at 20st 3lb and says that she found it increasingly difficult to find clothes to suit her. The turning point came for Kim when she struggled to keep up with her children she now takes part in regular exercise including cycling around her local area . Kim joined Slimming World in secret and lost a stone in her first three weeks . 'I tried to take pride in my appearance, but at that size it was impossible to find anything flattering, I ordered all my clothes from catalogues. 'Before long I had a wardrobe which could have been owned by a man. I had a signature cropped hairstyle and honestly looked nothing like a woman. I was worried that the the sexy, curvy bride which Sean had married had disappeared forever.' The turning point came for Kim when she was out with her children on St Patrick's Day in 2011. She had to stop and rest after struggling to keep up. She said: 'I was trying to follow the kids up a hill near our home. I was hot and sweaty and I had to stop to catch my breath. 'My weight was getting in the way of my life with my kids - I knew it was time to change. 'When I got home that night I found a Slimming World leaflet had been posted through my door. I thought it was a sign.' Kim started attending her local Slimming World classes in secret and was initially embarrassed to admit she was trying to lose weight. She said: 'It took all my courage to go to the meetings - I was convinced everyone would judge me. Kim feels far more feminine now that she is not limited to catalogue clothing . 'Three weeks later I'd shed a stone and I celebrated by telling my husband and the kids. They were all very supportive and amazed at what I had done.' In a bid to make a dramatic change she swapped greasy fried foods for healthy meals cooked from scratch. Kim even threw out her double deep-fat-fryer. The devoted slimmer also started running and cycling - and the pounds started to fall off. Soon she had slimmed down to the slinky 9st 10lb she is today and ditched her baggy unflattering clothes for good. She said: 'I love being able to go into shops and have everything fit me. I don't need to order from catalogues any more. 'I feel fantastic and I look great. I have a new life now.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Fry-up with four slices of buttered bread . Dinner: Chicken Kiev with potato croquettes and chips . Snacks: Crisps . Breakfast: Porridge with berries . Lunch: Scrambled eggs with ham and mushrooms . Dinner: Chicken stir-fry . Snacks: Throughout the day she snacks on yoghurt and fresh fruit .","Kim Callaghan, from Ireland, piled on the pounds after having children .

"Those hoping to meet an alien creature may well do better to look beneath the waves than beyond our own atmosphere. Scientists have discovered strange new organisms that infect the primitive forms of life that live deep below the ocean floor. While examining species of bacteria that thrive on the fossil fuel deposits deep inside the Earth - known as archae - they have found a new type of virus that infects them. This graphic shows how the new archael virus changes uses 'docking tips' - purple area - to infect bacteria . They now believe it may be viruses like this that actually hold the secret that have allowed archae bacteria to adapt to some of the harshest environments on Earth. This is because the virus actively causes one of its own genes to mutate - allowing it to develop new ways of coping with the ecosystem it finds itself in. Life has been discovered nearly a mile and half underground, raising hopes bacteria might be able to survive deep beneath the surface of other planets. Researchers found the single-celled organisms living inside coal beds more than 8,000ft (2,440 metres) below the seabed off the coast of Japan. It is the deepest life has yet been found beneath the ocean. At those depths the spherical microbes have to survive huge pressures that would crush most organisms while having no access to light or oxygen often needed for life. Instead, the bacteria scavenge the chemicals they need to survive by breaking down the hydrocarbon compounds in the coal around them. The findings have raised the prospect that life may still be clinging on deep underground on planets such as Mars, where there was once thought to be flowing water on the surface. Scientists have already speculated that the discovery of archae bacteria deep inside the Earth's crust has raised prospects of finding life on other planets. Now it seems they may also find viruses like this one living there too. Dr David Valentine, a geoscientist at the University of California Santa Barbara and co-author of the research, said: 'Our study uncovers mechanisms by which viruses and archaea can adapt in this hostile environment.' Dr Valentine and his colleagues discovered the virus while exploring methane vents 2,800 feet beneath the surface of the ocean in the Santa Monica basin off the coast of California. By pushing tubes into the ocean floor they retrieved sediments and brought the contents back to the lab where they grew the bacteria. When they screened the genomes of the methane-eating bacteria they discovered the genetic fingerprint of the new virus. The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature Communications, screened other samples taken from around the world and found similar fingerprints in bacteria from Norway and elsewhere along the coast of California. Dr Blair Paul, lead author of the research and an earth scientist at the University of California Santa Barbara, said: 'The evidence suggests that this viral type is distributed around the globe in deep ocean methane seeps.' Scientists used submersible Alvin (left) to obtain sediment samples (right) from the the Santa Monica basin . The sea floor, shown above, is covered in microbial mats of primitive bacteria that are infected with viruses . The researchers also found that a small genetic element - known as a diversity-generating retroelement - was able to accelerate mutation of a specific part of the virus's own genome. Dr Paul added: 'The target of guided mutation--the tips of the virus that make first contact when infecting a cell--is similar. 'But the ability to mutate those tips is an offensive countermeasure against the cell's defenses, a move that resembles a molecular arms race.' The researchers also found similar guided mutation elements in the archae bacteria living under the ocean floor themselves. Tiny bacteria known as nanoarchaea targetted four distinct genes. Dr Valentine said: 'The cell is choosing to modify certain proteins. The image above shows a ridge covered in microbial mats on the ocean floor of the Santa Monica basin . 'It's doing its own protein engineering. While we don't yet know what those proteins are being used for, learning about the process can tell us something about the environment in which these organisms thrive.' The findings suggest that life living beneath the ocean floor and in the cracks of rocks deep below the surface could be far more diverse than previously thought. It is thought that there may even be more biomass living inside the Earth than on its surface. Matt Kane, program director for the National Science Foundation's Division of Environmental Biology, said: 'Life far beneath the Earth's subsurface is an enigma. 'By probing deep into our planet, these scientists have discovered new information about Earth's microbes and how they evolve.'","New archeal virus infects primitive bacteria living off methane underground .

"A former Democratic congressional aide who pleaded guilty last year to raping two women was spared jail time on Friday because horrific disfiguring injuries he suffered in an unrelated 2013 acid attack. Donny Ray Williams, who was once a staffer for the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee, slipped an intern Ambien in 2010 before having sex with her while she lay unconscious. That same year, he had sex with a woman too inebriated to give her consent, prosecutors say. Despite admitting his guilt in December, D.C. prosecutors on Friday asked that Williams be spared prison time because he is himself the victim of a crime - the effects of which will mar the remainder of his life, Washington Post reports. No jail time: Former Capitol Hill staffer Donny Ray Williams is disfigured from an acid attack that occurred years after he raped two women. A judge on Friday agreed with a prosecutor's recommendation that he not serve jail time due to his serious injuries, for which he's undergone 20 surgeries and still faces more life threatening operations . The decision to give Williams a suspended jail sentence and 5 years probation - which Judge Robert E. Morin reluctantly agreed to - came despite one of his victim's request he be given 'some jail time.' 'He gave me a random dose of drugs and risked my life,' the woman argued in a letter read in D.C. Superior Court last week. The woman had just moved to Washington as an intern. She initially warmed to Williams because she believed he could help her get a leg up on Capitol Hill. 'After the assault, I moved away, and he continued to harass me and threatened me to drop the charges. This crime has caused me fear, pain and a financial burden,' she wrote. The other woman Williams raped was not present for the sentencing, during which Judge Morin said Williams 'was a victim of an independent crime and has serious medical issues.' Williams' own attack occurred in 2013 as he walked down a Washington street. A man approached him and tossed acid in his face that dripped down his body, he told the Post. 'I thought I was going to die,' Williams recalled. Acid attack: Williams was approached by a man in 2013 on a Washington street who tossed acid on his face. He believes a former girlfriend's jealous ex was behind the attack. He's now blind in one eye and nearly blind in the other . Massive second and third-degree burns put him in the hospital for two months, blinded him in one eye and nearly blinded him in the other. Williams believes the jealous boyfriend of a woman he was dating was behind the assault, the Post reports. Much of his face is now gnarled and disfigured and he currently has a massive lump at the top of his skull where doctors have surgically implanted a rod that stretches his skin in order to promote healing. He's undergone some 20 surgeries and still faces more 'life threatening surgeries. 'How easy it is for men to use power to abuse,' Williams said in court. 'Rape is cowardly, shameful and downright evil. I promise, I will protect a woman's right to her own body.' He'd previously denied the allegations against him, saying he only pleaded guilty because he wanted to focus on his health and not a trial. He now says he's a $1 million in debt and jobless after spending years working with such notable politicians as Senator Mary Landrieu and Senator Herb Koh. He worked in the Obama administration as the general deputy assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental relations in the Department of Housing and Urban Development between April 2009 and October 2010. Williams had served as a staff director for the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee. He started working on Capitol Hill in 1999 for Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.).","Donny Ray Williams on Friday was given a suspended sentence and 5 years probation for two 2010 sexual assaults .

"Women and vanity have always gone hand in hand. Indeed, archaeologists have been known to find the remains of bodies clutching make-up, beauty tools in graves and detailed beauty manuals from bygone times. While they may not have had vampire facials, cellulite cream and contouring kits at their disposal, the women of ancient history had some fascinating methods for beautifying themselves. The women of ancient history, including Mary Queen of Scots, who washed herself in white wine, had some fascinating methods for beautifying themselves . Cleopatra, for one, had some interesting methods and even penned a book documenting her most prized beauty secrets. The famed Egyptian beauty famously bathed in donkey-milk baths. Her daily donkey-milk baths, which she believed had anti-ageing and skin smoothing properties thanks to the alpha hydroxy acids, apparently required over 700 donkeys to accomplish. She often mixed donkey-milk with crocodile dung to create a face mask and also bathed in rose petals to leave her skin smelling sweet. Egyptian queen Nefertiti, meanwhile, loved to make her own cosmetics, including her own blend of eyeliner using lead-based kohl, and clay and crushed beetles as blusher. Cleopatra, left, the famed Egyptian beauty, famously bathed in donkey-milk baths, while Empress Elisabeth of Austria, right, loved to conjure up her own face creams in the 19th century . The goddesses of Ancient Greece strove to achieve a pale complexion and made honey and olive oil-based concoctions to achieve this. They used a combination of white lead and olive oil to whiten the skin and created an on-trend monobrow using dark powder. Bleach blonde hair was coveted in Ancient Greece and women doused themselves in vinegar to get the look. Meanwhile, the ladies of ancient India used cow dung and urine to boost their beauty regime and were said to treat problem skin and cracked heels using the bizarre ingredient. A rouge pout came courtesy of betel leaves, which  women would chomp on. The Geishas of Japan used rice flour to whiten their faces and cleansed with nightingale poop . The Geishas of Japan - particularly in the Heian era - achieved black teeth with oxidised iron fillings steeped in an acidic solution. Faces were whitened using rice flour and removed using nightingale poop, a treatment that beauty salons are adding to their menus today. Over in China, female emperor Wu Zetian mixed Chinese motherwort with cold water to cleanse her face. Mary, Queen of Scots was said to wash her body in white wine, which, thanks to its antiseptic alcohol content, was deemed to help boost her complexion. Empress Elisabeth (Sisi) of Austria loved to conjure up her own face creams in the 19th century. She mixed spermaceti (a wax found in the head of sperm whales), rosewater and almond oil and coated her face with the substance daily. She was also fond of creating a DIY night mask using raw veal and crushed strawberries.","Mary Queen of Scots washed herself in white wine .

"A nine-year-old boy has died in hospital from injuries sustained in a horrific car crash that also killed his eight-year-old sister. Piper and William Kulk were involved in a fatal two-car collision on New South Wales' Central Coast at about 5.15pm on Saturday. Police said Piper died in hospital on Sunday morning, while her brother died later that evening. They were travelling with their mother, Chantelle Boddy, 31, grandmother Helen Boddy, 54, and elder brother Daniel, 12, when it is believed their Holden Astra aqua-planed, spun out of control and ended up on the other side of the road. All three siblings were sitting in the back of the car when the wet weather accident occurred. A relative told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We’re just devastated.’ The eight-year-old girl who died in a horrific accident near Doyalson in NSW Central Coast has been identified as Piper Kulk (pictured) She was travelling with her two brothers William (left) and Daniel (centre), her mother and grandmother when the accident happened . The incident also left passengers in the ute that collided with the Astra on Wyee Road near Doyalson with severe injuries. Warwick Milham arrived at the scene after hearing his wife, Glenda, and daughter, Michelle, were involved in the crash. Glenda suffered a fractured neck while Michelle had broken bones. 'It was a horrendous scene. I wouldn't wish it upon anybody,' Mr Milham told 9News. With the crash claiming William’s life, the national Easter long weekend death toll now stands at 16.

The seven people involved in the crash were all trapped in the wreckage before being released from the two vehicles by emergency services. The two boys, Daniel and William, were airlifted to The Children's Hospital at Westmead and William later succumbed to his injuries. Daniel is now in a stable condition. The 54-year-old woman was the driver of the car, with their mother Chantelle was in the front-seat passenger. Heavy rain caused a car containing two adults and three children to spin out of control, colliding with a ute (pictured) The seven people involved in the crash, which happened about 5.15pm on Saturday, were all trapped in the wreckage before being released from the two vehicles by emergency services . A 32-year-old woman was driving the ute, with a 61-year-old woman in the front-passenger seat. All women sustained fractures in the crash and were taken to John Hunter Hospital. They are reported to be in a stable condition. Wyee Road was closed for seven hours while Crash Investigation Unit police examined the scene. 'When you get behind the wheel you accept the risks that go with it and that includes the real possibility you will change your family's life or that of another family forever.' 'As wet weather is expected to continue across the remainder of Easter – I am urging all road users to slow down, adjust to the conditions and leave more room than usual between your vehicle and the one in front of you,' Assistant Commissioner Hartley said. The crash follows the death of a two-year-old girl on Friday when a ute rolled over in South Australia. A 33-year-old man died in another rollover incident in Western Australia the same day. A couple and their two young children also narrowly avoided an Easter tragedy after a head-on crash with an allegedly drunk driver in NSW's Hawkesbury region. A 29-year-old Stanhope Gardens man was travelling with his wife, two-year-old son and one-month-old daughter, when the crash happened in Webb's Creek on Friday afternoon. All four were uninjured, but all the airbags in the car deployed in the crash. The driver of the second car, a 54-year-old Lower Portland man who was also not hurt, returned a positive reading of 0.120. The man was later charged with mid-range drink-driving and driving an unregistered vehicle. He was issued a field court attendance notice to appear before Windsor Local Court on May 14.

"The military mistress is back in the game. Bobbi Ann House, 39, who hit headlines in 2010 for marrying at least 14 servicemen and then draining their bank accounts - with one spouse losing $100,000 to her - is again wanted by police after getting out of prison and remarrying. However this time it is both House and her new husband, Zackerie House, 27, who police are after, accusing the couple of writing a series of bad checks worth at least $13,500. The purchases started in western Oregon in early March, then moved through Oregon coastal towns and into Colorado and Oklahoma. Wanted: Bobbi Ann House, 39, who became known as the 'military mistress' around 2010 for conning over a dozen servicemen, is now wanted again, this time for check fraud, along with her husband Zacherie House, 27 . Military mistress: Bobbi Ann Finley, also known as Bobbi Ann House, hit national headlines in 2010 when allegations surfaced that she hopped from one military base to the next, marrying service members to gain access to their bank accounts . The two are now believed to be hiding out camping, with their last fraudulent transaction for a 'large quantity' of outdoors supplies and groceries at Atwoods, a farm and ranch chain store in Checotah, Oklahoma, on March 30, Oregon Live reported. Officials released photos of a car the pair are believed to be driving - a blue 2005 Cadillac Escalade - which they bought by a fraudulent $1,500 down payment at Universal Auto Sales in Salem on March 14. The car, which they took possession of March 14 and has the license plate 535BWP, has been listed as stolen. While investigators believe the two are camping, they do not know where, and have asked anyone with information to come forward. Marion County deputies said they have probable cause to arrest Finley and House for their use of fraudulent checks in Marion County. Captured: Surveillance image of Bobbi Ann Finley and Zackerie House released by Marion County Sheriff's Office. This is one of the last times the couple were seen in March . Wanted: The two were last seen making a fraudulent transaction for a 'large quantity' of outdoors supplies and groceries at Atwoods, a farm and ranch chain store in Checotah, Oklahoma, on March 30 . On-the-run: fficials released photos of a car the pair are believed to be driving - a blue 2005 Cadillac Escalade - which they bought by a fraudulent $1,500 down payment at Universal Auto Sales in Salem on March 14 . The car, which they took possession of March 14 and has the license plate 535BWP, has been listed as stolen . Bobbi Ann, previously known as Bobbi Anne Finley, has had numerous run-ins with the law. She became infamous for targeting military personnel before allegedly taking their money and leaving them in financial ruin. In a jailhouse interview in 2011, the woman admitted that she may have destroyed lives, but she claimed she is a victim who has had a hard upbringing. 'I wasn't running a con,' Finley said. 'I wanted protection, the protection that I should have had growing up... I married these guys I couldn't love.' 'I was looking for love. I was looking for understanding, I was looking for someone to say, ""You know, it is going to be OK"",' Finley told ABC's 20/20 at the time. 'In many of the cases, you look and you started out and you get married and you're thinking, 'Oh, I'm going to live happily ever after."" And then you realise as soon it's done... it was a mistake,' she said. 'The devil himself is a pot of gold compared to her': Some of Bobbi Ann's victims described her as a smart, cunning, professional liar . For nearly 20 years, Finley allegedly preyed on military bases where she lied to servicemen claiming to be a wealthy heiress, the daughter of a general or an injured veteran about to get a large pay-out. 'She was smart, funny, witty, beautiful,' Jacob Anderson, one of Finley's ex-husbands, told ABC News. 'I mean, you'd come home... you didn't need to ask one... it was clean. 'Our food was cooked, and the food was excellent. Dishes were done, house was immaculate. You were going like, ""Wow, I couldn't ask for anybody better"".' But things soon changed when the men married Finley and money allegedly started disappearing from their accounts. 'The devil himself is a pot of gold compared to her,' said Shane Cheesman, one of Finley's ex-husbands whose marriage was annulled after a week. 'She has no heart. She has no feelings, no remorse,' he told ABC News. But Finley's alleged scam began to unravel in 2004 when she got on the wrong side of one of her many mother-in-laws. The victims: In 2010, ABC News assembled 10 of Bobbi Ann's former husbands, all servicemen. Ex-spouse Ben Giles described her as 'a domestic terrorist' who targeted and destroyed the lives of military members . Katie Wegg, whose son Rodney had fallen for Finley when he was a reservist stationed in Texas, began a six-year-crusade to bring her to justice after her son went away for the weekend and came home to find money gone from his checking account. She found that Finley had a history of fraud and bigamy, and had given birth to children and never told the fathers. Bobbi Ann has at least nine children, according to her family. '[Rodney] had a child out there and he wanted to know where this child was. And he wanted his child,' Mrs Wegg told ABC News. 'These guys didn't know they had children.' Finley served an eight-month sentence for forging cheques from Mr Wegg's account in 2007. Bobbi Ann House, 39, who hit headlines in 2010 for marrying at least 14 servicemen and then draining their bank accounts of thousands of dollars, is again wanted by police after getting out of prison and remarrying . She was arrested again in June 2010 and extradited to Alabama was jailed in February after pleading guilty to theft by deception and ordered to pay $5,300 in restitution. 'I mean, I'm angry. I'm sad. I'm lonely... because of what Bobbi did,' said Jeffrey Dietiker, one of Finley's ex-husbands. 'And now I'm paying for it, with every relationship I get in... Trust was everything I had, and now I don't.'","Bobbi Ann House, 39, is currently on-the-run for check fraud .

"A weakening U.S. economy spilled into the job market in March as employers added just 126,000 jobs 0the fewest since December 2013 – snapping a 12-month streak of gains above 200,000. The unemployment rate remained at 5.5 percent, the Labor Department said in its monthly report Friday. The March jobs data raised uncertainties about the world's largest economy, which for months has been the envy of other industrialized nations for its steadily robust hiring and growth. Employers now appear wary about the economy, especially as a strong dollar has slowed U.S. exports, home sales have sputtered and cheaper gasoline has yet to unleash more consumer spending. Scroll down for video . NUMBERS: Labor Department data shows the US economy generated a disappointing 126,000 net new jobs in March, half of what was expected and the worst month since December 2013 . GREEN JOBS ECONOMY? President Barack Obama was in Utah on Friday to promote an initiative that would see US veterans hired to work for the solar electricity industry . Some of the weakness may prove temporary: An unseasonably cold March followed a brutal winter that slowed key sectors of the economy. Last month's subpar job growth could make the Federal Reserve less likely to start raising interest rates from record lows in June, as some have been anticipating. The Fed may decide that the economy still needs the benefit of low borrowing costs to generate healthy growth. Reflecting that sentiment, government bond yields fell Friday. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note dropped to 1.84 percent from 1.90 percent before the jobs report was released. U.S. stock markets are closed in observance of Good Friday. Economists noted that for months hiring had been stronger than other gauges of the economy, suggesting that a pullback in job gains was inevitable. 'Job growth has been running at a stupendous pace in America over the last several months, increasingly out of tune with other economic indicators, which have pointed to a slowdown,' James Marple, senior economist at TD Economics, wrote in a research note. 'The reckoning in March closes at least some of this gap.' At the same time, some said last month's data looks bleak in part because hiring had been so robust in the months that preceded it. 'Employers aren't laying people off,' noted Patrick O'Keefe, director of economic research at the accounting and consulting firm CohnReznick. 'What they've decided to do is slow down the pace at which they're hiring until they have more confidence.' Last month, the manufacturing, building and government sectors all shed workers. Factories cut 1,000, snapping a 19-month hiring streak. Construction jobs also fell by 1,000, the first drop in 15 months. Hiring at restaurants plunged from February. The mining and logging sector, which includes oil drilling, lost 11,000. Some other categories showed continued gains. Health care added 22,000 workers. Professional and business services – a sector that includes lawyers, engineers, accountants and office temps – gained 40,000. Financial services expanded by 8,000, and retailers maintained their 12-month pace by adding 25,900. In addition to reporting sluggish hiring for March, the government revised down its estimate of job gains in February and January by a combined 69,000. Wage growth in March remained modest. Average hourly wages rose 7 cents to $24.86 an hour. JOB FAIR: Frances Scoggins, left, attended a 15-county event in Georgia in search of work on Thursday. She's been unemployed for the past four months . That marked a year-over-year pay increase of just 2.1 percent. But because average hours worked fell in March for the first time in 15 months, Americans actually earned less on average than they did in February. Tepid pay increases have been a drag on the economy since the Great Recession ended nearly six years ago. Many Americans remain out of the labor force, partly because many baby boomers are reaching retirement age. The percentage of Americans who are either working or looking for work fell in March to 62.7 percent, tying the lowest such rate since 1978. Job growth had been healthy for more than a year before March. Yet the streak of strong hiring, along with cheaper gasoline, hasn't significantly boosted consumer spending. The Fed signaled last month that it would be cautious in raising rates from record lows. The Fed has yet to rule out a June rate hike. But many analysts expect the first increase no earlier than September. Graph illustrating monthly US unemployment up to March 2015 . In part, that's because Fed officials have revised down the range of unemployment they view as consistent with a healthy economy to 5 percent to 5.2 percent from 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent previously. The weak hiring last month could give them further pause about a June rate hike. 'I think (June) is completely off the table,' said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at the financial services company Northern Trust. The Fed won't likely raise rates until it sees evidence of consistently solid growth. But the economy has weakened in the first two months of 2015, in part because of the tough winter. Cheaper oil has led energy companies to halt orders for pipelines and equipment, hurting manufacturers. At the same time, the strengthening dollar has made American-made goods costlier abroad, thereby cutting into exports. This year's job growth has yet to ignite a larger boom in consumer spending. McDonald's, Wal-Mart, the Gap and other major employers have announced raises for their lowest-paid employees. But those pay raises are staggered and unlikely to fuel faster wage growth. The economy has disproportionately added lower-paying jobs in the retail and restaurant sectors since the economic recovery began in mid-2009. Adding jobs in the lowest-paid industries can suppress average hourly wages, even when employers are rewarding cashiers, waiters and sales clerks with pay bumps.","Official unemployment rate – which doesn't count people who have dropped out of the labor force – stands at 5.5 per cent .

"Greece has denied it will fail to pay a multi-million pound loan following reports it has drawn up plans to introduce parallel drachma currency to pay domestic bills. The country is due to repay a £330million loan to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday but there were concerns the heavily indebted nation would default on the payment. Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time. Greece has denied it will miss a repayment of £330million to the International Monetary Fund after reports it had drawn up plans to introduce a parallel drachma currency to pay its bills . He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.'

The government is hoping approval of its latest reforms . package will unlock remaining aid of 7.2 billion euros under its .

"A trend we are just starting to get our heads around is the Wide Leg Trouser. Be it denim, cropped, printed or striped, the wide leg trouser is at the forefront of SS15 trends. There's something effortless about a wide leg trouser that really appeals. And if like us you are growing tired of the skinny jean and want to try out a new look this could be your answer. Louise Redknapp says that a wide-leg trouser can come as a welcome relief from the skinny jean . Skinny jeans have held court for quite a few years now and while they will never go out of style the wide leg will give you an alternative look. It's not the first time this look has made a comeback since the Seventies. Lou tried the out the trend seven years ago with a Stella McCartney flared jean - luckily she kept hold of them! The wide leg can be intimidating, especially if you're on the shorter side. But the key is all in the shoe. Huge amounts of fabric is hard to look flattering but if you keep your heels high and your top half simple you can pull it off with confidence. A high heeled shoe with an exposed top of foot will elongate the leg, a must when wearing a cropped voluminous trouser. Louise and Emma say to avoid being drowned by too much fabric try a high heeled shoe . Louise recommends pairing a wide-leg with a simple knit to keep the outfit in proportion . If going for a longer length go high-waisted and very long to give extra leg length. Proportion is everything, team with a simple knit, shirt or tee to keep the look current and cool, not costume. Denim is the easiest way to nail the trend - Gucci revisited the Seventies with a collection filled with flared jeans in vintage washes. The stylish pair agree that denim is the easiest way to achieve the trend .

"Known locally as Millionaires’ Row, the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac of 11 white Art Deco houses with private beaches at the end of Hove promenade is a real-life version of the TV comedy Stella Street. The sitcom featured impressionists playing celebrities such as Michael Caine and Keith Richards living as neighbours. But put the rubbish out here in Hove and you could be saying good morning to Oscar and Grammy award-winning singer Adele, Little Britain comedian and novelist David Walliams, DJ Norman Cook and his Strictly Come Dancing wife Zoe Ball, and former EastEnders and Heartbeat star Nick Berry. Scroll down for video . One of the white Art Deco houses on the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac has gone on sale for £4million . In previous years you might have been greeted by Paul McCartney, his then wife Heather Mills, or even by partying guests such as Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner. The homes were built between 1909 and 1910 by developer Michael Paget Baxter when overcrowding on British beaches in their heyday meant that a home with a private beach was the last word in luxury. And that still seems to be true. With celebrities occupying six of the properties – Cook and his wife have three, two for them and one for relatives – that leaves just five other houses. And in a rare event, one of those has just come on the market, for a guide price of £4 million. Approached from the back, the cul-de-sac does not look anything special, tucked away behind the warehouses of the working port of Shoreham. But sitting in the lounge of Malcolm VandenBurg’s splendid home on a sunny day, with the sea seemingly lapping at the floor-to-ceiling windows, you could be in Miami or Malibu. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors. Decking stretches on to the beach, and there is a hot tub. Stunning: The view of the sea from the property's modern living room. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors . Meet the locals: Singer Adele has a house in the exclusive cul-de-sac alongside comedian David Walliams . ‘Bringing the sea into the house was the aim,’ says Malcolm, a retired Harley Street doctor. ‘Bizarrely, the former owners didn’t make use of the sea views. So I opened up the back and put the terrace in and the balcony upstairs. ‘Now, when you walk in the front door you can see the sea from everywhere. It took a year but it was well worth it. It still takes my breath away every time I come home. ‘And sitting outside on the terrace with a fish barbecue with the sound system on full is just perfect. I’ve had a lot of impromptu parties.’ Malcolm, in his 60s and the father of four grown-up children, bought the four-bedroom house in 2010 after moving from London, where he had seen Adele perform at the Roundhouse in what he describes as his favourite gig of all time. So when the singer moved in to the cul-de-sac, he was ‘starstruck’. ‘She has this lovely little dog and, in the summer, when all the doors are open, the dog wanders into my house and Adele comes round to find it. She’s completely normal and everyone here is very pleasant and we all get on well,’ says Malcolm. Price £4 million . Location Hove, East Sussex . Bedrooms 4 . Unique features Beach for a back garden; cinema room; huge dressing room; high-tech controls for hi-fi, curtains, lighting; celebrities on every side . He also welcomed Walliams and his wife, model Lara Stone, by taking round a bunch of flowers. Unhappily they have now split up. Cook popped round one day when he heard that Malcolm was selling his vinyl record collection. ‘I thought he might buy the lot, but he didn’t want any of them,’ he laughs. The ground floor of Malcolm’s house has oak flooring throughout and there is a large entrance hall with a floating staircase, a media/cinema room, kitchen, snug and a 45ft lounge. Upstairs, the master suite and bathroom overlook the sea and a huge dressing room is the size of some of the designer clothes shops in the nearby North Laine of Brighton. Malcolm’s home has the latest high-tech automated systems, including a Lutron lighting control system, video door entry, digital music and video systems, integrated speakers, motorised curtains – in fact, everything a celebrity would be looking for. So who does he think will buy the house? Has Cook already been round with an offer to add to his portfolio? ‘No he hasn’t,’ says Malcolm. ‘I think he’s happy with what he has at the moment. But whoever does buy will never get tired of the wonderful, ever-changing views. Like me, they’ll fall in love with it straight away.’ Selling agent Jason Brand says: ‘This is the best beach residence to come on the market for years and one of the very few homes in Brighton, indeed the UK, to have direct private beach access.’","Hove promenade's white Art Deco houses are filled with British celebrities .

"He's branded himself Britain's 'flashiest playboy', and to prove he's happy to splash his cash, multi-millionaire Danny Lambo has bought his girlfriend a £10,000 Easter present. The boastful 37-year-old hotelier, who has previously said he enjoys flaunting his wealth, paid for a luxury bath to be fitted in the home of Natasha Flynn, 29, that runs pure chocolate milk. The bespoke gift, which is now available to buy, costs £1,000 each time to fill - with melted chocolate containing an astonishing 1.3 million calories. Scroll down for video . 'Flash playboy' Danny Lambo posing with girlfriend Natasha Flynn inside her £10,000 Easter gift - a chocolate bath . Natasha enjoys a flake in the £10,000 bath, which contains 205 litres of melted milk chocolate . Danny - whose actual surname is Karne but he claims he is known as 'Lambo' because of his passion for Lamborghinis - had the first-of-its-kind bath made as an Easter treat for his 'queen'. He said: 'Cleopatra was the ultimate queen of luxury so a bath that runs chocolate instead of water was the perfect Easter gift for the queen in my life. 'A standard Easter egg was just not going to cut it this year, so I wanted to get a show-stopping gift to show Natasha my love. 'Part of my work with my VIP contacts involves travelling the world to find rare artefacts, and recently during a research trip in Egypt I learnt a lot about Cleopatra and her fascinating habit of bathing in donkey's milk. 'I thought my girlfriend deserved the same but I wanted to take it up a notch - why not chocolate?' The brash Croydon-born entrepreneur, who claims he left school with no qualifications, says he was told by his headmaster that he would fail in life. Natasha poses in the bath - her Easter gift from Danny 'Lambo', the hotelier worth £25m . Danny, whose actual surname is Karne, is known as 'Lambo' because of his passion for extra-loud Lamborghinis. He has bought cars from the likes of rapper 50 cent . But years later he says he claims to be living a luxury lifestyle that sees him jetting around the world meeting Middle Eastern royalty, buying cars from rappers like 50 Cent and, of course, treating the ladies to the finer things in life. The Landmark Touchstone Bath is adapted to include a separate, refillable chocolate-warming reservoir plumbed to supply a pressurised flow of liquid in the tub which has a 205-litre capacity. The pressurised taps even mean the chocolate develops froth - allowing Natasha to relax in bubbles. The Landmark Touchstone Bath from bathstore is adapted to include a separate refillable chocolate warming reservoir that is plumbed to supply a pressurised chocolate flow through the taps on request, without affecting the normal function of the water flow, taps or bath. It's a freestanding, steep-sided bath is made from in non-stick, thermally efficient material to keep chocolate fluid, and is supplied with a slotted waste and a 205 litre capacity, for an ultra-luxurious chocolate bathing experience. Mr Lambo, a hotelier from Mayfair, London, went to the bathstore in Baker Street with his unusual request, and said he was delighted when they were able to start working on his idea. Danny, who is reportedly worth £25 million and the star of new TV show, the Broker, added: 'The bath is perfect for a chocoholic like her, not to mention the perfect fit for Easter. 'I went to bathstore with my idea, and although they thought I was a bit crazy they took on the project and found a way to make it work; it's brilliant.' Natasha, who relaxed while eating a Flake chocolate bar in the bath, said: 'It really is amazing. I adore chocolate and love having a bath so this is my idea of heaven. 'And when you get out your skin feels great and smells delicious. Easter is my favourite time of year because of all of the chocolate. 'I love to have a chocolate bar in my tub while I bathe - it's so indulgent, it's perfect. This the best Easter ever, Danny's outdone himself with this present.' The chocolate bath is now available to buy and prices start from £10,000. When he's not managing his three hotels and property empire, Danny claims he likes to enjoy swanky £10,000-plus drinks at his six-storey Mayfair townhouse, which once belonged to Tory Prime Minister Anthony Eden, or at his other property overlooking the Thames. He thinks nothing of spending an extravagant £5,000 on meals at trendy west London restaurants like Chiltern Firehouse and Novikov - and his home boasts plenty of antiques - which include a four-poster bed that he claims once belonged to Napoleon. Natasha says she 'adores' chocolate - and claim her skin feels 'great' after having a chocolate bath . Danny Lambo, pictured with his personal assistant, Nikki, and his fleet of cars outside one of the three hotels that he owns. He is part of a new generation of self made millionaires flaunting their wealth . His purple Diabolo Lamborghinis has the loudest exhaust in Britain, and has proved hell for his neighbours in west London . His other vices include judging beauty contests like Miss USSR UK and chatting up contestants at the Miss World finals. Despite his ostentatious ways, Danny claims he is a good person with a kind-heart who is just enjoying life. And despite his extravagant and flashy ways he says, he knows the value of money after growing up in a normal household. 'I'm not going to hide my wealth, I don't know why I should. I've worked hard for this. I wasn't born with a silver shoe, so why not flash it? 'I became a millionaire when I was 22 and I'm the type of person that if I have money I'll spend it. 'I'm not going to take it to the grave with me. 'When I'm dead and dusted I'll leave what I have left to charities, friends and family, but while I'm still here I'm going to spend it.' Danny, who owns a £100k Chopard watch, claims he is well-liked by the established wealth in London, despite appearing to flaunt his wealth. He claims grew up in a normal household with one brother and two sisters in Croydon, south London. Both his parents were teachers who encouraged him to get a full and rounded education - but Danny says he aspired to be something brighter and bolder. The self-confessed daydreamer left school aged 16 without any qualifications - thanks in part to a chance encounter with a Japanese music producer. Danny and his friends were singing in a London bar when they were scouted and invited to tour the Far East, with the intention of later marketing them back to a Western audience. 'We were offered a record deal and so I literally walked out of school before my final exams and headmaster said: 'Hey, Danny where are you going?'. 'I said, 'I'm going to Japan to become a pop star'. He replied 'you're going to fail in life'. He bought a 30-room B&B in Paddington and with the help of his interior-designer older sister converted it into The Pavilion hotel (pictured) - and it soon became a celebrity hotspot . Danny Lambo, pictured at the Pavilion Hotel, that stars including Morrissey, Duran Duran, Pete Doherty, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell have visited . 'I told him to get lost and we walked out and went to Japan.' Over the next four years, Danny toured girls' schools and other venues in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, living out of a suitcase and spending most of his time rehearsing and performing or living in hotels. When the band finished, Danny was forced to turn to the one thing he did know after several years on the road. 'The hotel kind of became my world outside of the music,' said Danny, who was the lead singer in the group called Jealous. 'For 21 hours of the day we'd just be hanging out in the hotels. It was all I knew. My best mate would be the concierge and I'd be dating the chambermaids. 'So when I got out of the music industry when I was 21, having sent every penny I'd saved back home, the only thing I knew how to do was run a hotel. 'I didn't have any qualifications but I could make a bed with my eyes shut, I knew how the concierge ran and I knew how the reception ran.' On his return he bought a 30-room B&B in Paddington and with the help of his interior-designer older sister converted it into The Pavilion hotel - and it soon became a celebrity hotspot. 'We had all the big bands staying with us like Morrissey, Duran Duran, Pete Doherty. And, of course, where the rock stars go, the fashion models follow. 'So we had Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss come in and all the supermodels of the time would come for photo-shoots.' The hotel later became known as The Pavilion Fashion Rock 'n' Roll Hotel due to its themed rooms and celebrity clientele. This success he claimed was then followed by more hotels and property investments, which make up the bulk of his £25m wealth. With the money coming in, Danny claims he was able to live a life most men in their 20s can only dream of - especially when it came to indulging his passion for fast cars and beautiful women.","Hotelier Danny Lambo said he wanted to buy Natasha Flynn an extravagant Easter present .

"Outspoken MP Bob Katter has risked being drawn into a race row after accusing the Queensland Government of believing embattled MP Billy Gordon was 'a little black puppet on a string'. In a bizarre statement on his party's website, Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence - and later admitted to his criminal past. Mr Katter, federal MP for Kennedy, is of Lebanese descent. He said he's been personally subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, and that he sympathised with Mr Gordon's position. Federal MP Bob Katter, who released a statement today accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence . Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk . He announced on Wednesday he will remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, throwing the Government, which holds a razor-thin majority, into chaos. 'In the last two cases where this occurred in the federal parliament, there was never any question raised about the member resigning. So why was it assumed here that Billy Gordon would resign?' Mr Katter's statement reads. 'I can't help but think that the Queensland Government thought they had a little black puppet on a string. Mr Gordon, who  was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history . The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with users questioning his terminology.

Not that John wrote: 'Wow, Bob Katter calls Billy Gordon, 'black puppet on a string' and the lefty loons stay silent. What if Abbott had said it?' The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet 'because I'm dark and I come from Cloncurry.' 'I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I'm going to call it for what it is,' he said. 'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.' Mr Katter used federal MPs Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence, but he vowed Mr Gordon would not make that mistake.","Mr Gordon was forced to quit Labor after being accused of domestic violence .

"The nation's largest suppliers of HIV and AIDS medical care is accused of bilking Medicare and Medicaid in an elaborate $20 million dollar scam that spanned 12-states, according to a lawsuit filed in South Florida federal court. Three former managers of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation filed a suit last week alleging the company paid employees and patients kickbacks for patient referrals in an effort to boost funding from federal health programs. Employees were paid $100 bonuses for referring patients with positive test results to its clinics and pharmacies. The lawsuit alleges kickbacks started in 2010 at the company's California headquarters and spread to programs in Florida and several other locations. Lawsuit: Three former managers of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation filed a suit last week alleging the company paid employees and patients kickbacks for patient referrals in an effort to boost funding from federal health programs (file photo) The Los Angeles-based company cares for more than 400,000 patients in 36 countries and is leading a mass testing initiative to identify and treat an estimated 25 million people who don't know they are infected, according to its website. The referrals were key to the company's business model and touted by AHF President Michael Weinstein at a 2013 leadership summit, where the complaint alleges he specifically directed staff to immediately raise the patient financial incentive to $50 and to implement the incentive program nationally throughout the organization. Weinstein said small incentives for linking people to services and keeping them there are 'mainstays of public health interventions.' 'Not only has AIDS Healthcare Foundation done nothing wrong, our pro-active approach to finding and linking HIV-positive individuals to lifesaving care and treatment is critical to stopping HIV in this country,' Weinstein said in a statement. He noted that the federal government and state of Florida formally declined to intervene in the legal action, which he says 'speaks volumes about the merits of the case.' Former managers Jack Carrel of Louisiana, Mauricio Ferrer of Florida, and Shawn Loftis of New York, filed the whistleblower complaint. The three were fired from the company after notifying their supervisors about the company's alleged wrongdoing, even though their attorneys said they are protected under the False Claims Act.

"A 44-year-old woman has been shot dead in front of her 12-year-old son by a  stranger she simply laughed at while passing him in her car. Denise Chiffon Berry and her son were driving in Hawthorne, California on Wednesday afternoon when they passed by three men in a Cadillac - one of whom had his legs dangling out of the window. The mother and son allegedly laughed at the scene, but someone in the car didn't find it funny when he made eye contact with the 12-year-old boy. Scroll down for video . Denise Chiffon Berry, 44, and her son (pictured) were driving in Hawthorne, California on Wednesday when a stranger in a Cadillac started shooting at them. Ms Berry died at the scene while her unidentified son survived . Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Lt. Dave Coleman told Daily Mail Online on Friday that the mother and son were simply having a chuckle. 'Mommy says, ""Look at that, isn’t that funny?"" and they made eye contact. She drove on and they began following her,' he told the Daily Breeze. Lt. Coleman said on Friday that no other connection between Ms Berry and the occupants of the car had been found. After driving a few blocks, Ms Berry feared the men were following her so she pulled over near the 14200 block of Kornblum Ave to tell a police officer parked there monitoring traffic. The officer told Ms Berry to park in front of him and he would investigate the Cadillac. It was as Ms Berry was parking, that the Cadillac pulled up and the man in the front passenger seat jumped out and shot at her and her son with two handguns. The police officer at the scene quickly responded and shot down the gunman. Both the gunman and Ms Berry were pronounced dead at the scene. While her son suffered gunshot wounds, he was able to run away from the scene and spoke to police before undergoing surgery on Wednesday. The 12-year-old was in a stable but fair condition as of Thursday. Denise Chiffon Berry, 44 (pictured) was pronounced dead at the scene on Wednesday. The Metro bus driver leaves her 12-year-old son and an older child, according to neighbors . The 12-year-old boy managed to get away from the scene despite being injured in the shooting and give information to police before being hospitalized and undergoing surgery . Scene: When they noticed the Cadillac was following them, the mother and son asked a police officer for help. They were pulling in front of his SUV when the white car pulled up and a man got out and started shooting . 'It appears to be random or misguided,' Coleman said. 'We’ll have to figure that out. ... We know that, at some point, the little boy made eye contact with the suspect. We don’t know if that’s what set him off.' Authorities have since identified the shooter as 38-year-old Robert Washington of Rialto, California. The two other men in the 1994 Cadillac were taken into custody. Driver Stanley White, 24, faces charges of murder and conspiracy while 19-year-old backseat passenger Brandon White was arrested for conspiracy. The half brothers were being held on $1million bond. A neighbor who arrived on the scene said he knew Washington, who has a previous felony conviction among others, and found the attack out of character for the father-of-two. Ms Berry had worked as a Metro bus driver for the past more than four years and had an older son, neighbors said. 'She was a very nice lady,' a neighbor said. 'She surely didn’t deserve this.' Lt Coleman told Daily Mail Online that Ms Berry and the father of her 12-year-old son appeared to be estranged.

"The name Gary - once one of the most popular name in Britain - is now heading for extinction. Just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the UK in 2013 were given the name, data from the Office of National Statistics shows. That compares to 235 Garys being born in 1996, when the name was the 147th most popular in Britain. In 2013, it didn't even make the top 1,000. All in a name: Others suggest that Gary Lineker, left, or Take That singer Barlow might have put some off . Helped by the popularity of actor Gary Cooper, there was a surge in  Garys  born in the US in the early 1950s. There was even a trend of girls being given the name. The name peaked in Britain roughly decade later. In 1964, it was ranked 16th most popular. Since then, there has been a fall in the number of Garys. It is now among a number of once-common names that are close to dying-out completely. Fall from grace: Some blame shamed pop star Gary Glitter, pictured, for the name's declining popularity . There has been suggestion that football pundit Lineker, or Take That singer Barlow might have put some off the name. But others point to Britain's most notorious Gary, paedophile pop star Glitter, who was jailed for 16 years for a string of sex attacks on girls, as the reason behind the name's fall from grace. Speaking to the Sun, Gary Davis, from south London, said: 'Gary Glitter has obviously done us no favours.' Between 1996 and 2013, unusual names such as Dexter (there were 1,019 born in 2013), Jenson (1,055) and Harley (1,275) all climbed in popularity to break the top 100. Meanwhile, the country went from having no girls called Harper - the name given to David and Victoria Beckham's daughter - to hundreds. Nearly 200 were born in 2013. Other names inspired by famous faces including Rihanna (60 born in 2013), Hermione (77) and Paris (107) were also more popular than humble Gary. Data from last year shows a surge in Arabic names in the UK, with Omar, Ali and Ibrahim all entering the boys’ top 100 for the first time. For girls, Maryam has shot up 59 places to number 35, while Nur is a new entry in the girls’ top 100, jumping straight to number 29. And Muhammad has risen an astonishing 27 places compared to last year to claim the number-one spot for boys. Sophia was the top name for baby girls but the year’s biggest riser within the girls’ top 100 was Maryam, while the highest new entries were Nur, Emilia and Gracie. For baby boys, Teddy was the biggest climber within the top 100. The highest new entry was Kian. Popular: Between 1996 and 2013 country went from having no baby girls called Harper - the name given to David and Victoria Beckham's daughter - to hundreds. Above, Harper with her brothers and father last month . GIRLS . Alpha - Alpha may be the first letter in the Greek alphabet, but it’s one of the last names modern parents consider for their baby girls. Not so in 1880, the first year baby name records were kept in the US, when Alpha was Number 301. It dropped off the Top 1000 in 1944 and is about to disappear for good. Barbra - Singer Barbra Streisand made her unusually-spelled, condensed name famous in the 1960s, when it peaked at Number 511, only to drop off in the Top 1000 in 1971. Barbara, a Top 10 name for three decades, hangs on in the Top 1000, but Barbra is about to vanish. Claudine - This feminization of the ancient Roman name Claudius ranked in the Top 1000 for first half of the 20th century, then blipped to a new height in 1970 on the popularity of singer Claudine Longet, only to fall off the charts in 1975. Claudine along with most other once-popular –ine and –een-ending girls’ names are now out of favor. Nanette - Nanette ranked among the Top 1000 until 77, peaking in 1956. But today, most parents say no to Nanette. Sheba - Sheba is the short form of the Biblical Bathsheba, disappearing from view with only five baby girls named Sheba in the US in 2013. Sondra - Sandra’s exotic sister Sondra ranked in the Top 1000 from the 1920s through the 80s, peaking in 1939. But the devastating Hurricane Sandy took a lot of wind out of all forms of this name, given to only five girls in 2013. Thisbe -Thisbe was never ranked in the Top 1000, but this ancient mythological name – she was a doomed young lover whose tale inspired Romeo & Juliet – is about to vanish from the modern lexicon. Zelma - Zelma nearly broke the Top 200 in 1902 but fell off the list in 1955. Selma, Thelma, and even Velma, might be hanging on by the tips of their antiquated fingernails, but Zelma is about to lose her grip on modern usage. BOYS . Elmo - Just over a century ago, this short form of Guglielmo, the Italian form of William, stood at a respectable Number 247, hanging in there until the 1950s, when it disappeared from view. Any hope of revival was shattered by the ticklish toy from SesameStreet. Icarus - A dramatic Greek mythological name, Icarus is known for flying too close to the sun with dire consequences. His name has never broken into the national Top 1000, probably due his rash reputation and the icky sound of the first syllable of his name. Inigo - Inigo is another name that’s never ranked here, though it’s admired enough on Nameberry to make it Number 261. It’s the medieval Spanish version of Ignatius, which has ranked as high as Number 602 on the national list and was used by Cate Blanchett, but Inigo is a no-go. Llewellyn - A common name in Wales, with the distinctive Welsh double-l beginning, Llewellyn appeared on the US list for six decades, ending in the early 1940s. But despite its rich Welsh history, literary cred and quirky nicknames, Llewelyn seems headed for extinction. Remus - With his twin brother Romulus, he was a legendary founder of Rome. But the stereotypical image of Uncle Remus, plus the unpleasant first syllable, have kept him permanently off the Top 1000. Sherwood - The stiff surname Sherwood, which does have the distinguished namesake of influential novelist Sherwood Anderson, managed to make it onto the list from 1897 to 1963, peaking at Number 533 in 1938, Anderson’s heyday, but it hasn’t been heard from in the 7+ decades since then. Waldo - Where’s Waldo? He’s nowhere to be found except on the birth certificates of a scant five boys last year. Waldo actually reached as high as Number 347 in 1881 and remained on the list till 1941, when it became a victim of anti-German sentiment.","Gary fell from 147th most popular British name in 1996 to 1,001st in 2013 .

"When James Bowen wrote a heart-warming memoir about a stray cat rescuing him from homelessness and heroin addiction, it became an overnight bestseller. The former Big Issue salesman and busker has sold more than four million copies of A Street Cat Named Bob and churned out multiple spin offs – earning £500,000 in just three years. But the Daily Mail can reveal that despite his ample fortune, Bowen, 36, continued to have his rent paid for by housing benefit. Since 2012 the taxpayer has forked out £15,500 for Bowen – who has a personal accountant – to live in his housing association flat in Haringey, North London. Scroll down for video . The former Big Issue salesman has sold more than four million copies of A Street Cat Named Bob and has also churned out multiple spin offs – earning £500,000 in just three years . And while Bowen and his famous cat stay in the social housing flat he was granted in 2010, the many homeless people he talks of helping remain desperate for a roof over their heads. A former friend of Bowen said: ‘He was fully aware he should not have been getting housing benefit, but failed to stop it. He hasn’t been hurrying to buy his own house either.’ Failing to tell your local council you are no longer entitled to housing benefit can result in criminal prosecution for fraud and jail time. A Haringey Council spokesman said it was the responsibility of claimants to contact them within one month of their income increasing, adding: ‘In this case, we were first informed of a change in circumstances in February 2015.’ Born in Surrey, Bowen was raised in Australia. He returned to England in 1997, becoming a heroin addict and sleeping rough for ten years. He said his life only changed when he found a stray cat on a doorstep in 2007. The Daily Mail can reveal that despite earning an ample fortune from the book (left with Bob; cover right), Bowen, 36, continued to have his rent paid for by housing benefit . Bowen’s account of rescuing Bob, and in turn being rescued by the cat’s loyalty and trust, was published in 2012, spending two years in the UK Top 10 bestseller list. In an interview two years ago Bowen said he was off benefits and saving up to get a mortgage. He added he would use his newfound wealth to help drug and homelessness rehabilitation programmes. Last night Bowen’s spokesman said he was unaware housing benefit was still paying his rent until December, when it came up in a mortgage application, and has since paid up. He added housing benefit was still being paid last week despite requests for it to stop. Speaking to the Mail yesterday, Bowen denied responsibility, claiming he told the council about his change of fortunes – but could not say if he had followed the correct procedure. ‘In 2013 I did make calls to the Peabody Trust housing association, the council, and social security and haven’t received benefits since,’ he said. ‘I personally told them I was no longer entitled to housing benefit, and for two years I’ve been trying to pay my £107-a-week rent myself, but the Peabody Trust wouldn’t cash the cheques.’","Since 2012 taxpayer has forked out £15,500 for James Bowen's flat .

"An undercover police officer who was captured on video ranting at an Uber driver is assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, it has emerged. The New York Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident after the footage was posted online involving Detective Patrick Cherry. One of the passengers in the car captured the exchange after the incident in West Village. Scroll down for video . Detective Patrick Cherry, pictured in the blue shirt, launched his tirade after the Uber driver hooted at him . The driver, named only as Humayun, pictured, tried to repeatedly apologise to Detective Cherry . The officer has been named by the New York Daily News as Detective Patrick Cherry of the NYPD's joint terrorism task force. Detective Cherry was trying to park his Hyundai without indicating when the Uber driver known only as Humayun honked his horn. The angered detective pulled over the Uber cab and launched a tirade, questioning the diver's command of the English language as well as his car control skills. Detective Cherry is now under investigation by the Civilian Complaint Review Board following a complaint of 'discourtesy'. President of the Detectives Endowment Association said Detective Cherry had been visiting his colleague Detective Harry Hill who had recently had a heart attack while undergoing surgery and was very stressed. He said: 'The past five days have been emotionally draining for the members of the JTTF dealing with their fellow detective's health . 'Despite what some people think, cops have feelings, too.' During the three-minute video, Detective Cherry shouts: 'I don't know where you're coming from, where you think you're appropriate in doing that; that's not the way it works. How long have you been in this country?' The two passengers in the backseat of the car can be heard assuring the driver that he has done nothing wrong, with one of them saying; 'It's not your fault; this guy's just a d***.' Moments later the cop returns with a ticket, this after he has pounded on the car and, according to one of the passengers, thrown things in the vehicle. As the driver agrees with everything the cop says, he manages to cut off the man, which sends him into another tirade as he screams; 'I don't know what f****** planet you're on right now!' The officer also mocks the driver's accent throughout and his pronunciation of certain words. Passengers in the cab claimed that Detective Cherry failed to indicate before attempting to park his Hyundai .

'Our Uber driver, Humayun, was abused by a police officer today in New York,' Sanjay Seth, who took the video, wrote on his Facebook page on Monday. 'The unending rage, door slamming, throwing items into the car, threatening arrest without cause was bad enough - but the officer's remarks at the end really took it to another level.' Uber said in a statement; 'The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident.

"A tribunal found Cambridge graduate Svetlana Lokhova, 33, was a 'resilient person' driven to a mental breakdown by work colleagues at the bank . A high-flying banker falsely branded ‘Crazy Miss Cokehead’ has been awarded £3.2million after her career was destroyed by sexist taunts. Cambridge graduate Svetlana Lokhova was driven to a breakdown by a campaign of sexual harassment by bullying male colleagues, an employment tribunal found. Workmates falsely accused her of being a cocaine user, dubbed her ‘Miss Bonkers’, and said she was hired by the bank only because of her looks. Miss Lokhova, 33, the only woman in her team, won her legal claim that she was the victim of sexual harassment and unfairly forced to leave her £750,000-a-year role. She was awarded £3.14million for lost earnings, £44,000 for hurt feelings and £15,000 in aggravated damages by judges at the Central London Employment Tribunal. They ruled she was a ‘resilient person’ who had suffered ‘disgraceful’ harassment and victimisation by colleagues in the London branch of Russian-based Sberbank CIB. Miss Lokhova said her reputation was ‘shredded’ by the taunts and slurs, which meant she could never get another job in financial services. She has been unable to work for more than three years and the tribunal said it accepted medical evidence that her City career was effectively over. It heard she was tormented by colleagues on the equity sales desk of the bank, who referred to her as ‘mad Svetlana’ and said she was ‘chemically dependent’ and ‘a major car crash’. Giving evidence last year, Miss Lokhova said: ‘My manager and colleagues described me in sexist terms as “Miss Cokehead”, “bitch”… and “Miss Dodgy Septum” in communications made to senior people and clients. My job was made impossible. This persistent unlawful treatment has had a seriously detrimental effect on my health, with severe and long-term consequences.’ She added: ‘I am completely broken down and exhausted by the bank’s campaign against me. I can never return to financial services again, which I loved and where I was enjoying considerable success. ‘Everybody knows everybody’s business in banking and people believe there is no smoke without fire. My reputation has been shredded.’ The tribunal found Miss Lokhova to be a 'resilient person' but ruled that harassment by her colleague at Sberbank (pictured), David Longmuir, triggered 'chronic and long-term symptoms' of mental breakdown . Miss Lokhova (pictured) was falsely accused of being a cocaine addict and branded 'Miss Dodgy Septum' Former manager David Longmuir sent an email to a client in which he said he was ‘awaiting arrival of Ms Cokehead in a puff of sulphurous smoke’. The tribunal said he should have been sacked for gross misconduct but heard he left the bank a year after Miss Lokhova resigned, and received a payout of about £170,000. When Miss Lokhova brought her legal claim against the bank, the false allegation that she was a drug user was put to her in a public hearing, which she said had made her ordeal worse. The tribunal said it was an attempt to bully her and awarded her aggravated damages to compensate for the ‘deliberate, planned and unnecessary misuse of these proceedings’. Miss Lokhova took a drug test during the hearing, which was negative. She joined the bank, which is Russia’s largest lender, in 2008 in an £80,000-a-year post. The tribunal heard her salary and bonuses increased until she was earning more than £750,000 a year. At one point she was awarded a £600,000 cash bonus after generating profits worth millions. Miss Lokhova said yesterday: ‘The case has been a long, difficult and draining process which has all but taken over my life and those of people close to me. But more than three years after my ordeal began, I have found the one thing I was seeking – justice.’ Sberbank said: ‘We are committed to take on board any lessons to be learned.'","Svetlana Lokhova worked in the London office of Russian firm Sberbank .

"California Gov. Jerry Brown ordered state officials to impose mandatory water restrictions for the first time in history on Wednesday, as the state continues to grapple with a serious drought. Brown said Wednesday that he had signed an executive order requiring the State Water Resources Control Board to implement measures in cities and towns to cut water usage by 25 percent compared with 2013 levels. California has been in a drought for four years. 'We're in a historic drought and that demands unprecedented action,' Brown at a news conference held at Echo Summit in the Sierra Nevada.  'We have to pull together and save water in every way we can.' Scroll down for video . Changes: California Gov. Jerry Brown, speaking at the podium, ordered state officials to impose mandatory water restrictions for the first time in history on Wednesday . Test: Frank Gehrke, left, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program for the Department of Water Resources, points to a mark on the snow pack measuring pole that was the lowest previous snow pack level as  Gov. Brown, center, and Mark Cowin, director of the Department of Water Resources, right, look on . State water officials found no snow on the ground at the site for their manual survey of the snowpack. Brown's order will require campuses, golf courses, cemeteries and other large landscapes to significantly cut water use; direct local governments to replace 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with drought-tolerant landscaping; and create a temporary rebate program for consumers who replace old water-sucking appliances with more efficient ones. The move will affect residents, businesses, farmers and other users. CBS News quoted Brown as saying 'People should realize we're in a new era. The idea of your nice little green grass getting lots of water every day, that's going to be a thing of the past. 'We're not going to change everything overnight but we are in a transition period. People have to realize that in many parts of California, they are living in a desert.' The order calls on local water agencies to implement tiered water pricing that charges higher rates as more water is used and requires agricultural users to report more water use information to state regulators. Brown's office said that would boost the state's ability to enforce laws against illegal water diversions and water waste. The order also prohibits new homes and developments from using drinkable water for irrigation if the structures lack water-efficient drip systems. In addition, the watering of decorative grasses on public street medians is banned. The snowpack has been in decline all year, with electronic measurements in March showing the statewide snow water equivalent at 19 percent of the historical average for that date. Resources: Snow supplies about a third of the state's water. A higher snowpack translates to more water in California reservoirs to meet demand in summer and fall (January 2015 file photo) Snow supplies about a third of the state's water. A higher snowpack translates to more water in California reservoirs to meet demand in summer and fall. There was no snow at the site of Wednesday's survey near Echo Summit, about 90 miles east of Sacramento. 'It is such an unprecedented lack of snow, it is way, way below records,' said Frank Gehrke, chief of snow surveys for the California Department of Water Resources. Officials say the snowpack is far below the historic lows of 1977 and 2014, when it was 25 percent of normal on April 1 - the time when the snowpack is generally at its peak. Brown previously declared a drought emergency in January 2014 and stressed the need for sustained water conservation. 'I've declared this emergency and I’m calling all Californians to conserve water in every way possible,' he said in statement at the time. But he has come under increasing pressure to be more aggressive as the state enters its fourth year of drought. Per CBS News, Brown said Wednesday 'We are embarking on an experiment that no one has ever tried, ever, in the history of mankind. And that is 38 million people with 32 million vehicles living at the level of comfort that we all strive to attain.'","California Gov.

"A health expert has slammed parents for not taking vaccination seriously after 19 children attending a primary school in north Brisbane contracted the potentially deadly disease whooping cough. Kilcoy State School is working with Queensland Health after a whooping cough outbreak in the area, but parents have been urged to take vaccination more seriously there. The Sunshine Coast Daily reports that infectious diseases expert Professor Matthew Cooper, a professorial research fellow at the University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience, attributed the outbreak to an anti-vaccination trend. Parents have been accused of not taking vaccination seriously after 19 children attending a primary school in north Brisbane contracted whooping cough . 'It's unfortunately just part of a growing trend that many people have decided not to immunise,' he said. 'We've seen this with other diseases that are more serious than pertussis but unfortunately the more people who choose not to immunise the more likely it is we'll get outbreaks.' Although immunisation rates in Queensland have dropped across most age groups there since 2010, in 2014 the Metro North region had the highest immunisation rate in the state. Kilcoy State School (pictured) in north Brisbane is working with Queensland Health after a whooping cough outbreak in the area . There are about 1200 cases of whooping cough every year in the Metro North area. This region covers the Brisbane River to past Caboolture. in total there have been 86 confirmed cases in 2015 - alarmingly 16 in the past week - compared to 113 last year. Statewide, 232 cases have been reported. Parents were urged to take children with any symptoms to their family doctor . Dr Cooper said it was essential to convince parents of the importance of vaccination. He said if vaccination rates continued to fall there could be an increase in unfortunate and preventable deaths. Parents were urged parents to take children with any symptoms to their family doctor, and for children who tested positive to stay away from school for five days.","Kilcoy State School working with Queensland Health to improve situation .

"How we work out the distance of something we can hear but not see has been somewhat of a mystery - until now. Scientists say we know how far away the source of a sound is by listening to the echoes it produces. In a study they found that the reverberations of sound help us locate the distance of, for example, a car passing round a bend or a person nearby. Scientists at the University of Connecticut say we know how far away the source of a sound is by listening to the echoes it produces (stock image shown). In a study they found that the reverberation of sound helps us locate the distance of, for example, a car passing round a bend or a person nearby . The research was conducted by scientists from the University of Connecticut and published in the Journal of Neuroscience. They said that echoes and fluctuations in volume are the cues we use to figure out the distance between us and the source of a noise. Researchers have long understood how we can tell a sound's direction - whether it's to our left or right, front or back, and above or below us. From their heavy build and short limbs, to the shape of their skull and teeth, there are many ways that the anatomy of Neanderthals differed to our own. Now experts say that even a small bone in their ears are dissimilar to one in modern humans, raising the prospect that our extinct ancient relatives heard differently to us too. Researchers created a computer model of the middle ear bone of a Neanderthal child, whose remains were discovered in France 40 years ago. The remains from the two-year-old child, which are known as La Ferrassie 8, were discovered at La Ferrassie in the Dordogne, south western France, between 1970 and 1973. Asier Gómez-Olivencia, an Ikerbasque researcher at the University of the Basque Country in northern Spain, produced a 3D computer reconstruction of the remains. His work, published in The Journal of Human Evolution, reveals another anatomical difference between the Neanderthals and modern humans in the smallest ossicles of the body. But how we tell how far away it is had remained a mystery. 'The third dimension of sound location was pretty much unknown,' said Dr Duck Kim, a neuroscientist at UConn Health. The researchers suspected that the effect echoes had on volume - or amplitude modulation - could be key in our ability to perceive a sound's distance from us. To explore the idea, they used tiny microphones to record the sounds inside rabbits' ears as they played sounds at different locations. They used these recordings to simulate modulated or unmodulated noise coming from different distances from the rabbit. Then the researchers played the simulated sounds back to the rabbit, and measured the responses of neurons in the rabbit's inferior colliculus (IC), a region of the midbrain known to be important for sound perception. When the rabbit heard the simulated sounds, certain types of IC neurons fired more when the sound was closer - when there was a bigger difference between the sound's maximum and minimum volume. The farther away the source of a sound is from a listener, meanwhile, the more echoes there are, and the more limited the changes in volume become. As the source moved further away, therefore, the neurons fired less and less. The researchers say that the effect echoes have on volume - or amplitude modulation - could be key in our ability to perceive a sound's distance from us. Without amplitude modulation, for example in an anechoic (echo-free) room, pictured, a person can't tell how far away a noise is from them . The results suggest that, as a sound gets further away, our brains are able to work out the differences in its maximum and minimum volume - and thus its distance. Dr Pavel Zahorik, a researcher at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, got the same results with human volunteers. Without amplitude modulation, for example in an anechoic (echo-free) room, a person can't tell how far away that noise is. 'Reverberation is usually considered a bad thing,' detrimental to hearing clearly, said Dr Shigeyuki Kuwada, co-author on the University of Connecticut study. 'But it is necessary and beneficial in order to recognise distance.' The researchers hope to investigate the problem further, and  tie together the perception of distance, horizontal and vertical directions of sound.","University of Connecticut study reveals how we can measure distances .

"Whether it's from a university or a new employer, we all know that horrible, deflated feeling that comes with getting a rejection letter. But 17-year-old Siobhan O'Dell hit back after being sent a rejection letter from Duke University, by sending the admissions office a message of her own, rejecting their rejection. The teenager, from North Carolina, had applied to the prestigious college in her home state, but on March 26 she was sent a letter telling her she had failed to make the grade. Scroll down for video . Siobahn O'Dell, 17, from North Carolina, sent this response to an email from the admissions department at Duke University telling her she had missed out on a place . However, refusing to take no for an answer, she wrote back, saying: 'After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me admission into the Fall 2015 freshman class at Duke. Mirroring the standard format of college rejection letters, she added: 'Despite Duke's outstanding success in rejecting previous applicants, you simply did not meet my qualifications. 'Therefore, I will be attending Duke University's 2015 freshmen class. I look forward to seeing you then.' Speaking to MailOnline about the letter, she said: 'They sent me a typical college rejection letter, ""This year we had an outstanding pool of applicants..."", blah, blah, blah. 'It made me realize how much power universities have over students. Seniors labor over applications, stress over waiting, and sometimes cry over the answer. Then that's it. 'The college has all the power. But what if that wasn't it? What if we got to treat the college like they treated us? I wanted to give them a taste of their own medicine.' Miss O'Dell's letter has attracted nearly 100,000 likes and rebolgs since she posted it to her Tumblr account, and will even feature in Duke's college newspaper . Since posting a copy of the letter to her Tumblr account, the image has gone viral, attracting nearly 100,000 likes and reblogs since first being posted. Speaking about the popularity of the email, she said: 'I obviously wasn't expecting it to get this popular, it was just meant as a joke. 'My friends all it's hilarious, I haven't showed my mom yet but she'll get a good laugh out of it. 'My only regret is not proof reading it first as a few people have pointed out the bad grammar.' Not sharing the joke: Duke University did respond to Miss O'Dell's email, but clearly didn't share her sense of humour, instead telling her she could appeal their decision, but was unlikely to get it overturned . While Miss O'Dell's letter didn't earn her a place at Duke, it seems to have got the attention of students on campus, and is even set to feature in the college newspaper. Duke did eventually respond to her rejection letter, but didn't appear to share the joke, instead telling her that should could appeal their decision, but 'it's very rare' for the call to be overturned. However Miss O'Dell, who also goes by her middle name of Reece, has no need for an appeal after being awarded a place at the University of Southern California. She said: 'I'm going to major in biology and minor in mathematics. My goal is to be a pediatrician. I look forward to going to USC this fall.'","Siobhan O'Dell, 17, had been hoping to get a place at Duke University .

"A paramedic who pretended he was gay to get close to women before sexually assaulting them has been struck off the medical register. Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.' When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'","Christopher Bridger, 25, attacked three women after drinking sessions .

"A husband whose wife was brutally stabbed to death by her own son has described his heartache at her death. Kris Wardle, who lives in Leicester, thought his world was complete when he married his long-term girlfriend Katrina in 2011 with her teenage son, Mark, acting as Best Man. However, less than two years later, the HGV truck driver would be a widower, after his beloved wife was killed in a frenzied knife attack by now 21-year-old Mark after a row over his cannabis use. Scroll down for video . Kris and Tina Wardle fell in love in 2002 and had planned a life together . 'You could have turned the lights out in the middle of an eclipse and if she smiled, the room would just light up,' said Kris. 'If I called her perfect she’d just come round and belt me round the back of the head, cause she knew damn well she wasn't perfect, but to me, that girl, she was just something so special.' Kris said Katrina, who was known as Tina, already had two children when they met and was a devoted mother when they fell in love in 2002 when her son Mark was ten years old. 'They came first, always, there was no question about it, she loved her kids, she loved them to bits,' said Kris. 'Mark was the apple of Tina’s eye, no two ways about it. He didn’t have an outgoing personality.' Kris said Mark was very quiet and only interested in his computer games. Mark Howe was obsessed with the TV show Dexter which features a serial killer . Michael C Hall who starred as Dexter in the TV show . 'He didn’t talk a lot, he’d come in, he’d do a bit of homework, he’d watch some TV, play computer games and sometimes we’d talk, but it would be inconsequential things, just little things, mainly about games. 'A couple of games he wanted to play, or the games he was looking to play. 'I think that him being as quiet as he was, made her so much more protective of him.' As time went on, the couple grew concerned that the now 13-year-old Mark was spending more time in his bedroom playing computer games and withdrawing not only from his friends, but his family too. 'Tina was a little worried because he seemed to be getting quieter in himself, she talked with me about it and she spoke to some of her friends from work, and they were saying he’s a teenager,' said Kris. 'He was just an average teenager. Sometimes he'd be ""yeah, whatever I'm not interested, I don't want nothing to do with it"" and other times he’d be ""yeah okay, let’s go to the cinema"". 'Sometimes he’d be chatty and sometimes he’d just stay in his room play on the computer. 'The reason it always sticks into mind so much, was how much more Mark was talking in the game room, compared to how he’d talk actually off line. 'He was more happy to talk online than off. Kris said Mark became increasingly obsessed with violent games and while he and his wife were watching television, they would hear Mark yelling at his games console. He said by 2010, Mark was becoming even more withdrawn. Kris and Tina married in 2011 and planned a long life together . 'It was still Mark but he it was like he was just going through a really a rough patch, emotionally. 'He was withdrawing more into the world where he doesn’t have to physically face people than the world where he’s got to face people.' He said the couple became encouraged when Mark got a job in a care home, however when he returned home, he would go straight to his video games. 'He’d go out to work, was paying his own way with things and he’d come back in from work and he’d bought a load more games, changing his phone regularly, just doing his own thing totally and basically just shut us out,' said Kris. Kris said when Tina smiled, the room would light up . 'It was like having a total stranger living in the house. And if we saw him, or spoke with him, if we bumped into each other in the kitchen or we had to stand outside his door saying ""look, we need the bloody plates out, you’ve got every plate in the house"" he'd be really rebellious.' Kris said they became concerned about Mark and although he hated his mother interfering, she felt she had to try. 'We took him down the doctors, but he didn’t really want to talk,' said Kris. Kris said in September 2011 he asked Tina to marry him, and to help mark feel more included, asked him to be best man. 'I wanted to prove to him that he was family and at that point said to him ""go on, do us a favour"" and he was like ""oh wow"". Happier times: Tina strikes a pose for the camera . 'I said it’ll be nice my son giving me my wife. And he was so up for it.' Kris said he and Tina had a perfect day. 'It was brilliant - I wasn’t actually walking on the floor, I was walking inches above it,' he said. 'It was just amazing and seeing Mark hug his mum. Everyone was hugging.' However, Kris said although the wedding day was a happy occasion, Mark was getting worse as he started to smoke cannabis which would would push him further into a dark world. Tina was 'devoted' to her children, said Kris . 'Mark had got to the point where he’s bringing it in and the house stunk of it.' Kris said Tina challenged Mark about the drugs, but he would shout back. Unknown to the couple, Mark was secretly sending his friends text messages saying how much he hated his mother and began stabbing the punch bag in his bedroom while also becoming obsessed with the TV show Dexter, which is about a serial killer. 'He was a fanatic for the programme. I mean, Dexter is a serial killer.' What the couple didn't know was that Mark began using the internet to search for the weapons Dexter used to kill his victims. On the 16 July 2012, Kris, 51, was working away from home when he received a frantic text from a family member saying that Mark had confessed to his sister that he had killed his mother. 'I tried Tina on the mobile and she didn’t answer, it just ended up ringing off, so I tried her on the land line and it was just the same. I kept kept ringing her and ringing her.' Desperate to know that his wife was safe, he asked his father, Brian, to go round to the flat where he found Tina lying in a pool of blood while still on the phone to his son. US TV series Dexter features a fictional police worker, Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter pattern analyst for the Miami Police Department, who leads a secret life hunting down and killing criminals he believes deserve retribution. Orphaned at the age of three, Dexter was and adopted by a Miami police officer who recognised he had homicidal tendencies . He was then taught to channel his passion for human dissection into killing only heinous criminals. 'From the amount of blood and that, I could tell she’d gone,' said Brian. Kris said: 'He’s saying he’s so sorry. My dad’s ex ambulance and when he said that, I knew. I didn’t want to carry on. I just wanted the world to stop. It had stopped.  Why? She didn’t have a bad word for anybody at any time.' Inside the flat, police discovered just how frenzied the killing was and it was established that Tina had been stabbed 53 times. Mark was arrested at the care home where he worked and blamed his step father, although the story was quickly discounted by detectives who had taken Kris into the police station for questioning. Kris said: 'That night I just lay there. I don't know if I slept, I don't know if I didn't. 'In the morning I walked home and there is this big white tent in front of the garden, with police there. I just sank down on my knees. I was just praying - praying it was all just a horrible dream, that it was somebody else’s.' Kris said he was hoping that Mark's trial in January 2014 would provide some answers as to why he killed his mother, although he said he was left bitterly disappointed. 'They brought him up and he just stood there and looked like he just didn’t give a damn. I wanted to see if there was something that was totally different to what I was expecting. I didn’t want to see Mark I wanted to see a demon. And all I saw was Mark, and he didn't care.' Mark Howe pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life with a minimum of 21 years and six months. Kris says he is now focusing on rebuilding his life by fulfilling his and Tina's dreams. Kris says Tina always wanted to visit Cambodia so he has scattered some of her ashes there . 'Tina had seen a picture of a place in Cambodia, called Bayon temple, part of the Angkor Wat region in Siem Reap,' he added. 'She always said she wanted to go there and I am like, ""we’re going, you wanted to go we’re going"". 'And all those plans. They just went up in flames. But I went to Cambodia and found the spot that we’d looked at in that picture and the tree looked just the same. 'I took some of Tina’s ashes and I spread them round the tree. The tree, that will be Tina, giving herself again. While the tree's there, Tina’s there.'","Mark Howe, 21, researched what weapons his TV icon used on victims .

"The Queensland government has called a government decision to deport a single-mother and her son 'cold and heartless'. Townsville nurse Maria Sevilla and her son, Tyrone, will be forced out of the country within 28 days, after Ms Sevilla's appeal to the Immigration Department was unsuccessful. The single-mum initially  had her visa application rejected because her son's autism would be a 'burden on the Australian health system', according to the Immigration Department. Scroll down for video . Tyrone (pictured) and his mother Maria Sevilla have had their visa application rejected and are facing deportation back to the Philippines . After Ms Sevilla's appeal was unsuccessful, her and her son will be deported within 28 days . Ms Sevilla said she did not want to be a burden, and was working in Australia in an effort to give her son the best possible 'future'. Queensland Disabilities Minister Coralee O'Rourke called it a 'cold, heartless decision' by the Federal Government. 'I call on them to reverse the decision,' she said, according to the ABC. Ms Sevilla said she hoped Immigration Minister Peter Dutton would exercise his ministerial power and allow them to stay. 'It's like, I'm pleading for our life, for Tyrone's future,' she said. A spokeswoman for Minister Dutton said the Migration Review Tribunal had reviewed the case and affirmed the original decision. 'Most visas for Australia require applicants to meet the health requirements set out in Australian migration law,' the spokeswoman said. 'The health requirements are an objective assessment to determine whether the care of an individual during their stay in Australia would likely result in significant costs on the Australian community. 'The visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement.' Ms Sevilla, a single mum and nurse in the Queensland town of Townsville, has lived in Australia with her son since 2007. She says it is the only place he knows, and he only knows English . Maria Sevilla has lived in Australia since 2007, when she arrived in the Queensland town of Townsville - a single mother wanting to become a nurse, in the hope of finding a better life for herself and for her baby. Her son was diagnosed with autism at the age of two, six months after they arrived in Australia. Ms Sevilla told Daily Mail Australia the new life in Australia 'changed everything' for her and her son, and she was able to fulfill her 'dream' of working as a nurse. It was not possible for Ms Sevilla to work as a nurse in the Philippines, where she said university is only possible for 'well-off families'. 'Coming here and becoming a nurse has given me assurance for our future and a sense of fulfilment,' she said. Ms Sevilla also rejected claims her son will be a burden on the country. 'All of it could be taken away because the government thinks that children with autism are going to be more of a cost to Australian society than a benefit – but that's just not true,' she said. Ms Sevilla has made a petition and is appealing the decision to send herself and her son back to the Philippines - a place where she has no family and no network of support. 'Everything is here for us. My work, our family, our home is here, Tyrone's school.' Ms Sevilla's application for a Skilled-Region visa subclass 489 has been rejected by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection due to Tyrone's autism. The rejection letter states that Tyrone 'has a severe autism spectrum disorder, a condition that is likely to be permanent in nature'. It stated that he would likely need special education services, state disability services, Commonwealth disability services and residential care services. 'Tyrone would be likely to result in a significant cost to the Australian community in the areas of health care,' the rejection letter said. A spokeswoman for then-Immigration Minister Scott Morrison released a statement about the initial rejection. 'The visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement,' the spokeswoman said. 'The applicant was advised of her options for independent review of the decision. People can only seek ministerial intervention once a refusal decision has been upheld at merits review'. Tyrone is a 'very cheeky, happy little boy' who is thriving at his specialised school in Townsville . Before appealing the decision, Ms Sevilla said she had received heartwarming support from many Australians. 'I have received so many messages from mums of children with Autism; it's very prevalent in Australia,' Ms Sevilla said . 'As a mother of a child with Autism, I know it isn't a disease you have to cure, but one you have to manage. 'Tyrone is a happy child with full of life attitude and can lighten the mood of a room with his presence. 'The idea that he can't contribute because of his condition is just wrong. People with autism can be excellent at a whole range of things; he just needs to be given a chance.' Ms Sevilla is sad, not angry, that the Immigration Department does not understand Autism, and says that her son deserves a chance . Due to Tyrone's autism, even minor changes to their routines troubles him, meaning having their deportation would cause enormous issues for the little boy. 'Tyrone notices any change to his routine. Even if I drive him a different route to school, he'll notice and react with a tantrum. But once you calm him down he's fine. 'But if we're asked to go back to the Philippines, we'd have to start from scratch. Tyrone only knows English. He only knows life in Australia.' Ms Sevilla lives with her brother and his wife, with her mother only fifteen minutes away - or as Ms Sevilla explains it 'just a phone call away'. They are a crucial support for her and adored by Tyrone. Ms Sevilla says there is no support for them in Tyrone, compared to Australia, where her beloved mother, brother, sister-in-law, aunty, uncle and cousins live. Tyrone is very happy with them, and are a crucial support for Ms Sevilla, which includes caring for Tyrone when Ms Sevilla is on night shift. 'I have found a better life for my family in Australia with my close family. My mother, stepfather and Tyrone's uncle and aunty are so important for Tyrone and I. 'They are a big help, as any single mum would understand.' Ms Sevilla (pictured second from the left, in pink) and her son Tyrone (centre, in blue cap) say they have 'never felt lonely' in Australia, despite their challenges, because of all the support they have been given . Ms Sevilla says that through all her challenges, Australia has been a safe, caring place for her and her son. 'I have a lot of support from the community. I have my family. I have never felt alone.'

"Kim Jong-un has ordered the recreation of the famous 'pleasure troupe' of young women that North Korean leaders have traditionally employed to entertain them. Kim disbanded the group of hand-picked teenagers shortly after the death of his father in the North Korean capital Pyongyang in December 2011. But now that the country's official three-year mourning period for Kim Jong-il has concluded, the eccentric autocrat has demanded his advisers find suitable new women for the role, as the previous members retired  and were married off to military generals when they hit their early 20s. Scroll down for video . Ladies love Kim: Kim Jong-un has ordered the recreation of the famous 'pleasure troupe' of young women to entertain him. Here he is mobbed by emotional women during an inspection of an all-female military unit . Mobbed: Kim Jong-un smiles as he walks alongside members of North Korea's women's national soccer team . Happily married: Kim Jong-un is photographed with his wife Ri Sol-ju in Pyongyang in July 2012 . News that Kim Jong-un is re-establishing the so-called 'pleasure troupe' was reported by South Korea's Chosun Ilbo. The tradition was established by the dictator's grandfather Kim Il-sung - who is considered the founder of North Korea and still holds the title of Eternal President despite dying in 1994. North Korean officials have traditionally scoured the countryside for pretty teenagers, sometimes as young as 13-years-old, who are then taken to Pyongyang to work as dancers, singers or servants for the country's leaders. Often the most attractive girls are forcibly married off to powerful military generals as a way of rewarding the men for their all-important loyalty to the regime. As part of the handover of power following the death of Kim Il-sung in 2011, the entire troop was dismantled and sent off to marry members of the North Korean establishment. But now that three years have passed it is thought acceptable for Kim to restart the tradition by finding his own girls. Inspection: Kim Jong-un is photographed at a machine plant yesterday in images released by state media . Giving orders: Kim Jong-Un inspects a machine plant at an undisclosed location in North Korea yesterday . Kim Il-sung's personal 'pleasure troupe' were given $4,000 pay-offs upon his death as a reward for their service to the regime, according to the Telegraph. As teenagers most were simply taken out of school and moved from their hometowns without the consent of their parents, who were no doubt terrified at what could happen to them if they resisted. The girls reportedly lived in the senior officials' houses and were traditionally allowed to marry their employers and 'retire' from service by the time they reached their early 20s. The three-year absence of the 'pleasure troupe' was due to a complete overhaul of the North Korean establishment by Kim Jong-un following his father's death. The dictator moved swiftly to remove the most powerful figures from his father's regime - having many of them executed - and replaced them with his own group of spineless bureaucrats.","Kim Jong-un dismantled the group of  teenagers after his father's death .

"David Cameron has suggested using jujitsu to 'put Nigel Farage on the floor' in tonight's televised debate between seven party leaders. The Prime Minister took advice from martial arts pupils about the best way to deal with the Ukip leader when they go up against each other in the two-hour showdown. Sensing he may have gone too far with the threat to to wrestle his opponent to the ground, Mr Cameron later backtracked, insisting there will be 'no bodily contact' during the debate.

Prime Minister David Cameron took advice from martial arts pupils in Warrington about the best way to deal with the Ukip leader when they go up against each other in the two-hour showdown . The Tory leader paid a visit to the Kings Leadership Academy in Warrington ahead of the seven-way debate tonight . All of the party leaders have spent the day preparing for tonight's debate, with Mr Cameron facing the prospect of having to defend the Tory-led government from attack on several fronts. Mr Cameron visited King's Leadership Academy in Warrington, where he spoke to pupils about their favourite sports. Chatting in a playground, the Tory leader said: 'In this debate tonight, jujitsu, is that the right thing?' To laughter he added: 'Shall I get Nigel Farage and put him on the floor, is that OK?' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he was feeling 'pretty good' ahead of his TV test . But later he played down the idea of physical violence, telling reporters: 'It was a joke. There'll be no bodily contact tonight.' Today Mr Cameron insisted he was not nervous and was 'relishing' the prospect of the two-hour debate in the ITV studios at Salford's MediaCityUK. Mr Cameron told reporters: 'It is a chance to get across that we have a long-term economic plan that is working.' For his part, Mr Farage said he was feeling 'pretty good' ahead of his TV test, telling Sky News: 'I hope the truth comes out on some issues. 'Particularly, I shall be arguing and asking the Prime Minister and others, will they please admit that, as members of the EU, we cannot have an immigration policy of any kind at all.' Mr Cameron and Mr Farage will share the platform tonight with  Labour's Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the Green Party's Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. It is the only time Mr Cameron will go up against Mr Miliband, with one of them certain to be Prime Minister after May 7. The Prime Minister was accused by Labour of 'running scared' after dodging a head-to-head showdown with the Labour leader. After Mr Cameron objected to broadcasters' plans for three TV debates during the five-and-a-half week campaign, the ITV show marks the only occasion before the May 7 election when the Tory and Labour leaders will face each other. With all the polls pointing to an extremely tight contest, the leaders of the two biggest parties will be anxious to avoid any costly slips while looking for the opportunity to score points at expense of their rival. Mr Clegg said he would go for a walk to 'clear my head' before making his way to the TV studios, while Mr Miliband said the best preparation was 'getting out to meet people'.

Nick Clegg was in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, today while the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon attended the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood .

Lots have been drawn to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak. The agreed line up behind the podiums will be, from left to right: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative). Names drawn out of a hat also helped to decide who will get to speak first, with Ms Bennett opening proceedings and Mr Cameron having the final word by giving the last closing remarks. The two-hour live debate will be be screened from 8pm to 10pm. Each leader will give an opening statement to a studio audience of around 200 people.

There will be just four 'substantial election questions' covered during the night. Each leader will then give a closing statement to the cameras, before the programme ends at 10pm. Michael Jermey, ITV's Director of News and Current Affairs said: 'The programme will provide a fair forum for a proper debate between the party leaders. 'Our viewers greatly valued the debates in 2010 and we know many are looking forward to this programme.

"An apartment house where only high-paying tenants can use the gym may be illegally discriminating, city human rights officials warned this week. It's the latest salvo in an ongoing struggle between property developers to build or maintain rent-stabilized apartments alongside luxury units that go for thousands of dollars more a month. Other building have installed so-called 'poor doors' for use by rent-stabilized tenants while full-rent residents get to use the front door. DNAInfo New York obtained pictures of the sign posted by property managers that warned only certain residents of the building were allowed access to the gym. The Human Rights Commission said in a notice filed Thursday that there's enough evidence of age discrimination to merit a hearing on the Stonehenge Village complex's fitness room. The rent-regulated tenants excluded from the gym are largely over 65, while market-rate tenants aren't, according to a complaint last year from tenants' association president Jean Green Dorsey. Scroll down for video . Jean Green Dorsey says the refusal of landlords to let rent-stabilized tenants use the new gym facility in the building 'smacks of second-class citizenship . The gym that property managers opened in Stonehenge Village last year was closed off to anyone who lived in rent-stabilized apartments . The gym, pictured here in a photo obtained by DNAInfo New York, was meant as a perk to lure full-price-paying tenants, who shell out $3,500-a-month for a one bedroom . Dorsey said being barred from using the exercise room smacked of second-class citizenship for the rent-stabilized tenants who occupy about 60 percent of the more than 400 apartments in the complex on Manhattan's Upper West Side. She said Friday she was hopeful the landlord would now let rent-stabilized tenants pay a reasonable fee to use the gym and have it continue to be free for their higher-rent neighbors. Dorsey said tenants previously offered to do that but were rebuffed, spurring her complaint. 'You really shouldn't have to do all this to live a happy life,' said Green Dorsey, 75, who has lived in the building since 1972. Market-rate apartments go for $3,500 a month for one-bedroom units, which advertise granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances and close proximity to Whole Foods. The landlord, Stonehenge Partners Inc., had no immediate comment Friday. Stonehenge Partners has said the gym was built last winter to entice market-rate tenants. 'Any impact on rent-regulated tenants arises out of their length of tenancy in the building,' not their age, 'and involves that person's choice to remain in a rent-regulated unit at lower rent,' the landlord's lawyer, Jerrold Goldberg, wrote in a filing last year. The building advertises one-bedroom apartments for $3,500 a month that feature granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances . While city law prohibits discrimination based on age, it's silent on the subject of rent-regulation status. Stabilized tenants get valuable benefits of their own, like lower rent, Goldberg noted. The building's courtyard, laundry room and some other amenities are open to all residents, he added. Stonehenge Village is among several New York buildings that have spurred an outcry over separate entrances for lower-paying residents - dubbed 'poor doors' - or playrooms, roof decks and other amenities reserved for market-rate renters. Galled by seeing such arrangements in developments that often enjoy tax and zoning breaks for including affordable housing, some officials have sought to require more equal treatment. Just this week, City Councilman Corey Johnson proposed to require buildings to let affordable housing tenants use amenities. Public Advocate Letitia James and several council members, including Johnson, supported Dorsey's complaint. James said Friday she was heartened by the rights commission's finding. 'This will send a clear message: This is really just unacceptable,' she said by phone. 'When you stigmatize individuals based their status as rent-regulated tenants, it was just inherently wrong and inconsistent with the general principles that we all hold dear.' Developers say the arrangements reflect business considerations, not prejudice, and ultimately contribute to more economically integrated environments. Attracting higher-paying residents with amenities helps make it feasible to incorporate affordable housing in highly desirable areas, according to developers. Green Dorsey, meanwhile, says she's eager to get into the gym.","Ruling by the New York City Human Rights Commission is a blow for Stonehenge Village on Manhattan's Upper West Side .

"A cross-dressing Japanese  television star's robotic clone has made its 'unnervingly real' on-screen debut - the first android to host its own show. Japanese engineers, who are trying to replace celebrities with human-like androids, have pushed the clone of transvestite entertainer Matsuko Deluxe into the limelight. The late-night television personality shared the stage with his 'Matsukoroid' doppelganger for the first time on Saturday night. Scroll down for video . Uncanny: The real Matsuko Deluxe (left) comes face-to-face with his android doppelganger Matsukoriod (right) 'Unnervingly real': Transvestite TV star Matsuko Deluxe (left) shared the stage with his 'Matsukoroid' doppelganger (right) on Saturday . Fake: Mr Matsuko's robotic clone make is debut at the weekend and has been described as 'unnervingly real' 'It’s unnervingly real,' said one commentator of the programme Matsuko Matsuko, which premiered at the weekend. Mr Deluxe, who is popular in Japan for his frankness, said it was 'fascinating' come face-to-face with his lookalike. 'I see myself as other people see me for the first time, and it was a significant moment,' he added. Working with world-famous roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro, Japan’s top advertising agency, Dentsu dreamed up the idea to clone an exact android copy of the rotund entertainer. A spokesman for the agency said: 'Artists and entertainers themselves aren’t yet seen as content that can be combined with technology, but the Dentsu group believes the need to develop android entertainers will grow.' Performing with natural movements, while voiced and controlled remotely by a voice impersonator, the robot was put through its paces in front of an incredulous audience for the first time on Nippon TV. For now, the  Matsukoroid robot is controlled by an human operator. But with 600 stock 'Deluxe' phases it can use in reply to voice and face recognition, it's hoped the Matsukoroid will be free of its operator by the end of the series as it learns on the job. Ishiguro’s science lab used the latest  silicon skin and state-of-the-art electronic actuators to achieve a lifelike look. Creating the android: Matsukoroid robot was developed at a cost of around £55,931 by the Japanese labs . Finishing touches: Japan’s top make-up artist was brought in to apply the finishing touches to  Matsukoroid . Japan’s top make-up artist was brought in to finish the job of making the bot glamorous. Observers said the effect was realistic enough to go beyond the creepy. Mr Ishiguro said: 'Because of advances in robotics, difficulty in telling man and machine apart could soon become reality.' Pepper is the first humanoid robot designed to live with humans . Looking slightly put out by his new, unpaid rival, the star - one of Japan's most overworked entertainers - said he was looking forward to 'using the robot to take a few well deserved days off'. Despite the jokes, the android could be part of trend that has a more sober side. According to research company Gartner, one in three jobs will be replaced by some kind of software, robot or smart machine by 2025. Matsukoroid was developed at a cost of around £55,931 by the Japanese labs that already produced an autonomous experimental news-reader. The theory goes that as robots start to look more human, people will become more sympathetic towards them. But with many Japanese already predisposed to being sympathetic to robots, because of the friendly way they are portrayed in Japanese popular culture, Mr Deluxe said he noticed his fans were more inclined to approach his clone rather than himself. During the recording of Matsuko Matsuko, one young fan even declared his love for Mr Deluxe through the robot and planted a kiss on the bot's thin, lipsticked-mouth during Saturday’s programme. Yuya Furukawa, the creative genius behind a raft of entertainment robots including the remarkable Pepper, wants to spearhead a robotics revolution for the consumer, where entertainment robots are just the start. Mr Deluxe, who is popular in Japan for his frankness, said: 'I see myself as other people see me for the first time, and it was a significant moment' Ishiguro’s science lab used the latest silicon skin and state-of-the-art electronic actuators to achieve a lifelike look . Collaboration: World-famous roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro (left), worked with Japan’s top advertising agency, Dentsu . The advertising company recently launched the Dentsu Robot Promotion Centre to tackle the new business which it says will be a 'new industrial revolution, second only to the internet'. Currently, the domestic robot market is worth about 900 billion yen (about £5billion) according to Japan’s trade ministry, which forecasts a 10-fold increase  by 2035. Dentsu also helped develop the first robot in space Kirobo – a 13-inch tall humanoid robot - which it plans to adapt as another personal entertainment drone. It was announced earlier this year that from this summer, the world’s first hotel staffed by robots will be opened in Japan. Chillingly life-like robots are causing a storm in Japan – where their creators are about to launch them as actresses, full-size mechanical copies for pop idol fans, and clones of the dearly departed. There is even talk that the naturalistic, even engaging she-droids may be taken up as men as partners in the not-too-distant future. Android Asuna was a star attraction at Tokyo Designers’ Week showcase last year and she is one of a series of geminoids, as their inventor dubs them, that are ripe for commercialisation says their creator - robotics professor Hiroshi Ishiguro. Chillingly life-like robots are causing a storm in Japan – where their creators are about to launch them as actresses and full-size mechanical copies for pop idol fans . Android Asuna was a star attraction at Tokyo Designers’ Week showcase last year. She relies on a camera rigged behind her that is relayed to a remote human controller to give her life . Asuna is so convincing that many bowed respectfully before requesting politely to take her photo or join a selfie. Unable, for now, to use some of the advanced artificial intelligence (AI), face and voice recognition systems that some Japanese robots coming on the market now use, Asuna relies on a camera rigged behind her that is relayed to a remote human controller to give her life. This so-called tele-presence enables Asuna to come alive, taking on the operator’s personality. A fully independent version of the geminoid is expected in 10 years using all the above technologies to make her virtually indistinguishable from humans says Takeshi Mita, CEO of A-Lab in Tokyo, the company working with Prof. Ishiguro to make Asuna and her kind commercial. Previous attempts by Prof. Ishiguro's team had been dismissed as unconvincing and prone to what is known as the 'Uncanny Valley syndrome'. This is a term coined by another Japanese professor of robotics, Masahiro Mori. It describes the response of revulsion and creepiness when faced with something that looks almost, but somehow not quite, human. As robots become as dexterous as Asuna at mimicking humanity, so the theory goes, the syndrome will erase itself. 'Androids for the sex industry are a definite possibly' Already Asuna and other androids from A-lab have had a taste of the limelight, appearing on stage and voicing actors lines using tele-presence. A-lab also hopes to tap into another big business in Japan - the popularity of fantasy figurines that appeal to Japan’s legions of nerdy men or 'otaku'. As A-lab is working with highly respected Prof. Ishiguro, Mr Mita says the company has ruled out producing androids that might be used for sex. But a spokesman working with Ishiguro’s lab says it is not a great leap of imagination to think similar robots, given the advancement in robotics and silicone skin technology, will be used for sex. 'Physical relations will be possible in general with such androids,' said Takahashi Komiyama. 'Androids for the sex industry are a definite possibly. Some have even fallen in love with Ishiguro’s geminoids. So we can't rule those relationships out.'","Robotic clone of cross-dressing Japanese TV star made on-screen debut .

"Radar images from Europe's Sentinel-1a satellite have revealed the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake in unrivalled detail. The information from the satellites has been transformed into an interferogram, which provides a colourful and highly detailed view of the Earth's land mass. By comparing before and after images, scientists have discovered Mount Everest shrank by about one inch due to the land that was shaken in the natural disaster. The tallest point in the world, however, still stands at 29,029 feet, according to The Weather Channel. Additionally, an area 75 miles (120km) by 30 miles (50km) has lifted up 3.2ft (1 metre) from the ground around the capital, Kathmandu. Interferogram over Kathmandu, Nepal, generated from two Sentinel-1A scans on 17 and 29 April 2015 – before and after the 25 April earthquake. Each ‘fringe’ of colour represents about 3cm of deformation. The large amount of fringes indicates a large deformation pattern of 3.2ft (1 metre) from the ground around Kathmandu . Scene: A rescue chopper prepares to land, evacuating climbers from higher camps to Everest Base Camp, Nepal. New radar images have shown that Mount Everest shrank one inch following the Nepal earthquake this week . These are the first radar images to reveal the destruction caused by the 7-magnitude earthquake that killed 5,000 people and affected millions more. 'There's a peak of slip just to the northeast of Kathmandu,' Professor Tim Wright from the Natural Environment Research Council told the BBC. He explained that what scientists count are the coloured 'fringes' in the interferogram, of which there are about 34 from this quake. This translates to more than 3.2ft (1 metre) of uplift. To the north of Kathmandu, the interferogram suggests that the ground receded, and it also shows how a fault ruptured east from the epicentre, but did not break the surface. Combining two Sentinel-1A radar scans from 17 and 29 April 2015, this interferogram shows changes on the ground that occurred during the 25 April earthquake that struck Nepal. An overall area of 120x100 km has moved – half of that uplifted and the other half, north of Kathmandu subsided. Vertical accuracy is a few centimetres . Sentinel-1A interferogram over Kathmandu, Nepal, showing deformation induced by the 25 April 2015 earthquake. East–west ‘fringes’ cross the city, with each coloured fringe corresponding to 2.8 cm of ground displacement (both uplift and subsidence). The interferogram combines two Sentinel-1A images from 17 and 29 April 2015 . Launch: 3 April 2014  French Guiana . Life: Minimum of seven years . Mass: 2300 kg (5070 lbs) Dimensions: 9.2ft (2.8m) long, 8.2ft (2.5m) wide, 13ft (4m) high . Mission: Monitoring sea ice, oil spills, winds and waves, land-use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes . How it works: Radar works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back. The satellite uses a technique called 'Synthetic aperture radar interferometry'. Two or more satellite radar images of the same area are combined to detect large-scale changes. Small changes on the ground modify the reflected radar signal and lead to rainbow-coloured fringes in the 'interferogram'. Professor Wright says this suggests not all the strain in the rocks before the earthquake was released in during the catastrophic event. Sentinel-1A's swath width of 155 miles (250km) over land surfaces has allowed for an unprecedented area size to be analysed from a single scan. Scientists say the entire area will be covered under the same geometry every 12 days, allowing for the wider region to be regularly monitored for changes in the land. Its ability to 'see' through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring earthquakes and for offering images for emergency response. This is because it uses radar which works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back. Radio waves travel through air virtually unimpeded, but materials like metal, rock and water act almost as mirrors which can help reveal those areas inundated by floods. It also makes no different to radar if the Earth is in darkness. Sentinel-1A is the first satellite for the Copernicus environment-monitoring programme led by the European Commission. The Copernicus EMS was activated on the day the earthquake struck, prompting Esa to begin collecting satellite imagery, which is being made available to support relief efforts. In parallel, the International Charter Space and Major Disasters was activated by India, China and the UN. Meanwhile, Nasa has posted its own images of the earthquake providing much less detail due to cloud cover. 'While we regularly post imagery of natural hazards, the weather and the satellites haven't cooperated in this case,' the space agency wrote in a blog. 'The orbital track of the satellites and the specific capabilities of the sensors on board determine whether we have imagery to share. In the case of Nepal, things haven't lined up in our favour.' The satellite imagery is used to create maps to support relief efforts, such as this ‘grading map’ of Kathmandu showing topographic features and crisis information. The red squares show road blockss, the green people markers show crowds, red dots are areas that are destroyed and yellow dots are areas that are possibly affected. The yellow lines mark out primary roads in the area . Sentinel-1 carries a radar that works in several specialised modes to provide detailed imagery (artist's impression left). The data will be used for applications such as monitoring the oceans, including shipping lanes, sea ice and oil spills. It also provides data to map changing land cover and deformations such as those produced by Saturday's devastating Earthquake in Nepal (right) Mount Everest before and after the earthquake. Not much change is visible because of a fresh coat of snow and cloud cover. The April 23 image was acquired by the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 .

"Turkey has lifted a block on social media sites in the country after Twitter, Facebook and YouTube agreed to remove chilling images of a prosecutor being held at gunpoint by left wing extremists. A Turkish court imposed the blocks yesterday because photographs of the deadly siege in which Mehmet Selim Kiraz was killed were being widely shared on social media. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when two members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage - uploading the photographs of Kiraz with a gun pointed at his head to social media in the process. Turkey initially demanded domestic newspapers stop running the 'terrorist propaganda' images, before going on to block access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube yesterday when requests to remove the photographs were ignored. Scroll down for video . Chilling: Mehmet Selim Kiraz died after two members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed a courthouse in Istanbul and took him hostage - uploading these photographs of Kiraz with a gun pointed at his head to social media in the process . Shocking: A Turkish court had imposed the blocks because photographs of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz. Access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube was re-established after the social media sites agreed to remove photographs of the deadly siege, which Turkey has branded 'anti-government propaganda'. However Turkey has since threatened to block access to Google unless images of the siege are removed from its search function. The journalists group, Turkish Press Council, said that while it understood the authorities concerns over the publication of the prosecutors' photographs, it said banning social media websites was in conflict with democracy. 'It is meaningless to totally shut down social platforms - which contain billions of useful information - to the use of the Turkish people because of some unsuitable content,' the group said. Users meanwhile were sharing information on how to get around the ban on the Internet. Kiraz and both of his captors were killed when Turkish security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. A British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath [of the prosecutor's . killing] is as grim as the incident itself. 'The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image . not be used anywhere in electronic platforms... The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply . upset. The images are everywhere.' After the block was lifted journalism group Turkish Press Council said that while it understands the authorities concerns over the publication of the prosecutors' photographs, banning social media sites is in conflict with democracy. 'It is meaningless to totally shut down social platforms - which contain billions of useful information -- to the use of the Turkish people because of some unsuitable content,' the group said. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death . Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Last year, Turkey blocked access to YouTube and Twitter after audio recordings of a secret security meeting or tapes suggesting corruption by government officials were leaked on the social media sites. Turkey's highest court, however, overturned the bans, deeming them to be unconstitutional. Previous moves by Turkish authorities to block the social media networks have provoked widespread criticism by Western governments and human rights organizations. Many tech-savvy users, including former President Abdullah Gul, had found ways to circumvent the bans both on Twitter and YouTube while they were in place.","Court imposed social media blocks after images of siege were shared .

"Labour will ban bosses employing regular staff on zero-hours contracts for any longer than 12 weeks. Ed Miliband said it was 'not good enough' for millions of workers not to know how many hours they would be working from one week to the next. He said a Labour government would give workers the right to demand a 'regular contract if they do regular hours' after three months. Scroll down for video . Labour party leader Ed Miliband announced the zero-hours contract ban to workers at David Brown Gear Systems in Huddersfield this morning . Mr Miliband said it was 'not good enough' for millions of workers not to know how many hours they would be working from one week to the next . Mr Miliband's announcement comes after David Cameron struggled to say if he could live on a zero-hours contract after being grilled by Jeremy Paxman last week. In an interview with BBC Breakfast this morning, Mr Miliband said: 'If it's not good enough for us, I don't think it is good enough for the people of Britain, and that's why we have got to make this change.' Mr Miliband said there had been an 'epidemic' of zero-hours contracts under the Coalition and dismissed fears scrapping them could force companies to lay off staff. It is estimated there are now 1.8million contracts in the UK that do not guarantee any hours – with as many as one in seven jobs now zero-hours. ONS data shows that 58 per cent of people on zero-hours contracts have been with their current employer for over a year, and that workers on the contracts work 23 hours a week on average. Mr Miliband said workers should be given the right after 12 weeks  to demand 'a regular contract if they do regular hours'. He said: 'I think it goes right to the heart of the election campaign. I don't believe we can build a successful country when working people are facing that kind of insecurity. 'There is an issue about the number of hours, but there is also an issue about the unpredictability of the hours. That's the insecurity people face.' The Labour Party leader  arrived in Yorkshire this morning for a question and answer session with workers on the second full-day of the campaign . He said most businesses did not use zero-hours contracts, but added: 'The trouble is for some businesses this has become the primary way that they employ people and I don't think it's the right way forward for our country. 'Zero hour contracts are just one example of the insecurity of our economy and what has happened over the last five years. David Cameron says it has all been a great success – I'll let the British people be the judge of that.' The Tories have already announced that it would ban exclusivity clauses which stop staff on zero-hours contracts from working for other companies. Under Labour's plan, workers will also be entitled to compensation if shifts are cancelled at short notice. The proposal goes well beyond the recommendations made by the former Morrisons exec Norman Pickavance in an independent review for Labour. He said workers should have a right to request a regular contract after six months' continuous employment and to be given one after 12 months. Critics have warned that company bosses could dismiss staff just before the right to a full contract kicks in. It also risks undermining Britain's flexible labour market which economists claim is behind the recent jobs boom. Jeremy Paxman grilled David Cameron over the number of zero-hours contracts in the UK workforce . But Mr Miliband told Labour activists later today: 'The problem of zero-hours contracts is at the heart of the key question in this election: who does our country work for? 'Does it work just for the rich and the powerful? Or does it work for working people – the people looking for a job, trying to find enough money to support a family, to make ends meet?' Christian May, of the Institute of Directors said zero-hours contracts were used by just '2 per cent of workers' which he said could 'hardly be described as an epidemic'. He added: 'Nobody supports the misuse of these contracts, but demonising and ultimately outlawing them will simply risk jobs and undermine a labour market that has made us the envy of Europe.' John Cridland, CBI director-general, added: 'The UK's flexible jobs market has given us an employment rate that is the envy of other countries, so proposals to limit flexible contracts to 12 weeks are wide of the mark. 'Of course action should be taken to tackle abuses, but demonising flexible contracts is playing with the jobs that many firms and many workers value and need. 'These proposals run the risk of a return to day-to-day hiring in parts of the economy, with lower stability for workers and fewer opportunities for people to break out of low pay.' But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said 'We need a fairer system that guarantees zero-hours workers decent rights at work and stops them from being treated like second-class employees.'","Labour leader said it's 'not good enough' for staff not to have regular pay .

"Winning your flutter in this week's Grand National all depends on a string of superstitions and rituals, a survey has revealed. And research shows that if your tip is seventh down the list or the jockey's racing colours are Royal blue, emerald green or red, then you're more likely to return to the bookies and collect a few bob.

Out of 2,000 Britons who confirmed they would be having a bet, 40 per cent of them admitted their selection would be purely down to the name of the horse because it would have struck a chord.

Others revealed they sit in the same chair and have exactly the same food and drink during the race every time – and even wear the same 'lucky' clothes!

"The family of a former art teacher who died from lung cancer after years of pinning pupils' work to classroom walls lined with asbestos has taken legal action against the local council. Jennifer Barnett worked Archway School in Stroud, Gloucestershire, between 1980 and 1997, when she left teaching to have her fourth child. The 60-year-old died last September, 14 months after she was diagnosed with mesothelioma - a cancer whose most common cause is asbestos. Loved: Jennifer Barnett worked Archway School in Stroud, Gloucestershire, between 1980 and 1997, when she left teaching to have her fourth child. Above, the mother-of-four with her husband and children . Her husband, Nigel, told an inquest into her death in January that his wife had to cut sheets of asbestos while working on a farm in her 20s. 'She then became an art teacher and from 1977 until 1995 worked at various schools, often hanging paintings on walls containing asbestos,' he added. The coroner, Katy Skerrett, recorded a verdict of death as a result of industrial disease. A post-mortem found a large tumour in her right lung. Ms Skerrett said: 'It is clear that there was sufficient exposure to asbestos in her occupation for me to reach a conclusion that this lady died from an industrial disease.' Mr Barnett and his family believe the asbestos in the school is to blame for Mrs Barnett's death and are now taking legal action against Gloucestershire County Council. In a statement released this week, Mr Barnett said that during her time as a teacher, his wife also did clay modelling with pupils and the cupboard where the clay was stored also contained asbestos. He said: 'Jen was a fantastic wife and a wonderful mother to our four children. She was so precious to us and it is hard to believe she's gone. 'Prior to her illness, she was a very fit and healthy 60-year old who enjoyed playing tennis in her spare time and was a dedicated and extremely talented artist who continued to work right up until her death. 'Our youngest daughter was only 18 when her mum passed away and was just about to start university. 'The whole family misses her dreadfully and we are all shocked and devastated that her life was cut short so suddenly.' Mrs Barnett worked at Archway School, where she was known as Miss Shonk, as an art teacher before being promoted head of the department. She left teaching aged 42 to have her youngest daughter, but continued to work as an artist. Her family said she remained positive during 'gruelling' chemotherapy treatment, but died the day after celebrating her 30th wedding anniversary, in September 2014. Dedicated: For 17 years, Mrs Barnett worked at Archway School, in Stroud, Gloucestershire, pictured, where she was known as Miss Shonk, as an art teacher before being promoted head of the department . Mr Barnett said: 'I'll never forget the consultant at the hospital asking Jen if she'd ever been exposed to asbestos and her saying a definite ""yes"" because she knew a lot of asbestos was previously used in school buildings. 'Jen fought the cancer bravely and remained positive throughout gruelling sessions of chemotherapy. 'The day before she died, she even managed to come to the little village church where we were married to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and we had a very special day together as a family. 'Photographs taken that day show her smiling and we will always treasure them.' Mr Barnett, from Painswick, Gloucestershire, has instructed specialist asbestos disease lawyers at Novum Law to investigate his wife's working conditions at the school. He added: 'I am hoping former teachers or ex-pupils will come forward who may have some knowledge about the asbestos ceiling tiles at Archway School or know of any other asbestos products or materials that were used there.' Helen Grady, an asbestos disease solicitor at Novum Law said: 'It is alarming that we are seeing more and more cases involving teachers. 'Asbestos was widely used in the UK as a building material for fireproofing and insulation from the 1950s up until 1985, when most types were banned. 'It was banned completely from new buildings in 1999 but, sadly the damage had already been done for thousands of victims who have paid the ultimate price for going to work every day. 'We hope anyone who may have attended Archway or worked there remembers Jen and can shed more light on how she got exposed.' Archway headteacher Colin Belford said staff were saddened by their former colleague's death, and were not aware of the issues raised by the coroner. He said: 'Staff who worked with her at Archway spoke of her with great affection and admiration. 'I can say that all of the building work which has taken place at Archway in recent years is fully compliant with modern building regulations. 'I am not aware of any current risk to staff or students but will ask the local authority for its assurance on this matter.' Phil Ashbee-Dobbins, Gloucestershire County Council asbestos administration officer, said: 'Buildings built in the 1960s and 1970s, and even up until the late 90s often have asbestos in them. 'It doesn't pose a risk unless it is disturbed, and we help schools under local authority control keep their own accurate records and to make sure it is treated properly and safely. 'Archway School has been extensively renovated in recent years. In addition, regular asbestos audits are completed as part of standard health and safety procedures. 'While we are unable to comment on this specific case, we would like to reassure parents, pupils and teachers that current guidance and practices in our county's schools appropriately manage the risks associated with asbestos.'","Jennifer Barnett worked at Archway School in Gloucestershire for 17 years .

"Avril Lavigne has revealed she has Lyme disease. In an interview with People Magazine, the 30-year-old explained the debilitating bacterial infection is the reason behind her months-long absence from the public eye. The singer has no idea where she got the tick bite that infected her. Scroll down for video . Struggling: Avril Lavigne has revealed she has Lyme disease. She is pictured here at her 30th birthday party in Las Vegas when she was fully suffering the effects . 'I had no idea a bug bite could do this,' she said. 'I was bedridden for five months. 'I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk and I couldn't move. I thought I was dying. 'I had complete weakness and fatigue. One night I tried to brush my teeth on the tour bus and couldn't even stand.' 'There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand,' she continued. 'It felt like having all your life sucked out of you.' Symptoms of the disease range from headaches and joint pain to severe fatigue, heart palpitations, paralysis of the face and even dementia. If not caught and treated early enough with antibiotics the condition can persist for years. Sick: The singer, seen her performing at Planet Hollywood in May, told People Magazine she had no idea where she got the tick bite that infected her . The disease was recently highlighted after Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster contracted it, who reveled she has lost the ability to read, write or even watch TV because of it. Incubation period from infection to onset of symptoms is typically two weeks, although it can be months or even years between the two, so it is impossible to say when the bites occur. Avril was between the Asian and South American world tour when she first developed symptoms . The musician thinks she may have been bitten last spring, and remembers first waking up on night in April drenched in sweat and feeling feverish. She assumed it was the flu, or even exhaustion and dehydration from touring, but when her symptoms persisted, some friends who were familiar with the disease suggested she might have it. However she said doctors were skeptical and didn't want to test her. After her last public appearance in September she tried to celebrate her 30th birthday in Las Vegas with friends, but she could not muster the energy. Awol: The Sk8er Boi singer said hubby, Nickleback frontman Chad Kroeger, helped take care of her while she was bedridden for five months . 'It was terrible, ""I could barely eat, and when we went to the pool, I had to leave and go lie in bed,' she said. 'My friends asked, ""What's wrong?"" I didn't know.' It was only several months later of, after a number of emergency room visits that a specialist finally diagnosed her. Since October the popstar holed herself up in her Ontario home while she recovers, aided by her mom who came to stay with her, while husband, Nickleback frontman Chad Kroeger took as many breaks as he could from his world tour to be with her. She says support from her fans through social media helped immensely, and she now feels around 80 per cent recovered. She now wanst to raise more awareness about the disease. Around 65,000 people in Europe are infected every year, and 25,000 Americans were diagnosed in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The tick normally has to be attached to the host for 36 hours to transfer the infection. Ill: Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster also suffers from the disease .

"Violent spectators might not be the only ones to face strict disciplining after Friday night's NRL match, as NRL head's reveal players could also face sanctions for their unacceptable behaviour on the field. Canterbury forwards James Graham and David Klemmer could face point penalties or a temporary game ban for their arguments with a referee during the Good Friday showdown between South Sydney and Canterbury at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney. NRL head of football Todd Greenberg revealed that the match review committee would 'look very closely at' their behaviour, noting that contrary conduct and detrimental conduct requirements will 'form part of the review'. Scroll down for video . David Klemmer and James Graham could face demerit point penalties or a temporary game ban after their argument with referee Gerard Sutton who awarded the Rabbitohs a late penalty at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney on Friday . Klemmer  reacts after being sent to the sin bin for dissent after yelling 'you're off your f****ing face,' at the lead referee . The NRL Judiciary Code of Procedure states that Contrary Conduct refers to 'the misconduct on the part of a Player constituted by behaving in a way that is contrary to the true spirit of the Game' while Detrimental Conduct means 'misconduct on the part of a Player constituted by behaving in a manner which is detrimental to the interests, welfare or image of the NRL'. Both Canterbury forwards could have these charges referred straight to the NRL judiciary, with the highest contrary conduct charge, a grade five, carrying a 525-demerit point penalty and a five-game ban. Graham's charges would relate to his argument with referee Gerard Sutton when he awarded Souths a penalty, after the Bulldogs captain's controversial tackle on Adam Reynolds. Klemmer meanwhile was sin-binned after crowding in on Sutton alongside Graham and yelling 'You're off your f****ing face,' at the lead referee. NRL head of football Todd Greenberg revealed that the match review committee would 'look very closely at' their behaviour, noting that contrary conduct and detrimental conduct requirements will 'form part of the review' 'I don't want to talk specifically about the incidents because they will form part of our match committee review but, in general terms, the behaviour of players on the field is something we will look very closely at,' Greenberg said on Saturday on Triple M. 'Swearing at match officials is not acceptable and I put a full stop on that sentence, because it is really not acceptable. 'I know our match review (committee) will look closely at those incidents. 'There are requirements under the code, things like contrary conduct and detrimental conduct which will all form part of that review and, if there are penalties that need to be imposed, I expect the match review (committee) will discharge their duties accordingly.' It comes as the NRL announced they are determined to come down hard on a worrying trend of increasing dissent towards match officials after a violent end to Friday's game when spectators threw bottles at match officials . The NRL match review committee will be headed up by Michael Buettner along with Brad Clyde, Michael Hodgson and Peter Louis. The NRL introduced new measures last season as to how and when captains could talk to referees. Former Bulldogs chief executive Greenberg again indicated that these would be monitored closely. 'James is the captain so he has the right to talk to him (Sutton) at certain parts during the game, but there were episodes in last night's game that caused me some concern,' Greenberg said. 'And that will form part of the review but it goes to a broader point - match officials need to be held with a much greater level of respect within the game.' Bulldogs CEO Raelene Castle checks on the NRL interchange official who was injured at the end of game. Darren Alchin was taken to hospital with a broken shoulder blade after slipping over in an attempt to avoid a bottle thrown from the stands . Bulldogs fans react towards the match officials at full time  at ANZ Stadium on Friday night in Sydney . Bulldogs fullback Brett Morris will also come under scrutiny from the match review committee after being placed on report for appearing to kick Souths hooker Issac Luke in the head as he scored a try just before halftime at ANZ Stadium. It comes as the NRL announced they are determined to come down hard on a worrying trend of increasing dissent towards match officials after a violent end to Friday's game when spectators threw bottles at the referees. 'The behaviour of players on the field is something we will look very closely at,' Greenberg said on Saturday . Officials had to run from the field for cover and sideline interchange official Darren Alchin was later taken to hospital with a broken shoulder blade after slipping over in an attempt to avoid a bottle thrown from the stands. A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that two people had been identified and their details taken down over the incident, however no charges have been laid. Officers are continuing with their inquiries and are yet to identify how many people were involved in incident. Those found responsible are facing a life time ban from the NRL. Two other men were charged with assault in unrelated incidents following the game, including a 22-year-old male who pushed a young relative to the ground, causing him to hit his face. 'The boy received minor facial injuries and did not require medical treatment. The relative was charged with common assault (domestic related) and given strict bail conditions to appear at Burwood Local Court,' a police statement read. A 38-year-old man was also charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm after knocking down a 21-year-old man outside the stadium. The injured man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital by paramedics where he was treated for a cut above his eye and his aggressor will appear at Burwood Local Court in April.","NRL head of football Todd Greenberg said the match review committee would 'look very closely at' the Canterbury forwards' behaviour .

Oscar Hübinette shredded through the snow on the Tolbachik volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia while his friend Fredrik Schenholm photographed his exploits.

Adventure photographer Fredrik Schenholm looked on in amazement as Oscar Hübinette flew down the icy slopes, while lava from the 12,000 foot tall volcano bubbled furiously behind him . Fredrik said: 'It was mindblowing to see the snow mix with the lava. 'The heat and cold at the same time was incredible. 'The air temperature was around -25C (-13F) and the lava temperature would have been more than 1,000C (1832F). 'Seeing the contrast of the black and red lava to the white snow was like gold to my eyes, and to my camera.'

After lying dormant since 1976 the volcano suddenly erupted in November 2012. During the eruption, which lasted more than six months, it regularly emits jets of burning hot lava up to 656 feet (200m) high.

The Kamchatka Peninsula is a 780 mile (1,250km) long peninsula in the Russian Far East. Tolbachik is one of 160 volcanoes on the island, 29 of which are still active . Fredrik added: 'The volcano was very active until the summer of last year. 'It is still active. At this time no lava is coming out of it but that could change at any minute.' The photographer admitted he has been chasing shots of skiers on volcanoes for several years and said he was thrilled to finally capture the image to perfectly contrast the hot and cold conditions. He said: 'It was a bit unreal seeing Oscar skiing near the lava. 'I was chasing this image for around five years and have tried, unsuccessfully, at many active volcanoes in South America, North America, Europe and Asia - but things always stopped me. 'Bad weather often reduced the visibility, eruptions are obviously very unpredictable and skiers weren't always around. 'So to finally get the view of Oscar skiing in front of the eruption was a big deal for me - it really was beautiful. After lying dormant since 1976 the volcano suddenly erupted in November 2012, spewing lava down the mountainside . The air temperature surrounding the volcano was around -25C while the lava temperature would have been more than 1,000C . 'The first thing I did when I got the shot was to scream to Oscar 'We got it!'. 'After that I looked at the display more closely and saw that the composition was really good - Oscar made a really nice turn as I took the shot. 'The lava looked great from the volcano and I had the feeling of perfection which is always a good feeling.' Fredrik said he was fully aware of the dangers of taking such dramatic shots, especially when lava was still flowing from the volcano. 'Seeing the contrast of the black and red lava to the white snow was like gold to my eyes, and to my camera,' Fredrik said . He said: 'Oscar was very brave for doing this - it goes without saying that being on active volcanoes is incredibly dangerous. 'We did wake up one night when the lava flow changed direction and started to flow just 100m (109 yards) from our tent. 'Things can go wild any time, but Tolbachik was pretty much under control and we did feel safe.'","Images show Oscar Hübinette skiing on the Tolbachik volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia .

"It has long been considered the most expensive place in the UK to buy property, but it seems London is being pipped to the post by coastal Salcombe. According to data, analysed by Harbour Hotels, the average cost of property in London - a whopping £638,217 - actually falls below that of the Devon enclave. The seaside town in the South Hams district boasts a skyrocketing average property price: £671,759. According to new data, the average cost of property in Salcombe, Devon, now tops the average cost in London . This is more then the average cost of property in some of the UK's most expensive cities, including Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh. And for those who want a room with a water view, that will cost you even more. The average value of a waterfront property in Salcombe tops £2million, putting it ahead of some of London's priciest postcodes, including Notting Hill and Regent's Park. In the west London neighbourhood of Notting Hill, prices average £1,629,495, while Regent's Park comes in with an average property value of £1,338,467 and Hampstead Heath close behind at £1,270,274. In the pricey west London neighbourhood of Notting Hill, property prices average £1,629,465 . Regent's Park comes in with an average cost of £1,338,467 and Hampstead Heath (pictured) at £1,270,274 . In Salcombe, property facing the estuary cost as high as £2 million, with non-sea views tallying £671,759 . Salcombe made headlines last spring when it was named Britain's most expensive seaside resort. Since then, property prices have continued to soar, increasing ten per cent in the last 12 months alone, which puts Salcombe's property market on par with London's 11 per cent yearly increase. Nearby seaside competitors, like Sandbanks, Aldeburgh and Padstow, however, have seen a dip in prices of about eight per cent on average. Property prices in Salcombe have soared 10 per cent in the last 12 months, while Padstow has seen an 8 per cent decrease . To visit Salcombe - without parting with millions of pounds - the Salcombe Harbour Hotel has rooms from £425 . With summer quickly approaching, many UK travellers will holiday in Salcombe to soak up a bit of sun and the million pound view. In fact, the most recent assessment places a view of the Salcombe estuary as being worth £1.3 million, given the average property cost of over £600,000 and an average waterfront property price of £2million. Known as 'Chelsea-on-Sea,' the idyllic waterside community is a yachting and sailing paradise, and home to fresh seafood and many stunning beaches. For those who fancy a taste of the millionaire lifestyle - without the accompanying price tag - the Salcombe Harbour Hotel & Spa has waterfront rooms priced from £425 this summer season.","Average cost of property in London is now less than in Salcombe, Devon .

"Fed up with Facebook, or coming to realise, in the words of David Cameron, ‘too many tweets might make a t**t’? It may be time to consider a short, sharp trip to the suburbs of Beijing. Here, in a collection of drab, concrete buildings surrounding a large courtyard is a military-style bootcamp designed with one thing in mind: to treat victims of a very modern disease — a compulsive addiction to electronic gadgets. Formed in 2006, the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre (IATC) has so far welcomed 6,000 mostly young, mostly male patients — and claims to have ‘cured’ 75 per cent of them. Scroll down for video . Hooked up: With wires hanging from his head, a young boy undergoes electroencephalogram scans to measure brain activity. The centre believes internet addiction leads to brain problems similar to those from taking heroin . Online zombies: A line of dead-eyed Chinese youths play computer games at an internet cafe. The country's government said internet addiction affects 24 million of its 632 million internet users . Smart salute: At the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre, it’s time to put down that mouse, pull on a camouflage T-shirt and learn to click heels, not screen icons . The man behind the facility is Tao Ran, a doctor and colonel in the People’s Liberation Army, regarded as China’s leading expert in wangyin, or internet addiction, which is said by the country’s government to affect 24 million of its 632 million internet users. He describes wangyin as a form of mental illness, saying that 90 per cent of his patients are clinically depressed from a lack of normal social interaction. Many have back and eyesight problems due to spending up to 14 hours a day staring at screens, and a third suffer from eating disorders. ‘Internet addiction leads to problems in the brain similar to those derived from heroin consumption but, generally, it’s even more damaging,’ Mr Ran said recently. ‘It destroys relationships and deteriorates the body without the person knowing.’ To break it, Mr Ran confiscates all electronic devices from patients and forces them to follow a super-strict, military-style fitness regime, starting with parade drills at 6.30 each morning. They must also endure occasional spells in solitary confinement and take regular medication. Progress is monitored by psychiatric assessments and regular brain scans. Mr Ran only considers someone cured if, six months after their release, they use the internet for fewer than six hours per day. Some critics have called the techniques brutal. But they also yield results and there is high demand for places: the IATC, which charges £1,000 per month (more than twice the average Chinese urban worker’s wage) recently expanded, so it can treat 130 patients at any one time. Work that body: Military-style drills, exercises and weekly tai chi sessions help the young addicts to shed their indoor pallor . Open wide: A nurse checks that 14-year-old Yin Yu Tao has taken his medication — all part of the £1,000-a-month bootcamp . It isn’t alone: there are around 300 such clinics in China, due largely to an explosion in the popularity of online games such as World Of Warcraft. Many internet cafes have beds, so customers can sleep at their keyboards, and Shanghai recently passed a law forcing parents to stop minors ‘being overindulgent with online and electronic games’. Meanwhile in Japan, where Facebook and Twitter are national obsessions, there are dozens of so-called internet ‘fasting camps’. Taiwan is also facing up to internet addiction — in January, its government voted to fine parents who allow children to spend ‘excessive time using electronic products’.

"A father who is paralysed from the waist down has been told he can only have a disability grant to adapt his home if his wife gives up her job and goes on benefits. Mike Hand from Haydock in Merseyside became wheelchair bound after being diagnosed with a tumour on his spinal cord. The 39-year-old is almost ready to leave St Helen's Hospital after undergoing surgery and rehabilitation. Mike Hand pictured with his wife Kate, who has been told he can only have a disability grant to adapt his home if his wife gives up work . Mr Hand, left, has been left wheelchair bound after being diagnosed with a tumour on his spine. He now says he needs to make adaptations to his home in Haydock, Merseyside, right . But after he and his wife Kate, who have an eight-year-old daughter called Mia, tried to claim for financial support to adapt their semi-detached home as they have no bathroom downstairs, they were told they weren't eligible. The couple were told that because they don't claim any income support or benefits, they would have to earn 'virtually nothing' to receive the grant. Mrs Hand, a credit manager for a tool hire firm who earns between £25,000 and £35,000, said: 'It's crazy. I understand that benefits need to be means tested and I agree with that. 'But it's not as if we are after ongoing weekly benefits - just funding to help us create a safe and comfortable home for my husband, who has suffered massively through no fault of his own. Mr Hand and his wife were told that because they don't claim any income support or benefits, they would have to earn 'virtually nothing' to receive the grant . 'If I gave up work we could claim for everything and would be entitled to everything, but because I work and would like to continue to work, we get no help. 'We're having to rely on my salary alone to support two adults and a child. At the end of the month there's nothing left. 'It's a classic example of the system working against the worker. They're almost forcing us to stop working and claim off the state.' The couple are wanting to adapt their home to incorporate a downstairs bedroom and bathroom. But they say because they are unable to do this, it is placing a strain on the family. Mrs Hand added: 'We live in a normal semi-detached house. We don't have a bathroom or bedroom downstairs and my husband will be expected to spend all of his time in the family living room with very little dignity or privacy.' Mr Hand, a former construction worker, became wheelchair bound after doctors failed to spot a tumour in his spinal column, despite him regularly visiting his GP at Haydock Medical Centre complaining of pain. He was referred to hospital for a CAT scan when only an MRI scan would have picked up the growth, caused by a build up of spinal fluid, which stretched half the length of his spine. Eventually the tumour was detected after he was finally sent for an MRI scan in July 2014, when complaining that while running he felt as though he couldn't lift his feet off the ground. He then underwent a 10-hour operation to remove the tumour as surgeons described his diagnosis as a 'ticking time bomb'. But due to existing nerve damage and the trauma of the operation, he has been left paralysed from the waist down with doctors unable to say if he will ever walk again.

A St Helens Council spokesman said: 'The council is bound by government means test guidelines, which unfortunately put Mr and Mrs Hand's income above the threshold at which they would qualify for assistance. 'Having said that, we want to help - and are exploring other ways of supporting the family, including the possibility of direct payments to assist Mr Hand at home. 'We look forward to discussing these options with them.' Meanwhile a Haydock Medical Centre spokeswoman added: 'We would like to offer our sincere sympathies to the patient at this difficult time. 'It would be inappropriate for us to comment further due to patient confidentiality, however we want to assure patients that we always aim to provide the best possible care.'","Mark Hand, 39, was left wheelchair bound due to a tumour on his spine .

"An Arkansas woman who has become the world's oldest living person wants President Barack Obama to attend her 117th birthday party on the Fourth of July. At 116, Gertrude Weaver was already the oldest person in America. With the death of 117-year-old Misao Okawa in Japan on Wednesday, Weaver became the world's oldest person, according to the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group. Scroll down for video . Gertrude Weaver, 116, of Camden, Arkansas, attributes her longevity to treating others well and exercising three times a week in her wheelchair . The staff at the Silver Oaks Health and Rehabilitation Center in Camden, about 100 miles southwest of Little Rock, said Weaver is in good health. They say she attributes her longevity to treating others well. Weaver would like to meet the president at her birthday party because she has voted for him twice. 'I treat everyone the way I want to be treated,' Weaver told reporters on her 116th birthday when she received a letter from President Obama. Weaver, born on July 4, 1898, exercises in her wheelchair three times a week and eats three meals a day at the facility's dining room. The daughter of sharecroppers was born in Arkansas near the Texas border and worked as a domestic helper. Gertrude Weaver, right, of Camden, Arkansas, became the world's oldest person on Wednesday following the death of Japanese woman Misao Okawa who died at the age of 117 on Wednesday . After retiring, she lived with her granddaughter and moved to Silver Oaks Health & Rehabilitation Center in 2009 when her granddaughter had health problems, the facility's administrator Kathy Langley said. 'She's an absolutely amazing lady,' Langley said. Weaver's 93-year-old son visits on a regular basis. 'She said she has been blessed with a long and healthy life because of the way she has treated others,' Langley said. Misao Okawa, a Japanese woman recognized as the world's oldest person who credited her longevity to 'eating delicious things' and getting plenty of rest, died at the age of 117 on Wednesday, Japanese media reported. Okawa was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest person in June 2013 when Jiroemon Kimura, also from Japan, died at the age of 116 years and 54 days. Rosa Camfield died on Monday. The 101-year-old Arizona woman had recently become an internet celebrity after appearing in a photo tenderly holding her newborn great-granddaughter . Also this week an 101-year-old Arizona woman who'd only just recently become an internet celebrity after appearing in a photo tenderly holding her newborn great-granddaughter died. Rosa Camfield. who was born in June of 1913, died on Monday. Since appearing on the popular Facebook page Life of Dad, she's received millions of likes and comments from around the world. 'Grandma was always happy, I mean, she was smart as a whip, even at 101,' Camfield's granddaughter Sarah Hamm, 33, told ABC News on Tuesday. 'She was funny and had lots of stories.' Hamm originally posted the photo a week before her grandmother's death after taking her daughter, then 2-week-old Kaylee, to meet Camfield. 'It was actually the day she was being released in the hospital, so we were hoping that Grandma would get to meet her,' Hamm said.","Gertrude Weaver, 116, of Camden, Arkansas, became the world's oldest person on Wednesday following the death of a lady in Japan .

"When Melbourne mother-of-two, Kady Marsh, took her seven-week-old baby aside to breastfeed at a popular Sydney hotel, the last thing she expected was to be told  to put her breast away. It was a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Manly Wharf Hotel. Kady was in town for her best friend’s wedding and was enjoying a post-party lunch with friends and family. When she moved to a quiet corner of the hotel’s lounge area with baby Isla, she says she was confronted by hotel management and told she couldn’t breastfeed because the area was for ‘over 18s only.’ ‘A young manager came over, pointed to a sign above me and said: ""Can't you see it says over 18s only?""’ Kady told Daily Mail Australia. 'At first I thought he meant he wanted to see my ID - that he thought I wasn't 18 - then I realised he was referring to Isla.' Scroll down for video . Kady Marsh with husband Euan, baby Isla (pictured left) and her older daughter Ava enjoying lunch at a hotel in Melbourne . 'I said: ""Oh no, she’s only seven-weeks-old, she’s just a tiny baby, that's ridiculous."" ‘He said we couldn't be there and told me to use the disabled toilet if I wanted to breastfeed in the hotel.' Kady went back to where her friends were seated in the main bar, 'feeling a bit embarrassed'. 'I wasn't worried about breastfeeding in the main bar  - and I would have done - it's just that I physically couldn't manage it on the stools in there and I couldn't find anywhere else to sit,' Kady says. 'My husband Euan went to speak with management to ask what we were supposed to do, and it was then that we were told to use ""the baby room"" - a disabled toilet with a change table.' Kady  was asked to move from the lounge area of the hotel because it was an area restricted to over 18s . Justin Tynan, general manager and licencee of the Manly Wharf Hotel, says the particular area of the bar where Kady was breastfeeding is the only area that is restricted to adults, apart from the gaming room. He says his hotel welcomes women who want to breastfeed elsewhere in the venue and that the incident sounds like it was a miscommunication. ‘It’s ludicrous to suggest that we wouldn’t allow breastfeeding in the hotel,’ Mr Tynan told Daily Mail Australia, adding that his own wife regularly breastfeeds their four-month-old baby, Max, at the venue – and elsewhere in public, often. ‘We just wouldn’t have a policy like that,’ Mr Tynan said. ‘We’re a kid-friendly bar: We have children eating here seven days a week on a special kids menu, we have 30 high chairs and we have mother’s groups here every day.’ Ajita Tynan, wife of Justin Tynan, with their baby Max. Mr Tynan, General Manager of the Manly Wharf Hotel, says Ajita often breastfeeds their son at the venue and it's 'ludicrous' to suggest the hotel wouldn't allow women to do the same . In Australia, women have a right to breastfeed in public. Under the federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984 it's illegal to discriminate against a person or deny services, directly or indirectly, on the grounds of breastfeeding. ‘Breastfeeding mothers should feed their babies, in any way they feel comfortable and not feel any pressure to meet other people’s expectations of discretion,' says Jessica Leonard of the Australian Breastfeeding Association. 'For some mums this may mean breastfeeding in public in full view, for others it might mean covering up,' she says. ‘But being directed to a public toilet is really inappropriate. Any place a woman breastfeeds has to be somewhere that is also appropriate to prepare food. A toilet is not one of those places.’ Ms Leonard says it’s important to see mothers breastfeed their babies because it normalises what is a natural and healthy thing to do. ‘Mothers breastfeeding in public are helping the next generation of Australians to learn that breastfeeding is normal,’ she says. Her comments echo those of Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr recently on the 'breastfeeding in public' issue. ‘Everyone has a right to choose what they feel is best for their own baby and some people cannot breastfeed and/or do not want to,' Kerr said after posting a photo of herself breastfeeding her son Flynn to social media. 'But don't abandon breast feeding because of any ""social"" stigma (perceived or real) that might be attached to breastfeeding in public,' she said. ‘There are more breasts being shown on a daily basis around the world in swimwear and low-cut dresses than there are from breastfeeding mums.' ‘There are more breasts being shown on a daily basis around the world in swimwear and low-cut dresses than there are from breastfeeding mums,' Miranda Kerr said when she tweeted this photo of herself with baby Flynn . For Kady Marsh, the incident at the Wharf Hotel was just 'unnecessary'. 'There was only one other couple sitting on the lounge area, it really wasn't that busy,' she says. 'If they had just exercised some common sense, said something like: ""Look we know it's silly, do you mind if we just ask the other patrons if they mind, or we can find an alternative spot for you,"" it could have been solved.' 'Instead, I was made to feel like I was doing something wrong, that I was just another hormonal breast-feeding mother being difficult,’ Kady says. 'If I was a first-time breastfeeding mum, I would have been a lot more upset.' Kady was told by another employee of the hotel to move to some benches about a metre from the 'over 18's' lounge. Instead, she and her husband - who  ran their own bar in Melbourne for more than three years - ended up going to a different hotel nearby. Kady says they sat down at a table and fed Isla without a sideways glance in their direction. They then went back to their friends at the Wharf. ‘We’re a kid-friendly bar': The General Manager of the popular Manly Wharf Hotel, pictured, says the venue  welcomes women who want to breastfeed elsewhere in the hotel . Jessica Leonard from the Breastfeeding Association says stories like Kady’s of women being asked to ‘move on’ are uncommon. But they do still happen and can knock a women’s confidence. ‘We know that about 300,000 babies are born in Australia each year and that 96 per cent of those mothers start out breastfeeding, so, the number of complaints we hear are really a drop in the ocean,’ she says. ‘Sometimes the problem is just poor customer service, but really, it’s in the best interests of businesses to be supportive of women who breastfeed.’ The Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA) supports recommendations of the World Health Organisation to breastfeed for the first two years of a child’s life, with exclusive breastfeeding until a baby is six-months-old. ‘Breastfeeding is the best way to provide infants with the nutrients they need and it should be encouraged everywhere,’ Ms Leonard says. New mothers can find breastfeeding-friendly venues through the ABA's Breastfeeding Welcome Here directory.The Association also runs a free 24-hour breastfeeding helpline for mothers.","A woman was told by Sydney hotel she couldn't breastfeed in '18s only' area .

"When the first iPad launched on 3 April 2010, opinion was split on how popular the product would turn out to be, and whether the tablet market would grow. Now five years - and 225 million sales - later it might be natural to presume that those who doubted the device have been proved wrong. But amid falling sales and a new generation of alternative devices, some industry experts have predicted that the  iPad’s days are numbered. Scroll down for video . The first generation iPad was revealed by the late Steve Jobs in early 2010 (pictured), but at the time it was met with ridicule as experts struggled to see how it would prove popular. Five years and 225 million units later, it seems many critics have been proved wrong - for now . When Steve Jobs revealed the original iPad in California in early 2010, it was met with derision by many technology experts, who failed to see how such a product would prove popular. At the time, blogger MG Siegler from TechCrunch said: 'Is it a must-have? The quick and dirty answer is: for many people, right now, no. 'Unlike the iPhone, which filled an already well-established need, there is no existing need the iPad fills.' Rhi Morgan at T3 magazine agreed. He said: 'I can’t see anybody who needs a laptop buying an iPad, and I can’t see people using it as a smartphone either.' But opinion soon swung back in Apple’s favour. Within the first 24 hours of Apple's launch the company sold 300,000 units, and to date, nine incarnations of the iPad have gone on sale, with the Air 2 and Mini 3 being the most recent. 1st generation: 3 April 2010 . 2*: 11 March 2011 . 3rd generation: 16 March 2012 . 4th generation: 2 November 2012 . Mini 1st generation: 2 November 2012 . Air: 1 November 2013 . Mini 2: 12 November 2013 . Air 2: 22 October 2014 . Mini 3: 22 October 2014 . *Note: The iPad 2 was the only iPad that had a number after its name (aside from the Air and Mini). The iPad was soon heralded as being the perfect mid-way device between a phone and a laptop. Considering, at the time in 2010, smartphones were still by and large finding their feet, the iPad filled a gap in the market that many thought simply wasn’t there. The Horn, a technology blog for eCommerce site Gazelle, cited a number of areas that the iPad exceeded in. In education, the iPad found its place as tablets were preferred to textbooks. And, according to The Horn, it ‘altered (and possibly saved) the publishing industry, forcing magazines and newspapers to create tablet-ready versions for digitally savvy customers.’ While the iPad was by no means the first tablet on the market, it successfully grew the industry to such levels that, today, news readers or presenters are often seen clutching an iPad when talking on the TV, where once they would have used paper. Launches of Apple products are often greeted by swathes of adoring fans - and that was none more obvious than with the launch of the original iPad. Pictured is Robert Scoble picking up the inaugural iPad on 3 April 2010 in Palo Alto, California . How far we've come: On the left is the original iPad, launched in 2010, and on the right the iPad Air 2, launched on 22 October 2014 . The latest variant of the iPad, the iPad Air 2, is shown here being unveiled by CEO Tim Cook on 16 October 2014. In total nine different versions of the iPad have made it to market . Queues of people are seen here waiting outside the Apple store in Regent's Street, London after the release of the iPad 2 on 25 March 2011 . But it seems the tide may be turning for the iPad. According to CNN Money, sales for the iPad dropped 18 per cent in the final quarter of 2014 alone. And this year, it’s predicted that sales will fall by five per cent from last year - admittedly still at 60.1 million units - but the lowest level since 2012. Industry expert Giulio Montemagno, from SVP International, RetailMeNot, says that while tablets might have revolutionised some markets, it risks being lost in a sea of other products. ‘This year alone, shoppers are set to spend £6.32 billion [$9.37 billion] using tablet devices in the UK, up from £3.62 billion [$5.36 billion] 2014,’ he said. But he added: ‘We are seeing a strong shift from tablets to smartphones as the lines blur between smartphones, phablets, and tablets.’ Apple's iPad has widely been heralded as kickstarting the tablet industry, creating a huge new market between smartphones and laptops - and seeing many copycat devices made in the process . ‘There are still flashes of life in the iPad,’ Martyn Landi, Press Association Technology Correspondent, told MailOnline. ‘It’s still the fastest selling product in Apple history with more than a quarter of a billion sold in five years - and that's quite something up against the iPhone and iPod. ‘But sales are starting to decline as smartphones are getting bigger and rivals are getting better. ‘iPad numbers were always going to fall at some point because they had a huge market share to begin with - 75 per cent after the first year of iPad - and that was always unlikely to be sustainable once the competition got involved. ‘It's being squeezed from both sides by “phablets” like Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and even the iPhone 6 Plus, but also on the other side by hybrid laptops like the Surface Pro 3. ‘Times and trends change. Right now, it's all about larger screen smartphones and full metal bodies. Tablets are not top of the wanted list for consumers right now, but that doesn't mean they never will again.’ All is not well for the iPad. The rise of new devices like the Apple Watch (left) and larger smartphones like the iPhone 6 Plus (right) mean the place for the iPad in today's market is becoming less obvious . ‘To some extent it’s Apple’s own fault,’ said Phil Morris, Deputy Editor for iCreate Magazine. ‘With bigger screens on its iPhones, consumers aren’t using their iPads like they used to. ‘The new MacBook is going to dent the iPad even further - that machine is like a Mac with an iPad engine, a real sofa-surfers' device. ‘Apple won't let the iPad die though, so we fully expect an iPad Pro later this year’ On whether Apple might consider discontinuing the iPad, though, he said he ‘can’t ever see that happening.’ He added: ‘Sales won’t fall off that dramatically for the iPad to be discontinued.’ Apple store staff in central Sydney welcome the first shopper waiting in line, Alex Lee (centre) of Canada, the moment Apple's iPad 2 became available for direct purchase in Australia on 25 March 2011. Hundreds of customers lined up outside Apple stores for the launch - but will we see such numbers again? With the release of smartphones with larger screens like the iPhone 6 Plus, and other devices like the Apple Watch, the place for the iPad today is becoming less obvious. But, after all, that is what they said five years ago, as well. Will we be celebrating the 10 anniversary of the iPad in 2020, though, and looking back on another successful five years? At the moment, it looks pretty unlikely.","Apple's first generation iPad launched on 3 April 2010 .

"This is the shocking moment an unemployed scaffolder punched his unsuspecting former friend in the face so hard that he was left with a fractured skull and a bleed to the brain. Richard Hutchinson, 40, from Thornaby-on-Tees, North Yorkshire, has been jailed for two years for attacking his victim without warning after the pair fell out over a debt of £300. Teesside Crown Court heard that the pair had a 'long-running' feud after Hutchinson borrowed the money but had not paid it all back. Scroll down for video . Richard Hutchinson, 40, from Thornaby-on-Tees, North Yorkshire, has been jailed for two years for punching his former friend in a betting shop. Pictured: The victim stands at the counter in William Hill prior to the attack . CCTV footage shows Hutchinson run into the betting shop and throw a punch at his former friend. The married father said he lashed out because the pair had fallen out over money and he wanted to 'sort it out' Hutchinson punched his victim in the jaw, knocking him unconscious and leaving him with a fractured skull and a brain bleed. He needed 16 days in intensive care and Hutchinson has now been jailed for two years . The court heard how both men allegedly made threats and violence against each other in the run-up to the attack, with Hutchinson still owing the victim £60 at the time of the assault. The prosecution said Hutchinson threw punches at the victim the day before the attack then threatened to 'fill him in' on the phone. CCTV footage shows the victim, an engineer and father of two, standing at the counter of William Hill bookmakers' when Hutchinson ran in and felled him with one blow to the jaw. The victim, who has not been named, was knocked unconscious by the 'full force punch' and did not remember the attack, which occurred in a betting shop in Stockton-on-Tees on September 6 last year. He was taken to hospital with a skull fracture and bleed on the brain and had to remain in intensive care for 16 days. He was discharged but later readmitted to hospital for another 11 days for rehabilitation, Teesside Crown Court heard. Following the incident, married father Hutchinson went to police and told officers: 'I've hit someone. I may have seriously hurt them.' He told officers that he 'lost it' because he and his wife had been threatened and said he went to try and 'sort it out'. He added that he thought he had 'just knocked him out'. In his police interview, he said: 'I didn't mean to cause that much damage to him. It shocked me how easily he went down. 'I'm gutted. I'm sick to my stomach that I've actually done that to him. 'I didn't expect that at all. If anything, I expected him to turn around and hit me back.' The unsuspecting victim (pictured in the betting shop prior to the attack) had to remain in intensive care for 16 days and was  later readmitted to hospital for another 11 days for rehabilitation, Teesside court heard . The defence claimed the money was demanded from Hutchinson, that his wife had previously been assaulted, that he was threatened with garden shears and told he would be given 'a good hiding'. Duncan McReddie, defending, said Hutchinson acted recklessly with 'a degree of provocation that was long-running' after he borrowed £300 from the victim, down to £60 by the time of the assault. He said the unemployed scaffolder had expressed regret and remorse since the assault and a prison sentence would badly affect his family. Hutchinson admitted causing grievous bodily harm and the court heard that he had a caution for a similar offence in 2005 and assault convictions, but no violence for a decade. He was jailed for two years and given a five-year restraining order banning him from contacting the victim or going to his street.","Richard Hutchinson attacked former friend in betting shop in money row .

"The woolly mammoth became extinct as a result of crippling bone disease that left them unable to fend off predators, according to startling new evidence from Russia. It was previously thought that the hairy beast simply died out from post-Ice Age climate change and being hunted to extinction by early man. But now a new theory is set to re-write the history books after the examination of more than 23,500 mammoth bones found them riddled with osteoporosis and lacking in calcium. Dr Leshchinsky, the head of the laboratory of Mesozoic and Cenozoic continental eco-systems, said: 'In some collections that we examined almost 100 per cent of the bones (pictured) had signs of osteoporosis' The major mineral deficiency - which came from the impact of rising temperatures on soil and water - resulted in them breaking their limbs and spines, and left them unable to walk. In turn it meant the giant animal, which stood 10ft (three metres) high, eventually collapsed to the ground and could not forage for food, or flee hunters. According to the Siberian Times, the new evidence was uncovered by Dr Sergey Leshchinsky, from Tomsk State University. He spent a decade analysing bone and teeth samples from mammoths that roamed western Europe and Russia between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago. Until now it was thought that the woolly mammoth simply died out from post-Ice Age climate change and being hunted to extinction by early man (analysis of bones at mammoth 'graveyard' pictured) One mammoth graveyard where many bones have been found is in Lugovskoe, Russia . Shown is a young mammoth jaw riddled with bone disease. According to the Siberian Times , the new evidence was uncovered by Dr Sergey Leshchinsky, from Tomsk State University . The deficiency in calcium - which came from the impact of rising temperatures on soil and water - resulted in mammoths breaking their bones (example pictured) limbs and spines, leaving them unable to walk . Since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths. All but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago. One popular theory, bolstered by this study, is that Ice Age people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence. However, some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago. Other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in North America 13,000 years ago, led to rapid climate change, eventually wiping out the mammoths. Today, it's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction. But now a new theory - osteoperosis - might need to be added to the list. Dr Leshchinsky, the head of the laboratory of Mesozoic and Cenozoic continental eco-systems, said: 'In some collections that we examined, almost 100 per cent of the bones had signs of osteoporosis. 'Obviously, this led to a high traumatism among animals, such as sprains and fractures because of the smallest loads. 'Mammoths with damaged limbs or spines could not find food in sufficient quantities and lost the ability to follow the herd. 'Those who lagged behind the herd quickly became the prey of predators.' Roughly the same size as a modern African elephant, the woolly mammoth is widely thought to have become extinct as a direct result of climate change. Most experts say warming temperatures - twinned with rising sea levels - following the last Ice Age all but wiped out their traditional habitats about 20,000 years ago. However, others say they lived long past this era and were finally hunted to death by early humans, with remains found in the Russian Arctic showing they existed just 3,700 years ago. Now the scientific world will be excited by the emerging evidence that bone disease, and a chronic lack of calcium, could instead be to blame. Shown left and right are mammoth statues in Khanty-Mansiysk. The research, if proven true, would provide a somewhat unusual explanation for how woolly mammoths died out . Experts spent a decade analysing bone and teeth samples from mammoths ('graveyard' pictured)  that roamed western Europe and Russia between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago . Dr Leshchinsky, who wrote about his findings in the Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences journal, added: 'The articular surfaces of the limb bones in some specimens were not just damaged, they were mutilated with disease. 'The most typical signs were osteoporosis, osteofibrosis, osteomalacia, osteolysis, cartilage atrophy and fractures resulting in the formation of false joints, ulcers and friction grooves.' The palaeontologist said that in his opinion the cause of the deaths was a metabolic disorder caused by mineral starvation. It is thought that mammoths did try to make up for their calcium shortfall by eating clay on the waterfronts or in mud baths, but it was not in sufficient quantities to strengthen bones. Often dubbed the 'old person's disease' in humans osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones and makes them fragile and more likely to break. It affects about three million people in the UK and one in 10 receives hospital treatment for fractures from falling down.","Mammoth bones found in Russia suggest new theory for their demise .

"A 10-year-old boy climbed through a school window and jumped to his death after his chess opponent failed to say 'checkmate' after beating him, a police report has revealed. The child, whose name has not been released, suffered fatal injuries in the incident at Grant Elementary School in Dumont, New Jersey on March 6 and died later that day. On Wednesday, police released a report after an investigation into his death, The Record reported. The fifth-grader had been playing chess with another student during a morning recess period when he became upset that his opponent didn't say 'checkmate', according to the report. An aide overheard him saying to the other student: 'Do you want me to do something drastic?' Tragic: A 10-year-old boy jumped to his death from a window at Grant Elementary School in New Jersey last month after becoming upset following a losing chess match, according to a new police report . She told police that as the students were about to leave the room for lunch, she saw him crying in a corner and writing a note, which he passed to his opponent but told him not to open it until later. She confiscated the note and when she turned around to look at the boy, she saw him climbing through a window before jumping through the second-story window, the report said. He had managed to lift himself onto shelves and had crawled along the top towards the window, which was open about a foot, according to witness statements. He went through the window 'headfirst, unforced, unassisted and of his own accord' and suffered 'serious facial injuries', the report said. Witnesses said the boy seemed to be conscious and moving after hitting the ground but he died in the hospital several hours later, The Record previously reported. The contents of the note he passed to his classmate have not been disclosed. After the tragedy, the classmate said the boy had made references to jumping out the window on four previous occasions - but he didn't tell anyone because he didn't think the boy was serious. After losing another chess match in December, the boy got angry and said, 'I'm this close to jumping out the window!' while holding his thumb and index finger about an inch apart, the classmate said. Upset: The boy had previously told his chess opponent on four separate occasions that he would jump out the window, but the classmate told police he thought the boy was just messing around (stock photo) In the days before he jumped, the boy had also told the lunch aide that no one was letting him play chess with them, so she told the other students to include him. A classmate reported seeing the student often eating lunch on his own. The report concluded that no criminal charges will be brought in the incident. The school has not spoken out about any potential changes to its policies and an attorney for the school declined to comment on Wednesday. But several Dumont High School students said that their school has imposed a new policy that prohibits windows from being opened more than 6 inches, The Record reported. Some of the windows have been fitted with screws that stop them from opening up all the way, the students added. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","The child, who has not been named, suffered fatal injuries after jumping from a second-story window in Dumont, New Jersey last month .

"A heavily pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman  and her baby died after she was diagnosed with leukemia but refused a blood transfusion that would probably have saved both of their lives. The 28-year-old was diagnosed with the cancer seven months into her pregnancy, and doctors told her she could  give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy but both would require her to have a blood transfusion. The Sydney woman refused both options due to her religious beliefs and her baby died in utero three days later. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis after suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a challenge to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. The 28-year-old had pregnancy complications due to her leukemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . In a recent  article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber Biscoe wrote: 'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' The woman was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.","Jehovah's Witness and her baby have died after refusing blood transfusion .

"Clinton Jackson, 25, was jailed for 18 years for targeting the pensioners in their home . A gang of  thugs who battered an 81-year-old woman with a metal bar as they ransacked her home were jailed for a total of 44 years. Jermaine Kellman, 29, Marvin Sempler, 30, Clinton Jackson, 25, and Darren Lewis, 34, targeted the couple in their 80s after they were tipped off that money was kept in their home in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Verna Fisher, then 81, awoke in total darkness in the early hours of 31 July last year confronted by four men wearing white balaclavas and gloves. She tried to cry out for help, but Lewis had his hand clasped over her mouth while demanding money, the Old Bailey heard. Mrs Fisher was thrown off the bed while the burglars took her purse containing £250 and a mobile phone from under her pillow. But the men continued to demand more money before Lewis struck the pensioner twice with a metal bar, leaving her covered in blood, prosecutor Philip Evans said. Her bed-ridden husband Mortimer, who was 85, was sleeping in another room and woke with a man standing over him, but was powerless to help his wife. The couple were so traumatised by the terrifying ordeal that they had to leave their home. Mrs Fisher now lives with her daughter, while Mr Fisher sadly passed away in October 2014. There were gasps from the public gallery as Jackson was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment and brothers Kellman and Sempler were each handed 13-year jail terms. Lewis will be sentenced later this month. Judge Steven Gullick said offences of violence committed at night in the homes of the elderly and vulnerable must be met with significant custodial sentences. ‘As a direct result of this burglary Mr and Mrs Fisher had to leave their home. They no longer felt safe there. ‘They have never and will never return. Sadly Mr Fisher died in October 2014, Mrs Fisher now lives with her daughter,’ the judge said. The court heard a cousin of Sempler and Kellman, who had worked for the Fishers as a cleaner, told the brothers that the couple kept cash in their home. Brothers Jermaine Kellman, right,  and Marvin Sempler, left, were each handed 13-year jail terms . Judge Gullick said: ‘Armed with a metal bar and each wearing masks you forced entry into the Fishers’ home in the early hours of the morning. ‘Mrs Fisher, aged 81, was asleep in her bedroom. Mr Fisher, who was 85 and had been bed-ridden for a number of years, was asleep in what was nominally the living room of that house. ‘He was quite unable to do anything by way of protecting his wife.’ The four men went into Mrs Fisher’s bedroom, where she usually slept with the light on, and turned the light off. ‘You went their because you understood that was where the cash was,’ the judge told them. ‘The four of you surrounded her bed and she woke up to find four men, wearing masks standing over her, one with his hand over her mouth. ‘The room was in complete darkness, she was terrified.’ Lewis was the man brandishing an eight or nine inch metal bar as he demanded money off the petrified pensioner, the prosecutor said. Judge Steven Gullick at the Old Bailey, pictured, said offences of violence committed at night in the homes of the elderly and vulnerable must be met with significant custodial sentences . Mrs Fisher was then thrown off her bed and the gang found a purse, containing £250 and her bank cards, and a mobile phone under her pillow. ‘Lewis continued to demand money and to reinforce his demands struck her twice on the nose with the metal bar,’ Judge Gullick said. He also demanded she give him the PIN number to her bank cards, the court heard. ‘Despite her ordeal Mrs Fisher had the presence of mind to give Lewis numbers to cards she knew were not in her purse,’ the judge added. Kellman, of  Wandsworth, southeast London; Sempler, of  Lewisham, and Lewis, of Croydon pleaded guilty to a single count of aggravated burglary. Jackson, of  Norwood, south London, was convicted of the same offence following a trial at St Albans Crown Court.","Gang targeted home of Vera Fisher, 81, and her bed-ridden husband, 85 .

"Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday that he won't sign a religious freedom bill that his state's legislature sent to him on Tuesday, citing influence from his politically liberal son. He is sending it back to lawmakers, he told reporters, for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act – which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians. Hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law. 'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Hutchinson said. 'And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that ... there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.' Seth told Daily Mail Online that 'I love and respect my father very much, but sometimes we have political disagreements, just as many families do.' 'I had communicated with him my opposition to the bill, along with thousands of other Arkansans and concerned citizens around the country,' he added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a former member of the US Congress, where he was a reliable conservative vote on social issues – but he said Wednesday that he won't sign a new religious freedom bill into law . LIKE FATHER, LIKE – WHOA! The Republican governor's son Seth, pictured in a Barack Obama shirt, signed a petition asking his dad to veto the religious freedom law . About 200 demonstrators flooded the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Tuesday after the  bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature . 'I’m proud to have made a small contribution to the overall effort to stop discrimination against the LGBT community in Arkansas, the state that I love (Go hogs!),' the younger Hutchinson said. Seth works as a labor organizing coordinator for the Austin, Texas flagship office of the Texas State Employees Union. 'Most importantly,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'I hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to HB 1228 and other similar discriminatory bills around the country will energize more Americans and help create a long-lasting drive for change in this country, on many issues.' His father told reporters hours earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory. 'The bill that is on my desk at the present time does not mirror the federal law,' Hutchinson said. 'It doesn't mirror it in a couple of ways, particularly allowing the First Amendment to be asserted in the private litigation between parties or reliance on the state law in those claims.' 'Therefore I asked that changes be made in the legislation and I've asked that the leaders in the General Assembly to recall the bill so that it can be amended.' The White House jumped into the fray on Wednesday, with spokesman Josh Earnest telling reporters that the Arkansas legislation could 'be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love.' 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to,' Earnest said. 'And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry.' Hutchinson didn't cite any pressure other than his son's, however. 'My responsibility is to speak out on my own convictions,' Gov. Hutchinson said at the state Capitol, 'and to do what I can as governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of Arkansas, protects those of religious conscience – but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment.' The unusual move – sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it – means Hutchinson doesn't risk a veto-override in the state legislature. Lawmakers could refuse to amend the bill and force his hand, or they could do what he asks. Josh Earnest . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reacted during his daily press briefing on Wednesday: . 'The piece of legislation that was passed by the Arkansas legislature tracked closely with the legislation that was passed by the Indiana legislature last week. 'The kind of outcry that we saw in response to the Indiana legislation being signed into law by Governor Pence is similar to the outcry that we saw in Arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation. 'We saw, you know, some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of Arkansas expressing some concern about the impact of that law, and that that law could justifiably – or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love. 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to. And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry. 'But you know, obviously the next step will be for the leaders in Arkansas to determine. I think we've made pretty clear what our views are on that.' The governor has one other option: He said he's considering issuing an executive order to clarify that 'Arkansas wants to be a place of tolerance.' His concern that the bill went further than the 1993 law signed by then-President Bill Clinton was akin to complaints that critics raised this week in Indiana, where a similar law took effect on Monday. One key detail in Indiana's version – and Arkansas' – expands the idea of giving conscientious Christians a way to defend themselves if they're sued when their businesses refuse to provide services for gay weddings. They protect against civil suits filed by private individuals, not just those pursued by the government. But few civil-rights suits are filed and funded by allegedly harmed people. State- and federal-level commissions and law-enforcement agencies typically carry them forward. And Indiana University law professor Deborah Widiss told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Religious Freedom Restoration Act laws have not 'been a sort of blank check to discriminate.' At issue is whether a Christian-owned business could legally deny services to gays if doing so would conflict with their religious values. Typically, the issue is raised when same-sex couples seek vendors for their weddings. 'Let me make it clear,' Hutchinson said Wednesday: 'This law under consideration does not extend discrimination. That's important.' 'What is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance,' he said. 'And secondly, we make sure that we communicate we're not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future.' At the same time he seemed to defend the idea of having a law that protected the religious-express rights of business owners. 'This bill simply defines the standard to determine the right balance' between those rights and those of gay men and women, he said. Hutchinson had initially supported the bill and on Tuesday his office said he planned to sign it. 'This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial, but these are not ordinary times,' he said Wednesday as Americans watched his quick 180-degree turn. Hutchinson spoke to reporters outside his office at the state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday, saying that he wants a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in 1993 . DAD-WHISPERER: Seth Hutchinson seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad . As Arkansas braced for the possibility that it would become the new religious-freedom ground zero, Wal-Mart, the state's largest for-profit employer, had insisted that the new legislation was a bad idea. Those objections were unexpected in some corners because the massive big-box chain is seen as a rare bastion of Christian values in a crowded secular marketplace. The Walton family, the company founders who still own a large stake, are famous for using leadership models culled from Christian service traditions. Wal-Mart also is known for selling enough Christian-themed books to worry some religious bookstores. Yet Doug McMillon, the company's CEO, signed a statement saying that the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act 'threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.' 'Every day in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve,' McMillon said. Arkansas legislators defied widespread criticism in passing the bill on Tuesday. A similar measure that Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed into law a day earlier became an instant national flashpoint in the gay rights debate. It took Pence less than a day to capitulate to protesters, saying in a press conference that he would work with legislators to 'fix' the law's language. FLASHPOINT: Rallies like this one in Arkansas ould spread to the other 19 states where versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are already on the books . Arkansas state Rep. Bob Ballinger (right) sponsored the bill and was all smiles when it passed, but now his brainchild is in limbo . 'WE WILL FIX THIS': Indiana Gov. Mike Pence told reporters on Tuesday that he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state's new religious freedom law does not allow discrimination . Wal-Mart isn't the only big player that would have complained if Hutchinson had signed the bill. NASCAR said in a statement Tuesday that it was 'disappointed' by Indiana's legislation, and would likely pile on in the Razorback State. The NCAA, which has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1999, says it is concerned about the law's effect on future Indiana events including this week's Final Four men's basketball tournament. The governors of New York, Vermont, Washington and Connecticut have announced bans on certain state-funded travel to Indiana. Mayors of Denver, Seattle and Washington, D.C. have followed suit for city-funded travel. Those restrictions could have quickly doubled in size to include Arkansas. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that the Indiana law 'flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the Arkansas bill would be equally offensive to the Obama administration.","'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Republican Gov.

"Robert Durst's first court date culminated in a shouting match after none of his lawyers' witnesses showed up. The 71-year-old real estate scion awaiting extradition to face murder charges in California appeared in New Orleans accused of illegal gun possession. His defense team was expected to challenge the case by accusing police of searching Durst's hotel room in the city without a proper arrest warrant. However, as a shackled Durst appeared to be sleeping in the courtroom, the judge raged at his attorneys for being unprepared as they requested to delay the hearing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Controversial: Robert Durst, 71, (file image pictured) appeared to doze of in the New Orleans courtroom as his lawyers became embroiled in a shouting match with the judge after no witnesses showed up to the trial . In custody: Durst has been in custody since his arrest on March 14 and labeled a suicide risk as he waits to be extradited to California where he will be tried for the 2000 murder of his longtime friend Susan Berman . Durst was arrested on March 14 on charges of possession of a weapon by a felon and possession of a gun with a controlled substance, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, but has yet to be formally charged. It was the day before the final HBO episode aired of The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst. Authorities who searched the room, where Durst stayed under an alias, claim to have found over $42,000 in cash, a revolver, marijuana and a latex mask that could fit over his neck and head. FBI agents arrested Durst over fears he would flee the country, the agency has said. On Thursday, the judge eventually agreed to postpone the hearing until next week, when the witnesses - two FBI agents and a state trooper - could be charged with contempt of court for failing to appear. Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003. He is now facing the death penalty in California, where he is accused of murdering his longtime friend Susan Berman in 2000. Two FBI agents and a state trooper ignored their subpoenas and could face contempt of court charges . The real estate heir was temporarily placed on suicide watch soon after his arrest. His lawyers claim his Asperger's Syndrome led him to erroneously trust the HBO producers, who screened semi-confessional interviews that will now be used against him in trial. Durst, who prosecutors have said is worth up to $100 million, has long been estranged from his powerful family, which has major New York real estate holdings. He has been held without bail at a facility for mentally ill inmates about 70 miles (110 km) from New Orleans, with local authorities having labeled him a suicide risk.","Durst, 71, was arrested in New Orleans hotel room day before HBO finale .

"Bath Abbey could be linked to the city's Roman water network to heat the vast medieval church using ancient underground springs. The idea has been in the pipeline for years, but now excavation work has begun to determine whether it’s possible to connect a modern heating system with an ancient hot spring. The Church of England’s ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of Bath’s 45°C spring water to power a modern heating system for the building. Bath Abbey (pictured) could have the world's first natural underfloor heating system sourced from spring water in Roman drains. The idea has been in the pipeline for years, but now excavation work has begun to determine whether it’s possible to connect a modern heating system with an ancient hot spring . The Abbey, which lies at the heart of Britain's only World Heritage city, was granted planning permission for the unique £18million scheme two years ago. Engineers plan to excavate ancient crypts below the church to tap into a Roman drain where 850,000 litres of natural spring water empties every day into the ground. They hope to divert the warm water instead through a network of underground pipes to provide a world-first natural underfloor heating system for the abbey. Church leaders believe the plans would provide a unique source of green energy for the abbey and help the 10th century building reconnect with the city's Roman roots. Plans show how Bath Abbey will use water from the city's ancient springs, which heat water used in its Roan Baths. Waste water currently filters out to the River Avon but could be put to use under the new scheme . An artist's impression of plans for Bath Abbey shows how the ground will be excavated to create the heating system, new work space and song school . Today, excavation work is taking place on Kingston Parade outside the Visitor’s Information Centre to determine the feasibility of installing the system. Each day, a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the Roman Baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site. A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby River Avon – passing through the Great Roman Drain. The idea is, that it this waste water was harnessed correctly and converted, it could produce 1.5 megawatts of continuous energy – enough to heat Bath Abbey and the world-famous Roman Baths and Pump Room complex. Engineers are currently digging 13 ft (4 metres) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger, which transfers heat from one medium to another. A spokesman for the project told MailOnline that the investigations are in their infancy, but it appears that water levels may be too low to use in the Great Roman Drain area, but that energy could be harnessed in the Georgian part of the drain. A small scale trial is also underway to test how the heat can warm up different types of stone floors in the buildings. The Church of England’s ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of Bath’s 45°C spring water to power a modern heating system for the building. The idea is that waste water from the baths escaping down the Great Roman Drain would enter a hidden thermal heat exchange and heat the Abbey (illustrated above) Engineers plan to tap the power of warm waste water from the Roman bathing complex (pictured). Engineers are currently digging 13 ft (4 metres) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger . The plans for Bath Abbey's underfloor heating may use modern technologies, but will make use of the same natural spring tapped by the Romans. The Romans came up with underfloor heating called a hypocaust, which heated houses and public spaces with hot air. The word comes from the Ancient Greek, where hypo means under and caust means burnt. Romans used underfloor heating, or hypocausts to heat rooms at Bath's intricate bathing complex. Here, you can see the pilae stacks though which hot air would have circulated to heat a tile floor on top . The floor was raised above the ground by pillars called pilae stacks and made of a layers of tiles sandwiched together with concrete. The air under the floor was heated by a furnace. Walls were also made of hollow bricks so hot air could circulate through them, as well as below the tiles. Rooms requiring the most heat were placed closest to the furnace, the heat of which could be adjusted by adding more wood to the fire. It was labour intensive to sun a hypocaust as the fire needed a lot of fuel and constant attention, meaning underfloor heating was used in large public buildings, luxurious villas and bath complexes. Every day, a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the Roman Baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site. A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby River Avon (pictured)– passing through the Great Roman Drain . The modern elements of the system would be hidden underground and an archaeologist will be working alongside the engineers to document any objects that may be uncovered by the excavation. Once the investigation is complete, the ground will be covered back up and the engineers will work out how the thermal heat exchanger will be housed. Charles Curnock, Footprint Project Director from Bath Abbey, said: ‘An innovative thermal heating scheme using Bath’s hot springs ticks all the right boxes, while providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for both the Abbey and the Roman Baths & Pump Room complex.’ Two years ago, Bath Abbey rector Edward Mason said: ‘These are ambitious plans which would allow us to capture an incredible and ancient natural resource which is currently being wasted. ‘The Abbey lies at the heart of what was once Roman Bath, and our architects have located a drain where spring water flows. ‘As it stands, the water pours away and empties eventually into the Avon. ‘Our plan is to remove the floor of the Abbey, dig down and divert the drain and then pump the water through an underground heating system to warm the church. ‘It would provide virtually all of the Abbey's heating and would give us a unique way to reduce our carbon footprint.' Today, excavation work is taking place on Kingston Parade outside the Visitor’s Information Centre to determine the feasibility of installing the system A new work space could be created beneath the ground under the plans to excavate parts of Bath Abbey .

"The President of the Czech Republic has banned the U.S. Ambassador from Prague Castle following a public dispute over the former's decision to attend a Russian World War II parade. President Milos Zeman has been criticised by Ambassador Andrew Schapiro over his plans to attend the annual parade in Moscow, marking the Allied win  at the Western front in 1945, despite the crisis in Ukraine. In response to the critique, President Zeman said Ambassador  Schapiro is no longer welcome in the Prague Castle, the seat of presidency. Under attack: Czech President Milos Zeman was criticised by U.S. Ambassador Andrew Schapiro over his plans to attend the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, despite the crisis in Ukraine . Much to the chagrin of President Zeman, the country's prime minister together with Czech lawmakers are siding with the American. 'I think that the reaction of President Zeman was not adequate,' Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said. 'I would naturally welcome it if the attitude of Mr. President to foreign policy in general was a bit more professional,' Sobotka told the Czech public television on Monday. 'We should be able to communicate with our friends and allies,' Sobotka added. Parliament's lower house speaker, Jan Hamacek, said he thought Zeman was overreacting; the deputy speaker of Parliament's upper house, Premysl Sobotka, said Zeman demonstrated a lack of 'diplomatic thinking.' Harsh reaction: In response to the criticism, President Zeman has banned Ambassador Schapiro from visiting Prague Castle, the seat of presidency. Jan Mlejnek, an analyst, said Zeman's rhetoric was unfortunate and will harm Czech-U.S. relations. In an emailed statement from the U.S. embassy, Shapiro said 'it would be unfortunate for President Zeman to be there as perhaps? the only EU head of state.' Zeman, whose is critical of European Union sanctions against Russia, said he wanted to honor Soviet soldiers who sacrificed their lives to liberate his country in World War II. The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial post and the government is in charge of foreign policy. Sobotka said he accepted Zeman's explanation for the trip. Shapiro said he regretted that President Zeman felt offended. 'I value a good working relationship with everyone, and I want him to know that my door will be open to him,'? Shapiro said. 'I also want the Czech people to know that the United States government, and the people of America, value our relationship as partners and allies more than ever.' The Moscow Victory Day Parade parade is held on May 9th, and will this year commemorate the 70th anniversary of the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945.","Czech President Milos Zeman plans to attend WWII parade in Moscow .

"Having a Waitrose within walking distance is not only convenient – it also means your house is worth more, according to a study. Homes with the upmarket store nearby cost 12 per cent more – or £38,831 – than those in surrounding areas that weren’t near a branch. But having a budget store such as an Aldi or Lidl on your doorstep means your house could be worth thousands of pounds less than others in your neighbourhood. Homes with a Waitrose nearby cost 12 per cent more – or £38,831 – than those in surrounding areas that weren’t near a branch. But having a budget shop nearby means your house could sell for less . In a study published today, Lloyds Bank investigated average house prices in postal districts that have chain supermarkets nearby, to see how they compared to the wider postal region. Houses in areas with a Waitrose cost an average of £354,378 – which was £38,831 (12 per cent) more than typical prices for their regions. Sainsbury’s also delivered a big boost to residents, as properties near the store were worth 10 per cent more (£24,506) than ones in the surrounding area that weren’t near a branch. The price of having a supermarket on your doorstep: Waitrose scores highest - and Aldi the lowest . Tesco came in next, with a price premium of 8 per cent (£17,125), followed by Marks & Spencer, on 7 per cent (£18,786). But the presence of an Aldi nearby was associated with house prices that were 3 per cent (£5,910) lower compared to the wider postal region. And houses close to a Lidl cost 2 per cent (£4,719) less. 'It was mainly the views that attracted us to the property' Meanwhile houses near several different stores enjoyed the highest price premiums. Researchers found that homes in Clifton, Bristol – which enjoy access to a Waitrose, a Sainsbury’s and a Co-op – cost £392,961 on average. This is 64 per cent (£153,488) more than in nearby areas. And homes in Didsbury, a suburb in Manchester that boasts an Aldi, a Co-op and a Tesco, typically cost £239,595, which is 61 per cent or £91,096 more than houses in the surrounding area. Waitrose has carefully cultivated its upmarket image, proving popular with middle and high income families. But the research raises the question of whether a neighbourhood already had more expensive homes – encouraging the store to build a branch near its target customers – or if it was the store’s presence that boosted the area. Similarly, Aldi and Lidl, who have become popular as budget rivals to the big chains, have managed to keep prices low by locating branches in areas that were already cheaper, such as on the edge of towns.","Homes with Waitrose nearby cost 12% more than those not near a branch .

"The captain of a ship that sank off the coast of Africa 'started applauding and cheering' when his vessel was entirely submerged, according to anti-poaching activists who saved the man and his crew. Crew aboard Sea Shepherd vessel Bob Barker, which had been pursuing the ruined vessel named Thunder for 110 days in an effort to stop alleged poaching activities in Antarctic waters, found themselves taking on the role of saviours when the boat's distress signals were sounded. 'What was incredibly strange was that the captain of the Thunder, when the vessel did actually sink, started applauding and cheering, which I took to be very unusual behaviour and further evidence that he deliberately sank his own vessel,' Captain Peter Hammarstedt told Fairfax media. Scroll down for video . Thunder, one of six vessels known to illegally fish vulnerable toothfish in the Southern Ocean, sunk off the coast of Africa on Monday . Crew on Sea Shepherd vessel Bob Barker, which rescued those on board Thunder, said the captain of the now submerged ship was seen cheering . Sea Shepherd claims that Thunder is one of six vessels known to illegally fish vulnerable toothfish in the Southern Ocean. The conservation organisation's ships collected and delivered to authorities over 72 kilometres of illegal gillnet that it alleges was abandoned by the vessel in December. Thunder's sinking is believed to be another deliberate move by the vessel to hide evidence of any illegal activities. 'When my Chief Engineer boarded the Thunder in the hours leading up to the sinking, he was able to confirm that there were clear signs that the vessel was intentionally scuttled,' Captain Hammarstedt said. 'What was incredibly strange was that the captain of the Thunder, when the vessel did actually sink, started applauding and cheering,' Sea Shepherd Captain Peter Hammarstedt said . He added: 'I took to be very unusual behaviour and further evidence that he deliberately sank his own vessel' 'Usually when a vessel is sinking, the captain will close all hatches so as to maintain buoyancy. However, on the Thunder, the reverse was done - doors and hatches were tied open and the fishhold was opened. It is an incredibly suspicious situation, to say the least.' The alleged poaching vessel  issued a distressing signal, claiming that the ship was sinking at about 4.00pm on Monday. 'The Captain of Thunder radioed us and said their ship was sinking. We  launched our small boat and did everything we could to assist,' Mr Hammarstedt said. 'It appeared as though the ship and crew were in a serious situation.' All 40 crew members, who abandoned the sinking ship, were safely rescued and are being taken to the Sao Tome, in the Gulf of Guinea after receiving food, water and medical attention . The rescue was made despite numerous reports of violent behaviour from the vessel towards Bob Barker, including that crew had thrown grappling hooks at the ship and tried to ram it on more than one occasion . The rescue was made despite numerous reports of violent behaviour from the vessel towards Bob Barker, including that crew had thrown grappling hooks at the ship and tried to ram it on more than one occasion. Mr Hammarstedt told ABC News they have been following the 'internationally-wanted poaching vessel for the past 110 days' as part of its Operation Icefish. 'Our suspicion is that the captain of the Thunder, knowing he's run out of fuel, has deliberately sunk his own boat in order to destroy any physical evidence,' he said.

"She might be well into her eighth decade but Bette Carrouze, 78, from Brighton, has no intention of hanging up her dancing shoes. Instead, the single mother of two is partying away her final years on Brighton's gay scene and regularly emerges from clubs in the early hours of the morning. But her penchant for partying isn't entirely without its pitfalls, with the pensioner admitting that proffering a bus pass in the early hours while 'stinking of vodka' can be a bit embarrassing.

"A family-friendly coffee shop had its Facebook page hacked and flooded with pornography after an employee clicked on a malicious link in an email. Staff at Scooter's Coffee, in Omaha, were locked out of the page for almost 24 hours, starting at 5pm on Sunday, by an 'unknown third party' who then took control of the picture feed. Instead of the usual images of smoothies, coffees and cookies, the page was plastered with adult cartoons - similar to those posted on Delta Air Lines and Crayola's pages after they were hacked. Scooter's Coffee, Omaha, issued this apology to customers on its Facebook page after it was hijacked by hackers for 24 hours who used it to post pornography . Scooter's said that the images which appeared on their Facebook page were similar to the images that were posted on Crayola's page when they were hacked in January (pictured) From 5pm Sunday until almost the same time the next day, followers of the Scooter's Facebook page were sent links such as this one, instead of the regular images of smoothies and cookies . After trying to contact officials at Facebook with limited success, it was not until a day later that the company managed to kick the hacker out, and regain control of the account. Jamie Hamburg, spokesman for the company, said: 'At approximately 5pm CST on Sunday, 29 March, the Scooter's Coffee Facebook page was hacked by an unknown third party. 'The offensive content that has been posted as a result of this hack is similar to that seen in other recent breaches of major brands. 'Scooter's Coffee would like to apologize to our loyal Facebook audience and anyone that has been affected by this inappropriate content.' The hack is believed to have come after an employee clicked on a link of a direct message sent through Facebook itself. The hacker then kicked the member of staff out of the page, locked it, and began posting. Scooter's Coffee said that, despite repeated attempts to contact Facbook, and hundreds of reports being sent about inappropriate content, nobody at the social media network responded. It was only by contacting larger businesses that they were able to get in touch with Facebook, who removed the content and restored the page nearly 24 hours later. All of the images have now been removed, and Scooter's have offered apologies to thier customers via their Facebook and Twitter pages . It is thought that the hack occurred after an employee clicked on a link in an email which purported to be from Facebook. Hackers were then able to gather enough data to allow them to take control of the page . Crayon manufacturer Crayola was caught out by a similar breach in January, when hackers took control of the page to post pictures of cartoon breasts, and links to adult websites. One post included a link to a drawing of a scantily clad female cartoon character from the DreamWorks movie 'The Road to El Dorado' - with the words 'If Disney Was For Adults.' Delta Air Lines was also affected the following month in a similar attack involving a link to a sexually explicit joke. Their page was hijacked for around an hour, during which 'objectionable and offensive content', similar to that in the Crayola and Scooter's hacks, was published.","Staff were locked out of Scooter's Coffee page starting at 5pm on Sunday .

"While we all know the key to maintaining a healthy weight is finding a middle ground between the amount of food you eat and the amount of exercise you put in, it can sometimes be a bit tricky to anticipate exactly how much exercise is required. With Easter just around the corner we thought it would be helpful to give you a real life gauge on how much cardio you'll need to put in to get the most out of your Easter binge session. Starting at the very bottom of the chocolate egg scale is the mini solid egg, around four of them equate to 550 kilojules. After eating only four mini solid chocolate eggs that contain 550 kilojules you'll need to run for at least 40 minutes to melt the calories away . A 67-kilogram woman who ate only four of these snack sized treats would need to vigorously walk for around 40 minutes before the guilt, and the calories melted away. A man weighing in at around 80 kilograms could achieve the same in 30 minutes. Any child, or grown adult for that matter, out on an Easter scavenger hunt is sure to come across a chocolate replica of the Easter bunny himself. You would need to run for about half an hour to burn off a hollow chocolate egg . What you’ll be surprised to find is that a medium chocolate bunny contains around 4400 kilojules that won’t burn themselves off. If you chose the humble kayak as your weapon against weight gain, ladies you'd be expected to paddle for at least three hours to burn that bunny off. Gents you've lucked out in this department and will only have to spend around two hours in the water. If cycling is more your style, then men you'll need to spend just under two hours pedaling and ladies, you'll need to put in just over that for that bunny to be history. If you wanted to munch on a small bunny there’s no avoiding the 2212 kilojules that come with it. Ladies, you could hop in the pool and swim for just over an hour, or guys just under an hour, before that bunny would have melted away. If you've taken home a large chocolate bunny you can expect to spend at least three hours playing squash before you have worked off the 11060 kilojules added to your daily intake. For those who like their Easter with all the trimmings can expect to spend around three and a half hours on the squash court for women and just under three hours for men, before they’ll be able to burn off a large bunny which adds around 11060 kilojules to your daily calorie intake. Chocolate isn’t the only temptation around Easter time with two hot cross buns containing around 1800 kilojules, and that's without any butter or jam! Fruit hot cross buns  will have you hitting the pavement for an hour- and that's if you forgo the generous layer of butter! For those who can go without the extra spread you’ll need to run for about 40-50 minutes to work them off. For those who can’t, expect another 30 minutes of cardio before the calories are gone! If you thought classic hot cross buns were bad, wait until you’re faced with 1030 kilojules of choc-chip hot cross bun- and that’s just for one! Men will need to salute the sun for around an hour and fifteen minutes with ladies putting in an hour and a half of yoga before the singular bun will vanish! Hot cross bun's calorie laden, choc chip counterpart will require around an hour and a half of yoga before it's completely gone!","A balanced diet can get harder to achieve around the holiday times .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury (above) yesterday called on Christians to use non-violent means of resistance when faced with persecution by extremists - days after an attack in Kenya killed 150 people . The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday called on Christians to use non-violent means of resistance when faced with persecution by extremists. In the wake of the slaughter of Christian students in Kenya and the barbarity of Islamic State militants, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said the dead were ‘martyrs’. Delivering his Easter sermon in Canterbury Cathedral, he said: ‘Christians must resist without violence the persecution they suffer and support persecuted communities, with love and goodness and generosity.’ Dr Welby told his congregation that the killing of Christians over the past year had been a ‘wicked’ development. ‘To witness is to be a martyr,’ he said. ‘I am told by the Coptic Bishop in England that the Coptic Christians murdered in Libya last month died proclaiming that Jesus Christ is Lord. They are martyrs, a word that means both one that dies for their faith and one that witnesses to faith. ‘There have been so many martyrs in the last year. On Maundy Thursday, three days ago, around 150 Kenyans were killed because of being Christian. They are witnesses, unwilling, unjustly, wickedly, and they are martyrs in both senses of the word.’ The archbishop said their Christian faith meant the martyrs would defeat evil despite ‘their cruel deaths, the brutality of their persecution’. Dr Welby’s praise of martyrdom was made as Pope Francis called for governments to intervene in Syria and Iraq. In his Easter address in the Vatican City’s St Peter’s Square, the Pope said: ‘May the international community not stand by before the immense humanitarian tragedy unfolding in these countries and the drama of the numerous refugees.’ Pope Francis also spoke of the suffering of the victims persecuted for being Christian. He said that Christians ‘do not need to employ violence; they speak and act with the power of truth, beauty and love’. A priest similarly conducts an Easter Sunday service at the Catholic Church in Garissa, Kenya, where the attack happened . Officers from the Kenya Defence Forces and the Kenya Red Cross place an injured woman on a Nairobi-bound plane for specialised treatment . Some of the Garissa University students who were rescued comfort each other at the nearby military camp . He added: ‘We ask Jesus to lighten the sufferings of our many brothers and sisters who are persecuted for his name, and of all those who suffer injustice as a result of ongoing conflicts and violence. ‘We ask for peace, above all, for Syria and Iraq, that the roar of arms may cease and that peaceful relations may be restored among the various groups which make up those beloved countries.’ Pope Francis told the thousands gathered in the square for the Easter mass that he prayed ‘that the present absurd bloodshed and all barbarous acts of violence may cease’. The Pope said he also prayed for peace in Libya and the Middle East. A general view of the Garissa Catholic Church, which has remained closed after an attack by gunmen on Thursday at a university campus . Kenya’s special forces took seven hours to arrive at the scene of the massacre at Garissa University, it emerged yesterday. The assault by Somali-based Al Shabaab militants, which killed nearly 150 Christians, was Kenya’s deadliest terror attack since the 1998 bombing of the US embassy. Yet troops from the country’s elite Recce Company did not arrive at the campus until 2pm – seven hours after Thursday’s dawn attack was launched. Reporters based in Nairobi, who drove 225 miles to Garissa after hearing the first reports of the attack, arrived before the special forces flew in. It also emerged yesterday that one of the Islamist gunmen responsible for the massacre was the missing son of a senior government official. He was identified as law graduate Abdirahim Mohammed Abdullahi, son of a Kenyan regional government official in Mandera County.","Archbishop of Canterbury also said the dead were 'martyrs' in speech .

"A woman who urinated in her in-laws' cups of tea everyday for a year was caught red-handed when her mother-in-law walked into the kitchen and found her squatting over the teapot. Angered that her in-laws had stopped her husband from doing chores around the home, she sought revenge by urinating in their cups of tea for more than a year. Rekha Nagvanshi, 30, had turned on her husband's parents at the home she shared with husband Deepak, 34, in the district of Indore in central India's Madhya Pradesh State. Rekha Nagvanshi (pictured), 30, was caught urinating into the tea she was serving to her in-laws . Claiming she would rather live with her parents, she was said to be unhappy about her arranged marriage and felt she was being treated poorly. Her friend, Alia Kohli, 32, said: 'She was very unhappy with her arranged marriage and said her husband treated her like a slave and eventually she decided she'd had enough. 'But after moving out, he begged her to go back for the sake of their four-year-old daughter. 'She agreed but only if he cooked for her, massaged her feet and did all the washing up.' But after moving back in, parents-in-law Suraj, 60, and her husband Ajith, 55, found out about the arrangement and tried to stop it. Kohli said: 'He seemed fine with it but they went mental and accused her of treating him like a slave. 'Rekha is strong-minded and likes to be independent and the thought of being dictated to by his parents was just too much for her. 'So I guess that's when she decided to start doing what she did, and urinating in their tea.' Her disgusted mother-in-law said: 'We used to go and visit them once or twice a week. Nagvanshi was said to be unhappy that her husband's parents had stopped their son from doing chores around the home. Here she is pictured with her husband Deepak . 'And although we knew she didn't like us we had no idea she was doing this. She always smiled and offered us tea and we accepted. 'But one day I went into the kitchen and found her urinating into the teapot.' After going to the police and being told it was not a case for them, the horrified parents-in-law decided to take out a private prosecution. Suraj said: 'You cannot urinate into someone's tea for a year and get away with it. We want justice.'

"Guilty: Adam Rushton, 37, took advantage of his post as a beat officer to have sex with women . A policeman convicted of misconduct in a public office after having sex with women he met on duty was today labelled ‘a disgrace’ to the force. Adam Rushton took advantage of being a beat officer in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, to have sex with women, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The 37-year-old officer was found guilty of five counts of misconduct and another of breaching data protection rules by obtaining personal data. Rushton, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, denied ten counts of misconduct and two of breaching data protection laws while employed by police. He was acquitted on the remaining counts. Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker called Rushton ‘a disgrace to the police service’ who had ‘brought shame on himself, his colleagues’ and the force. Giving evidence, Rushton, who has been with the force for ten years, conceded some of his actions were ‘not very professional’ but claimed it did not amount to criminal misbehaviour. During the trial, he said he never expected to end up in the dock after going to one woman's home and having oral sex. ‘It's not very professional, I fully accept that, and that it's wrong,’ Rushton told jurors. ‘But no way whatsoever did I think I'd be standing here.’ He was convicted over that offence, and of making a social visit to another victim, while on the clock. Rushton was also convicted of having sex with a different woman at her house. He was found guilty on two counts relating to another woman, whom he met outside work, on one occasion having sex with her while on another exchanging ‘playful and flirty’ text messages before going to her home. Beat officer: Rushton has been with Staffordshire Police (whose headquarters are pictured) for ten years . His conviction for breaching data rules was in relation to looking up information relating to a fifth victim. The offences all happened between 2008 and 2012. When first interviewed over the allegations in April 2013, he denied sleeping with all but one of the women, however later accepted he had sex with several others. However, he denied his actions were criminal misconduct. Rushton had an impressive professional record as a neighbourhood policing officer, with many letters of praise from senior officers. But Crown Prosecutor Duncan Bould said the constable's duties brought him into contact with ‘vulnerable and frightened females, often in extreme circumstances’ and he had ‘sought to take advantage of those situations to have sexual activity of some kind with them’. Criticism: Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker (pictured) called Rushton ‘a disgrace to the police service’ after the verdicts . None of the women made any complaints to police about Rushton. He was conditionally bailed after the verdicts were read out and will be sentenced at the crown court on May 1. After the hearing, Mr Baker apologised to the police officer's victims on behalf of the force. He said: ‘This was an astonishing breach of trust by an individual officer and he has badly let down vulnerable victims and their families. The public must be able to trust their police officers, and on this occasion they have been let down. ‘We made the decision that Rushton should be prosecuted as a police officer, and hope this sends out a very strong message - no matter who you are, and what position you hold, if you commit crime you will be dealt with firmly and robustly.’ He added that after the allegations came to light in 2013, the matter was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which carried out an investigation. Mr Baker said that, as a result, ‘robust processes’ were now in place to prevent such incidents happening. IPCC commissioner Kathryn Stone said Rushton had abused a position of trust and used his job ‘in a calculated manner to satisfy his own sexual desires’. Ms Stone added: ‘The IPCC has previously expressed concern at the number of cases across England and Wales where officers have targeted vulnerable women for sex. 'And I hope that today's outcome reinforces a message that corrupt officers will be discovered and brought before the courts where appropriate.’","Adam Rushton took advantage of being a beat officer in Stoke-on-Trent .

Most responded that the sharks looked like either Blacktips or Spinners, which migrate this time of year to breed. The picture had been shared more than 2,000 times by Sunday.

"Florists in rural Georgia are hoping their state passes similar measures to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but say they would deny service to gay people regardless of the legality. Jennifer Williams, of Jeff Davis County, said that she would not sell flowers for a gay commitment ceremony or wedding but 'It doesn't mean that I love them any less.' Conservative Christian shop owners have recently come under fire after an Indiana pizzeria made national headlines for being the first store to refuse service to gay customers under new legislation in the state. Scroll down for video . Jennifer Williams, an employee at a flower shop in Jeff Davis County, Georgia, said that she loves gay people but would not help them with flowers for a wedding or commitment ceremony . Melissa Jeffcoat (center) said that she would serve adulterers but not gay people and that Jesus 'died on the cross for me so that's the least I could do for him' Carlton Jeffcoat, who is studying to be a Baptist minister, agreed with his mother's decision not to sell flowers to gay people . Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Indiana, plans to reopen soon after being bombarded with calls following the attention. On Thursday the state's governor Mike Pence signed a law 'fixing' his state's controversial legislation, which has prompted boycotts on state employees traveling to Indiana for business from Connecticut, New York and Washington. Williams, a Southern Baptist, said that she doesn't hate gay people and still loves them despite her refusal to have any part in their romantic ceremonies, she told CNN. Multiple shop owners in her county, named for the president of the Confederacy, said that they would like their own state to let them legally deny service for gay weddings. Georgia's senate passed legislation similar to Indiana's but did not get a vote in the state's House of Representatives before its legislature adjourned its session this week. Jeff Davis County's Melissa Jeffcoat said that she would be willing to take the risk of possible legal action by refusing gay people. 'He died on the cross for me so that's the least I could do for him,' she said, referring to Jesus. Her son Carlton is studying to be a Baptist preacher. Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed a 'fix' to his state's religious liberty bill on Thursday that said it could not be used to discriminate against gay people after criticism and travel boycotts from other states . Indiana has been the site of protests (pictured above, March 28) since its religious freedom bill got widespread attention. A pizzeria in Walkerton was bombarded with calls after refusing to cater a wedding . 'I serve a god who's higher than any Supreme Court judge. He's called the judge of the universe. And I don't care what anybody else says,' he said. Mrs Jeffcoat said that she would serve adulterers or other people who have sinned against Bible teachings, but not gay people. State religious liberty bills first were first passed in the late 1990s, following a federal bill signed by President Clinton in 1993. Most states focus on interactions between religious individuals and the government, though Indiana and a wave of new legislation in new states applies to private parties such as florists. A series of legal cases in Colorado found that a Christian baker discriminated against a gay couple when he refused to make them a cake for their wedding reception. On Friday, the state's Civil Rights Division ruled that a pro-LGBT baker did not discriminate against a man when she refused to decorate a cake with the Bible verse 'Homosexuality is a detestable sin. Leviticus 18:2'. The baker offered to make the cake and give the man frosting so he could write the decorations, which also included a picture of two grooms with a red x over them, according to ABC 7.","Flower shops in Jeff Davis County say they want religious freedom bill .

Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same ""situations"" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'","Lindsay, 28, moved to the UK last spring before making her London stage debut .

"Three hours after giving birth to her longed-for baby girl, Lianne Hindle lay dead in the same hospital bed. The mother-of-four suffered a cardiac arrest at the scandal-hit North Manchester General Hospital in December. The 37-year-old's death came just months after three babies and one mother died at the maternity unit. The deaths, along with those of four babies and two mothers at the Royal Oldham Hospital prompted an investigation. Today Ms Hindle's partner Chris Barnes and his sister Karen have called for action to prevent further tragedies. Chris Barnes, whose partner Lianne Hindle died three hours after giving birth to their daughter Poppy (pictured with brothers Zac and Louie), is calling for action to prevent further tragedies at North Manchester General Hospital . The 40-year-old father-of-four said: 'Something has to be done. It isn't right. 'This is still happening. Maternity units are supposed to be the safest places to have babies.' Mr Barnes, who suffers with cerebral palsy, has been left to care for the couple's three-month-old daughter Poppy, and her three brothers, Morgan, 15, Zac, nine, and Louie, seven. North Manchester General and the Royal Oldham Hospital called in independent experts to review its maternity units after the spate of 10 deaths in the eight-month period from December 2013 to July last year. Ms Hindle, from Bury, died in December - her death falling outside the scope of the investigation. She went into labour at almost 35 weeks pregnant, in the early hours of December 15. The expectant mother was scheduled to give birth at St Mary's Hospital, which has a specialist intensive care baby unit, after suffering two previous stillbirths, and three premature pregnancies. But she was taken to North Manchester General by ambulance instead, after it became clear she was going to give birth before she could get to St Mary's. This is the only picture Ms Hindle's family have of her holding daughter Poppy . Immediately after welcoming baby Poppy shortly after 2am, Mr Barnes said his partner appeared 'fine', holding the newborn and naming her. But just an hour later,  she started to feel unwell  - complaining that she was 'red hot'. Ms Barnes described how Ms Hindle started to look 'deathly white', and felt cold and clammy to touch, before her eyes began rolling back in her head. Her blood pressure and heart rate plummeted as her condition deteriorated and she died at around 6am after suffering a cardiac arrest. Ms Barnes said the family has concerns about the care Ms Hindle received, claiming she was left alone with a student midwife following the birth, once the placenta had been delivered. 'Lianne was repeatedly talking of how red hot she was, asking for a fan and the windows to be opened,' Ms Barnes said. 'The student midwife said that was normal after having a baby and wafted her with a sick bowl. 'I didn't see Lianne's temperature taken once.' Ms Barnes claimed at one point, a member of staff came into the room and asked the student midwife: 'Who are you supposed to be with?' To which the student replied, ""exactly"", Ms Barnes said. Ms Hindle's family said no one from the hospital had contacted them since her death. Ms Barnes added: 'That makes us feel that she just wasn't important to them.' Mr Barnes, who suffers cerebral palsy, has been left to care for the couple's four children, Zac, nine, Morgan, 15, three-month-old Poppy, and Louie, seven . A spokesman for The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'Our condolences go out to the family in this tragic case. 'Lianne was diverted to us as an emergency on the way to another hospital. 'She was not previously known to our maternity service and while her baby was delivered safely, tragically Lianne subsequently died. 'We are unable to comment further as this case has been referred to the coroner and has not yet been heard. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' Mr Barnes said: 'Lianne had always dreamed of a little girl. She was a strong character and loved her family. Her death has shocked and devastated us. It doesn't seem real. 'The boys have been pretty resilient but Louie is a mummy's boy and recently has been waking up in the night and crying out for her. That has been hard to take.' A date for her inquest has not yet been set. An investigation was launched at the North Manchester General Hospital after the deaths of three babies and a mother at the hospital between December 2013 and July last year. The probe also looked at the deaths of four babies and two mothers at the Royal Oldham Hospital over the same time period . A catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two NHS hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months. Independent investigators were called into Royal Oldham after the deaths of four babies and two mothers, and North Manchester General after the deaths of another three babies and one mother. Lisa Parkisson, 35, died at Oldham Royal 48 hours after giving birth in April this year, while newborn Thomas Beaty died at the same hospital in June after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth. A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. Lisa Parkisson, 35, (left with son Zac) died 48 hours after giving birth at Oldham Royal in June last year. Thomas Beaty (right) died from  at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb . A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. Pennine Acute is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings. They include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management, making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors. Gill Harris, chief nurse at Pennine Acute, said last week: 'The Trust is always keen to learn and to improve care. We commissioned a review by experts from outside the Trust to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals. Independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at Oldham Royal following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months . 'We are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' A spokeswoman for the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, said: 'CQC is aware that Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust, NHS England and local CCG regarding the review findings.'","Lianne Hindle suffered a cardiac arrest at North Manchester General .

"In one of the biggest cheating scandals of its kind in the U.S., 11 former Atlanta public school educators were convicted Wednesday of racketeering for their role in a scheme to inflate students' scores on standardized exams. The defendants - including teachers, a principal and other administrators - were accused of falsifying test results to collect bonuses or keep their jobs in the 50,000-student Atlanta school system. The educators fed answers to students or erased and changed the answers on tests after they were turned in to secure promotions or up to $5,000 each in bonuses, the court was told. However the person accused of benefiting the most from the conspiracy, Superintendent Beverly Hall - who is thought to have received up to $500,000 in bonus payouts - died of breast cancer over the course of the trial. A 12th defendant, a teacher, was acquitted of all charges by the jury this week. The 11 will all be sentenced on April 8 and could face up to 20 years in prison for the racketeering charges. They were all found guilty under the the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, which is typically reserved for major mobsters and organized crime bosses. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Donald Bullock, left, former Atlanta Public Schools Usher-Collier Heights Elementary testing coordinator, is led to a holding cell after a jury found him guilty in the Atlanta Public Schools cheating trial . Cheating: During the trial prosecutors accused a dozen former teachers, principals and administrators of erasing incorrect answers or instructing students to change their answers to secure promotions and cash bonuses in 2009. Seen here is Former Atlanta Public Schools school research team director Tamara Cotman . Jail: Former Deerwood Academy assistant principal Tabeeka Jordan is led to a holding cell after the verdict. One principal was accused of wearing gloves as they erased test score answers and filled in new ones . 'This is a huge story and absolutely the biggest development in American education law since forever,' said University of Georgia law professor Ron Carlson. 'It has to send a message to educators here and broadly across the nation. Playing with student test scores is very, very dangerous business.' The case stems from an investigation carried out in 2011, which uncovered evidence that the educators gave answers to students or changed answers on tests after they were turned in. Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools, with nearly 180 educators involved, and investigators found teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation. The cheating is believed to date back to 2001, when scores on statewide skills tests began to turn around in the 50,000-student school district. Between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered and falsely certified, according to the 2013 indictment. According to Governing.com, most educators' bonuses didn't exceed a total of $5,000 between 2005 and 2009. A grand jury indicted 35 educators in March 2013 on charges including racketeering, false statements and theft. Many reached plea agreements, serve between 250 and 1,000 hours of community service, repay between $500 and $5,000 in bonus money and complete up to two years of probation. Others testified at the trial against their co-conspirators. However, Superintendent Beverly Hall never went to trial, successfully arguing she was too sick to mount a defense. She died last month of breast cancer.

Emotional: Donald Bullock, left, former Atlanta Public Schools Usher-Collier Heights Elementary testing coordinator, reacts as a jury finds him guilty. He is now facing 20 years in prison . Hall insisted she was innocent and had no part in any cheating. But, the educators said she was among those pressuring them to inflate students' scores to show gains in achievement — which were needed to meet federal benchmarks tied to extra funding. Hall, who served as superintendent for more than a decade, which is rare for an urban schools chief, was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2009 and was credited with raising student test scores and graduation rates. The investigation found that Hall 'created a culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation' during her time as Superintendent. It also found that she had permitted 'cheating — at all levels — to go unchecked for years'. Investigators believe she may have accepted up to $500,000 in bonus payouts as a result of the ongoing cheating scandal. In 2008, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a series of articles that questioned the veracity of test scores across the Atlanta school school system, which has 50,000 students . The newspaper contended the scores were statistically improbable . Gov. Sonny Perdue subsequently launched an investigation, which concluded in June 2011 . It found at least 44 schools were guilty of cheating, dating back to 2005 . Educators fed answers to students or erased and changed answers on tests after they were turned in .

It allowed them to accept bonuses of up to $5,000 each, however Dr Hall is believed to have accepted up to $500,000 . In March 2013, Dr Hall and 34 educators were indicted by a grand jury on charges including racketeering, making false statements and theft . 21 of the educators plead guilty to reach plea agreements .

Hall said: 'There is simply no excuse for unethical behavior and no room in this district for unethical conduct.' Defense attorneys argued those convicted should remain free until sentencing because they don't have prior records, have community ties and showed up to trial every day. Yet, only one was allowed to remain free on bond — teacher Shani Robinson — because she is expecting to give birth soon. The jury reached its verdict on the eighth day of deliberations.

Verdict: Defense attorney Annette Greene reacts as the verdict is read for her client former Dunbar Elementary teacher Shani Robinson. Robinson and 10 other former Atlanta Public Schools educators were convicted for their part  in a test cheating conspiracy that drew nationwide attention . Prosecutors said the 12 former educators on trial were looking out for themselves, seeking bonuses for higher test scores rather than worrying about the education of their students. Defense attorneys argued that their clients were caught up in an overly broad prosecution that overreached in charging them with violating racketeering laws most often used for organized crime. The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney's office lasted nearly two years. It only came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2008 that some test scores were statistically improbable.

District Attorney Paul Howard said it was the biggest and most complex case his office had ever handled. It lasted nearly two years and involved hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students. 'Our entire effort in this case was simply to get our community to stop and take a look at the education system,' Howard said.

"After nearly two years of jockeying with Congress over the IRS's history of discriminating against conservative nonprofit groups, former official Lois Lerner won't be charged with a crime for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions. U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, on his last day in office, told House Speaker John Boehner in a seven-page letter that Lerner could wrap herself in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, even though she offered a self-serving opening statement before clamming up during a May 22, 2013 hearing. Lerner has long been in the GOP's crosshairs because she led the IRS department tasked with approving nonprofit groups' applications for tax-exempt status. Beginning in 2010, the department gave conservative groups with words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names extra scrutiny, slow-walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had subpoenaed Lerner after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE DOJ'S LETTER TO BOEHNER . I'LL TELL THE TRUTH ... UNLESS I'M TAKING THE FIFTH: Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing, and then refused to answer lawmakers' questions – a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen (left) dropped his bomb on Congress just one day before leaving office to return to private legal practice . Emailed? Machen's letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner (left), who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5, 2014, House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department once it was approved. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, then the Oversight committee's chairman, told Lerner in one hearing that she had 'effectively waived your rights' by defending herself under oath. 'I have not done anything wrong,' Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing. 'I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.' Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made 'general claims of innocence,' she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions. 'Ms. Lemer's general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to ""testimony"" about the actual facts under the Committee's review,' he said. 'The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense, should she be prosecuted ,,, for her refusal to testify.' Machen's March 31 letter arrived on Capitol Hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five-year stint as Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor inside the Justice Department. President Barack Obama named him to his post in December 2009. Reactions swept through the nation's capital as word spread that Lerner was, legally, in the clear. 'Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. 'But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy, and the American people deserve the truth.' 'The White House,' said Steel, 'still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS’ actions.' Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel, instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice: Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of $6,750 to  Obama’s campaigns and to the Democratic National Committee. SWITCH: During the tea party targeting hearings, it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (left) who was regularly exasperated – but now Darrell Issa (right), his Republican foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner . Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green-lighted liberal groups in weeks or months . Issa, whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against Lerner – and one against Holder, for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal – was livid. 'Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to Congress and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to Congressional investigations,' he said Wednesday in a statement. Issa's successor as chairman of the Oversight committee, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, said Machen's letter 'exhibits a disregard for the rule of law' and scoffed at his objectivity. 'It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner, or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS’s leadership,' Chaffetz said. 'The Committee will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of American citizens based on their political beliefs. Our goal is to ensure that the people responsible, including Lois Lerner, are held accountable.' Lerner's attorney, William Taylor, said in a statement that his client 'looks forward to moving on with her life.' 'It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights,' Taylor said.

"It is the disease the medical community refuses to accept, and most experts claim is just a mental illness. Morgellons disease has been described by those who suffer from it as causing fatigue and memory loss, while also leading to large sores on the body which are constantly itching to the sensation of bugs or parasites crawling underneath the skin. From these sores they claim sprout colorful fibers that cannot be described and, according to one person, 'cannot be forensically identified as animal, vegetable or mineral.' That person is Joni Mitchell, who claims to have suffered from Morgellons for most of her life, and who has recently been hospitalized after she was found unconscious at her home. Mitchell, who suffered from polio as a child, remains in the hospital, but is said to be in 'good spirits.' Scroll down for video . Joni Mitchell (above) has suffered from Morgellons disease throughout her life, and has recently dedicated herself to trying to get it accepted as a medical condition . Sufferers say they are constantly itching, and large sore develop on their skin from which colorful fibers (above) grow . Mitchell spoke of the disease in a 2010 interview with the Los Angeles Times, saying; 'I have this weird, incurable disease that seems like it's from outer space.' She went on to say; 'Fibers in a variety of colors protrude out of my skin like mushrooms after a rainstorm ...  Morgellons is a slow, unpredictable killer - a terrorist disease: it will blow up one of your organs, leaving you in bed for a year.' This is far different than the way many in the medical community describe the disease however, which, according to the Mayo Clinic, is incredibly rare and effects predominantly middle-aged white women. The Centers for Disease Control reports that the symptoms are very similar to those of mental illness, from the sensation of crawling and bugs and parasites to the concept of false beliefs. The CDC even conducted a study at one point, and found that most people who claim to suffer from the disease were likely just experiencing anxiety, depression or, in some cases, issues with substance abuse. Mitchell admitted to briefly having problems with addiction in a Reader's Digest interview, saying; 'I didn’t get involved for years, and then I went on Rolling Thunder and they asked me how I wanted to be paid, and I ran away to join the circus: Clowns used to get paid in wine – pay me in cocaine because everybody was strung out on cocaine.' A 2012 paper published in a peer-reviewed medical journal found that half of the 115 subjects tested positive for a prescription or illicit drug, among them; amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, and even cocaine. Futhermore, most of the fibers collected from their skin were cotton, likely from clothing or bandages, and no parasites were detected in any of the individuals. The medical community believes Morgellons is likely a mental illness and that sufferers are anxious, depressed or even suffering from substance abuse (Mitchell above in 1996) Cindy Casey Holman, the director of the Charles E. Holman Morgellons Disease Foundation and herself a registered nurse takes issue with this study. 'A serious and often deadly systemic infection is present in Morgellons samples. Still patients are being prescribed antipsychotics while the infection goes undetected and untreated,'  she told CBS News. 'Clouding the picture is that some patients do exhibit psychiatric manifestations. But spirochetal infections, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, are well known to affect the central nervous system and cause psychiatric symptoms. Yet the infection is ignored while dermatologists offer dangerous antipsychotics as the only treatment.' Some individuals have said that taking antibiotics cured them of Morgellons, though some experts could bring that back to the idea of mental illness and claim it is simply a placebo effect. Researchers and experts meanwhile do accept that Morgellons exist, just not as an actual medical condition. Mitchell meanwhile has long been committed to having Morgellons recognized for what she believes it to be - an 'incurable disease.'","Joni Mitchell was hospitalized on Tuesday after being found unconscious in her California home .

Messerschmitt told the individual his room number at the hotel and gave a meeting time of 7pm - 7.30pm. The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon. On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com article about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual. Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago.

"A mother is suing her local council over claims it ignored complaints of bullying that she says left her autistic daughter with post-traumatic stress disorder. Tracy Stratton said her daughter, Tianni, suffered physical attacks and verbal abuse at Greenacres Primary School in Eltham, south east London. She claims the seven-year-old has been left so traumatised that she has almost stopped talking and is afraid to leave the house. A psychologist diagnosed Tianni with PTSD, she added. Bullied: Tracy Stratton claims seven-year-old Tianni (pictured together) has been left so traumatised that she has almost stopped talking and is afraid to leave the house. A psychologist diagnosed Tianni with PTSD, she added . Ms Stratton is now claiming damages from The Royal Borough of Greenwich Council, after she says the school ignored at least five reports of bulling. The 45-year-old said Tianni 'absolutely adored' school when she first started last April but that signs of trouble emerged just four weeks later when her daughter started to become more reserved. Worried her daughter was being picked on, Ms Stratton said she approached staff at the school but that they refused to listen to her concerns. One one occasion, Ms Stratton said her daughter, who is half Asian, wore sun cream in an attempt to change the colour of her skin. Victim: Tianni, suffered physical attacks and verbal abuse at Greenacres Primary School in Eltham, south east London, her mother claims . She said: 'On the walk home from school she put sun cream on. She has beautiful brown skin. 'She put a big dollop of sun cream on her arm and said, 'look mum I'm white, I'm English now"". 'I wiped it off and said, ""you are English, you have beautiful brown skin, anytime anyone says that remember one thing: brown is beautiful and don't let anyone else tell you different"". 'I wanted to burst into tears.' But the full-time mother said she only realised the full extent of the bullying when she saw her daughter being attacked in the playground shortly before the start of the school summer holidays. She said: 'I saw a girl  slap her but the teachers tried to say she was making it up because of her autism.' A few weeks later, Tianni confided in her mother and grandmother about the abuse. Ms Stratton then reported the bullying five times in writing, according to legal documents. Tianni refused to go back to school and is now being educated at home. Ms Stratton said she had no choice but to approach a solicitor in September who handed the council a legal notice in December after her daughter verged on being a mute. She said: 'She was never Mrs Chatty but she's got worse since she was diagnosed with PTSD in November. 'My daughter went from a bright, happy and vibrant little girl who wanted to play with her friends and do what other girls her age were doing to being a recluse, like a flower that has wilted. Ms Stratton said she had no choice but to approach a solicitor in September who handed the council a legal notice in December after her daughter verged on being a mute. Above, the mother and daughter at home . 'I got a solicitor in October when nobody at the school was listening to me and we launched the legal action in December. 'Tianni's had her life interrupted.

"David Cameron has made no secret of the fact that he gets broody around babies, but his wife Samantha has ruled out adding to the family in Number 10. In another joint interview on the election campaign trail, the couple were insistent that they are not planning more children, with Mrs Cameron revealing her doctor has told her: 'No way, Jose.' She was pregnant throughout the 2010 campaign, and gave birth to their fourth child Florence in Cornwall after she arrived weeks early. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron has ruled out having another baby, days after she and husband David cooed over seven-week-old Regan on a visit to Chorley, Lancashire . Baby talk has never been far from the couple's mind as they have campaign across the country . Baby talk has never been far from the couple's mind as they have campaigned across the country. On Friday Mr Cameron celebrated his emergence from the TV leaders' debate unscathed with a visit to promote help for first time buyers. The couple cooed over seven-week-old Regan as they meet her parents, Robert Arron and Kelly Jeffers at a housing development in Chorley, Lancashire. Mr Cameron was heard quipping: 'Come on darling, maybe another one?' The Prime Minister, already a father of four, later admitted he could not help thinking about having more children when he was around young babies. On a visit to a brewery in Cardiff yesterday, Mrs Cameron, 43, pointed to a glass of Welsh Black stout she had been handed, and said: 'I normally just drink this when I'm pregnant' Campaigning in Cornwall, Mr Cameron told House magazine: 'Definitely, we are not having another baby.' Their fourth child Florence was born in the county in 2010 . David Cameron and his wife Samantha relax in Downing Street by watching Channel Four hit Gogglebox, the pair have admitted. The Prime Minister said the popular show was 'a very clever programme'. But Samantha went further, reeling off her favourite characters filmed watching television. She said she 'loved' Scarlett Moffat, the quick-witted northerner who become a cult figure over her sharp put downs caught on camera. Mrs Cameron said: 'I like the daughter in Newcastle. She's so funny, I love her, she's hilarious. I really think she's great. The Siddiquis are good as well.' After sympathising with the couple about sleepless nights he said: 'Whenever I see a small baby I feel broody, but don't worry, nothing is going to happen on that front.' Then on a visit to a brewery in Cardiff yesterday, Mrs Cameron, 43, pointed to a glass of Welsh Black stout she had been handed, and said: 'I normally just drink this when I'm pregnant.' The Tory leader - who recently ruled out the couple having a fifth child - quickly interjected: 'That is not an announcement!' Now they have moved to rule out categorically any idea that they might add to their brood. Campaigning in Cornwall, Mr Cameron told House magazine: 'Definitely, we are not having another baby.' Mrs Cameron agreed: 'We are definitely not.' She then added: 'The doctors have said 'no way, Jose'.' Mr Cameron chipped in: 'That's another story, darling… But anyway. No, we are not having any more. The last one was born not ten miles from where we are now.' Mrs Cameron gave birth to Florence in the middle of a family holiday to Cornwall in August 2010. The Prime Minister drove with his wife to hospital for what they believed would be a routine check-up. But four hours later he was by her side when she gave birth by caesarean section to their 6lb 1oz 'unbelievably beautiful girl'. It is believed Mr Cameron scrubbed up - wearing a gown and cap to reduce the chances of infection - for the delivery, which was three weeks early. The birth, at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, came a year after the death of the Camerons' six-year-old son Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy. The couple also have a nine-year-old son Elwen and 11-year-old daughter Nancy.","Another intimate election interview by the Prime Minister and his wife .

"London commuters faced traffic chaos this morning while thousands are still without power as firefighters battle to extinguish an underground blaze that has been raging for more than 24 hours. More than 2,000 office workers had to be evacuated yesterday due to the fire in Holborn which apparently started in a tunnel carrying electrical cables, causing flames to erupt from the pavement and filling the area with smoke. Although the blaze has now been brought under control it has not been put out entirely, and firefighters still do not know the cause of the fire. Scroll down for video . Blaze: The scene in Holborn today, where a fire has been raging for more than 24 hours . Emergency: Firefighters and gas workers were still battling to put out the fire a day later . Plume: Flames rose up from the street in the deserted part of central London today . Continuing: Firefighters spraying water into a manhole in a bid to put out a fire in Holborn . Much of the area is cordoned off as firefighters struggle to extinguish the fire, while there were reports of major delays in central London. Commuters were urged to avoid travelling through Holborn if possible, and firefighters were unable to estimate when the situation might return to normal. Tonight 35 firefighters and police officers remain at Kingsway, where flames were seen erupting from a manhole cover yesterday. Kingsway is closed, as is the Strand underpass, while Waterloo Bridge is closed northbound. Transport for London said that 15 bus routes were being diverted, and witnesses described seeing dozens of buses backed up along High Holborn, but Underground services have returned to normal. More than 1,000 buildings remain without power today, with businesses, government departments and tourist attractions forced to close ahead of the Easter weekend. firefighters and gas workers continue to tackle the flames in the Kingsway Service Tunnel . Carnage: Parts of the road had to be dug up in an attempt to extinguish the fire below the ground . The underground fire has stopped power workers from accessing their equipment . Jets: Firefighters deployed multiple hoses to combat the blaze which wreaked havoc on the area . Exhausted: Firefighters looked tired as they took a break after working at the scene for hours . Blocked: Roads were closed in the wake of the fire, whose cause is still unknown . UK Power Networks said that 100 staff had worked through the night to restore electricity to the area, but it is not known when buildings will regain power. A spokesman said: 'A major gas fire in an underground tunnel is still burning so we cannot yet access our equipment. 'Our engineers have restored power to 2,000 customers and the remaining 1,100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible. 'We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. 'We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated.' Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer, and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. 'This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle,' he said. 'The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night, the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished. 'However, the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close.' Works: More than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central London . Disruption: The road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area . Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said the blaze was 'a technically difficult incident to tackle' Deserted: The Holborn area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption . Closure: Shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience . One council boss warned that there was a 'worrying trend' of pavements exploding in central London and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents. 'We do not fully yet know what caused the fire in Holborn on Wednesday,' said Richard Beddoe of Westminster Council. 'However, pavements have exploded in central London previously and it is a very worrying trend. 'Our message remains the same - we want to see better investment in the capital's infrastructure, as it benefits the whole UK. 'We are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties, but the losses to big businesses in the West End, due to poor infrastructure, is just not acceptable. We want to see action.' In July, Piccadilly Circus was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire. Meanwhile, in February last year, 50 people were evacuated from a street in north London after a pavement burst into flames. And in April 2013, a fireball burst from a pavement in Pimlico Road, central London, narrowly missing a passer-by standing yards away. A UK Power Networks spokesman said: 'There have been a small number of incidents disturbing pavements over recent years, caused by a variety of reasons and affecting utility infrastructures underground.' Blackout: Power was knocked out across the area and more than 1,000 buildings remain without electricity . Dramatic: This aerial image shows how a wide area of London was left without power . Scene: These file photos show tunnels under Holborn near to where the fire broke out . Smoke: More than 2,000 workers were forced to flee their central London workplaces . Among the buildings affected by the fire is the Royal Courts of Justice, home to the High Court and Court of Appeal, which was due to remain closed all day. Somerset House, the London School of Economics and the London Transport Museum were closed, while the English National Ballet cancelled its planned matinée performances of Swan Lake. One of the offices affected by the fire was that of HM Inspectorate of Prisons, which is closed as a result of the power cut. Gillian Perham, 54, lives near the fire and said there had been similar incidents in recent years. 'There was an exploding pavement not far from here last year,' she said. 'We are fed up with it. I'm terrified it's going to happen when I'm near one.' At one point yesterday, 70 firefighters and 10 engines were at the scene of the blaze, which forced a number of West End theatres to cancel shows last night, including The Lion King, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong. In a separate incident, 15 engines were called to a fire on an industrial unit in north London.","Main roads in Holborn are closed more than 24 hours after fire broke out .

"A boyfriend said he 'thought' he had to kill six members of his girlfriend's family during a Christmas Eve dinner as he took to the stand in a bid to avoid the death penalty. Joseph McEnroe, 36, from Carnation, Washington, was convicted of slaying four adults and two children - aged three and five - in 2007 by a jury last week. The same 12 people that found him guilty of the murders are now determining whether he will be executed or sentenced to life in prison without parole. Scroll down for video . Joseph McEnroe, 36, from Carnation, Washington, (pictured in court on Thursday) who murdered six members of his girlfriend's family on Christmas Eve, 2007, is testifying in the penalty phase of his trial in a bid to avoid the death penalty . In an attempt to spare his life, McEnroe told the court on Thursday he 'thought' he had to kill Wayne Anderson, 60, and Judy Anderson, 61; their son and daughter-in-law Scott and Erica Anderson, both 32; and the younger couple’s children Olivia, 5, and Nathan, 3. The court heard that McEnroe and his girlfriend Michele Anderson gunned them down and then hid their bodies in a shed behind the house. 'I know that’s not a good excuse' he said. 'I’m not trying to excuse myself. I’m trying to explain my actions. 'There is no question I did these awful things. I thought I had to.' During his testimony, according to KIRO-TV, he claimed he was abused as a child at the hands of his unstable mother and her boyfriends. Wayne and Judy Anderson (pictured) were the first to be killed by Joseph McEnroe on Christmas Eve 2007. McEnroe had been living with his girlfriend in a mobile home in the backyard at the time . Erica and Scott Anderson (pictured) and their children were also shot and killed during the holiday gathering . According to The Seattle Times, he was constantly interrupted by the prosecutor or court reporter, asking him to speak up or slow down. At one point he started giggling and had to apologize to the court room for his 'terrible' speech impediment. He added: 'I did not do this because I wanted to. I was trying to protect Michele. I was completely wrong. Anderson had been living in a mobile home with McEnroe on her parents' property and prosecutors said the couple was upset Michele's parents did not pay their rent. The defense called Dr Donald Dutton, a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia, who said McEnroe was a victim of 'folie à deux.' Michele Anderson, McEnroe's girlfriend, is set to stand trial for the brutal killings later this year. Court hearings have been delayed because of concerns over her mental capacity . Because he had shared a home with Anderson, Dutton explained, McEnroe had become to believe her claims she had been sadistically abused by her father. Anderson will face trial for the killings later this year, but court hearings have been delayed over questions regarding her mental competency and whether she is fit to stand trial. If the jury decides on the death penalty, McEnroe would be the first person sentenced to death in King County since 2010. There is currently a moratorium on executions while Washington Governor Jay Inslee is in office.","Joseph McEnroe, 36, was found guilty of six murders last week .

"The baby, known as Mary, had been born at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, pictured, but died six months later with traces of cocaine in her stomach . A six-month-old baby died with traces of cocaine in her stomach despite her drug-user parents being reported to social services five times. Small amounts of painkiller and anti-depressant drugs were also found in the infant, known as Mary, who died suddenly in 2013, after a lengthy stay in Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Now a review released today has called for a host of lessons to be learned after several agencies fell short in sharing information that could have highlighted the baby's vulnerability. According to a report, Mary's family, who lived in Liverpool, were well-known to social services and had been reported five times amid concerns of alcohol abuse, domestic violence and child neglect. A school had also raised concerns about the way other children in the family were being brought up. Mary was the youngest child in a family of four children born to a mother aged 30 and a father aged 33. At the time of her death, her siblings were one, eight and 10. Her parents came to the attention of social care unit Careline five times between 2008 and 2012. Mary's siblings' school had already raised concerns that the two eldest children were overweight, staying off school and left to look after their baby brother while their parents stayed in bed. Mary was born 12 weeks early at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in January 2013 and was diagnosed with a number of medical conditions, including a heart murmur. She was kept in hospital for three months during which time there were 'several consecutive days' in which she had no contact with her parents. After she was discharged from hospital and into her parents' care, a number of community nurse follow-up visits were scheduled. But the nurse was unable to get access to the family despite visiting them three times in one week. A fourth visit was successful but later appointments were not kept. A day before Mary died in July 2013, a health visitor went to the home but was stopped at the door. A post-mortem revealed the presence 'at very low levels' of cocaine, tramadol and mirtazapine (an anti-depressant) in her stomach. Police also found empty beer cans, drugs and a syringe on the premises and her mother admitted to the police that she used cocaine and cannabis in the home. Because of a lack of evidence, a coroner ruled the cause of Mary’s death was 'unascertained' as it was ruled the traces of drugs, which could have come from the environment or through resuscitation attempts, were not considered to have directly led to her death. A post-mortem revealed the presence of cocaine, pictured, at 'very low levels' as well as tramadol and mirtazapine, an anti depressant (file picture) The report said: 'Whilst agencies had some concerns about the older children, they generally worked to single rather than multi-agency agendas and processes. 'There was some evidence of good informal liaisons such as between the school and the education welfare officer, or the school and school nurse, but generally the level of inter-agency communication required to support a family with four children was not achieved. 'Child Mary was a vulnerable child and a discussion between health professionals may well have highlighted important information about [the mother’s] history of not engaging with health services in respect of her children and the shared information may have led to further action.' But Liverpool Safeguarding Children Board, which compiled the independent report, said it was impossible to tell if the death of baby Mary – not her real name – could have been avoided. Chairman Howard Cooper said: 'Predicting the likelihood of such an outcome for a vulnerable baby is difficult to achieve with any meaningful degree of accuracy. 'It cannot be inferred that child Mary’s death was preventable, but there are lessons to be learned for all the agencies involved with this family about multi-agency working.” Mr Cooper said a number of recommendations had been made in the wake of the infant's death to improve working relationships between agencies tasked with supporting vulnerable children and their families. The 10 findings made by the board included an assessment that the follow-up services by Mary’s hospital and community health services were “ineffective” for a vulnerable baby in the care of parents with a “very poor history of co-operation”. The panel also criticised the lack of a multi-agency system for monitoring missed medical appointments, resulting in “potentially significant” signs of neglect being missed.","Infant, known as Mary, was also found with two other drugs in her system .

It was this embarrassing incident that inspired the mother-of-one to make a dramatic change to her diet and exercise routine losing 7st in as many months . This was the final straw for the full-time mum who had been left battling depression and anxiety after gorging on fast-food and ballooning to 17 stone. Determined Shauna has since dropped seven stone and now weighs in at just over 10 stone. Shauna made fast progress as she began to eat healthily, she lost four stone in as many months reaching 13st by December, 2014. She then hit the gym and shifted another three stone and has started a new relationship with boyfriend Curtis Grayson, 21. Before shedding the weight Shauna battled with depression because of her size . And 5ft 2in Shauna insists she's never been happier. She says if she had not got stuck in that ride her life would never have changed for the better. 'I was addicted to takeaways and I've never felt so low,' she said. 'When we got to go through to the ride I got stuck in the turnstile and Lacey started crying. 'Everyone was looking at me and I felt so humiliated so I had to do something about it. 'You can see in the photo taken when I finally got out just how upset Lacey is.' Shauna swapped her daily treats of chips and pizza for a high protein diet of chicken and fish . Shauna is now a regular at the gym going up to five times a week with running being her workout of choice . Before her weight loss Shauna would feast on fish and chips on the daily as well as donner meat pizzas but has now traded them in for a 1,500 calorie-a-day diet of chicken and fish. As well as her change in diet Shauna heads to the Energize ladies gym in Workington for an hour a day, up to five times a week, tackling the treadmill and the cross-trainer in her bid to keep fit. Shauna says that it was taking to the treadmill that really helped her to shift her extra pounds. 'I look at the pants I used to wear and they are like a tent - and they used to be tight, I could barely get into them,' she said. Shauna is now more confident than ever and is even prepared to take Lacey swimming . 'I can't believe I used to wear stuff that big. But I started walking on the treadmill at first and I've gradually got faster until the point that I was running and it's made a big difference.' And the change has boosted her confidence so much that she is prepared to even take Lacey swimming for the first time. Shauna said: 'I've never been able to take Lacey swimming before because I've been too conscious of my body to wear a swimsuit. 'I'm excited to finally take her to the pool. 'I don't think she's noticed the difference in me as she sees me everyday but I'm so much happier and much more active now. I feel great.'","Shauna McGlasson became trapped in the turnstiles of a fairground ride .

"A married couple were killed in a light aircraft crash as they made a surprise visit to see family during the holiday weekend. David and Margaret-Ann Rous were on an Easter getaway when their private plane crashed into hills during bad weather in the Scottish highlands. The pair had arranged a secret visit using Mr Rous’s light aircraft to see his wife’s mother and sister on an island in the Inner Hebrides on Saturday. Newlyweds: Dr Margaret-Ann and David Rous died when their light aircraft crashed into a Scottish hillside while flying from their home in Dundee to make a surprise to see family on the the Hebridean isle of Tiree . Tragedy: The couple – who had been married for less than a year – were found in the wreckage of the aircraft . But when the couple failed to turn up at the island’s airstrip and radar contact could not be made with the plane, a search party was scrambled. The wreckage of the plane and the couple’s bodies were found in hills in Argyll six hours later as aviation experts said the flight may have encountered poor visibility. Shocked residents on the island of Tiree paid tribute to the ‘wonderful’ Dr Rous, 37, who had been married to the 28-year-old structural engineer for three years. The couple, who are understood to have been planning a family and to move into a larger property, can be seen revelling in married life in photographs posted online. Alongside images of their honeymoon in Venice, one poignant photograph, posted only months before the crash, shows the smiling couple wearing headsets in a plane cockpit. Dr Rous’s sister Johann yesterday described the GP as her ‘absolute rock’, and said learning about the crash led to ‘the hardest day of my life’. Dr Rous met her husband when he visited Tiree, where she grew up, several years ago. Lives cut short: It is understood the couple were moving to a larger house and were planning to start a family . The couple lived in a £260,000 semi-detached house in Newport-on-Tay, just across the river from Dundee where Dr Rous worked as a family doctor. Neighbours said that despite Mr Rous often working away from home, the couple frequently held parties for them to make friends. Dr John Holliday, Tiree’s local doctor for almost 30 years, said: ‘I had known Margaret-Ann since the 1980s. She captivated everyone that knew her. She was absolutely gorgeous in every way. She became a much-loved GP in Dundee and I have no doubt that she was a wonderful doctor with her charm and great empathy. Surprise visit to see family: The couple were flying in Mr Rous's Piper Cherokee from Dundee, where they lived, to Tiree, where Dr Rous grew up, to spend the weekend with her mother and sister . Scouring the landscape: A Coastguard search and rescue helicopter, a Royal Navy helicopter from HMS Gannet and an air ambulance were all scrambled to make a search after radar contact with the plane was lost . ‘She immediately touched the hearts of everyone who came into contact with her.’ Paying tribute to Mr Rous, originally from Gillingham in Kent, he added: ‘He was a really nice man and a very talented structural engineer with a bright professional career ahead of him. ‘Together they made a fine couple. We can only imagine what the family must be suffering. ‘A cloud has fallen over Tiree, but the island community will come together as it always does at times like this.’ Private jet: The couple were flying in a Piper Cherokee light aircraft (like the one above) when tragedy struck . The tragedy unfolded after the couple set off from Dundee Airport in Mr Rous’s single-engine Piper Cherokee plane on Saturday. Radar contact was lost at around 1.50pm as they travelled over the remote Beinn nan Lus area of Glen Kinglass. Coastguard and Royal Navy helicopters, as well as an air ambulance, were called, and found the wreckage at 8pm on the northern side of Glen Kinglass, above Loch Etive. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch is now examining possible causes of the crash. Local aviation expert David Howitt said that the conditions were poor at the time, adding: ‘I have been taking weather readings here for 50 years, and on Saturday the weather was very, very dubious. There was some very poor visibility.’ Iain MacKinnon, part of the coastguard team that searched the area, said: ‘At the loch surface it was almost perfect visibility, but in terms of using the rescue helicopters they were very restricted.’","Dr Margaret-Ann Rous and her husband David were flying to Tiree to see her mother and sister .

"The world's highest-grossing fast food chain will be sharing a little more of its revenue with its workers, as the company revealed plans to raise wages at its restaurants across the US. McDonald's announced Wednesday that it will increase starting wages for full- and part-time employees to a dollar over the minimum wage where company-owned restaurants operate. The company said the increase will be instituted starting July 1. It expects the average wage to be more than $10 an hour by the end of 2016, up from the current rate of $9 an hour. Fattening paychecks: McDonald's announced Wednesday that it will raise starting wages at its restaurants to a dollar over minimum wage beginning July 1 . McDonald's USA owns about 10 percent of the more than 14,300 McDonald's restaurants across the country, with the rest operated as franchises that will not be subject to the pay increases. The burger brand joins other large corporations raising basic pay against a backdrop of an improving economy and public pressure to increase wages. Workers at fast food chains, including McDonald's, staged protests last year, asking companies to raise wages to $15 an hour and demanding a union. Complaints in front of the National Labor Relations Board and the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration have also alleged violations including denial of overtime pay and unsafe working conditions at the restaurant chain. Meanwhile, the economy has continued to strengthen, with the unemployment rate falling from 6.7 percent to 5.5 percent over the last year. McDonald's USA President Mike Andres told the Associated Press that only a handful of McDonald's employees joined the demonstrations and that they didn't affect the company's reputation. Demonstrations: Labor organizers with a campaign to raise fast food industry wages to $15 an hour say they are fighting to unionize low-wage workers across various sectors . 'They're not taking a toll,' Andres claimed. 'It's a very competitive environment,' Andres stated. 'A significant rationale for this plan is that we want to be the most competitive and attractive employer.' Last month, McDonald's Chief Administrative Officer Pete Bensen hinted such an announcement could be in the works. Bensen said at the time that a big part of the turnaround effort in the U.S. would be what the company is doing 'around the employment image and our employee-employer relationship.' In addition to wage increases, McDonald's says workers at company-owned stores will get paid time off. Employees who have worked for the company for at least a year and work an average of 20 hours a week will be eligible to accrue about 20 hours of paid time off a year. Workers who don't take the time off will be paid for the value of that time, McDonald's said. Kwanza Brooks, a McDonald's worker in North Carolina, called the move 'too little to make a real difference.' 'Raising wages only a little for only a small fraction isn't change. It's a pure stunt,' she said in a conference call set up by labor organizers. McDonald's US business has been struggling, with sales and customers counts at established locations falling two years in a row. In January, the company named Steve Easterbrook, its chief brand officer, as its new CEO. That change took effect last month. 'We know that a motivated workforce leads to better customer service so we believe this initial step not only benefits our employees, it will improve the McDonald's restaurant experience,' Easterbrook said in a statement Wednesday. McDonald's also said it is expanding benefits to help workers at company- and franchise-owned restaurants complete high school and college. It did not immediately provide details on that program.","The fast food chain will pay a dollar over minimum wage at its company-owned restaurants .

"Tiger Woods ended a week of speculation and debate over the state of his game by announcing on Friday that he will play next week in the Masters. The 39-year-old played an 18-hole practice round on Tuesday at Augusta National, and Golf Channel said he was seen on the practice range Friday morning at the club. 'I'm playing in the Masters,' Woods said on his website. 'It's obviously very important to me, and I want to be there. 'I've worked a lot on my game, and I'm looking forward to competing. I'm excited to get to Augusta, and I appreciate everyone's support.' Scroll down for video . Woods announced on Friday that he will be playing at the Masters in Augusta next week (above Woods at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines on February 5) He said: 'I've worked a lot on my game, and I'm looking forward to competing. I'm excited to get to Augusta' Woods, a four-time Masters champion, last competed at the Farmers Insurance Open on February 5 at Torrey Pines when he walked off the course after 11 holes because of tightness in his lower back, and after another shockingly bad display of chipping. That followed a missed cut at the Phoenix Open, where he shot a career-high 82. He will have gone nine weeks without competition when he hits his opening tee shot on Thursday at the Masters, which is not unprecedented for Woods. He went nearly five months without playing when he returned in 2010 from a crisis in his personal life that led to one of the greatest downfalls in sport, and he tied for fourth that year. Scrutiny might be even greater this time around. After two trips to Augusta National this week, Woods announced his return to the competition (above Woods at the Phoenix open on January 30) Woods hits a shot on the fourth hole during the final round of the 2013 Masters Tournament at Augusta National in April 2013 . The last time Woods took an extended break before the Masters, he had won his previous tournament at the Australian Masters. Now, his game has been in disarray over a series of injuries and another change in coaching. Woods has plunged to No. 104 in the world ranking, his lowest spot since a week before his first professional victory in 1996. He last won a tournament in August 2013 at the Bridgestone Invitational, and he has not had a top ten since the end of 2013. Woods missed the Masters last year because of back surgery to alleviate a pinched nerve. Four tournaments into his return, he again dealt with back pain and sat out the final four months of the season to fully recover and get stronger. Woods celebrated making the winning putt on the 18th green during the 2005 Masters Golf Tournament at Augusta National . But when he returned at his Hero World Challenge in December, he tied for last in an 18-man field and chipped so poorly that some analysts said he had the chipping yips. He would either duff them short or blade them over the green. At the Phoenix Open this year during the pro-am, Woods hit a bunker shot that went over the green and into the first row of bleachers. 'He's got to go out and probably exorcise some of those demons,' Paul Azinger, a former PGA champion and ESPN analyst, said Thursday. 'The first little pitch shot he's got to hit — not chip shot, the first little pitch shot he's got to hit — will be microanalyzed, and he knows that. There's a big microscope on that guy. 'I don't think he'd show up unless he feels like he solved that problem.' Woods will be closely watched during the Masters tournament next week, said former PGA champion Paul Azinger (above Phil Mickelson shakes hands with Woods after he won the Masters in 2005) A week after withdrawing in the middle of his round at Torrey Pines, Woods announced that his game and scores were unacceptable and he would not return until he felt he could compete at the highest level. When he skipped the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, he said he hoped to be ready for the Masters and would continue working. Second-hand reports have ranged from Woods playing well at his home club of The Medalist in South Florida to making five birdies in a round of 74 at Augusta National earlier this week. Next week, he will be playing his first major since turning 39 in December. No player has won more than three major titles beyond his 39th birthday.","Four-time Masters champion made the announcement on Friday .

"Jen Psaki thought the offer to be President Barack Obama's communications director wouldn't last long. She figured White House chief of staff Denis McDonough hadn't heard she's expecting a baby girl in July. 'My immediate instinct in my head was to tell him I'm pregnant and this will be the end of this. He'll tell me good luck and be very kind about it and I'll be on my merry way,' said Psaki, who was serving as chief spokeswoman at the State Department. Instead McDonough - and later Obama himself - assured Psaki they would accommodate her needs as a new mom amid the West Wing's nonstop demands. She started in the post Wednesday and is one of two pregnant women serving as assistant to the president — a first for such a top level adviser in Obama's presidency and practically unheard of under previous presidents. A family-friendly administration: Obama aides Katie Fallon (left) and Jen Psaki (right) are expecting babies in May and July of this year. High-ranking female administration officials becoming pregnant  is virtually unheard of . What to expect when your expecting...in the White House: Psaki (left) says the White House knew she was pregnant when she was being considered for the communications director job, and that Mr Obama called her personally and assured her that maternity leave would not be an issue . Caring: Fallon (left) says the president is constantly checking up on her health, making sure she's attending her doctor's appointments. She is currently serving as the president's legislative director . Rahm Emanuel, Obama's first chief of staff and now Chicago mayor, once remarked that every White House says they'll be family-friendly, but it's never really a good workplace for any family except the president's. Yet Obama has pushed family-friendly policies like childcare, flexibility and paid leave, including instituting 12 weeks paid maternity leave for his own staff. But until now, he hasn't put it into practice in a very prominent way with few mothers of young children on his own senior team. 'All workplaces are adapting and that includes the White House,' said Obama legislative director Katie Beirne Fallon. She is scheduled to give birth to identical twin boys in May, just as her husband, Brian, plans to start as press secretary for Hillary Rodham Clinton's impending presidential campaign in New York. President Obama makes an effort himself to have dinner with his wife and daughters most nights. The first family pictured above in a portrait for Easter. From left: 16-year-old Malia Obama, Michelle Obama, Barack Obama and Sasha Obama, 13, with dogs Sunny and Bo . Fallon said she made it clear when she took her job that they were trying to start a family. She said everyone has been accommodating - from cooks at the mess hall where her lunch orders have included a baked potato topped with tuna fish and frozen yogurt with Raisin Bran, all the way up to the president. 'He's constantly checking in on me,' she said, urging her not to miss doctor's appointments and to put her health first. 'Don't let us get in the way of that,' she said he's told her. Fallon and Psaki both say they envision working more flexible hours so they can put their babies to bed. Press secretary Josh Earnest - one of several new fathers in the West Wing - says he tries to get home once a week before his baby is asleep. Obama tries to make it to dinner every night with his wife and daughters. 'I don't think it would be appropriate for me to be home at 6:30 every night in the way that he is,' Earnest said at a Center for American Progress forum. But he said Obama's actions signal to staff they can make family a priority. Times have changed. Joan Baggett Calambokidis, President Bill Clinton's political director, is one of the only other assistants to the president that former White House aides can remember having a baby on the job. She spent her delivery taking calls from the West Wing to discuss the choice of a new party chair. 'The doctor said, ""I see the baby's head, you have to get off the phone,""' she said. After Calambokidis returned from maternity leave, a newspaper reported her doctor advised her to resign for health reasons because the job was too stressful - a rumor she said was fabricated to push her out. 'You can take off four months but you aren't able to be in there to do the turf battles that you need to do,' she said. New on the job: Psaki started her new job as White House communications director on Wednesday, after serving in the same position for the State Department. Mr Obama pictured above walking with Psaki into the West Wing of the White House . 'All workplaces are adapting and that includes the White House,' Fallon said. Pictured above with Mr Obama walking out of the West Wing last year . Rhonda Keenum was a mother of 1-year-old triplets when she started as President George W. Bush's director of public liaison - a deputy assistant to the president. She was shocked to get pregnant again at 44 - and she wasn't the only one. Keenum said Bush pointed at her aboard Air Force One and said, 'I want to know how that happened,' as the first lady kicked him under the table. 'I said, ""Sir, I got knocked up."" It was the only time I ever was irreverent with him.' Keenum said she took just two weeks maternity leave - the White House a welcome getaway from four in diapers at home. 'I knew the White House opportunity was short-term and motherhood was not.' Psaki said as she discussed whether to take the job with her husband, Greg Mecher, chief of staff to Massachusetts Democratic Representative Joe Kennedy, Obama called and personally pledged to support her needs. She said he told her, 'My wife would be mad if I didn't convey that having a baby is a wonderful experience and the best thing I'll ever do, but it's also hard. And we'll make it work.'","White House Communications Director Jen Psaki is expecting a baby girl in July; Legislative Director Katie Fallon has a May due date for twin boys .

"The devastated fiance of the late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough has written an emotional letter to her followers, revealing she was undergoing radiation treatment in her final weeks and 'giggling and drinking green smoothies' in her hospital bed until the day she died. Ms Ainscough, 30, died in late February following a lengthy fight with a rare and aggressive form of cancer known as epithelioid sarcoma. She spurned chemotherapy and radiation, choosing to fight the cancer with a controversial treatment known as Gerson Therapy, which involves a vegan diet and coffee enemas and does not have scientific support. But after discussions with 'oncologists, healers and specialists around the world', in her final weeks - the most 'difficult' weeks of her fight - Ms Ainscough began a course of targeted radiation, her partner Tallon Pamenter has revealed. 'This was a risky and tough decision, but Jess bravely embraced this last chance option,' he said. Jessica Ainscough (left) was planning to marry her partner Tallon Pamenter this year. She died after a long fight with cancer in February . 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life,' Mr Pamenter said . Tribute: Jessica Ainscough died in late February after a seven-year-long battle with cancer . 'In true wellness warrior style, we integrated our natural healing regime with the recommended radiation. 'Finally the walls were broken down between conventional and unconventional medicine - I don't know why as a society we must choose one or the other. 'This was something Jess was looking forward with sharing (with her followers). It was an exciting evolution from her earlier days of feeling that she had to be part of one extreme world or the other.' Mr Pamenter said the six weeks of her radiation were among the toughest the couple - who were planning to marry this year - had been through. 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included.' The radiation successfully managed to shrink the tumour but 'some complications arose during the final stages of treatment'. 'Not long after, the words I LOVE YOU would leave my lips only to fall softly upon Jess's ears for the last time. 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since.' 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included,' She 'showed (her partner Tallon) what it means to live in a world full of love', he said in his tribute . 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since' 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life. 'I have been taken to a place so foreign and unknown with no navigational bearing on how to get back. 'Loved ones tell me to be strong during this time... but the thing is I don't want to be strong... I want to cry when I'm sad, yell when I'm angry and smile during those fleeting moments of happiness brought on by the memories we created together. 'I want to sit in silence and be present with every single emotion that decides to show up. 'It's in those moments I feel closest to her.' Ms Ainscough made the decision to undergo radiation after the fungating tumour in her left shoulder became large and painful. It began to interfere with her 'ability to enjoy her favourite things like walking our furbabies on the beach', Mr Parmenter said. Mr Pamenter told Daily Mail Australia she planned to tell her followers about her new treatment just days after she passed away. Ms Ainscough was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 when she was 22 and working at Dolly magazine, a favourite of teenage girls. She initially underwent targeted chemotherapy to her left arm, according to reports, but the cancer returned a year later. She also refused doctors' advice to have her left arm amputated. Jessica's mother was also diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by her daughter's fight, she also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. Mr Pamenter said his partner 'showed me what it means to live in a world full of love'. She was laid to rest in early March.","Devastated fiance of late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough writes touching tribute to followers .

"Ed Miliband has been getting a lot of praise for admitting that he ‘blubbed’ while watching Pride, a British film released last year. It’s a rose-tinted, nostalgic look back at a critical moment in 20th-century British history. Every drop of sentiment is wrung out of the story, with brave young men and women risking their lives to take on an evil dictator. So what is it about, this heartwarming tale of British derring-do? The Battle of Britain? The Falklands crisis? The Iraq War? Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband confessed that he 'blubbed' during the British film Pride that centres on the 1984 miners' strike . No. It centres on the 1984 miners’ strike and the plucky underdogs are a London-based group of gays and lesbians who travel to South Wales to express their solidarity with the local branch of the National Union of Mineworkers. Needless to say, the evil dictator who they’re fighting is Margaret Thatcher. Miliband received a lot of praise for admitting that he had a weep . What a surprise that such a storyline led the Labour leader to exclaim: ‘Justine [his wife] and I watched it recently and blubbed.’ I’m sure Pride isn’t the only British film that the right-on Milibands will have cried their way through. For there have been so many over recent years that mythologised the ‘brave and downtrodden’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories. In truth, these movies — Pride, Billy Elliot (also a piece of miners’ strike propaganda that depicted Thatcher as the Devil incarnate), Made In Dagenham (about a car factory strike) and The Full Monty (about a group of redundant Sheffield steelworkers forced to strip naked to make money) —might as well have been party political broadcasts for Labour. For the keystone of these Left-wing propaganda films is a pernicious rewriting of history, portraying Britain’s recent past as a battle between heroic trade unionists, fighting to defend the poor and the vulnerable, and unfeeling bosses, bulldozing everything in their path in the ruthless pursuit of making money for their capitalist overlords. There is no acknowledgment by the film-makers that the unions’ greed and bully-boy tactics all but destroyed the British economy, or that their beloved welfare state (which has actually created a terrible dependency culture in many parts of the country) relies on a strong, unsabotaged economy to keep it afloat. The film Pride achieves a double whammy by venerating not one but two sacred cows of the Left: bolshie unions and minorities (in this case, homosexuals). Naturally, it doesn’t take long for the union bosses to recognise that the life-and-death struggle faced by gays and lesbians is very similar to that of their Welsh colliery members. Scroll down for video . Wringing every drop of emotion from Left-wing audiences, the director ends the film with a scene showing bus-loads of miners turning up to support a gay pride march in London’s Hyde Park, as singer Billy Bragg’s There Is Power In A Union comes blasting over the soundtrack. Strangely absent from the story, of course, is any reference to the role the NUM played in bringing down successive British governments — both Conservative and Labour alike — and its contribution to the terrible industrial unrest that gripped Britain in the Seventies and culminated in the Winter of Discontent. Nor is there any mention of the attempt by Arthur Scargill, the loony-Left leader of the NUM, to persuade communist Russia — not to mention Colonel Gaddafi — to bankroll the strike, which his members hadn’t even had the right to vote for in a fair ballot. Billy Elliott is another film about ‘brave and downtrodden’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories . The same historical revisionism is exhibited in Made In Dagenham, about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. As with Pride, the dramatic heart of the story is a conflict between two groups of Left-wing activists who gradually learn to make common cause — in this case, male and female shop-floor workers. At no point in the film is any sympathy shown towards the employers struggling to keep the firm competitive. The viewer is expected to assume that the demands of the strikers are completely justified. Made In Dagenham’s political message couldn’t be clearer, and it ends on a triumphant note with the passing of the Equal Pay Act by a Labour government in 1970. A more honest assessment of the British car industry would have featured the way union firebrands such as Derek Robinson — ‘Red Robbo’ — at British Leyland helped to destroy it and did so much damage to the economy at large. Indeed, a more realistic ending to Made In Dagenham would have pointed out that the Ford factory which once employed 40,000 people now has fewer than 4,000, thanks, in part, to rising labour costs — pushed up by militant unions. Brassed off starring Pete Postlethwaite and Ewan McGregor portrayed Margaret Thatcher as an orge . Then again, that would have meant acknowledging the inconvenient truth that the trade unions played a big role in the postwar decline of Britain’s industrial base. Perhaps the most glaring omission from such Left-wing propaganda movies is any concession that the policies of Margaret Thatcher were a necessary corrective to the chaos and pessimism of the Seventies. The fact is that her government inherited a country on the brink of political and economic collapse and restored it to rude good health, able to hold its head up high again in the world. But in so many Left-inspired British films of the past 25 years, whether Brassed Off (about a colliery band facing the closure of their coalmine by a Tory government), The Full Monty or Billy Elliot, Thatcher is portrayed as a wrecking ball determined to destroy traditional working-class communities and replace nice Left-wing values with nasty Right-wing ones. Inevitably, the period before Thatcher is depicted as a golden age, a pastoral idyll straight out of a Hovis commercial, while the Britain she left behind is portrayed as a money-grubbing spiritual wasteland. Is it any wonder that such films make Ed Miliband, brought up by a Marxist academic father, ‘blub’? The only exception to this disgraceful series of truth-twisting films was The Iron Lady, in which Britain’s first female Prime Minister was shown in a more nuanced light, almost in spite of its makers’ Left-wing instincts. Made In Dagenham is about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. It is broadly unsympathetic — there are plenty of scenes in which she is seen to be suffering from dementia, which suggests an element of hostility — but actress Meryl Streep brings such depth and humanity to the lead role that Baroness Thatcher emerges as a more complex figure than the bogeyman of Left-wing mythology. Not surprisingly, The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being ‘shallow’ and ‘superficial’, an example of ‘self-important’ film-making. No doubt if it had depicted Thatcher as a cruel monster, the same critics would have acclaimed it an out-and-out masterpiece. But not to worry. This mistake was corrected the following year by Labour-supporting Danny Boyle. In his lavish £27 million opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics he made no direct reference to Britain’s greatest postwar Prime Minister — which was odd in itself — but left viewers in no doubt about his view of Thatcherism. Once again we were treated to the familiar Left-wing version of Britain’s history, in which top-hatted Tory industrialists, determined to despoil the country with dark satanic mills, are stopped in their tracks by an alliance of suffragettes, trade unionists and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activists. Boyle’s collaborator, Frank Cottrell Boyce, condemned Thatcher for being ‘insufficiently British’ and said ‘although she draped herself in the Union Flag, she never seemed to understand this country’. The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being ‘shallow’ and ‘superficial’, an example of ‘self-important’ film-making . The truth is, it’s the Left that doesn’t understand contemporary Britain. We are not a drab, depressed country, riven with class divisions and grotesque inequality, as you would think from watching films such as Pride and Billy Elliot. On the contrary, crime is lower, life expectancy higher and the standard of living better than at any time in our past. The rights of women, gays and ethnic minorities are all robustly defended by politicians of both Left and Right, and our schools and hospitals have never been better (or more lavishly funded). Britain now has the fastest-growing economy in the Western world, with more jobs being created last year in Yorkshire — ironically, the county where so many of these Left-wing propaganda films have been set — than in the whole of France. Couldn’t we have just one home-grown film that celebrates the miracle that is modern Britain and brings a tear of pride to us all, rather than Left-wing drivel that triggers ‘blubbing’ from Ed Miliband?","Ed Miliband has admitted that he cried watching the British film Pride .

"A workman caught hanging out the door of a van travelling at 85mph down the motorway says he was only doing it because he needed some fresh air. The man, wearing an orange high-vis jacket, could be seen leaning out the sliding door of the black Vauxhall Vivaro van as it hurtled down the outside lane of the M40 near Oxford. He appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the KJ Rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicle. Today his boss, who has called the man in for a disciplinary hearing, revealed that the man claims he was only leaning out of the door because he wasn't feeling unwell and needed some fresh air. These shocking pictures show a workman hanging out of the door of a van as it speeds down the M40 . The man can be seen leaning out the side door of the black Vauxhall Vivaro van as it hurtled down the outside lane of the motorway . The incident, which police are investigating, is believed to have gone on for five minutes as the man pulled off the 'stunt' just yards from lorries. Dave Roy, a director at KJ Rail, said the man, the driver and their colleagues in the van would be hauled before a disciplinary hearing tomorrow morning. 'We're taking a robust approach to this and all of them will be in for a full disciplinary meeting first thing tomorrow,' he said. 'He's told me he was leaning out the door for some fresh air because he was feeling unwell and the next services were miles away. Having seen the pictures I'm not so sure. 'KJ Rail does not condone this sort of behaviour and takes a firm stance against it.' Mr Roy said the man could face the sack for the incident, which was captured by dentist James Hobkirk as he made his way down the M40, travelling south from Manchester to Kent. 'My wife was driving and she spotted something strange in the rear view mirror,' Mr Hobkirk, 37, said. He appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the KJ Rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicle . The incident, which police are investigating, went on for five minutes, as the man pulled off the 'stunt' just yards from lorries . 'I turned around and there was this guy in the outside lane hanging out of the van, saluting people as he went past. 'We were travelling about 65 in the middle lane and he came flying up behind us. He must have been doing about 80, 85. 'He was just hanging out the side door for about five minutes. He's obviously a complete nut job. 'People were moving in to the middle lane to get out of the way. It's like he was surfing. 'There were about four people in the back of the van and two in the front. They were all laughing. 'It's not just dangerous, he was an idiot. Going high speed in the outside lane and doing that is crazy.' KJ Rail, which owns the van, said it was investigating and that the man was likely to be punished . Thames Valley Police are also investigating the incident, which took place on Friday afternoon. A spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police received a report of a man hanging out of a side door of a vehicle while travelling on the M40 motorway between junctions 9 and 8a southbound on Friday at 1.15pm. 'Officers attended the scene and carried out an area search however the vehicle was not located. Enquiries are ongoing to trace the occupants of the vehicle.' Philip Goose, senior community engagement officer at Brake, the road safety charity, said: 'Driving is the most dangerous thing we do on a daily basis. 'It is worth remembering that five people die every day on roads in the UK, and being in charge of a heavy, fast moving object has the potential to, and regularly does, kill and seriously injure individuals and tears apart families. 'Driving deserves our full attention, and irresponsible behaviour such as this and driving at excessive speed greatly increases the chance of being involved in a fatal or life-changing crash.'","Man seen leaning out of sliding door of work van in middle of motorway .

"Bumping into Peter Stringfellow in Mothercare in Palma just over a year ago was not such a big surprise, since we both have houses in Majorca where I now live most of the year. However, it was a scene that would have amused anyone who had known us both, or had read about us in gossip columns, in our heyday in the Eighties. There we were, two gentlemen in our 70s; me, a former newspaper editor and Peter a well-known businessman, with more than our fair share of silver hair. We were both pushing a buggy with a tiny baby inside: me, my son Ben, now four, who was born when I was 73; Peter, his daughter Rosabella, who arrived when he was 72. Our beautiful and much younger wives (a 40-year gap in his case, 25 in mine) were there too and it was smiles and congratulations all round. Donald Trelford (left) had his son Ben (back right) when he was 73 and his daughter Poppy (held by Donald) when he was 76-years-old . Since then Claire, 52, and I have had a second child, Poppy, while it has just been announced that 74-year-old Peter and Bella are expecting a sibling for their 20-month-old daughter. I was 76 when Poppy came along last May, making me, I believe, the oldest living British new father. So what advice could I give to other would-be septuagenarian fathers? Well, I know from experience that two children are more than twice the work of one. You have two minds and sensitivities to cope with, so to prevent jealousy equal attention is essential. For example, as she is only ten months old, Poppy’s cot is in our bedroom. Much effort is required to stop Ben thinking he is being excluded when he sleeps on his own. Then there’s the feeding, the nappy changing, the crying in the night and the wearying lack of sleep. The sheer physical effort of coping with children at this age can be demanding. So much so that I have to take a brisk daily walk and use an exercise bike and some modest weights to revive my shrinking muscles. After all, toddlers can be heavy and buggies even heavier. Then there is the manhandling of a mountain of luggage whenever we travel: suitcases, car seats, pushchairs, carry-cots and toys. Travelling with children is not easy, anyway, as I once discovered when I was bringing Ben back to Majorca on my own after a family trip to the UK. We were in the two seats nearest the window, with a rather formidable-looking lady, casually flicking through the pages of a style magazine, in the aisle seat. The plane had just taken off and was still climbing (with the lavatory off-limits) when I detected a terrible smell. Ben’s nappy had overflowed on to the seat (note to nappy manufacturers: make them higher at the back). I worked away frantically with wet wipes and a plastic bag, worrying about the people sitting nearby. Fortunately, the lady in the aisle seat appeared to be lacking any sense of sight, hearing or smell. Donald (pictured with Ben and Poppy) says the physical effort of coping with young children at his age can be demanding but he takes daily walks and uses an exercise bike to keep fit . Ben and I managed to edge our way to the loo without making eye contact with other passengers and thankfully things were soon put right. I know EasyJet has hundreds of planes; even so, if any reader is flying with them, I would avoid seat 4F, just in case. Besides the occasional blip, raising a child, no matter your age, is a huge pleasure. Feeding a baby its bottle is one of the great joys of life for a father and one of the few things one ever does that is unquestionably useful. However, when you are in your 70s, levering yourself out of a deep armchair afterwards and transferring baby to cot without waking it is quite a physical achievement. I think it should be included as an Olympic event for the over-75s. Now I am 77 and I can think of many moments I have shared with my young children which never fail to bring a smile to my face; mainly because I never dreamt I would be experiencing such moments at this age. There was the afternoon I spent catching popcorn fired from a cannon in a Spanish square while being jostled by screaming infants. One morning, I dodged moving traffic to rescue a balloon for my son before the car wheels crushed it — or me. During a lively fiesta I paraded one child dressed as an ant and another as a strawberry before bumping into my Spanish bank manager, herself dressed as a plum. Then there is the novelty of exchanging pleasantries in halting Spanish at my son’s school gates with yummy mummies who must be at least 50 years younger than me. Majorca is thankfully a marvellous place for bringing up children, and not only because the Spanish simply idolise them. Claire and I began going there for holidays shortly after we met in 1997 and eventually we decided to make a permanent move. We now live in a beautiful finca, or country estate, on the side of a hill with mountain views all around and the sea only a few miles away. There is a big garden with an orchard, in which Ben and I pick oranges off our trees and he takes them away in his little wheelbarrow and puts them though the juicer himself while standing on a kitchen stool. You couldn’t do that in Coventry, my birthplace. When Ben started at the Escoleta (nursery school), I used to take him there in a pushchair, then go into the main square for a coffee with the empty chair. On one of these journeys, a friend who understood the Catalan spoken there says she heard an old Majorcan woman say to her neighbour: ‘The old man has forgotten the baby again.’ Surprisingly, I have been mistaken for Ben’s grandfather only twice (at least to my face). I have four grown-up children from earlier marriages. Once, during a get-together in a restaurant, some pushy and very nosey British tourists at the next table insisted on knowing more about the puzzling family beside them. I declared proudly: ‘This is my son Paul — he is 44; this is my son Ben — he is two.’ In fact, the gap between my oldest and youngest daughters is even bigger: 49 years. Thankfully, the older children are very happy about the new arrivals and couldn’t wait to see them. The eldest of my six grandchildren, who is 14, sent his new-born Uncle Ben a note: ‘Hope the birth went well.’ My youngest grandchild is one-month-old. The biggest drawback with a baby at this age is the freedom it steals. The new arrival needs constant attention. Whereas before I could write if I felt like it, or go for a walk, or read a book, or watch some sport on TV, there is now a prior, and sometimes rather insistent, call on my time. Even though you have been through it before, there are always anxieties with tiny babies. Before Poppy was born, we were warned she might not survive due to a medical condition suffered by my wife. When Poppy arrived fit and healthy via a Caesarean, the doctors had to give Claire emergency pain relief for several hours, during which time I was left holding the baby. Talking to her during those first hours was a strangely surreal, precious experience. Before leaving the hospital in Palma we had to complete some forms but the officials flatly refused to believe my date of birth and wouldn’t let us go until I had dug out my passport to prove it. Thankfully, Claire and Poppy both emerged none the worse for their respective ordeals. There had always been a nagging doubt in our minds that, given our ages, there was a risk of abnormality, but both our babies are strong and beautiful. Along with the inevitable anxieties there are many small pleasures of late-life parenthood: the warming smile of recognition in the morning, that look of unconditional love, the noisy ecstasies of splash-time in the bath, the heart-bursting pride as baby takes its first steps. I look at Ben’s face sometimes, his stubborn assertion of his identity, and feel a surge of love that comes from somewhere very deep inside. There is a sadder side to having tiny children at my age, in that I won’t live to see them as adults, maybe not even in their teens. I also have to face the fact that they may hardly remember me at all in later life. For them, too, there is the inevitable trauma of losing a parent while they are young. But then some children lose their parents anyway; I have known two fathers who died at 51, one of them before seeing his child. To say that I should not have had children at my age would have left my wife childless, for she has not been married before nor had any previous children. That is a big call for anyone to make about other people’s lives. A curious family oddity is that my father was born in 1911 and Ben in 2011; my mother was born in 1914 and Poppy in 2014. We called her Poppy before realising how appropriate a name it was for someone born on the centenary of World War I. I have to admit that it can be a strange and unsettling experience being so old a new father, especially when both children look like me (friends call Ben ‘a little Donald’). You can’t help thinking: ‘In my end is my beginning.’ Whatever happens, one can only hope that these late-coming Trelfords will get as much fun out of life as their old man.","What's it like to become a new parent in your seventies?

"Former Hewlett Packard head Carly Fiorina is attributing the years-long drought in California to 'liberal environmentalists,' whom she says brought on the state's water shortage with their policies. 'It is a man-made disaster,' she told Glenn Beck during a Monday radio interview. 'With different policies over the last 20 years, all of this could be avoided.' The 'tragedy' of California, Fiorina, a maybe presidential candidate, said, is it 'has suffered from droughts for millennia,' and still 'liberal environmentalists have prevented the building of a single new reservoir or a single new water conveyance system over decades during a period in which California’s population has doubled.' Scroll down for video . Former Hewlett Packard head  and maybe Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina is attributing the years-long drought in California to 'liberal environmentalists,' whom she says brought on the state's water shortage with their policies. 'California is a classic case of liberals being willing to sacrifice other people’s lives and livelihoods at the altar of their ideology. It’s a tragedy,' Fiorina, a one-time California Senate candidate, told Beck, on Blaze Radio station. With the drought stretching into its fourth year, California's Democratic Governor Jerry Brown last week signed an executive order limiting water consumption. Excluded from the new restrictions, however, was the agricultural industry, which is responsible for 80 percent of the state's water usage. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill at the end of last year allowing water to be redistributed from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to drought-affected areas of the state, but the legislation died in the then-Democratically-controlled Senate. The measure was opposed by environmental groups, who said the water transportation system would disrupt the habitat of certain fish species, and the White House had said the president would veto the bill if it passed. Zeroing in on President Barack Obama, Fiorina, a Republican, said Monday, that '[he] goes out to California a little over a year ago, calls it a tragedy of global warming and hands out money to a food bank.' 'This is all about politics and policy, and it is liberal environmentalists who have brought us this tragedy,' she continued. Fiorina, now a resident of Virginia, was referring to the president's February 2014 visit to San Luis Obispo. There he pledged to give California's food banks $60 million in aid, in addition to monies he said the state's farmers would receive, $15 million, and monies that were set aside for watershed improvement measures. Zeroing in on President Barack Obama, Fiorina said Monday, that '[he] goes out to California a little over a year ago, calls it a tragedy of global warming and hands out money to a food bank.''This is all about politics and policy, and it is liberal environmentalists who have brought us this tragedy,' she continued. Obama is pictured here in Palm Springs during the trip Fiorina referred to . One of the so-called liberal environmental groups that Fiorina blamed on Monday for the state's water woes later told the Huffington Post that the Republican politician's argument was 'irrational.' Knocking her as 'a science denier,' NextGen Climate said it was rich for Fiorina 'to opine that Democrats caused the drought in California.' That's 'about as irrational as believing someone who failed at running a business in California and then failed as a candidate for office in California has any cause to be running for the highest office in the land,' the organization's spokesman, Bobby Whithorne, said. Another group, the Sierra Club, took issue with the scientific aspect of her claims. 'For more than 100 years, environmentalists have failed to stop the damming of nearly every significant river in California. And yet all of the hundreds of dams out there have done nothing to produce rain or snow pack over the last four years,' Kathryn Phillips, director of the California chapter of the national organization, said, according to the Huffington Post. 'That's because you can't store what's not there,' she said. 'We simply don't have rain or snow pack and are suffering the worst California drought since water agencies and weather trackers started keeping records.' A spokeswoman for Fiorina doubled down her boss' claims in an email to Daily Mail Online, saying, 'It is clear that the radical environmental lobby would prefer to ignore the facts on this one.' 'We aren't storing rainfall or building water conveyance systems in California because they are willing to put fish before people,' Fiorina spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said. Taking the argument a step further, Flores asserted that 'over 300 billion gallons of water are diverted away from farmers in the Central Valley and into the San Francisco Bay in order to protect the Delta smelt, an endangered fish that environmentalists have continued to champion at the expense of Californians.' 'Meanwhile, the President is touting the money he is sending to food banks but refuses to do anything about the 70% of rainfall that is going out to sea,' she added. 'Those aren't talking points. Those are the facts.'","'It is a man-made disaster,' she said. 'With different policies over the last 20 years, all of this could be avoided'

"Ben Hagon's (pictured) high-powered Mercedes sports car crashed into Tara McIntyre leaving her with life-changing injuries . A driver  destroyed a young woman's life when he smashed into her car after taking a lethal cocktail of drink and prescription drugs has been jailed. Tara McIntyre, 24, was left virtually wheelchair-bound after Ben Hagon's high-powered Mercedes sports car crashed into her at up to 75mph, a court heard. She had just popped out to the shops in her small KA when she was hit by the drunk-driver and suffered the life-changing injuries which included a fractured spine and pelvis. The court heard that Hagon, who already had a conviction for drink-driving in 2003, had taken prescription tranquilisers and was more than twice the legal alcohol limit when got behind the wheel. Judge David Turner branded Hagon's driving 'madness' - and accused him of changing Miss McIntyre's life for the worse for ever. Sentencing him to two years and eight months in prison, Judge Turner said: 'Miss McIntyre went on what ought to have been a simple shopping trip and has been left with injuries which are literally life changing. 'She will be dependent on others for help for the rest of her life. The medical consequences have been utterly traumatic.' 'This personal catastrophe has been brought about fully by those moments of madness in your driving. 'I accept you feel considerable remorse. This is frankly as bad a piece of driving in combination one can imagine.' Hagon was overtaking a line of cars on the A131 at High Garrett, near Braintree, Essex (pictured) when he ploughed into the side of Miss McIntyre's Ford Ka . Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Hagon was overtaking a line of cars on the A131 at High Garrett, near Braintree, Essex, when he ploughed into the side of Miss McIntyre's Ford Ka as she waited to turn right. One eye-witness estimated he was hitting 75mph in the 40mph stretch of road in his 54-plate Mercedes SLK. But others said his speed was closer to 50-60mph before the horrifying smash  at about 2.15pm on February 2 last year. Police crash investigators found that Hagon had made no attempt to brake. Miss McIntyre was rushed to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, by air ambulance suffering head injuries, a fractured spine and pelvis, and a cut to her artery. She spent the next three months in hospital, including some time in an induced coma, and a further two months in a special rehabilitation facility. Miss McIntyre was rushed to Addenbrooke's Hospital after the crash with terrible head injuries, a fractured spine and pelvis . The formerly independent young woman now needs help with basic day-to-day tasks and has been told she will spend most of her life in a wheelchair as she is only able to walk just 60 yards with a stick. She was also left partially sighted and had to learn to speak again after brain damage caused by the crash. Miss McIntyre's boyfriend, who was sitting beside her in the front seat, amazingly escaped with minor injuries, as did Hagon. Jane Oldfield, prosecuting, said Hagon had been banned for drink-driving in October 2003. She also said Miss McIntyre's devastated parents were now having to move house as their home could not be adapted sufficiently to care for their seriously-disabled daughter. Hagon, of Halstead, Essex, had been out drinking the night before and downed Champagne, three pints of beer and a jug of cocktail, the court heard. A blood test calculated he had 161 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood- double the legal limit. Hagon admitted drink-driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was jailed for two years eight months at Chelmsford Crown Court (pictured) He had also swallowed prescription tranquillisers as part of treatment he's having for anxiety. The court heard he had blatantly ignored advice not to drive while taking the powerful drugs after being warned that their effects would be worsened when combined with alcohol. Rakesh Sharma, defending, said Hagon was now seeking help for alcohol addiction and did not intend to ever drive again. Mr Sharma said: 'He thinks about the victim every day and can't believe what he has done.' Hagon admitted drink-driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was jailed for two years and eight months. He was also banned from driving for five years. He will have take an extended re-test if he does want to drive again. No award was made for compensation or costs due to the prison term, but Hagon must pay a victim surcharge.","Tara McIntyre, 24, was left with life-changing injuries after horrifying smash .

"When Destiny's Child reunited at the Stellar Gospel Awards in Las Vegas last weekend, it was the first time Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams performed together since appearing during the halftime show at Super Bowl in 2013 in New Orleans. Beyoncé and Kelly joined Michelle to surprise the crowd,and opened the broadcast with a gospel medley that included the song 'Alpha & Omega' and the hit single 'Say Yes' from Michelle's 'Journey To Freedom' CD. The group received a rousing standing ovation from the 9,000-plus crowd, but they weren't introduced as Destiny's child - they were introduced by their individual names. Scroll down for video . Nameless: Singers Michelle Williams, Kelly Rowland and Beyonce performing ""Say Yes"" during the 30th Annual Stellar Awards in Las Vegas last week. The singers did not refer to themselves as Destiny's Child . Touchdown: Destiny's Child perform during the Pepsi Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show in 2013 . Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively that the threesome want to do another ten-year reunion tour and intend to cut a reunion album - but they won't use the group name for that either. And it's all by design. 'Alhough Destiny's Child is made up of the three ladies, Beyoncé's father and former manager Mathew Knowles owns one-fourth of the group as well. Anytime they do anything under the name Destiny's Child, he has involvement in it and money from it,' a source close to the group reveals to Daily Mail Online. None of the members of Destiny's Child want any involvement with Mathew, who once managed each of their individual careers as well as the group. Kelly was first to fire him in 2009, Michelle followed in 2010 and Beyoncé finally nixed all dealings with her dad after accusations of stealing money from her in 2011. Mathew's marriage to Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles ended after it surfaced he had gotten a woman named Alexsandra Wright pregnant. Once she gave birth to their son Nixon, Tina filed for divorce. In 2014, it was revealed that Mathew fathered a second child, a four-year-old daughter named Koi. 'That it was claimed Mathew stole money from Beyoncé and then he sued to prove that he didn't was bad enough. But all of the extramarital affairs and children outside the marriage just made it so that Beyoncé doesn't have anything to do with her dad at all,' the source explained.

In late 2012, Beyoncé invited her dad to meet daughter Blue Ivy and to have a conversation with him that was chronicled for her HBO documentary, 'Beyoncé: Life Is But a Dream.' But after  that, says the source, she stopped communicating with him again and his only access to her is via her assistant's work email address. The trio's unwillingness to deal with Mathew is why they keep putting off a Destiny's Child reunion album and tour. Their 2005 Destiny Fulfilled tour grossed approximately $70.8 million in the U.S. alone and according to Billboard it was the highest-grossing tour for either a pop or R&B band since TLC's FanMail Tour. Beyoncé, Kelly and Michelle wanted to record a 10-year follow-up CD and launch a tour. They know both the album and tour could a huge seller and break tour records. 'The problem is they can't figure out how to nix Mathew from the deal. They all want more than anything to give the fans one last run of the group, especially since they all have their own individual success, but don't want to deal with Mathew,' the source explained. It's unlikely that Mathew would allow the women to cut any deals without him. His financial problems have been widely reported over the last year. Having once earned millions of dollars, Mathew told a court during a child support hearing in 2014 that he only made $127K in 2013 and has expenses of at $51,000 a month. Destiny's Child first album debuted in  1998 . In late 2012, Beyoncé invited her dad to meet daughter Blue Ivy and to have a conversation with him that was chronicled for her HBO documentary. But after that, says the source, she stopped communicating . Last December photos emerged of a huge garage sale he was having in Houston, where selling both Beyoncé and old Destiny's Child memorabilia to raise money. 'At best they maybe could offer him a flat rate or one-time settlement to buy out his portion of the group, but otherwise we may never get a Destiny's Child reunion because none of them want him to benefit financially,' the source concluded. Destiny's Child made their debut in 1998 with their self-titled release. The group then consisted of Beyoncé, Kelly, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett. In 1999, Mathew kicked out LaTavia and LeToya and replaced them with Michelle and a short-lived member Farrah Franklin (she barely lasted three months) before settling in as a trio. They would release four additional albums; win three Grammy Awards and go on to sell more than 60 million records worldwide. Mathew Knowles financial problems have been widely reported over the last year. Having once earned millions of dollars, Mathew told a court during a child support hearing in 2014 that he only made $127K in 2013 and has expenses of at $51,000 a month . Last December photos emerged of a huge garage sale Knowles was having in Houston, where selling both Beyoncé and old Destiny's Child memorabilia to raise money. Giant Beyonce posters sold  for $200 . T-shirts for sale: . After their breakup in 2005, Beyoncé became an international pop star with five solo albums releases and 17 Grammy wins. In addition to starring in movies like Dreamgirls, Obsessed, The Pink Panther and Cadillac Records; Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z became friends of President Barack and Michelle Obama. Kelly first became a top-selling European music superstar before finding solo success in the U.S. with hit singles like 'When Love Takes Over' and 'Motivation.' With four solo albums under her belt, she's won a Grammy Award as a solo artist and became a judge for both Simon Cowell's The X Factor UK and The X Factor US editions. Michelle was has released three chart-topping Gospel CDs and dance album called 'Unexpected.' She's also starred in multiple Broadway productions including Aida, The Color Purple, Chicago, and Fela!. In addition to co-hosting Oxygen's Fix My Choir series, she's been named a frontrunner as a new co-host for ABC's The View.","Destiny's Child reunited at the Stellar Gospel Awards in Las Vegas last weekend.

"Made famous by their 'matchy matchy' style and twin-like looks (despite the five year age difference), the Melbourne based fashion duo Jess, 22, and Stef, 27, Dadon are now set to take their crazy style collaborations to a new level. The sisters have teamed up with 'Print All Over Me' - an innovative online New York-based company that allows you to digitally design your own prints - and Buffalo shoes, the brand behind the Spice Girls' trademark platforms. Introduced to the company via a mutual friend in the U.S., the girls knew it was a match made in heaven. 'We both have a love of colour and prints and so we said lets do something crazy together,' says Stef. Scroll down for video . Quirky collab: Sister duo Jess and Stef Dadon have teamed up  with  New York company ' Print All Over Me' Cocktails and creativity: The sisters are heading to LA soon for summer to launch new shoe line 'Twoobs' The photo-shoot was their own idea, which according to Jess they 'threw together' because they didn't think the collaboration on its own had enough of their signature look that is all about over-the -top colours and accessories. While the duo look posed and polished in the pics, they let us in on a little secret, according to the 'How Two Live' girls, they insist they don't actually like modelling, despite the 1732 posts on Instagram that would suggest otherwise. 'We don’t like to model, so we decided to add wigs and sunnies so we can hide behind them and they don’t see us,' says Jess. Candy coloured palettes: Stef, 27 (left) and Jess, 22 (right) Dadon have over 111,000 followers on Instagram . Steph says they use the term 'modelling' loosely as they don't see themselves as professional models, they just happen to be in the photos showcasing the clothes. The photo shoot which took place in Sydney's Luna Park provided the perfect backdrop for the crazy, clown-like antics of the collaboration. 'They closed the park for the day so we had a couple of hours to take over and shoot. It provided the perfect creepy abandoned backdrop.' Model shy:The girls admit while they love wearing clothes, they are actually camera shy . Theme this: Sydney's theme park 'Luna Park' was the backdrop for their crazy colour pop collaboration . The shoes featured are also as part of the collaboration and are from the brand 'Buffalo Shoes' which are the same brand who sky-rocketed platforms into the mainstream  when they were famously worn by the Spice Girls during the 90s. 'We'd been collaborating with the guys from Buffalo shoes but we weren't sure what our following would think, so we posted a pic on Instagram and everyone has been dying over them - so it's had a great response,' says Jess. While the  photo shoot for their current collaboration only took a quick 45 minutes, the Dadon sisters had a lot of other projects  keeping them busy. Down-to-earth duo:  45 minutes is all it took to string together the glamour shots as seen throughout . Pop princesses: The platforms  made by Buffalo Shoes are the same company made famous by the Spice Girls . First there's their new shoe label, titled 'Twoobs,' coming out in  June in America. 'We  did a shoe collaboration with Windsor Smith a year and a half ago and once we got a taste for shoes we fell in love,' says Jess. 'This first line will be all about sandals with  flat and platform soles,'she said. According to Jess,  platforms are a must because they're much more comfortable than heels - 'you’re feet won't be sore at the end of the night and you still get the height.' Flair for fashion: With a natural knack for fashion the girls are now releasing a 'how-to' book titled #howtolive . Colour craziness: 'How To Live' have become well known thanks to their colourful Australian style . Questioned why America is their first market, the sisters admit escaping to summer weather is their biggest appeal, especially as their based most of the year in Melbourne (known for it's southerly chill). 'We’re going to go for three months then decide if we'll stay on permanently. We love L.A., and we already have a fan base and  connections to the shoe industry over there so it just made sense,' says Stef. They also have a book in the works, with the very insta-worthy title ' #howtwolive' coming out in September. Celebrity scene: In their short two and a half years of blogging they've met  Rachel Zoe and Anna Dello Russo . The book offers 36 'how-two' projects including fashion, recipes and nail art ideas. As for more collaborations? There's more on the cards but according to the girls it's still under tight wraps at the moment. Not that the fashion bloggers will need any help with exposure. The duo have met a lot of fashion royalty in the two and a half years since their blog's conception - with highlights including   Rachel Zoe at New York Fashion Week and  Anna Dello Russo when they guest edited for Elle Girl Japan. Fame and fortune aside, at the end of the day all the girls really care about is representing fashion. 'In the Australian blogging scene, everyone does the same thing, so we decided early on our goal was to bring colour into the Australian market,' says Jess. Patriotic pair: Despite business endeavours in the U.S. they take pride in representing Australian designers . And it's their vibrant and uniquely Australian approach that seems to be working. 'When we met Rachel Zoe we were wearing an amazing Australian designer Natasha Fagg and she came up to us and was like ‘""I love what you’re wearing, you girls look so crazy,""' says Jess. 'It also helps that we were wearing big sunnies, very Rachel Zoe, she adds. 'We love to promote Australian designers when we're overseas. When we guest edited Elle Girl, it was so cool to have people from Japan come up and ask us who we were wearing,' she said . Despite their recent success, the duo from Melbourne remain down-to-earth about their life and even admit that despite receiving the odd gifts here and there they prefer to buy all their own clothes. 'It's flattering to receive gifts but we're a bit picky and it's always better to buy what you love and stay true to what your style is,' says Jess.","The stylish sisters 'How Two Live' collaborate with print and shoe brands .

"For the first time in 65 years the California Department of Water Resources has found no snow during its manual survey of the land at 6,800 feet in the Sierra Nevada in early April. Governor Jerry Brown observed the survey on Wednesday, which found the lowest water level in the Sierra Nevada snowpack since 1950 when records began. The fourth consecutive year of vanishing snow spells trouble as California depends on it to melt into rivers and replenish reservoirs. As he stood in a brown meadow that's normally blanketed in snow, Gov. Brown ordered sweeping, unprecedented measures to save water in the state. Scroll down for video . What a difference a year makes: Spatial distribution of the total volume of water in the snowpack across the Tuolumne River Basin in California's Sierra Nevada mountains as measured by NASA's Airborne Snow Observatory is seen in images from March 25, 2015 (bottom) and April 7, 2014 (top) 'We're in a new era; the idea of your nice little green grass getting water every day, that's going to be a thing of the past,' Brown said. The governor's order requires cities and towns to cut water use by 25 percent. So far in the current drought, many Californians have not made changes to their daily routines to save water or taken a hit in their wallets because of it. Attending the survey with Gov Brown was DWR Director Mark Cowin, who said Californians can expect to receive almost no water from the meager snowpack as it melts in the coming weeks. 'Today's survey underscores the severity of California's drought,' he said. 'Water conservation must become a way of life during the worst drought in most Californians' lifetimes.' In what were considered normal precipitation years, the snowpack supplied about 30 percent of California's water needs as it melts in the spring and summer. California's historically wettest winter months have already passed, and the drought is now firmly rooted in its fourth consecutive year, reports AGWeb. Frank Gehrke, left, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program for the Department of Water Resources, and Gov. Jerry Brown walk across a dry meadow that is usually covered in several inches of snow as conducts the snow survey, near Echo Summit on Wednesday . One year ago: In this April 1, 2014 photo, Frank Gehrke, chief of snow surveys for California's Department of Water Resources, crosses a meadow still covered in snow as he returns from conducting the snowpack survey at Echo Summit, California . Early last year, Brown called for a 20 percent voluntary cutback, but the state achieved just half of that. In recent years, cities have developed storage capacity and supplies to soften the blow of future dry years — a move that has insulated residents from the severity of the current drought. In 1977, Brown asked for a voluntary 25 percent cut in water use during his first term as governor. Nearly 40 years later, he warns that drought might be the new normal as he ramps up efforts to adapt. His executive order on Wednesday directed officials to impose statewide mandatory water restrictions and expand programs intended to reshape how Californians use water. Cemeteries, golf courses and business headquarters must significantly cut back on watering the large landscapes. Local governments will tear out 50 million square feet of lawns and instead use drought-tolerant plants. And customers will get money for replacing old water-sucking appliances with efficient ones under a temporary rebate program. This 3-D composite image map of the Sierra snowpack released by NASA shows the deficit in the total volume of water contained within the Tuolumne River Basin snowpack from April 7, 2014 to March 25, 2015 . The initiatives are part of the goal to reduce water use by 25 percent compared to levels in 2013 — the year before Brown declared a drought emergency. The order also directs local agencies to charge extra for high water use. Water officials vowed to crack down on waste and illegal water diversion, acknowledging there has been spotty enforcement of existing rules limiting outdoor water use. The order also prohibits new homes and developments from using drinkable water for irrigation if the structures lack water-efficient drip systems. In addition, the watering of decorative grasses on public street medians is banned. 'We have to pull together and save water in every way we can,' Brown said. Critics of the Democratic governor said his order does not go far enough to address agriculture — the biggest water user in California. The Enterprise Bridge passes over full water levels at a section of Lake Oroville on July 20, 2011 (top) in Oroville, California, compared with August 19, 2014 (bottom) The order contains no water reduction target for farmers. Instead, it requires many agricultural water suppliers to submit detailed drought management plans that include how much water they have and what they're doing to scale back. After a drought in the previous decade, state officials acknowledged that some suppliers did not submit similar required plans. Mark Cowin, director of the Department of Water Resources, said the state will provide money to make sure the plans are written and might penalize those who do not comply. The state is not aiming to go after water-guzzling crops such as almonds and rice the same way Brown has condemned lawns. Dave Kranz, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation, said farmers have already suffered deep cutbacks in water supply during the current drought. Farmers have let hundreds of thousands of acres go fallow and laid off thousands of workers as the state and federal government slashed water deliveries from reservoirs. Officials said Wednesday the statewide snowpack is equivalent to 5 percent of the historical average for April 1 and the lowest for that date since the state began record-keeping in 1950. 'It is such an unprecedented lack of snow, it is way, way below records,' said Frank Gehrke, chief of snow surveys for the California Department of Water Resources. Cemeteries, golf courses and business headquarters must significantly cut back on watering the large landscapes .","For the first time in 75 years the California Department of Water Resources has found no snow during its survey of the Sierra Nevada in early April .

"A charity set up by Brad Pitt to build new houses for people made homeless when Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans a decade ago is embroiled in legal action – after the new homes started to rot. Pitt, 51, vowed to help ‘make it right’ for the city’s thousands of displaced citizens by building eco-friendly homes to replace the ones destroyed. The star personally backed the building of 104 homes in the Lower Ninth quarter of the city, decimated in the 2005 storm, which killed almost 2,000. Scroll down for video . Brad Pitt pictured leaving one of the Make it Right Foundation's houses in the Lower Ninth quarter of New Orleans in 2012 . Make it Right: Brad Pitt personally backed the building of 104 homes in the Lower Ninth quarter of the city . ‘He took this personally and was even helping to bang in nails,’ a source told The Mail on Sunday. But in a lawsuit filed in New Orleans’ District Court last week, Pitt’s Make It Right Foundation is suing Timber Treatment Technologies for $500,000 – claiming the wood was defective. It says it was forced to replace decking and other wood on the new homes after using the company’s  TimberSIL product. In one case, a house had rotted so badly it had mushrooms growing from it, it is alleged. A spokesman for Pitt could not be reached for comment last night. The source added: 'This has turned the project into a PR nightmare. The homes are literally rotting away because the wood that was used wasn’t as advertised.’ The lawsuit says Pitt’s charity chose to use TimberSIL wood after being told it had undergone a special ‘environmentally friendly glass-wood fusion process’ designed to prevent rot and decay. The timber was advertised as ‘award winning green certified’ and was supposed to be guaranteed against mold, mildew and rotting for 40 years. Brad Pitt gives Ellen DeGeneres a walking tour of the Make it Right Foundation houses in New Orleans . Former U.S. President Bill Clinton and  Brad Pitt before the groundbreaking ceremony for the actor's Make it Right Foundation house construction project . But, the suit adds, a whistleblower informed Make It Right that the company skipped a vital part of the manufacturing process rendering the wood useless and forcing the charity to replace the decks and other wood in all 104 homes - at a cost of more than half a million dollars. ‘Before filing this lawsuit the charity tried to reach an agreement with the wood company but the talks went nowhere,' the source added. Pitt’s charity is suing for the cost of replacing the damaged wood, legals fees and for unspecified costs in relation to the PR damage caused by the debacle. Resident Vanessa Rogers said her front stairs and decking had to be rebuilt: ‘A lot of it got rotten really fast. 'It got so bad I fell down the stairs. The floorboards were rotting and the back porch and deck al has to be replaced. It’s really bad.’ Pitt’s spokesperson did not return calls for comment. Timber Treatment Technologies declined to comment on the row.

"Tucked along the coastline of the second smallest country in South America, the tiny fishing village of Jose Ignacio is almost unknown around the world. But every summer, this sleepy backwater hosts the creme de la creme of the fashion world, celebrities and more than a few millionaire playboys. Staying in shabby chic cottages or sleek hotels overlooking the sea, they converge of the beach - a mass of honeyed limbs and perfect figures stretched out in the sun while planning where to party that night. The tiny village of Jose Ignacio is an understated getaway for the rich and famous, filed with pretty villas and sleek beach huts . Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood (left) and Colombian singer Shakira (right) are among the stars said to have escaped the spotlight by holidaying in the chic resort of Jose Ignacio . So, what has brought everyone from Colombian singer Shakira to Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood and restaurateur and playboy Giuseppe Cipriani - the man behind the glamorous Cipriani restaurants dotted around the world's most stylish cities - to these shores? Wedged between oversized neighbours Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay has largely stayed off the radar for European and American travellers, but has long been a favourite summer spot for South Americans thanks to its endless golden beaches and low prices. With an area of just 68,000 square miles, the country's sizeable Atlantic coastline is home to pretty villages, two major cities - the capital Montevideo and the glorious colonial Portuguese town of Colonia - while the interior is dotted with little more than estancia farms breeding cattle and growing wine. Each summer (during the American and European winter), Uruguay's beaches are taken over by well-heeled Brazilians and Argentinians looking for good food and sunshine. Even the luxury boutiques selling trinkets alongside designer products are designed in the shabby chic beach style . La Huella is one of the most famous restaurants in Jose Ignacio and a favourite with holidaymakers for its relaxed beach atmosphere . As telenovela (soap opera) actresses and Latin film stars descended on the coast, one resort in particular became the haunt of the rich and famous. Punta del Este, about 85 miles east of Montevideo, was soon known as the Miami of South America, with sumptuous hotels, pop-up restaurants run by celebrity chefs and visitors ranging from supermodels and actors to company CEOs. There are so many celebrity homes in the area that there has actually been a bus tour launched, much like the ones in LA and New York. And Punta del Este even has its own area called Beverly Hills. Naomi Campbell has visited, as have British and Spanish royalty, footballer Diego Maradona has a house nearby and even former US president George Bush has stayed. Locals and visitors stay understated in their beachwear (left) and the entrance of the village itself is posted with colourful signs by the side of the sandy roads . The dark-tiled pool perfectly reflects the sky and blends in with the sea beyond at the exclusive Playa Vik hotel . While the golden beaches of Uruguay are the main draw for Argentinian and Brazilian visitors, but those coming from further afield may want to combine Jose Ignacio and Punta del Este with some other hotspots. Colonia del Sacramento is perhaps Uruguay's prettiest town, with cobbled streets and crumbling buildings left over from Portuguese and Spanish rule . Colonia del Sacramento sits across the Rio de la Plata from Argentina (Buenos Aires is just an hour away by ferry). Owing its heritage to a mix of Portuguese and Spanish colonialism - the two battled over its strategic location - it is a maze of pretty cobbled streets, bougainvillea-draped buildings and a crumbling lighthouse with panoramic views. The picture-perfect spot is doesn't take long to explore but is ideal for a couple of lazy days strolling the streets, eating in patio restaurants and enjoying the atmosphere. The capital Montevideo tends to divide opinion among travellers. Some blast the city for its high-rise buildings and lack of colonial charm (at least when compared to nearby Colonia). But the quirky capital does have some of the buzz of its rival across the water Buenos Aires, with a beautiful 19th century market near the port crammed with restaurants serving asado (barbecue beef) and endless bottles of wine. The city has a necklace of beaches which come alive in the summer time with events and eateries and there is a faded beauty in the crumbling towers and Art Deco buildings of the city. Tango bars and theatres have combined to give the city a reputation as a true cultural hub in Uruguay. If you want to head away from the cities, then travel inland to the various estancias (ranches) that dominate the country's interior. There is a good business in rural tourism here, with estancias offering stays to visitors - ranging from the basic to the super-luxurious - and the chance to ride gaucho-style on horses through the countryside, learn about their culture and tuck into the freshest asado beef there is. Website www.welcomeuruguay.com has some options listed. With so many big names rubbing shoulders in one town, it is on wonder the ultra-chic crowd started to head elsewhere for some peace and quiet - which is how they happened upon tiny Jose Ignacio, just 22 miles east along the coast. Happen upon it on a quiet day and you would never know how popular it is. The tarmac road gives way to sand at the entrance of the village, pretty clapboard houses probably look more elegant than most, and signs pointing to chic boutiques and eateries are subtle. In the centre of the village is a simple square decorated with colourful flowers. There are no high rises, no gaudy luxury hotels, just an assortment of those shabby chic-style buildings that make the perfect romantic backdrop for fashion shoots - something which is not lost on the fashion directors of the world's glossiest magazines, who flock to the area to create stylish beach spreads. The hotels in the area hide behind walls and fences, leaving them almost invisible to the average visitor, while at the same time showcasing spectacular ocean views to their guests, taking advantage of the village's location on a peninsula jutting out to sea. The suites sit in individual huts covered in grass and wildflowers and the bedrooms boast spectacular views out to sea from the floor-to-ceiling windows . The central titanium and glass structure was designed as a sculpture and the back opens up onto the terrace and infinity pool . From the restaurant, guests can stroll out on to the terrace and sit by the pool which blends in with the sea beyond . One such sleek addition is Playa Vik, built by Norwegian-born hotelier Alex Vik, it is a sleek modern design which shouldn't work with the traditional ambience of the village but somehow does. Virgin Holidays Worldwide Journeys offers a 17-day Best of South America trip from £3,829pp. The trip includes return flights from London Heathrow to Lima and returning from Rio de Janeiro, accommodation and sightseeing encompassing Lima, Yucay, Machu Picchu, Cusco, Puno, Iguassu Falls, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. Price is based on two adults sharing a standard room on a mixed board basis and includes sightseeing with experienced English-speaking guides and transfers. An additional trip to Uruguay can be added into the itinerary at an extra cost. Stone and glass huts sit under grass roofs dotted with wildflowers, blending them in with their surroundings and are organised in a circle around a central grassy area. Inside, huge stone baths and showers give the bathroom a rustic feel, while the huge bedrooms have quirky quotes scrawled across them (a favourite is: 'May the fleas of a thousand camels infest the crotch of the person who screws up your day and may their arms be too short to scratch'). The floor-to-ceiling windows provide spectacular ocean views to those lucky enough to enjoy the end properties, and there are more chances to contemplate the seascape from the rooms on the top floor of the main building - a huge rectangular titanium and glass structure designed as an enormous sculpture. Paintings hang on every wall, a cosy library gives way to a grand open room used as a casual restaurant throughout the day and evening, but the showstopper is the missing fourth wall, leading out to decking and a narrow infinity swimming pool, complete with dark tiling, which juts straight out towards the sea and is illuminated with star-like lights at night. By day, guests languidly swim while looking out to sea and across the golden sands and in the evening, the terrace is the perfect place to watch the sun go down while enjoying a glass of Uruguayan wine. It may not be as famous as its Argentine neighbour, but the beef and wine in Uruguay is just as fabulous (just don't say that to an Argentinian). During my stay, bankers, fashion designers and movie executives mingle over fresh breakfasts, discuss their plans to explore further afield and generally create a convivial atmosphere so very different from the hugs nameless, faceless hotels often found at beach resorts. Chic beach houses are the order of the day in Jose Ignacio, with understated clapboard getting a modern twist and beach attire very much on the casual side . Uruguayan painter Carlos Paez Vilaro created this fairy tale home Casapueblo in Punta del Este perched on a clifftop and looking out to sea - visitors can tor the quirky property today and learn more about the artist or stay in the part of it converted into a hotel . Playa Vik has been such a success that down the road Estancia Vik has recently opened, providing a grander, more traditional atmosphere with its luxurious 'farmhouse', but it has a similar atmosphere to its siter hotel, created by spectacular works of art on every wall, fantastic food and a personalised service (I never meet a member of staff who doesn't greet me by name). For those looking for more than relaxation on the beach, the estancia offers the chance to ride horses through the countryside like a gaucho and take to the local rivers in a kayak. The best eateries frequented by the great and good are the stylish but casual dining options on the beach. Mostrador Santa Teresita was set up by Argentinian chef Fernando Trocca, serving fresh seafood and glorious salads. Parador La Huella is one of the most popular restaurants in town and opens with the same staff every year, serving only local produce and spectacular asados (barbecues), while La Susana also boasts a beautiful beach spot and has long been famed for its glorious barbecued meat paired with wines.","Jose Ignacio is a tiny fishing village on the Atlantic coast of Uruguay - the smallest country in South America .

"A photographer has captured dozens of Elvis impersonators as they gathered at some of Europe's biggest tributes to The King. Graeme Oxby documented the dedicated fans at events including Europe's Tribute to Elvis in Blackpool, The Elvis Weekender in Bridlington, East Riding of Yorskshire, and The European Elvis Championships in Birmingham. The 50-year-old, from East Yorkshire, even visited their homes to capture images for his photo series, called 'The Kings of England'. He said: 'Elvis was a unique phenomenon, the prototype superstar and his influence has spread far and wide. 'Britain is the European centre for Elvis tribute activity and hosts of the biggest and best contests in the world. The fans I met were in mainly quite old although, there's a new generation of people discovering the music of the King. 'I hope to show the colour, the razzmatazz and the fun of the Elvis Tribute world. Elvis was a one off but all around Europe, and to varying degrees of success, men women and even children are paying tribute to a remarkable performer and cultural phenomenon, having a good time in the process.' A selection of his work is on a UK gallery tour until 2017, ans is currently on show at The Cooper in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

"This is the dramatic moment a caravan is totally destroyed after its impatient driver loses control while trying to overtake a lorry. The motorist attempted the dangerous manoeuvre on the A39 between Street and Glastonbury in Somerset on Tuesday morning after becoming stuck behind the HGV for several miles. The driver gambled on finally passing lorry driver, Nick Townley, at a set of lights but badly miscalculated as the road narrowed and lost control at 50mph. An impatient driver who attempted to overtake a lorry lost control and destroyed the caravan he was towing . The dramatic moment was captured on dash cam by the HGV driver that the motorist had tried to overtake . He swerved in front of the truck and his caravan whiplashed into a lamppost, smashing the rear into smithereens and spilling the contents across the road. The car ended on the opposite side of the road - forcing oncoming traffic to slam on their brakes - with what remained of the caravan still attached. The moment was captured on camera by a dash cam fitted to the cab of 49-year-old Mr Townley's lorry. He had been slowly accelerating his 22-tonne truck to nearly 30mph when the collision happened and managed to perform an emergency stop inside just 20 yards. The driver had been stuck behind the 22-tonne lorry for several miles and gambled on overtaking after a set of traffic lights. But he appeared to misjudge the gap and collided with the front of the lorry's cab . He swerved in front of the truck and his caravan whiplashed into a lamppost, smashing the rear into smithereens and spilling the contents across the road. The accident closed the road for several hours as police cleared up the debris and questioned the driver . Mr Townley, from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, who has been an HGV driver for 24 years, said he was so shaken by the accident he had difficulty sleeping that night. He said: 'I was stopped at the lights and there was one car by the side of me, the red one. 'There was a box van behind me which had been there from the time just after I came off the M5. 'We pulled off from the lights. As I was going through the gears the red car passed me. 'I looked in the mirror and saw the box van was not trying to pass... but less than 8 to 10 seconds later I glanced in the mirror as something caught my attention. The lorry driver, Nick Townley, was so shaken by the accident he had difficulty sleeping that night . Mr Townley posted his dramatic footage on Facebook where scores of people condemned the caravan driver . 'This is when I hit the horn and the brakes as hard as I could. I stopped the lorry in around 20 yards and got up on the kerb as much as I dare. 'I was not trying to block him out as some people suggest - he came through the lights at about 50 mph.' He posted his dramatic footage on Facebook where scores of people condemned the caravan driver. The accident closed the road for several hours as police cleared up the debris and questioned the driver. No one is thought to have been seriously injured in the crash.","Motorist tried to overtake the lorry on A39 between Street and Glastonbury .

"This is the amazing scene as a freelance photographer risks his life to capture an image of a hungry lion from just a few feet away. Fearless Atif Saeed, 38, from Lahore, Pakistan was in the city's safari park when he spotted the male lion in the distance. Mr Saeed got out of his car and crept up towards the hunter armed only with a camera and fired off a few frames. Atif Saeed crept to within 10 feet of the hungry lion before leaving the safety of his car to lie on the ground . Armed only with a camera, Mr Saeed, managed to capture a couple of frames before retreating to safety . Unfortunately, the clicking sound of the camera's shutter alerted the lion to Mr Saeed's presence, who was forced to retreat quite rapidly from just 10 feet away from the lion. He said: 'I was sitting in front of him just near my car and the door of my car was open. I was sat on ground few feet away, so he was treating me like his prey. 'I was thinking - I must show the character and status of lion and this was the only way I could think of to achieve this. 'The story finished in few seconds as the lion aggressively jumped towards me and I just about scrambled into my car. ' was laughing at that time, but now when I think back about the incident I don’t think I would be able to do it again. It was a pretty close encounter.'","Photographer Atif Saeed crept to within ten feet of the hungry male lion .

"Nearly 15 years ago an amazing story emerged of how a young Japanese woman had travelled half-way across the world to try and find a suitcase stuffed with $1m dollars that had been buried in the snow. It was claimed that Takako Konishi had believed the film Fargo was real - after all the hit movie begins with the words 'This is a true story - when she was found dead in a mini-skirt and high-heeled boots in the frozen wastes of Minnesota just days after arriving. This was all confirmed by a police officer from the small town of Detroit Lakes, who said he had spoken to the 28-year-old shortly after she turned up. He said she kept repeating the words 'Fargo, Fargo'. Scroll down for video . Rinko Kikuchi as Takako Konishi in the new film Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter, which tells the story of how the young Japanese woman went searching for a suitcase of cash which had been buried in the film Fargo . According to the film, Takako froze to death searching for the $1 million stash buried in the snow by Steve Buscemi's hapless criminal (pictured) in the Coen Brothers' fictional 1996 film . Fargo was shot in the frozen wastes around the North Dakota town not far from where Takako died . But it turns out that it was all a simple misunderstanding between a small town cop and the woman from Tokyo who could not speak English. Now Takako's incredible story has been made into a film of its own - Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter - newly released by American filmmakers, and brothers, David and Nathan Zellner - that dramatizes the myth of her journey and sad end. What is certain is that Takako's body was found by a hunter in some woodland near Detroit Lakes, a town in Minnesota some 50 miles east of the real town of Fargo, in the neighbouring state of North Dakota, in November 2001. But she didn't die in search of the cash buried in front of a roadside fence under the snow by Steve Buscemi's character in the 1996 Coen brothers film. Paul Berczeller, a New Yorker based in London who in 2003 released his own documentary about Takako, This is a True Story, travelled to the area in the midwest region of the US to find out what really happened. The short film comprises a series of stills in which actress Mimi Ohmori plays Takako and the actual cops involved, Jesse Heliman and Steve Kilde, play themselves. Berczeller told MailOnline: 'The Coen brothers started it really by putting the line ""This is a true story"" at the start of Fargo. Peter Berczeller used an actress to play Takako in his 2003 film This is a True Story, which told the real tale . Mimi Ohmori in Berczeller's film (left) and Rinko Kikuchi in the Zellner brothers' new release (right) In the new film Takako sets out with a crudely drawn treasure map across the frozen tundra of Minnesota in search of her mythical fortune . A still from This is a True Story in which Takako's body is depicted exactly as it was found, right down to the black thigh boots, miniskirt and coat which she was wearing despite the freezing temperatures . 'It was a half joke, half trick. They were making a joke about how people love to believe a story is real. 'When the story of Takako came out the mix between fiction and reality started by the Coen Brothers, that fuelled the whole story in a way.' On his mission to research his film, Berczeller stayed in the very same motel in Bismarck, the state capitol of North Dakota, where Takako checked in during her stay. He said: 'I had the very same room that she stayed in before she died but I had to call the clerk and say ""this is too strange"" and get another room. 'There was a British night clerk, which is strange enough in itself out there, and there certainly weren't too many Japanese people passing through so he remembered her. 'I was the one who actually told him she had died. I think he quite liked her because he remembered her really well. She was such a mysterious figure.' Berczeller's breakthrough came when he met Officer Heliman of the Detroit Lakes Police Department, who'd spoken with Konishi for four hours before her death. He said: 'The news stories at the time said this Japanese woman had been found dead in a field near Fargo and quoted the local police as saying that basically she had this map and went to a police station with it. 'It had a road and a tree on it and she kept pointing at it and saying ""Fargo, Fargo"". Officer Heliman interpreted it as she was trying to find this money. The fantastical story of how Takako travelled all the way from Tokyo in search of the lost money began to spread not long after her death. This is a still from Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter . Berczeller (right) told MailOnline: 'The Coen brothers started it really by putting the line ""This is a true story"" (left) at the start of Fargo' A scene from This is a True story. Officer Jessie Heliman actually spoke with the real Takako before she died . The Zellner Brothers' new film has been a critical success but is no more a true story than Fargo itself . 'Takako didn't speak any English and the police didn't speak any Japanese so basically they made it up - they didn't lie about it, it was like a game of telephone [Chinese whispers].' 'It was really interesting to find out that ""wait a second, the story that everyone believed is completely wrong"".' So the story of Takako, which sprung from the outlandish tale of the film Fargo, was based on a simple misunderstanding. And yet this hasn't stopped Kumiko, released in February in the UK and starring Rinko Kikuchi as a version of Takako, become a critical hit. The truth about how a young Japanese woman came to freeze to death thousands of miles from home in temperatures of -3C, while wearing the absurd outfit of a miniskirt, thigh boots and black coat, is actually even more sad than the mythical version. Takako had apparently been chasing an American banker she'd met in Tokyo who'd moved to Singapore and was originally from the town of Fargo. The story of Takako, which sprung from the outlandish tale of Fargo, was based on a misunderstanding . In Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter, the 28-year-old meets up with local cops just as she did in real life . Detroit Lakes in Minnesota. Takako's body was found by a hunter in woodland not far from the small town . The relationship ended but he was the last person she spoke to the night before she died, spending $88 on a 40-minute call to Singapore which Berczeller managed to trace. A suicide letter to her parents said she had gone to the hometown of her ex lover to die and toxicology reports found she had drunk two bottles of champagne and simply lain down in the snow. Berczeller traced her home address to the Shinjuku district of Tokyo using police records and managed to speak to her landlady. He said: 'Takako came to Tokyo from the country. She was a regular girl who came to the big city to live and try to live a good life and it all went wrong. 'She worked at a travel agency and lost that job and then apparently worked as a dancer. 'She met this guy and I don't know if she was obsessed with him or in love but everything went wrong. He was the last person she spoke to.'","Movie tells the incredible story of Takako Konishi, found frozen to death .

"Asia Siddiqui not only saw herself as a soldier for Allah, but a poet as well. The 31-year-old woman who was arrested Thursday in New York for allegedly hatching a terrorist plot with her former roommate, 28-year-old Noelle Velentzas, was also friends with the one-time editor of Al Qaeda magazine Inspire. Samir Khan, an American citizen, was killed in a 2011 drone strike in Yemen. But before that he published several articles in Inspire, including a DIY bomb-making guide which the Boston bombers allegedly used to make their twin pressure-cooker explosives. Kahn was apparently so chummy with Siddiqui that he published one of her poems  in the precursor to Inspire, a publication called Jihad Recollections. Scroll down for full poem . A soldier and a poet: Asia Siddiqui (right), one of the two woman arrested in Queens, NY on Thursday for plotting a terrorist attack had previously published a poem in an Al Qaeda magazine, it was revealed.  Siddiqui and her accused co-conspirator Noelle Velentzas (left) pictured in a court sketch from Thursday . Extremist friends: Siddiqui befriended Samir Khan (left) in 2006, three years before he left the U.S. for Yemen and started Al Qaeda magazine Inspire (right). Khan published Siddiqui's poem in a publication which was the precursor for Inspire. Khan was killed in a 2011 drone strike . The poem, titled 'Take Me to the Lands Where the Eyes are Cooled' details Siddiqui's aspiration to  'drop bombs' and 'taste the Truth through fists and slit throats'. The informant says Siddiqui boasted about the poem in a August 2014 conversation, and said she had it published under the name 'Murdiyyah'. That same name was connected to a Facebook account associated with Siddiqui's computer IP address. According to the lengthy criminal complaint against Siddiqui and Velentzas,  Siddiqui met Khan sometime in 2006, while he was still living in the U.S. and they continued to communicate after he moved to Yemen in 2009. Siddiqui and Velentzas have been accused of plotting to carrying out a terrorist attack in New York City, and referred to themselves as 'real bad b****es' in conversations with a federal informant. The informant says the two were considering targeting a military base or police funeral with a homemade bomb - but that there was no specific terrorist plot at the time of their arrest Thursday. Siddiqui's friend Kahn was born to Pakistani parents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on December 25, 1989, but spent most of his life growing up in Queens - the same NYC borough where Siddiqui and Velentzas lived. Captured: Above, the home in Queens where Asia Siddiqui was arrested for allegedly plotting a bomb attack on the United States. She met fellow Queens native Samir Khan in 2006, and later had him publish one of her poems in an Al Qaeda magazine he was editing at the time from Yemen . DIY: Khan went on to found Inspire, an Al Qaeda magazine. One of the articles he wrote for the magazine a a bomb-making how-to guide apparently used by Boston bombers Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) Other than refusing to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and blaming 9/11 on America, Khan appeared to be a well-adjusted young man when he attended  W Tresper Clarke High School. At the school, Khan wrote for the student newspaper, and participated in cheerleading and the glee club. However, at some point while still living in the U.S., Kahn started writing about Jihad from his parent's basement with a blog called 'InshallahShaheed,' or 'Martyr, God willing'. In 2004, his family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina where he attended Central Piedmont Community College. Five years later, Khan cut ties with his family and moved to Yemen. Khan was killed in a September 30, 2011 drone strike in Yemen - the same one that claimed the life of infamous American-born Islamic militant Anwar al-Awlaki. Take me to the lands where the eyes are cooled… . There are dreams I will leave everything behind for . Everything that has meaning in my life . Came to life with the introduction to my Lord . To the Oneness of my Lord . To the Mercies of His evermore . Than I can implore… . I have memories of soldiers of Allaah, memories of soldiers of shaytan . Memories of battlegrounds I haven't yet stepped on . Memories of battlefields I have never stepped on… . Yaa Allaah, take me – Aslamtu lirabbil aalameen .

Al-Mu'eed! … my mind strays back to golden past I haven't yet lived… . All this Time I spent living Wahn dreams instead . Surrounded by walls of marble with widescreens, gardens of plush green . Pouring rain splashing on window panes, crystal ceilings . But Allaahi, nafsi only knew of empty feelings . Verily, time teases. The tease of martyrdom when the ruh leaves . In degrees; the degrees every soul dreams to seize . The degrees the angels appease one over another . The degrees of infinite seas with which the Lord pleads, the seven seas cannot encumber . I drown in ghibtah rage for a cavalry of my own . Plotting against shaytaan, suffocating for self-control . I want to be purified with every breath, every sweat, every echo, every harakah . The innumerable Tawaafs, the countless du'at, every step I take, I'm back at Arafat . I have work to do. Mistakes to correct, time to make up. No excuse to sit back and wait- for the skies rain martyrdom . Wait, No! The skies never rain martyrdom… . Martyrdom rains the skies! This world is a morgue on standstill watching the lost souls . In a cold, silent, blank stare – death stare . Death stirs in cold, silent, despair . Finding no place to call home, my vision blurs . All my fingers plucked out, my veins stretched to dull . Laughter poking into my sleep… into my dreams . Peeling laughter – the never-ending discourse of shaytaan's regime . Sahytaan Ar Rajeem… silenced. Prison walls that scream . The urges reincarnate into rebellion, into physical hunger, social incompetency . I am a slithering soul cringing to be free . The sweat of my efforts choke, wet strokes of vapour from a cloud . For my dreams to emerge… on cracked canvas – chipping off paint . The pigments of a lost nation. A curse. A nation. A religion. A pagan . An exiled. A misery. A child with incisors. A soliciting child . Soliciting for a while for golden signs… along the Cyprus, Nile, miles from . With a defied conscience eager for recompense… . The mountains are my castles, the sand is my sea . I peril through the wilderness as it's a part of me . I hear voices in the dark; feel pressure on my prayer rug . As I swing on a hammock between date palms, I drop bombs . I feel blisters beneath my feet as I sneak behind the enemy fleet . I fall sleep in the midst of battle before sirens and tanks owned by enemy ranks . Hit cloud nine with the smell of turpentine, nations wiped clean of filthy shrines . My teeth grind, my gums sting, my jaws flinch from and flame in chemical pain . And from all this. I confess I've become more sane . My backbones sprain from the tensions of unresolved game . I refuse to return home! Thrust open my wounds where my nerves have ruined . Rupture my skin where my membranes bare thinned . Tear my limbs that resist in abstinence . Here- taste the Truth through fists and slit throats – . And prefer this over death from slit wrists, pills, drunk and doped . Thank me later, for now, do what you will – let the noise persist! Running in half excitement, half regret, index finger to sky, a bulletproof vest . I turn around – what can my enemies do to me if Allah has promised me success? I waken with moistened eyes, tired and high off of unresolved life . Some dreams seem like real life; sometimes, life seems like a dream . I steel from the greedy the remnants of my fitrah and run into the dungeon of death . Jannah awaits!

"Promposals are the big trend in high school proms as teens think up progressively more outlandish ways to ask each other to the biggest dance of the year. They are so big, in fact, that students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual, according to a new survey. With budgets for outfits, flowers, transportation, food and other sundries at around $1,000 for the average American high schooler, that means most intend to spend $324 on the once-simple query: Will you go to prom with me? Pricey promposals: Students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual of promposals, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by Visa . That's according to a survey from Visa, which asked 3,000 people aged 18 or older what they expected to shell out for the prom and on what. For a primer on promposals, see previous years' winners of most outrageous (and viral) prom proposals. In 2012, Matthew Ho from Toronto promposed to his girlfriend, Tina, with 1,500 pink helium balloons and a sign that read, 'Tina, will you go to prom with me?' His stunt attracted a crowd in the hallway, giving the blindfolded Tina an audience when the stunt was finally revealed. It's unclear what the cost of these hockey pucks was, but the average American high schooler could spend over $300 just asking his or her date to the yearly dance .

Some students have even rented plane banners to pop the prom question - at a starting cost of $1,000 in the New York area. 'It started last year — I've been in the business six years, and we had never sold a prom banner before then,' explained Remy Colin of Aerial Messages in Daytona Beach, Florida. At John B.

Dressed in a tuxedo, and running into a packed assembly hall where Kristelle was waiting, unaware of what was going on, Mr Garza performed a rendition of Heath Ledger's famous scene in Ten Things I Hate About You, singing Lauren Hill's Can't Take My Eyes Off of You. Arresting: Palmdale, California student Davyeon was 'arrested' in his lunchroom thanks to prom date Stephanie. No word on how much she bribed the officer who cuffed him . Not always pricey: Mike Ramirez, student at Crosby High School in suburban Houston, managed to get Texans cheerleader Caitlyn to go to the prom with him by getting 10,000 retweets . Jamie Vandenberg from Ontario, Canada, promposed to his girlfriend Madison Dillion using a fake pop quiz that his teacher distributed at the beginning of class. As students reached question three, where Mr Vanenberg laid out statistical quandaries to Miss Dillon's yes or no answer, they realized their probability questionnaire was a ruse. When student Taylor Huestis opened her locker, 456 ping pong balls, all with 'prom' written on them, fell onto the floor. Huestis' boyfriend had planned the stunt for days, enlisting the help of her friends; his sign read 'I finally had the balls to ask you to prom!'

"They all look heart-breakingly gorgeous and the perfect pets – but this menagerie of cute animals are all unwanted and some have endured horrendous cruelty. But now, thanks to Amanda Holden, the RSPCA and, just possibly, you, many of these long-suffering animals could be given happy new homes. The Britain’s Got Talent judge is presenting a new series on ITV which will highlight the plight of the animals arriving at the RSPCA’s Newbrook Farm Animal Centre in Birmingham. Animal lover: Amanda Holden will host the new show on ITV highlighting plight of RSPCA centre in Birmingham . On Give A Pet A Home, Amanda and her co-stars – including Loose Women’s Coleen Nolan, Olympic gold medallist Denise Lewis and former Pussycat Dolls singer Kimberly Wyatt – will appeal to members of the public to take in the animals featured. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Amanda said: ‘As Brits, we are the land of the underdog and the land of pets. I think we really appreciate the loyalty and love animals give back. ‘It’s only a small minority of people who mistreat animals, whereas the majority will watch the show and think they can give something back by giving a pet a home. Perry, the black and white cat, is six, like curling up in a lap and being groomed but dislikes too much noise. Darcy, the female degu, likes playing with jingly balls and chewy toys but doesn't like being on her own . Homeless: Rocky, a greyhound, one, has only been at the centre for a month. He can be a little shy but likes living with other dogs . It’s not just cats and dogs – it’s horses, ferrets, rabbits, guinea pigs, birds, anything, really and you’ll see how the RSPCA operates from the ground up. ‘I hope that every week we’ll find lots of homes for otherwise unwanted animals.’ Amanda has a Yorkshire terrier/Jack Russell cross called Rudie, and a Siberian fluffball cat, Muffy, and admits she loves her pets and gives them the full run of the house. She said: ‘When I’m on the loo, I have the children, the cat and the dog in with me chatting away.’ Given the boot: Fern is a two-year-old black gerbil  who likes lots of handling, playing with toys and her tunnels. She has been at the centre since last July . Her aim for the show is to inspire families to share her love of furry animals and to adopt one as a pet. Viewers interested in adopting a pet can apply on the ITV.com website after each show. Applications will be sifted and those offering the best matches will be vetted by the RSPCA. Successful applicants will be featured on the following week's show. She said: ‘Although there will be some tear-jerking stories along the way, we’re also going to have a lot of fun watching the celebrities get stuck in. We want to unite as many pets as we can with new owners.’ Amanda has two daughters Lexi, nine, and Hollie, three, with record producer husband Chris Hughes, and has shared her love of animals with her family. ‘The only downside of doing this job is that it’s going to be very hard for me not to take the animals home,’ she says. Loving: Petal is a ginger and white dwarf lop rabbit, aged one, that would be happy living in a house but is quite wriggly to handle. Buster, right, is a brindle and white Staffordshire bull terrier, eight, who loves his lower back tickling but is not so keen on other dogs . Companions: Ailsa and Anna are two female gerbils who need to be kept together. They are very sociable, good with children and enjoy being handled . The presenters have been trained as RSPCA volunteers and will take part in chores and witness emergency calls and rescues.

Sivkov wrote a column in the Military-Industrial Courier that Russian should develop a small force of megaweapons  that can cause tsunamis and seismic activity at Yellowstone National Park (pictured) He said that the main objective of the new system would serve as an asymmetric threat against the US, which is 'moving to the borders or Russia' Sivkov headlines sections of his article with headers such as 'Specifications for Megaweapons', 'One Day Without America,' 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'The Apocalypse- Simply and Cheaply' The Russian analyst reasoned that because 80 per cent US population lives near the coast, generating tsunamis on the San Andreas fault and in the Atlantic would be an effective way of causing massive damage to 240 million people. He references Hurricane Katrina's impact on New Orleans and says that detonating nuclear bombs near the bottom of the ocean would create waves almost a mile high that would sweep inland. The military man says that all the seismic activity could release another wave that would wipe out the US's European allies. Sivkov, the president of the Academy of Geopolitical Problems, says that Russia's large inland territory in Siberia will protect it from receiving too much harm. He raises the stakes for the apocalyptic scenario even further by saying that the tsunami could trigger the Yellowstone Caldera, a supervolcano that last exploded 640,000 years ago. Triggering the Yellowstone Caldera, which hasn't erupted in 640,000 years, would spread ash across the country. Above, a map from the United States Geological Survey predicts the amount of ash from the blast . Sivkov says that triggering the supervolcano at Yellowstone would cover most of the US in ash and serve as an asymmetric weapon. Above, Mammoth Hot Springs at the park . The explosion would then unleash  feet of volcanic ash over all of the United States. According to Sivkov, Russia could also trigger just the volcano with a 'relatively small' megaton blast because it has shown signs of activity. Sivkov said that the normal nuclear deterrent was not good enough and too expensive given Russia's economic problems. While he is convinced of his idea, it remains to be seen if the tsunami and the litany of destruction that followed would be even be possible if the world came to nuclear war. The journal that the analyst writes for is a niche publication with less than 2,000 fans on the Russian social network VKontakte. He may not have the ear of President Vladimir Putin, but Sivkov has a history of making attention-grabbing statements about Russian military affairs for state-backed media. Sivkov said that his new nuclear deterrent idea could be deployed from one ship and could be ready within ten years. He has  imagined potential war between the US and Russia before, telling the pro-Kremlin Independent Newspaper that military games in eastern Russian north of Japan were 'intended to simulate a response to a hypothetical attack by Japanese and US forces.' His other articles in VPK repeatedly call for bigger and more powerful weapons for the Russian military and he has bemoaned Russia's lack of military spending compared to the US, according to the Moscow Times. Sivkov said that detonating nuclear bombs on the ocean floor could generate deadly tsunamis and cause massive damage to the US population. Above, devastation after the 2011 tsunami that hit Japan . State-run television presenter Dmitry Kiselyov (pictured receiving an award at the Kremlin) said last year that  Russia is 'the only country in the world capable of turning the USA into radioactive dust' Russians' once positive views of America have slid sharply since the beginning of rising tensions between Moscow and Washington over Syria and Ukraine. In January 81 per cent of residents said they had a very bad or generally bad view of the US. Imagining America turned to ashes is a frightening thought, though Sivkov's article was not the first time that it had been floated recently in Russia. During the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis and Russia's annexation of Crimea, state-run television presenter Dmitry Kiselyov said that President Obama's gray hair was because of worries about Russian nuclear weapons. He said that Russia was 'the only country in the world capable of turning the USA into radioactive dust.'","Konstantin Sivkov wrote that Russia needs a new 'asymmetric' weapon .

"Nine British Muslims caught trying to cross into Syria are no longer welcome in England and should find a new country to live, Labour's Simon Danczuk has said. The outspoken Rochdale candidate said it was 'unacceptable' that people who were prepared to join ISIS should be free to come home. It comes after nine members of the same family were arrested in Turkey – including the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor in Rochdale. Scroll down for video . Waheed Ahmed (right) - the son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - and his cousins walk into the Turkish Police Department's Foreigners' office today after being caught trying to cross into Syria . The family – including Councillor Shakil Ahmed's son Waheed, his cousins, aunt and four children – are expected return to the UK from Turkey this week. Coun Ahmed, 45 – who was photographed with Labour leader Ed Miliband just weeks ago – served alongside Mr Danczuk's wife Karen on the Town Council until her resignation in January. But Mr Danczuk today lashed out at suggestions that the family could be allowed to return to Britain without facing any terror charges. Speaking to MailOnline Mr Danczuk said: 'I think I speak for the vast majority of people in Rochdale in saying that this family will not be welcome back in Rochdale.' Mr Danczuk added: 'The Islamic State in Syria are carrying out sickening and barbaric acts of inhumanity and anyone who pledges their allegiance to this cruel and twisted ideology will rightly be seen as an enemy of the UK. 'Waheed and his family were apprehended trying to get into Syria and had they been allowed to cross the border then I've been given to believe Waheed would now be getting trained up to fight for ISIS. Mr Danczuk said they were not welcome back in Rochdale . 'The police have to recognize this, because the idea that someone who was prepared to join a terrorist outfit like ISIS could be allowed to return to civilian life in Rochdale and carry on as though nothing has happened is unacceptable.' It shares a border with part of Syria controlled by rebel factions including those linked to Al Qaeda and ISIS. The Rochdale nine are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory. The three men and two women, aged between 21 and 47, were taken to a hospital with their children, aged one, three, eight and 11 after being apprehended last week. Photographs showed Waheed Ahmed, dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots, leading the group from a minibus into a police station. Several women, all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces, could be seen carrying children. Most of the party were wearing walking boots, perfect for trekking across the rugged region. Turkey is a key staging ground for foreign fighters and others hoping to reach Islamic State-held areas of Syria and Iraq. The Ahmed family are originally from Kashmir but settled in Rochdale in the 1980s and have lived in their current home since 2006. Coun Ahmed posted a picture of himself with Labour leader Ed Miliband on his Facebook page just before Christmas. Their arrest came after Yahya Rashid, 19, was charged with preparing acts of terrorism after flying into Luton Airport from Istanbul. Rochdale Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed, pictured on his Facebook page with Labour Leader Ed Miliband just weeks before his son tried to cross into ISIS controlled Syria . Waheed smiled in a car as he left a hospital after undergoing medical checks and fingerprinting in Hatay southern of Turkey last week . He is suspected of acting as an Islamic State smuggler, paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group. Mr Danczuk said the number of Britons fleeing the country to join ISIS – now thought to number more than 600 – exposed the failure of the Government's anti-terror strategy. He said: 'I have spent the last few days in discussions with the Foreign Office minister, Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner, local authority leaders, religious groups and local people.' Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said the British family caught trying to cross into would be forced to train up as ISIS fighters . The outspoken candidate added: 'The message coming back to me loud and clear is that while the vast majority reject this ideology of hatred, exclusion and intolerance, there are some people who are susceptible to radicalization. 'I do not think the Government's Prevent strategy is working and we need a much smarter approach from all the authorities to stop this cancer spreading.'

"Patterns appearing on both the very large and very small scale are rare in nature. But researchers have found such a pattern in two apparently unrelated places - cells in human skin, and the mysterious fairy circles in Namibia. While the distribution of desert fairy circles may look random, as if the landscape is marked with freckles, the pattern closely matches the distribution pattern of skin cells. Researchers have found a similar pattern in two apparently unrelated places - skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in the Namibian desert. The illustration on the left shows the distribution of skin cells, and the one on the right plots fairy circles, which are also arranged in polygons . ‘It's a completely amazing, strange match,’ said Professor Robert Sinclair, head of the Mathematical Biology Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan. Desert fairy circles are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because no one knows how they form. Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth measuring anywhere between 10ft and 65ft in diameter (three metres to 20 metres) that are ringed by short grass dotting the scrub land like craters on the moon, or big freckles. Several teams of scientists are trying to explain the bizarre markings, and suggestions have included termites nibbling grass, zebras rolling in circles, competition for resources, hydrocarbons emanating from the depths of the earth to kill off patches of vegetation and even aliens. Desert fairy circles (pictured) are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because it is now known how they form. Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth ringed by short grass dotting the desert like craters on the moon, or big freckles . Now, Professor Sinclair and Haozhe Zhang believe they have identified a small, but vital, piece of the puzzle by comparing their distribution to skin cells. The duo compared the number of 'neighbours' adjacent to fairy circles and skin cells, according to the study published in Ecological Complexity. They used satellite images of fairy circles and a computer to draw lines halfway between each pair to give them invisible boundaries that look similar to cell walls. The majority of skin cells and fairy circles both had six 'neighbours', and similar percentages of other neighbours (shown in this graph) The computer then counted how many neighbours surrounded each fairy circle. Another group of researchers had calculated skin cell neighbours in a similar way several years ago, which was used as a comparison. The experts found that the results were almost identical, in that both the majority of skin cells and fairy circles had six neighbours. And the percentage of fairy circles with four, five, six, seven, eight and nine neighbours was essentially the same as the skin cells. ‘I didn't expect it to be so close,’ Professor Sinclair said. ‘We spent a lot of time checking because it really looked too close to believe.’ Mr Zhang, a PhD student at Iowa State University who was previously at OISTsaid that future mathematical models designed to explain how fairy rings are made should incorporate the results of this study. The researchers suspect the patterns might be similar because both skin cells and fairy circles are fighting for space. Professor Sinclair said: ‘It is still difficult to say why exactly they are similar, but the fact that they are similar is already very important. ‘This is suggesting there may be such types of patterns that cover really different size scales.’ Huge swathes of grassland in Namibia is covered with mysterious vegetation-free patches that have been baffling scientists for decades. While a number of studies have suggested the fairy circles are created by industrious termites, research last May claimed they are the result of resource competition for water among plants. German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles and found that they are ‘remarkably regular’ in their distribution, which made them question the termite theory. Experts from various institutions have previously claimed that termites nibble away at grassroots in certain grasslands of southwest Africa, causing the dieback of vegetation and creating a water trap. Last year, German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles (pictured in the Marienfluss Valley) and found that they are 'remarkably regular' in their distribution. There is a no vegetation growth within the circular area . The genesis of a fairy circle has not been observed. Their occurrence appears to be restricted to particularly arid zones at the border of grassland and desert regions, according to the study published in the journal Ecography, where there is intense resource-competition for water. Dr Getzin's team was joined by experts from Göttingen in Germany, Italy and Israel who studied aerial images of the circles in north west Namibia to pinpoint the location and distribution of the barren patches within the surrounding landscape. Using statistical methods, they found that the circles are distributed regularly across large areas. ‘The occurrence of such patterning in nature is rather unusual. There must be particularly strong regulating forces at work,’ Dr Getzin said. He believes it is the local resource-competition among plants and vegetation, in a similar way to how young trees space themselves out in forests to ensure they have access to enough nutrients and water. ‘A similar process of resource-competition may consequently also be the real cause for a self-organising formation of the mysterious fairy circle patterns,’ the study says. The scientists simulated underground competition for water and the spatial vegetation distribution patterns. They found that similar patterns emerged on the screen to those recorded in Namibia.","It is not known how fairy circles in the Namibian desert are made .

"John Lewis is still desperately trying to sell its leftover Christmas stock despite spending millions on a festive advertising campaign. The department store has slashed the prices on almost 200 products in an attempt to flog Christmas trees, festive ornaments and decorations - more than three months after December 25. It comes after the major high street outlet reportedly spent £7million on its tear-jerking 2014 Christmas advert campaign featuring Monty the penguin. John Lewis is still desperately trying to sell its leftover Christmas stock such as this Father Christmas decoration-just days before Easter . The department store giant has slashed its prices on its Christmas decorations and festive themed gifts such as this gold reindeer, cut from £20 to £10 . With just days to go until Easter, John Lewis has halved the price of many of its decorations and trees - knocking as much as £250 off the 9ft John Lewis Pre-Lit Peardrop with 500 lights, formerly £500. Meanwhile, a 64cm high 'Cambric and Cream Father Christmas Sack', is now available to buy half price at £17.50. A plywood White Wooden LED Advent House is also priced at £17.50 on the store's website - compared to £35 in the build up to Christmas last year.

There are now 108 items priced at £5 or less and 36 festive themed gifts and objects will set you back less than £2. Their bid to sell off leftover stock comes just days before this year's first national holiday, when families tuck into Easter themed products like chocolate eggs. Office worker Georgina Adams from Southampton, Hampshire, was shocked to see the giant high street outlet still stocking the products. It comes after the major high street outlet reportedly spent a staggering £7 million on its tear-jerking 2014 Christmas advert campaign . The 30-year-old said: 'It's crazy. Who wants to make decisions about Christmas at Easter? 'Everyone knows they go a bit over the top at Christmas - especially with their adverts - but selling old Christmas stock in April seems a bit odd.' A John Lewis spokeswoman said: 'We get demand for Christmas products all year round. 'While the majority of our customers might begin their Christmas purchases much nearer the festive season we do see interest in our seasonal offer all year round. 'Our in-store Christmas shops open in October and last year we saw Christmas become the most searched term on our website at the beginning of September. 'As with other seasonal offerings, if there is a demand for reduced Christmas items for sale post season then it makes sense to make such product available for customers.'

"Ryanair has taken the unprecedented step of banning passengers from bringing their own booze on board flights between Glasgow and the party island of Ibiza out of concerns for safety and comfort. The Dublin-based airline has informed passengers travelling on the notorious flight from Glasgow Prestwick Airport to the Spanish island that their alcohol purchases from duty free shops are no longer allowed in the cabin, and they risk being kicked off the flight if they don’t comply. Ryanair refused to explain the reason behind its decision, but it follows a handful of incidents involving boorish behaviour by inebriated travellers heading to the island for days of sun, booze and revelry. Passengers' hand luggage will be searched before they board at Glasgow Prestwick Airport, said the airline . An email sent to Ibiza-bound passengers and obtained by the Daily Record said: ‘Customers will not be allowed to carry alcohol on board and all cabin baggage will be searched at boarding gates. ‘Any alcohol purchased in airport shops or elsewhere must be packed in a suitable item of baggage, which will be tagged and placed in the aircraft hold free of charge. ‘Customers attempting to conceal alcohol will be denied travel without refund or compensation.’ In a statement to MailOnline Travel, a Ryanair spokesman said the airline made the decision after consultations with customers and airport officials. Passengers who are caught trying to sneak alcohol into the cabin risk being kicked off the flight . The spokesman said: ‘Those who have purchased duty free alcohol will be asked to either place their purchases in their cabin baggage and into the hold at the boarding gate, or leave their purchases behind. ‘The comfort and safety of our customers and crew is our number one priority and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour at any time.’ The spokesman declined to identify the incidents which sparked the ban or say what will happen to passengers caught trying to sneak alcohol on board. There have been problems with passengers opening alcohol purchased from duty free shops at Glasgow Prestwick Airport and imbibing on the flight  to Ibiza. Passengers who purchase booze from duty free shops at Glasgow Prestwick must place it in the luggage hold . Last year a flight made headlines when an online video showed passengers chanting and swearing. Rowdy passengers were recorded singing the theme to Dambusters and chanting ‘Here we, here we, here we f****** go’ after the plane landed. Travellers who didn’t join in appeared anxious or agitated with the scene unfolding just rows in front of them, and cabin crew were shown looking on helplessly as the singing continued uninterrupted. In 2013 a flight on the same route had to divert to Beauvais-Tille Airport, north of Paris, after a group of drunk passengers began causing trouble. Police said 14 men were thrown off the plane in France and were so inebriated they thought they had landed in Ibiza. It was believed the group had been drinking alcohol bought from duty free at Glasgow Prestwick before the two-hour flight. The budget carrier currently flies twice a week between Glasgow Prestwick and Ibiza, with flights operating on Sundays and Wednesdays.","Ryanair has informed passengers they cannot bring alcohol into the cabin .

"The parents of a 5-year-old boy whose body was found inside a septic tank in Virginia last month have been charged with felony child abuse and neglect. Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis announced the arrests of Ashley Jennifer White, 30, and Paul Thomas, 32, Thursday afternoon – a week to the day after the tragic discovery. Their 5-year-old son, Noah Thomas, went missing from their home in rural Dublin on the morning of March 22 as his mother slept with her infant daughter.

From left; Virginia State Police Lt. Ed Murphy, Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis, Pulaski County Commonwealth Attorney, Mike Fleenor, during a press conference Thursday announcing the arrest of White and Thomas . After an intense-five days search, the child's body was found in a septic tank on White and Thomas' property. 'It came to a point where the evidence that we had we felt was sufficient to arrest them for probable cause,' said Commonwealth's Attorney Mike Fleenor of Pulaski County, reported Indianapolis Star. The couple's 6-month-old daughter was removed from their home and placed in the custody of social services the day after Noah's body was recovered. White and Thomas were each charged with two counts of neglect and abuse involving Noah and his baby sister. During their arraignment via teleconference Friday, both suspects objected to the presence of reporters in the courtroom. 'This is the saddest thing that’s ever happened to me in my life,' White was quoted as saying. 'I don’t feel people should be able to enjoy it over dinner.' Her boyfriend sounded a similar note, saying that he doesn't want his life to be a news story. The judge, however, allowed members of the media to stay in the room. They are being held in jail without bond pending a court hearing scheduled for August 12. Investigators are now waiting for the medical examiner's office to release the results of Noah's autopsy to shed light on the cause of death, which could take weeks, if not months. Search crews have looked around the boy's house. His mother could not find him after she woke up at 10 . Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road near Noah's house, which is 'never typical' White said Noah, pictured left with his dad and right, was a cautious child who would not have run away . Noah Thomas was last seen alive sitting in his parents' living room and watching cartoons at 9am March 22. His mother took her baby daughter, Abigail, to another room and settled in for a nap. More than an hour later, she woke up to find the back door open and Noah gone. Nearly five days later, an FBI-backed search concluded with the discovery of Noah's lifeless body in a septic tank near the family home. Police and more than 100 volunteers who signed up to look for Noah in the small town had covered about 3.3 square miles after the 60lb red-headed boy was reported missing. Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis said at the time that authorities have no evidence of foul play in his disappearance, and that the family have cooperated with authorities. Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road adjacent to Noah's house, which is 'never typical'. No suspicious vehicles were seen in the area. Crews used helicopters in the search in the area, which is mostly residential with farmland and a woods by the boy's house. Ashley White, who called police at 11am after searching for her child on her own, said that the boy was cautious and had no history of running away. Stephanie Ide Hudgins, Paul Thomas' sister, described her brother and his partner as 'the best parents, hands down,' reported Roanoke Times.

A friend who helped arrange their first date, Tara Rose Munsey, disappeared in January 2000 from her job at a Taco Bell. Her body was discovered in a ravine two weeks later. She was 16 years old. Some years later, White's father was murdered and her mother became gravely ill. Before the mother's passing, White and Thomas decided to have a baby together. 'They were so excited to have Noah,' Hudgins said. 'Noah was special anyways, before he even came into this earth.'","Ashley White, 30, and Paul Thomas, 32, charged with child abuse and neglect .

"Islamic State militants have imposed a new  law threatening to jail any man caught wearing skinny jeans or having music on their mobile phones in an apparent crackdown on hipsters. The terror group said it would also imprison anyone caught smoking or turning up late for prayer in further draconian crackdowns in its Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. Violators will be jailed for ten days, during which time they will be made to take an 'Islamic course', it was reported by anti-ISIS informants in the city. At the end of their prison term, they will be forced to take a test, with those who pass being released immediately. Those who don't will be fined and kept in prison until they pass. Outlawed: Militants fighting for the Islamic State (left) have threatened to jail anyone caught wearing skinny jeans (like the ones pictured, right) in its latest draconian crackdown in the Syrian stronghold of Raqqa . The introduction of the new laws were revealed by the anti-ISIS campaign group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS) who risk their lives leaking information from inside the city. RBSS says the sanctions are 'volatile and changeable' but notes that they are becoming increasingly more stringent. One resident, named only as Jassem, told the group how dozens of people had fled the city in the wake of the jihadi network's brutal enforcement of its twisted form of sharia law. He said: 'ISIS tightens penalties and uses the principle of intimidation in dealing with public, which led to the migration and escape of many people. 'Freedom of expression has become a crime, so you can not oppose a decision issued by the group. 'Otherwise you will be arrested on charges of violation of God’s law as its fighters claim, but they are far from this law. 'There is no difference between ISIS and Assad’s regime: bribery and favoritism are widespread within the group and play a major role, especially among the local members of the group.'

Shocking: The cigarette burning images emerged as it was revealed ISIS has erected shocking anti-smoking posters throughout its self-declared caliphate featuring images of burning human lungs . Earlier this month, ISIS militants carried out a second mass cigarette burning as the terror group stepped up its anti-smoking campaign. Photographs taken in the northern town of Barqah, close to the border with Turkey, show members of the group's feared religious police force setting light to vast piles of cigarettes in a field. The images emerged as it was revealed ISIS has erected shocking anti-smoking posters throughout its self-declared caliphate featuring images of burning human lungs, in the hope it will convince militants to reject the 'slow suicide' caused by cigarettes. Images also emerged earlier this week showing dozens of black balaclava-wearing extremists graduating from an Islamic State-run school of terror in Raqqa.

The company says their Bell 525 will be configured to 'perform head of state transport throughout the region' while another purchaser K Aircraft Leasing, will rent their two 525s out to Middle East-based oil and gas companies. Ireland-based Waypoint Leasing has also tentatively agreed to buy 20 of the helicopters, reports the Wall Street Journal, before the craft even makes it maiden flight. One early buyer calls the helicopter, which looks like a living room that can fly anywhere, 'a marvel of modern technology' Another deluxe interior option for the helicopter which looks like it should be a private jet rather than a helicopter . Depending on the configuration of the interior, the 525 will hold 16 or 20 passengers along with the two flight crew with what the builders say is best in class passenger cabin height (137cm) and floor area (8.2 square metres). The 525 is also the first commercial helicopter to incorporate fly-by-wire flight controls, which they say delivers 'superior handling qualities and increased level of safety' with features that, among other things, stabilise the aircraft without the need of input from the pilot. Depending on the chosen configuration, the 525 will hold 16 or 20 passengers along with the two flight crew . The manufacturers say the 525 boasts best in class passenger cabin height (137cm) and floor area (8.2 square metres) The exterior has an advanced aerodynamic design, a Next Generation GE engine and 'best-in-class payload-range capability' For the technically savvy, it is also the first commercial craft if its kind to include the Garmin G5000H, a glass touchscreen avionics suite for the flight deck that replaces knobs and switches with what they say are simpler controls and information, such as weather, charts, traffic, terrain and Global connectivity options, for the pilot. For the 525 it's been rebranded as the ARC Horizon system. The slick exterior of the chopper, which looks like something Iron Man wouldn't be adverse to taking a ride in, of course has an advanced aerodynamic design, a Next Generation GE engine and an airframe that offers 'best-in-class payload-range capability'.","The Bell 525 Relentless boasts an 88-square-foot cabin and space to fit 20 passengers in boardroom-style comfort .

"The chilling Facebook posts of a gun-obsessed 24-year-old man who is believed to have shot dead his father and tried to gun down a family friend before turning the rifle on himself have been revealed. Tim McNaughton’s body was discovered alongside his father Greg McNaughton’s near a shooting range at a farm in The Caves, near Rockhampton in central Queensland on Tuesday. In February 2012, Tim was issued with a ‘shooter’ firearm licence by the Northern Territory Police. Posting a photo of the license on the social media site he alarmingly wrote: ‘Mwahahaha do the realize what they have just done [sic].’ The deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide as it’s revealed a third man, Lindsay Hart, escaped being killed after being shot in his bicep by running into the bushland as bullets flew past him. Tim McNaughton (pictured) is believed to have shot dead his father and tried to shoot his pilot colleague before turning the gun on himself . Tim McNaughton posted this photo of his gun stash on Facebook in December 2013, writing: 'My Christmas is better than yours' In February 2012, Tim was issued with a ‘shooter’ firearm licence by the Northern Territory Police. Posting a photo of the license on the social media site he wrote: ‘Mwahahaha do the realize what they have just done [sic].’ Mr Hart ran into bushland after being shot at and sent a desperate message to his brother Doug Hart, the Courier Mail reports. The message said: ‘Come get me quick. I’m bleeding to death. I’m just about stuffed. I’ve lost a lot of blood but come through the neighbour’s place.’ ‘Don’t go home, whatever you do. He’s just shot his father and he’s just shot me. Ring the coppers and get them on the road,’ Mr Hart, who is currently in a stable condition in hospital, warned. Mr Hart, 53, also telephoned police from a neighbouring property for help and officers are said to have found the father and son’s bodies several hours later after an extensive search of the 50 acre farm. Inspector Darrin Shadlow told the ABC: ‘They were there target shooting, there's only the one weapon involved and we have recovered a weapon.’ Police confirmed Mr Hart is not a suspect and they are not looking for anyone else in relation to the deaths. Captain Greg McNaughton (left) was a pilot with the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Rockhampton. Police believe he was shot dead by his 24-year-old son. Pilot Lindsay Hart (right) reportedly escaped being killed by running into the bushland as bullets flew past him. All three men were friends and had been target shooting together before the incident . Tim’s Facebook page tells a story of a young man fascinated by guns. He reportedly suffered a sever brain injury during a motorbike accident last year . Greg McNaughton, 53, and Lindsay Hart were both pilots with the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Rockhampton, while Greg’s son Tim was an apprentice aircraft engineer with the company. He was visiting his parents in Queensland while on leave from his posting at an RDFS base in Alice Springs. Tim’s Facebook page tells a story of a young man fascinated by guns and with a passion for motorbikes. In June last year, he suffered serious head injuries during a motorbike race in Alice Springs which left him in an induced coma for several weeks, the ABC reports. Friends say the incident on Tuesday would never have occurred if he hadn't had the devastating brain injury and that his previous Facebook posts about guns were just 'jokes'. Forrest Turner, 25, told the NT News: 'This injury that happened to him in that race is the only cause of this (incident). It would have never have happened before. There are lots of people hurting at the moment because this just wasn’t normal. He just wasn’t like this.' Along with the photo of his firearms license, Tim’s page is littered with photos of himself on motorbikes and cradling rifles. In March 2014 he posted a photo of two boxes of bullets and in April of the same year he said: ‘You know you’re a redneck when your vacuum cleaner gets clogged with empty shells.’ Tim posted on social media about how he shoots 'too much' This photo he posted in May 2013 shows a bullet on his bed sheets . 'I love it when Nik buys me presents. 300gn and 405gn. 45/70 rounds oh sweet Jesus,' he wrote on Facebook while posting a photo of two packs of bullets . Another photo he posted in May 2013 shows a bullet on his bed sheets alongside the caption: ‘Ok this is how I know I shoot too much when I wake up in a bed 1500km away from my guns and there is an empty case in me bed [sic].’ On 24 December 2013 he uploaded on image of four rifles and multiple packets of bullets with the line ‘my Christmas is better than yours.’ A statement from the CEO of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, where all three men worked, said everyone was shocked by what had happened. CEO Nino Di Marco's said: ‘All of us at the Royal Flying Doctor Service (Queensland Service) are deeply saddened and shocked to hear the news of this terrible tragedy in Rockhampton. Tim was visiting his parents in Queensland while on leave from his posting at an RDFS base in Alice Springs when he is believed to have shot his father and himself . In March 2014 he posted a photo of two boxes of bullets and in April of the same year he said: ‘You know you’re a redneck when your vacuum cleaner gets clogged with empty shells' A statement from the CEO of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, where all three men worked, said everyone was shocked by what had happened to Tim (pictured), his father and Lindsay Hart . ‘The incident that occurred late Tuesday afternoon was a leisure activity on a private property. It was not work related.’ ‘We can confirm that Rockhampton Senior Base Pilot, Captain Lindsay Hart, is in a stable condition and is currently recovering in hospital,’ Mr Marco said. ‘However, it is with great deal of sadness that I confirm the passing of his much loved fellow pilot Captain Greg McNaughton, and Greg's son Tim (who is an apprentice engineer currently on leave from the RFDS base in Alice Springs). ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with their families, friends and colleagues at this time and we ask that everyone respects their right to privacy and opportunity to grieve at this difficult time.

"Two trainee obstetricians have been removed from a newly developed $2 million hospital in Western Australia reportedly over  concerns about the quality of service and problems with patient safety at the obstetric unit. The concerns around Fiona Stanley Hospital, in southwest Perth, were revealed to theWest Australian by unnamed sources. However, according to health authorities, the move was purely based on reshuffling junior medical faculty. The latest potential developments at the hospital follow recent reports  that blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments. The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was found to have blood and bone fragments of some its medical instruments . The West Australian was told junior doctors were moved to 'maximise training opportunities' by a state committee that organises both accreditation and training for the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The hospital went on 'baby bypass' when the maternity unit opened four months ago, due to an unexpectedly high number of women giving birth. The hospital consequently had to direct expectant mothers to other hospitals. This week the RANZCOG told the West Australian that the obstetrics unit, which opened on December 2 last year, was approved for  training in March. Michael Gannon, president of the Australian Medical Association WA, told the West Australian he knew of issues surrounding the recently opened obstetrics unit. He said concerns of the unit's services were similar to others at the hospital, due to planning issues from years ago. The hospital was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February . Earlier in the week, it was revealed that the hospital's medical service provider Serco failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February. The company was fined $60,000 and was subject to Department of Health workers auditing its staff, but the hospital was reportedly operating with poorly sanitised instruments, reported the ABC. Australian Medical Association WA president Michael Gannon noted recent reports that some instruments contained blood and human matter. 'There's been reports of bits of bone on some orthopaedic equipment, there's been reports, that are really hard to believe, of blood still being seen on some instruments,' he said. 'So this gives us great concern.'. Dr Gannon said the latest revelations will further damage the hospital's public image and likely cause a loss of morale within its workforce. 'I can't imagine how people must feel if they've got surgery booked at the hospital at some stage,' he said.","Two trainee obstetricians have reportedly been removed from a newly-opened $2 million hospital in Western Australia .

"He is the Prince of derring-do, flying in an Apache helicopter in Afghanistan and braving sub-zero temperatures to trek across frozen wastes to the South Pole. Now Prince Harry has been filmed revelling in a daring new adventure – a stomach-churning flight in a Spitfire. Buckingham Palace released video of the 30-year-old enjoying his flight ahead of his arrival in Australia tomorrow, where he will begin a month-long attachment with the Australian Defence Force. Scroll down for video . Flying in formation: Prince Harry, pictured in the back of the foreground aircraft, took to the skies after meeting with Armed Forces veterans . Thrilling: Footage released today shows Prince Harry howling with excitement as the Spitfire performs a loop over the English Cennel . He will also visit the War Memorial and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, both in Canberra. Harry, who is leaving the Army in June, relished his adrenaline-charged 250mph Spitfire ride from Goodwood to the Isle of Wight. The flight – which included two Spitfires – was staged to support the Royal Foundation’s Endeavour Fund and a new Spitfire training scholarship for wounded servicemen. The brief journey included a ‘half Cuban’ manoeuvre – a semi loop in mid-air – after which Harry can be heard to shout: ‘I’d love to see what my face looked like doing that.’ Breathtaking: Prince Harry, seated in the back of the cockpit, soars past the British coastline in a Spitfire during a sortie last August . Crew: Prince Harry, seated, second from right, with Chris Hadlow, seated left, Steve Boultbee Brooks, second from left, and Phil O'Dell, right. The royal met with Corporal Alan Robinson, standing left, and Nathan Forster, standing right, who won scholarship places . Flight instructor Phil O’Dell, who was with the Prince during his training session, said the 30-minute journey had been ‘amazing’. ‘The aircraft has dual control and Harry flew it briefly. He was remarkably down-to-earth, very likeable and I could tell he’s a competent pilot.’ A spokesman for Boultbee Flight Academy added: ‘It’s a hard aircraft to fly.’ Praising Mr O’Dell, Harry said: ‘My first landing in a Spitfire – it was quite good!’ This Spitfire is the same aircraft that will fly the lucky winner of The Mail on Sunday competition on a 20- to 30-minute flight over the English Channel – worth £2,750 – later this year. Two thumbs up: The former Apache Helicopter Commander looked relaxed as he took part in the sortie alongside instructor Phil O'Dell . Success: Touching down after the flight, the royal gives a thumbs up and smiles out the window as he says the landing felt 'quite good' Handing over control: The prince enjoyed flying the plane before instructor Phil O'Dell took charge and guided the plane into a loop . Support: The veterans' scholarship was supported Endeavour Fund, which Harry set up alongside his the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge .

The valuable artefact was posted back to Solent Sky Museum in Southampton, Hampshire, in a jiffy bag with the address scribbled on with Tip-ex. The museum was burgled on March 8 and the case, which belonged to Reginald Joseph Mitchell, was amongst the items stolen. His 'RJM' initials are engraved on the outer case and it was donated to the museum by pilot Jeffrey Quill, one of the foremost Spitfire test pilots and a close friend of Mitchell's.

"When Lane Smith passed away in a freak accident last July, he left behind his heavily-pregnant girlfriend and their unborn son. But now, nearly eight months after his passing, the young Oklahoma family has been reunited in their first ever family portrait, thanks to some clever photoshopping by a local photographer. Kayli Henley was snapping pictures of six-month-old Taos and his 20-year-old mother, Sierra Sharry, when the young mom asked the photographer if she could make their family complete. So Henley took a photograph of Smith from the family and, with a ghostly filter, fitted the image around his girlfriend and son, as if he were standing over them. Scroll down for video . Family portrait: A photoshopped image shows Sierra Sharry holding her six-month-old son Taos with her boyfriend, the baby's father, Lane Smith, standing behind them. Smith passed away before his son's birth . Sharry called the ghostly final picture 'amazing'. 'Lane's not physically here with us, of course, but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what,' she told KOCO. After sharing the image to her Facebook page, the photographer found that other people thought the image was amazing too. It has been liked more than 200,000 times and shared more than 25,000 times, and Henley has been inundated with requests to create other pictures for families who have lost a loved one. In a post shared on the Facebook page, Sharry explained that in July 2014, she and 26-year-old Smith had been nervous about the impending birth of their son. 'We were scared as any new parents would be but ready for the adventure together,' she said. Excitement: 26-year-old Lane Smith, pictured with his girlfriend in the couple's pregnancy announcement, died after hitting his head in an accident in July 2014. His son was born just a few weeks later . When she was around eight months pregnant, they went to jet boat races in El Reno, she recalled. But the weather was too warm for Sharry, so she left her boyfriend there with his family. 'When I left Lane that day I had no clue it would be the last time I'd see him,' she wrote. But in the early hours of the next day, she awoke to a call that Smith had been rushed to the OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City after he had fallen and hit his head. She and her mother raced to his side. They never considered his injuries could be life-threatening, but once they got there, they were given 'absolutely no hope that Lane was going to make it'. 'July 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life,' she explained. 'I lost my best friend. The father of my unborn child. And since that day I have felt so empty inside. A part of me will forever be missing. I loved that man more than life itself.' Strong: Sharry said that part of her has been missing since the death of Taos' father but that the photograph allowed her to see her complete family for the first time. She is pictured in another image from the shoot . Missed: She said she knows that Smith, pictured left, will always be watching over her and their son, right . Their son was born just a few weeks later and when he approached six months, Sharry asked Henley, who is baked in Yukon, if she'd be able to put together a family photo. 'I just got to thinking, we don't have a picture with Lane in it,' Sharry explained to KOCO. So Rene created the photo that has since been shared thousands of times online. 'It brought me to tears,' Sharry wrote about the photograph. 'This is how I picture us. Taos and I living our lives the best we can with Lane ALWAYS watching over our shoulder.' Rene said she was happy to be able to help. 'As soon as I met Taos, he had a smile that was so contagious, the happiest baby boy, and he instantly captured my heart,' she said on her Facebook page. '[I] never knew if I could make this reality for them. So glad I could and they can cherish this forever.'","Lane Smith died after falling and hitting his head in July 2014 - just a few weeks before his girlfriend, Sierra Sharry, gave birth to their son, Taos .

"An Ohio couple have been found dead in an apparent murder-suicide in their stateroom aboard a Holland America cruise ship docked in Puerto Rico. The unidentified man and woman were in their 50s and from Cleveland, police Sgt. Ricardo Cruz told The Associated Press. Cruz said blood was found in the cabin aboard the MS Ryndam, but it was unclear how the couple died. A team of FBI investigators boarded the MS Ryndam after a Cleveland couple were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide as the ship docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico . The bodies were taken off the ship Thursday night by a team of FBI crime scene investigators. Authorities will not say how the couple died . The cruise is expected to get back underway on Friday as it heads to the Virgin Islands . 'We don't know yet whether an object was used or what the motive was,' he said. He said the ship's cleaning crew found the bodies when they checked on the couple after not seeing them for a while. The FBI has taken over the investigation. It was unclear exactly when the couple died. The ship departed Tampa, Florida, on Sunday for a two-week cruise in the southern Caribbean. It stopped in Key West on Monday and then spent two days at sea before docking in historic Old San Juan on Thursday, Holland America spokesman Erik Elvejord said. Passengers say they had no idea of what had happened - only that they had to wait a long time to disembark from the ship . Passengers were horrified when they learned what had happened in a stateroom aboard the ship . 'We are terribly saddened by this tragic event,' the company said in a statement. Cruise ship passengers said they were not aware of what had happened. 'This is a shock to me,' said Mark Moore of Watertown, New York, who was traveling with his wife. He said the crew had roped off part of the ship and hung a sheet in the hallway as passengers disembarked around noon. Other baffled passengers said they were never told what happened aboard the ship - only that there was a big holdup as they tried to disembark when the ship docked at San Jaun, according to WAPA-TV. Then, a large team of FBI crime scene technicians arrived, along with local police and other FBI agents. The Ryndam was scheduled to depart Puerto Rico late Thursday and arrive in St. Thomas on Friday.","The couple are in their 50s and from Cleveland, Ohio .

"It was a real-life fairytale – the moment, 70 years ago, when two carefully guarded princesses were let loose to join the jubilant crowds in London celebrating the end of the Second World War in Europe. Now the adventure has been re-created in a new film, showing the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they wander incognito through the city streets. And among the most curious viewers of A Royal Night Out, released next month to coincide with the anniversary of VE Day on May 8, 1945, will be a woman who knows better than anyone what really happened on that extraordinary night. Scroll down for video . Royal Role: Canadian Sarah Gadon, left. plays a young Princess Elizabeth, pictured right . Dancing Queen: Sarah Gadon as Princess Elizabeth enjoying a night out to celebrate the end of the Second World War . Because she was there. ‘It was a Cinderella moment in reverse,’ says The Hon Margaret Rhodes, 89, first cousin to the Queen and her best friend. ‘It was wonderful bedlam. I can’t remember whose idea it was. It was just one of those things that happened.’ Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from her home at Windsor Great Park, she says: ‘I think it’s one of the things that the Queen remembers with great happiness. Neither of them had ever done anything remotely similar, being let loose in a crowd like that to walk all the way from Buckingham Palace through to Trafalgar Square. ‘Everyone was kissing everybody and picking up hats and throwing them away. It was euphoria at its most euphoric!’ Mrs Rhodes, then young Margaret Elphinstone, was lodging at Buckingham Palace while working as a secretary for the military intelligence service MI6. She recalls how a small gang including 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, 15, and Mrs Rhodes’s brothers, left the Palace by the Privy Gate. ‘With the best will in the world, I can’t remember if Princess Elizabeth kissed anyone, but kisses were being thrown about very liberally,’ she says. ‘It was like we had all been living under a huge, heavy, dark cloud. And suddenly, it had gone. I’m so old now, I’m literally the only other person left alive who was there with them on VE Day.’ The Queen is said to remember the night with 'great happiness' In the film, which stars Canadian actress Sarah Gadon as the future Queen and British newcomer Bel Powley as Princess Margaret, the sisters are shown wearing cocktail dresses for their adventure. In real life, Princess Elizabeth was wearing her Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform. Mrs Rhodes says: ‘In order not to be recognised, the Queen pulled her cap right down over her eyes and one of the officers who was with us said, “Look, I’m not going about with an officer who can’t wear her cap properly,” so she had to put it back. Mrs Rhodes adds: ‘I always thought it was very clever of the King and Queen Elizabeth [the Queen Mother] to let the girls go out into the night, with all those myriad of people around them. They knew it was something the Queen and Princess Margaret would never forget.’ Princess Elizabeth is also shown forming a brief attachment with a young serviceman called Jack, who takes her gambling and to a Soho brothel. ‘That didn’t happen,’ laughs Mrs Rhodes, whose younger self does not feature in the film. ‘Apparently, Princess Margaret escapes on the top deck of a bus. That never happened.’ Princess Margaret is also shown quite drunk. ‘No! There was no possibility. We never encountered anyone offering one a drink,’ insists Mrs Rhodes, the daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone. One of the true scenes in the film is of the Royal party dancing the conga through the Ritz. ‘The smart old ladies having drinks were gobsmacked,’ says Mrs Rhodes, although it actually happened on VJ night, August 15 – when Britain celebrated Japan’s surrender. The princesses were protected on their VE Day jaunt by Captain Harold Campbell RN, equerry to Princess Elizabeth’s father, King George VI. ‘He was deeply disapproving of the whole manoeuvre,’ says Mrs Rhodes. The party returned to the Palace after midnight. ‘It was emancipation,’ says Mrs Rhodes. ‘I don’t think anybody realises what she has had to give up. You give up your independence. Poor Princess Margaret is dead, but that night is something I know the Queen will never forget.’ ...And she recorded a secret song tape . Friends: Margaret Rhodes, left with Princess Margaret and Elizabeth, right . By Michael Powell . The Queen and Princess Margaret recorded a secret tape of children’s songs as a touching gift for their mother on her 90th birthday, it has been revealed. Pianist and composer Laurie Holloway has told for the first time how his friend Princess Margaret phoned him with the idea, days before the Queen Mother’s milestone birthday in August 1990. He was summoned to Buckingham Palace and taken to an upstairs room ‘where there was a dark brown, walnut grand piano and two microphones. There was also a sound engineer who I think they had got in from the BBC’. Mr Holloway said the Queen, then 64, and Princess Margaret, then 59, wanted to sing quite unusual children’s songs. ‘One was called I Know Where The Flies Go In Winter Time,’ he said. ‘The Queen said they were taught them by their mother’s father, the Earl of Strathmore. We rehearsed them a few times and then we recorded them in one take each.’ Mr Holloway, 77, musical director on Strictly Come Dancing for its first three series, said the Royal sisters sang ‘very well, beautifully in fact’ during the two-hour recording session. ‘The Queen has a nice, sweet tone to her voice,’ he added. He said Margaret told him the Queen Mother loved the gift. ‘She said that when they gave it to her at Windsor, the Queen Mother said she didn’t have anything to play it on, so they had to go out to the car to listen to it. ‘Later, Prince Charles arrived and wanted to listen to it. They told him he would have to go out to the car and to everyone else’s surprise he opened a cupboard and there was all the latest stereo equipment right there.’ Sadly, the cassette went missing after the Queen Mother’s death in 2002, although Mr Holloway wonders if a copy might still exist somewhere.","Princess Elizabeth and Margaret joined the crowds celebrating in London .

"Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year, shocking new figures have revealed. A study reported in the British Medical Journal found that 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14. The 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week. The shambolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. Lack of access: Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year . The figures, from the GP Patient Survey, also show that patients who report worse access to conventional GP appointments are more likely to use out-of-hours   services. And surgeries where patients were able to see a GP within two week days had lower rates of A&E department visits. Other research has suggested that greater access to GP surgeries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke. The figures come just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to A&E are unnecessary. A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete’s foot and head lice, a study has claimed. Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the NHS £290 million. Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a ‘self-treatable condition’. The data covered one in ten A&E units across England, so if the trends are mirrored across the country, then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a GP, particularly out of hours. Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours. Today's piece, written by academics from Imperial College London and New York University, points out that more GPs are required if access is to be improved. But they add politicians' promises of an extra 5,000 to 8,000 GPs are likely to be challenging to achieve. Effect: The situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. The new figures come just a day after it was revealed a fifth of patients turning up to casualty have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete’s foot and head lice . So despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour to improve access to GPs appointments, they argue these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term. The 'public should [therefore] question the promises of politicians', they said. The BMJ report said largest increase in GPs over a previous parliamentary term in the past 20 years was 5,414 GPs (from 2004/05 to 2008/09) under Labour. But Labour's previous pledge for all appointments within 48 hours was 'far from being achieved', it adds. Only 81 per cent of patients ended up able to see a GP within two weekdays in 2009/10 when the party was last in government. The researchers add there is also no firm proof that more patients getting to see their doctor will lead to fewer A&E attendances. David Cameron has promised patients will be able to access GP surgeries between 8am and 8pm seven days a week by 2020 if the Tories are re-elected. Ed Miliband has guaranteed appointments within 48 hours if Labour are voted in. But the piece said these pledges may prove unrealistic, adding that the evidence behind them has not been made clear - and the problem with access has not been precisely defined. Denial: The study authors say that despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour (David Cameron and Ed Miliband are pictured, left to right) to improve access to GPs appointments, these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term . 'The aims and rationale of the policies outlined by the Conservative and Labour parties do not seem explicit,' the analysis said. 'One aim is undoubtedly to win election votes. But the aims for the NHS and for patients are less clear.' The analysis suggests five points of action 'for policy and research if improvements in access are pursued'. These are: . * Evaluating the extended opening hours pilot scheme carried out by the Tories . * Making general practice consultation data routinely available . * Looking at employing practice staff besides GPs . * Evaluating new types of appointment such as telephone consultations . * Considering alternatives to general practice such as pharmacist-led minor illness services. Lead author Thomas Cowling, of Imperial College London, said: 'Both parties have made bold promises about access to GP services, but the evidence behind their pledges is lacking. 'It's important that policies like extended access are independently evaluated before being implemented more widely. 'The pledges on increases to the GP workforce are very ambitious and unlikely to be met within a parliamentary term.' Instead, he recommended the NHS evaluates the use of new types of appointment that have been proposed to increase GP capacity, such as consultations and triage by phone or online. 'It should also consider other types of staff who could take on some of the work of GPs.'","Study: 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14 .

"A hospital in Western Australia is in hot water after blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments. The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February. The company was fined $60,000 and was subject to Department of Health workers auditing its staff, but the hospital has been found of continuing to operate with poorly sanitised instruments, reports ABC. The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was found to have blood and bone fragments of some its medical instruments . Australian Medical Association WA president Michael Gannon said some of the instruments were found to contain blood and human matter. 'There's been reports of bits of bone on some orthopaedic equipment, there's been reports, that are really hard to believe, of blood still being seen on some instruments,' he said. 'So this gives us great concerns. We've been told the problem's been fixed and this would suggest that it hasn't. Dr Gannon said the latest revelations will further damage the hospitals public image, generating a loss of morale within its workforce. 'I can't imagine how people must feel if they've got surgery booked at the hospital at some stage,' he said. The hospital was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February . There has been a string of controversial incidents in the hospital, including the death of a patient last month who went into a coma. Jared Olsen, 41, had irritable bowel syndrome and was also suspected of having Crohn's disease.

"A thief nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'  who drugged and robbed men after she lured them into bed has been arrested. Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.com said Davila, who worked in PR for a bowling alley, told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer .","Sofia Davila, 21, nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook' over crimes .

"A city high-flyer who combined her stressful finance job with raising six children has advised her daughters to marry early and have children while they are young. Fund manager Nicola Horlick, 54, said she felt a noticeable difference in her body between her first child at age 25 and her last at 38. She revealed juggling child-rearing with boardroom duties meant she had to breastfeed in the office – even while carrying out job interviews. Nicola Horlick, 54, whoraised six children while working in the City, says women should have babies early . Her eldest daughter Georgina died from leukaemia in 1998 age 12. Mrs Horlick has children Alice, 26, Serena, 24, Rupert, 21, Antonia, 18, and Benjie, 15. She said: ‘I had my last child when I was 38 and I was 25 when I had Georgie and I noticed a major difference between the first and the last in terms of my body. ‘My advice to them [her daughters] is not to leave it too late to get married and to have children in their twenties if possible. It is better for you and better for the baby. ‘When I breastfed it was in the office and I have breastfed when I have been interviewing people for jobs. ‘I used to have a shawl and I would put it over the head of a baby and no one cared. But if you do it with your breast bare in public then it does affect some people and maybe older people. ‘I don’t think there is any point in doing that and babies don’t mind having a shawl over their head.’ She is disapproving of stay-at-home mothers because she believes the lifestyle will leave them twiddling their thumbs. ‘I don’t think women should be stay at home mums because if you are an ambitious and intelligent woman what are you going to do sitting at home whilst your child is at school?’ she said. A family photo shows Nicol Horlick, pictured with her children Georgina at 10, Alice at eight, Serena at six, Rupert at three and Antonia, aged seven months, with Nanny Joan Buckfield . ‘But I don’t think it’s particularly acceptable for mothers to do jobs that involve them working later into the night and all weekend. If you are doing that then what is the point of having a baby?’ The fund manager, who is married to second husband financial journalist Martin Baker after divorcing Tim Horlick in 2005, said she does not feel her hard work has negatively impacted her children. ‘I don’t actually feel that my children have suffered and I don’t carry any guilt. People often ask me “Do you feel guilty?” and the answer is no. Because my children are better off having a mother who feels fulfilled than a mother who feels unfulfilled,’ she said. Mrs Horlick is now campaigning for Just A Drop, which aims to reduce child mortality by delivering clean and safe drinking water. She revealed her daughter Georgina inspired her to fundraise for Africa before she died. Mrs Horlick explained: ‘When she was having her bone marrow transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital it was during a time when there was one of those terrible famines in the Sudan. 'Georgie said the most incredible thing to me. She said: “Mummy why are they wasting money on my bone marrow transplant when I am probably going to die any way and they could be spending that money on food for those children. All they need is food and if they were given food they would live.” It was the most extraordinary thing to say and she was very insightful.’ ‘When Georgie died I knew that she would want me to try and do something about those children in Africa.’","Nicola Horlick, 54, raised six children while working in the City .

"A hotelier claims to be living in fear after her windows were smashed and she received intimidating phone calls after appearing on Channel 4's 'Four in a Bed' criticising other hotels in the area. Jennifer McGirr, 61, said the abuse started when the windows to the Tower View Hotel, which she owns, were shattered after a man threw a brick at them in a 'premeditated' attack. She also claims to have had a stream of intimidating phone calls since starring on the reality TV show, where B&B owners visit each others properties and rate their stay.

She said: 'It's come totally out of the blue. It's been very frightening really. 'Where does all this hatred come from?' On hotel CCTV footage of the incident, a man can be seen walking up to the hotel with a brick in his hand before spending several minutes outside, apparently checking he is not being watched. He can be seen putting the brick down while he sits on a nearby wall for a while, letting a car go past, before he picks it up again and hurls it at the hotel. She then received an abusive phone call later in the day, while police were at the hotel investigating the damage. She said she also answered the phone in the middle of the night and could hear only the sound of someone breathing.

'He said it was a disgusting, horrible hotel and he wouldn't stay there if I paid him. 'I don't know this guy - it's not anyone who has stayed here. I passed the phone to one of the policemen and when he said hello the man hung up.'

"Unruly: Rick Yoes, 57 (pictured), spent the weekend in jail in an attempt to avoid paying $1,700 in fines related to nearly two decades of code violations for his overgrown lawn . A 57-year-old man in Texas was jailed this weekend after nearly two decades of code violations for his unruly lawn came back to haunt him. But Grand Prairie resident Rick Yoes claims the city didn't do enough to warn him about the citations, which officials claim were sent out in the mail. Yoes, an electrician at Tarrant County College, was shocked when he received a postcard a couple weeks ago saying he had six outstanding code violations totaling $1,700 and that there was a warrant out for his arrest. Issues Yoes has been cited for in the past include  high grass over a foot long, overhanging tree limbs, a dilapidated wood fence, an inoperable vehicle and junk in the yard, and a dirty swimming pool. 'I can’t really afford to pay a lawyer to fight it,' Yoes told CBS Dallas/Fort Worth. 'I couldn’t really afford to pay them $1,700 in fines that he said I owed him. I didn’t know what else to do I just turned myself in.' Yoes turned himself in this weekend and spent two nights in jail before a friend paid his fine to secure his release. Daughter Angel Yoes told the Fresno People's Media that when her father received the warning, he took off all his vacation days at work and found a replacement so that he could serve 17 days in prison rather than pay the fine. Father and daughter say they've had issues with code enforcement in the past, but have tried to keep the yard up to standard when the previously received warnings.  However, Yoes claims he didn't know about the six violations he was confronted with recently. Scroll down for video . Let it grow: The city of Grand Prairie says they tried several times to reach out to Yoes over the years, but that the man refused to keep his lawn up to code. Above, Yoes' home in Grand Prairie . Too long: Above, another view of Yoes' lawn from Bing. Among the issues with Yoes' lawn were overhanging branches long enough to hit a passing truck . Repeat offender: Above, a picture of Yoes' lawn on one of the dozens of visits code enforces have taken to his property since 1996 . Upset: Yoes says the city didn't do enough to warn him of the mounting fines for his lawn. Pictured on the left in a photo posted to his Facebook . Following Yoes' stint behind bars, city officials released a list of Yoes' violations on his Coffeyville Trail home and insisted that they had given him plenty of warning to get his yard up to code and avoid fines. 'Unfortunately, since 2014, he has not responded to our repeated requests to jointly solve the problems, which has forced us to ultimately cite him for the violations,' the city said in a statement. 'Our Municipal Courts are always amenable to work with citizens on a suitable plan for unpaid citations, but this citizen chose not to take advantage of that opportunity, either.' Officer Mark Beseda of the Grand Prairie Police Department added: 'I can assure you our city would never simply place a citizen in jail for failing to mow their grass.' In an interview with WFAA, Yoes claims he never got any letters from the city for the citations. 'I assume they probably mailed me something; never landed in my hands,' Yoes said. 'If they sent me certified mail, I don't pick certified mail up.' But in another interview with CBS, Yoes tells a different story, saying he received the letters but never opened them because he thought they had to do with another legal matter. He says he's upset with the system the city uses to send out citations. 'When you get a traffic ticket the officer brings you the ticket,' Yoes said. 'So there’s no question so that you know that this is what happened. That never happened here.'","Grand Prairie, Texas officials say Rick Yoes, 57, has refused to respond to two decades worth of code violations for unruly lawn .

"The wife of the prominent D.C. rabbi who was caught filming dozens of women changing in a ritual bathroom at their synagogue has spoken out for the first time since his arrest last fall. A little more than a month before her husband, Bernard Freundel, is set to be sentenced for his crimes, his wife Sharon Freundel held a lecture at a Maryland Jewish school about how to respond to traumatic experiences. While Mrs Freundel did not directly address her personal drama, she did allude to the scandal which shocked her community at the beginning of the talk. 'As you all know, I've become an expert in PTSD,' Mrs Freundel told the room of about 150 people, according to the Washington Post.  'Researching this has been so therapeutic.' Sharon Fruendel (right), wife of disgraced D.C. Rabbi Bernard 'Barry' Freundel (left) gave a speech on March 22 which alludes to her family's recent scandal. In October, her husband was charged with spying on dozens of women who changed in their synagogue's ritual bathroom . It was in October that Sharon's husband Bernard 'Barry' Freundel was arrested after a police investigation revealed he had spied on dozens of women who changed in the ritual mikvah bathrooms at the Kesher Israel Congregation synagogue in D.C. Freundel first came under investigation when a woman changing came across a suspicious  clock radio in the bathroom which is used mainly by people converting to Judaism and Jewish women to cleanse following menstruation. In February, the 63-year-old rabbi pleaded guilty to 52 misdemeanor charges of  voyerism and he is set to be sentenced on May 15. In the weeks following her husband's arrest, Freundel left D.C. for Maryland, where one of her daughter's lived. While her husband has granted her a Jewish divorce, the two are still legally married. On March 22, she spoke to the group fathered at Charles E Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville, Maryland,  for about 90 minutes. During the talk she cited several instances of 'trauma' in the Hebrew bible and how the biblical figures responded to their crises as lessons for life. She seemed to address her own personal issues with her husband when she quoted Jewish philosopher Joseph Soloveitchik, who wrote that marriage is a place people can go 'when we believed nobody 'gets' us.' Barry Freundel pleaded guilty to 52 counts of misdemeanor voyeurism in February. He is set to be sentenced in May. Pictured above leaving D.C. Superior court on February 19 . However, Soloveitchik ends by saying that ultimately, the answer 'is to turn to the one above. The one above will get it.' Several members of the Kesher community were in attendance to hear Freundel talk, and respected her more for it. 'She didn't want to represent the scandal anymore,' one longtime Kesher member told the Post. 'It gave her sense of how she survived it and how the community can survive it. She was educating the community in surviving its misfortune.' Mrs Freundel is also the director of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at the Jewish Primary Day School in northwest D.C. Prosecutors said Freundel recorded the women between early 2009 and October 2014 using devices installed in two changing rooms for the National Capital Mikvah, which is next to the Kesher synagogue. Investigators found six video files of nude women, with one showing Freundel's face as he set up the camera, prosecutors said. Police searched his home and his office at Maryland's Towson University, where he was an associate professor, and seized computers, electronic devices, remote controls, hard drives and cameras hidden in a fan and a tissue box, they said. Prosecutors said at least 52 women were recorded nude or partially nude on 25 different dates from March 2012 to September 2014. Voyeurism carries a three-year statute of limitations. Investigators also found that Freundel secretly recorded about 100 more women between 2009 and September 2014 in a bathroom at the National Capital Mikvah, they said. Each of the 52 counts of voyeurism carries a penalty of a year in prison and/or a fine of up to $1,000, or $2,500 for those committed after June 2013. One of the victims, Stephanie Doucette, said in a statement: 'I continue to be profoundly shocked and upset by Rabbi Freundel's outrageous conduct, which violated the security, trust and beliefs of so many women.' Freundel is also facing civil lawsuits and was fired from Kesher Israel in December. His congregation has included Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman.","Sharon Freundel gave a lecture on dealing with traumatic incidents at a Jewish school in Maryland on March 22 .

"A New York City doorman says he's been fired for being too good at his job. Ralph Body, up until March 29, manned the front desk of the luxury 27 on 27th building in Long Island City, Queens. The 41-year-old told the New York Post he 'gave his life' for his wealthy tenants and would go out of his way to do any personal tasks they asked--all while keeping a cheerful smile on his face. But that willingness to go above and beyond for tenants--by taking care of pets and watering plants, among other chores--didn't sit well with the 2-year-old building's management, Body says. 'They said, 'We know you did it for the right reasons, but unfortunately...you're too nice to the tenants,'' he told the Post. Too nice? Queens doorman Ralph Body was a smiling fixture in the lobby of the luxury 27 on 27th building in Long Island City, but was fired for, according to him, being too nice . When Body insisted he only did what was asked of him, he says his employers with Heatherwood Communities said it didn't matter. 'Unfortunately, in this case, nice guys finish last,' Body says his higher-up told him. According to the Post, the tenants who so adored Body have now taken up his cause with a petition to get him reinstated to his job. 'Most tenants, especially those who have lived in the building since it opened, can attest to Ralph's kindness and eagerness to make people feel safe and welcome,' the petition reads. 'The ruthlessness of Ralph's termination is disgusting, unjust, and disheartening. From day one, Ralph has gone above and beyond his duties. Yes, rules and regulations must be followed, but Heatherwood is more than capable of providing coaching and counseling to ensure the best possible outcome for its tenants and staff.' Management company Heatherwood Communities says Body broke the rules. Body says he only did what was asked of him, like cleaning cat litter, taking care of pets and watering plants . The petition, on ipetitions.com, had received 72 of its goal of 250 signatures by Sunday evening. Now he waits, though Body could soon get a new job through his staffing company PBS Facility Services. Most tenants in Body's corner blame the building management and not the staffing company for the concierge's termination. the Post reports. But Heatherwood, in an email sent to tenants, says that's not the case. 'It was recently brought to our attention that Ralph did not follow PBS's policies and procedures and after being spoken to several times, it was their decision to reassign him to another building,' says the letter, which was obtained by the Post.","Ralph Body was once a beloved figure at the front desk of the building 27 on 27th in Queens .
The concierge says he was fired last week and now believes it was because he was too willing to help affluent tenants--even after his shifts .
Some tenants are gathering signatures to get 41-year-old Body reinstated as the building's ever-effervescent doorman ."
"It may not be a looker, but the Lusitanian toadfish can do much more than croak. The fish, which lives in rocky crevices in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean and glides over the muddy sea floor, can whistle, croak and grunt. Scientists have found that Halobatrachus didactylus makes five types of calls not only to attract a mate, but to warn off rivals too may be trying to swipe their nesting site. Lusitanian toadfish (pictured) make five types of calls and males can even sing in choruses to attract mates. The fish woo females with long, rhythmical boatwhistles, which also act as a deterrent to love rivals, . Male fish woo females with long, rhythmical noises that sound like boat whistles, which also act as a deterrent to love rivals, New Scientist reported. They build nests under rocks during mating season, which runs from May to July and sing to attract female visitors. If they are successful, the pair mate and the male looks after young that hatch from sticky eggs until they are ready to fend for themselves after around a month. Because males, which grow up to 20 inches (50cm) long, are fiercely territorial, their song also serves as a warning for rivals to stay away. Males build nests under rocks during mating season (pictured), which runs from May to July and sing to attract female visitors. The creature is well camouflaged so sound is the best way to get attention . This is important because males nest close together to one another and form singing choruses like frogs or toads to demonstrate their virility and strength. The whistles vary according to the size of the fish, meaning that specific calls from larger specimens are particularly effective at deterring another fish from picking a fight and stealing a nest. Lusitanian toadfish typically weigh more than four lbs (2kg) and their large, flat heads and wide mouths, make them look like toads, giving their their name. Portuguese scientists discovered that the sounds made by Lusitanian toadfish indicate who they are, their motivation and information about their nest. If they are successful, the pair mate and the male looks after young that hatch from sticky eggs until they are ready to fend for themselves after around a month. Here, a female lays eggs, which stick to the roof of a nest . The experts analysed the frequencies of different songs.  Water temperature, tide level, fish motivation and the level of social interactions affected most acoustic parameters analysed (shown above). For example, during low tide, the sounds made by the fish were shorter in duration and had lower main frequencies . Male mice sing to woo females, scientists claim. They also change their tune depending on whether she is within sight or not. The females, meanwhile, seem to like some of the songs more than others. In a quirky study that could shed help shed light on autism and other conditions that involve difficulties in communication, researchers from Duke University in North Carolina studied male mice that were either placed in a cage with a female – or one with just her scent. Special equipment was used to record and analyse their squeaks, which are so high-pitched that people can’t hear them. This revealed that they sang one song when they could simply smell a female and another one when they could see her. When they could merely smell a potential mate, they belted out an extremely shrill and complex song, perhaps in an attempt to make themselves known. But when she was within sight, they serenaded her more softly. These songs also had a more simple structure and were longer. Clara Amorim of ISPA University Institute in Portugal studied the different sounds made by the fish, which contracts muscles in its swim bladders to release air, a little like bagpipe. It makes different sounds by contracting its bladders in various ways. To prove that 'boatwhistles' are used as a deterrent as well as for seduction, her team deflated the swim bladders of fish under anaesthesia, so that the creatures could still contract their muscles, but were rendered silent. The team found that mute males were more likely to face intruders in their nests, suggesting that 'boatwhistles' are an effective warning siren. ‘Boatwhistles are a cheap way to exclude intruders without engaging in a fight,’ Dr Amorim said. ‘Seeing that a nest is occupied is not as effective as hearing that there is a male in the nest eager to defend its territory.’ The sounds are modified by environmental factors such as tide level and water temperature as well as courtship motivation and by social interactions. For example, during low tide, the water temperature rises slightly and it's harder for sound to travel in shallow waters, which means that fewer fish sing and their noises are shorter in length and lower in pitch. They found that males that are desperate to mate sing a lot more at higher frequencies with longer notes. Males singing as part of a chorus sing more than they do when they are alone. Fish that sing the most, were found to be capable of a contracting their sound-producing muscles more and therefore showed that their body is in good condition. This means that males that can sing for longer have more energy reserves to defend the nest and to care for the eggs, and could enjoy higher social status and reproductive success as a result. Other fish sing too, such as clownfish, which click their jaws together to scare off intruders.

"All hungry Leo wanted was one of his dog biscuits to chew on. Instead the Staffordshire-Boxer cross ended up nearly burning the house down and killing his owner's son. The dog caused a severe fire after managing to switch on the cooker while trying to reach his dog treats. The heat from one of the hob's rings set fire to a child's seat that had been left resting on the electric appliance. Fire starter: Hungry Leo almost burned down his owner's home  as he hunted for his dog treats . The blaze was started after the Staffordshire-Boxer cross was believed to have knocked one of the cooker knobs, switching on the hob . Smoke began to fill the three storey home in Peckham, south-east London, as owner Allen Mosey's son, 21, and his daughter's boyfriend relaxed in upstairs rooms. The pair   managed to flee unharmed with Leo after noticing thick black smoke billowing up the stairs. More than 10 firefighters were needed to extinguish the flames. A search of the house later revealed that the source of fire was the cooker. Firefighters believe that when Leo was hunting for food he knocked one of the cooker's knobs, turning the rings on. The blaze damaged one third of the ground floor of the property and Leo's family have been left surviving on sandwiches. 'You wouldn't think butter would melt in his mouth to look at him,' Mr Mosey, 67, told the Southwark News. 'He's the most docile dog you could think of.' The charred remains of a car seat that had been left on the hob, which caught fire . Leo's owner Allen Mosey examines the damage caused to his home by the fire in Peckham, south-east London . Allen and his wife Jean were out shopping when the blaze started. Mrs Mosey, 47, confessed that she often left things on the cooker when it was switched off. She said that despite Leo almost burning down the  house the family still love him, but he will be locked out of their new kitchen. A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: 'We're naturally extremely pleased that no one was injured in this fire and while unusual, it's not unheard of for our crews to deal with incidents like this. 'It shows just how important it is to keep pets away from naked flames or cooker controls and to make sure kitchen surfaces and cookers are clear of food and other items that can easily catch fire.'","Family pet Leo nearly burned down home in Peckham, south-east London .

"A family doctor cut a hole in a Lynx shampoo bottle so he could film men using the showers in the gym. Dr Omar Saadi Al-Atraqchi, 42, faces being struck off the medical register making him unable to continue working at the Custom House Surgery in Newham, East London as well as other surgeries in North London after he was found with the footage. The urology specialist cut peepholes in Lynx bottles and emptied and dried them so he could hide his iPhone inside to film through the hole. He then slid the device under the partition of shower cubicles so he could secretly film men next door to him. Dr Omar Saadi Al-Atraqchi could be struck off after he admitted secretly filming men in the gym showers by cutting a hole in Lynx shampoo bottles and concealing his iPhone inside before he put bottles into cubicles . But Al-Atraqchi was caught out twice - once when a man noticed a glint of a camera through a bottle, and again when a fitness instructor became suspicious when he heard plastic being rustled and saw a Lynx bottle appear in his shower cubicle. The doctor said he had set up the intricate device  to 'let off steam' because of the pressure at work, and claimed he also felt isolated and confused about his sexuality. Al-Atraqchi pleaded guilty to four counts of voyeurism and was fined £500, and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £25 when he appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. He now faces a hearing to determine whether he will be struck off the medical register after a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester found him guilty of misconduct and told his ability to practise medicine had been impaired. Two of the incidents took place at Pure Gym in Holloway. A spokesman for the gym said security had now been stepped up and Al-Atraqchi had been banned from all Pure Gyms for life. In the first incident, in March last year, the Iraqi GP was found out when a naked gym user noticed a shower gel bottle being moved under the exposed area at the bottom of the  cubicle and spotted a man's hand moving the bottle around as if to re-position it. He also saw a hole in the top and a camera lens exposed in the hole. He knocked loudly on the shower wall and shouted at the doctor who then pulled the shower gel bottle away and fled. Al-Atraqchi cut a peep hole in Lynx bottles (left) and dried them out to hide an iPhone inside the bottle . The urology specialist worked at Custom House surgery in north London, as well as other local practices . On the second occasion a member of gym staff was showering when he noticed 'odd sounds' coming from an adjacent cubicle. A few moments later he noticed a shower gel bottle lying flat on the floor diagonally from within the adjoining cubicle and saw something 'gleaming' from the hole in the bottle. The staff member then wrenched opened Al-Atraqchi's cubicle as the doctor was standing, naked and clutching various shower gel bottles. He denied owning the bottles but was banned from the gym and police called. Describing the first time he was unmasked at the gym Dr Al-Atraqchi told the hearing: 'It was there but I don't recall any recording. I was caught. He caught me. He opened the door and said 'open the cubicle, otherwise I will open it' and he saw what was in my hand - the shower bottle. 'It's difficult to explain and give justification for it, but my understanding it I was isolated, not comfortable with myself and my sexuality, had low self-esteem with my job, depression with work, moving from job to job and that's put me under pressure and pushed me for this impulsive behaviour. Al-Atraqchi said he secretly filmed the men to 'let off steam' because his job was very stressful . 'I wish I could apologise. To be honest, on reflection, one thing that would stop me doing it is I wouldn't accept this would be done to me. If I can, I apologise.' Officers seized two mobile telephones one showing secret footage of a man unwittingly exposing his private parts in 2011. Hamish Common for the General Medical Council told the doctor he had 'impulsive behaviour.' He said: 'You had a shampoo bottle and the fact there were two shampoo bottles found in your possession in March 2014 by the assistant manager means you must have used the shampoo or otherwise got rid of it out of the bottle, emptied it, and dried it out. You opened up the shampoo, cleaned it and put in the iPhone. 'There was a hole cut in the Lynx bottle in such a place to expose the lens of the camera to the outside world. Would it be reasonable to assume there has been some planning and preparation in the construction of this albeit rudimentary apparatus?' Al-Atraqchi's lawyer claimed the doctor had suffered 'shame and humiliation' as a result of being caught and he posed a low risk to patient safety. He had also been allowed to carry on working despite the incidents. But the tribunal panel said: 'The convictions demonstrate a lack of integrity in that you recorded people secretly, in a state of undress and without their consent. The panel is also concerned about your level of insight. It has been described as 'poor' in one report and it is only lately that you are able to say that you are 'getting there' in terms of your offending behaviour. 'The panel does not consider that your insight is fully developed and considers that you remain at risk of repeating the behaviour. 'Your offences undermine public confidence in the profession and the panel considers that a reasonable member of the public, in possession of all the facts, would be deeply troubled by the behaviour in which you engaged.' Al-Atraqchi will learn his fate next week.","Dr Omar Saadi Al-Atraqchi, 42,  is a family doctor specialising in urology .

"The search for a two-metre South American boa constrictor, on the loose after police mistakenly believed it was a harmless Australian python and set it free, has been called off. The bizarre search began on Queensland's Gold Coast as authorities tried to locate the reptile which could pose a threat to local wildlife and even people's pet cats and dogs. Snake catcher Tony Harrison warned that if the large-predatory boa has Inclusion Body Disease 'it can be unbelievably contagious if that gets loose in Australia'. Mr Harrison told Daily Mail Australia: 'Police should have called the snake catchers and we'd have euthanised it. That was very silly of them.' But Biosecurity Queensland officials have now given up looking for the snake and authorities will instead put up a warning sign. The notice will reportedly tell dog owners and small children to 'watch out', the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. Scroll down for video . Queensland Police found the snake at the base of a tree on a footpath (pictured) in Surfers Paradise and then released it into the wild . Queensland Police say officers were called to The Esplanade at Surfers Paradise on or about March 26, to respond to reports of a large snake spotted at the base of a tree on a footpath. The officers released the reptile into bushland at the Southport Spit, sparking an operation by Biosecurity Queensland officers who say the snake isn't a harmless python after all. Mr Harrison believes the snake - likely to be an illegal import that was kept as a pet - will be found 'within a month' but there are fears if the boa is pregnant there could then be up to 30 live young on the loose. The reptile which could pose a threat to local wildlife and even people's pet cats and dogs (stock photo) South American boa constrictors  have varying patterns of cream, brown, tan, gray, and black with ovals and diamonds . 'They can eat up to three times their girth, no more or less than pythons and including a cat or small dog, but the biggest problem is if it was going to give birth,' Mr Harrison warned. Biosecurity Queensland was working with the Gold Coast City Council in a bid to find the snake. 'Police originally caught it in a sheet after spotting it under a tree in Surfers Paradise before they released it in bushland at The Spit,' a spokesman said. 'They say they captured the snake when it started moving towards people.'

"A shrine created in memory of those killed during the Germanwings crash has revealed the first picture of the hero pilot who tried to break into the plane’s cockpit. Staring straight ahead, eyes firmly on the camera, this is the only photograph to have emerged of Patrick Sonderheimer, the pilot of the doomed flight. Yet the shrine, which was erected in memory of the staff killed during the tragedy, controversially also includes a picture of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. Scroll down for video . A memorial display at Dusseldorf airport has revealed the first photograph of hero captain Patrick Sondheimer left) who tried to break down the cockpit door to stop killer pilot Andreas Lubitz (second from left) from crashing the aircraft . Mr Lubitz is the man who orchestrated the disaster by steering flight 9525, from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, into the mountains killing all of those on board. It has since emerged that Mr Lubitz had carefully planned the attack using the online pseudonym ‘Skydevil’, according to the German newspaper Bild. As the plane plummeted towards ground, Mr Sondheimer, 36, a father-of-two, tried in vain to save the lives of the 144 passengers and five crew members on board. Moments before, he had left the cockpit in the hands of his co-pilot in order to use the bathroom. When he returned, the door was locked and co-pilot Lubitz, 27, ignored desperate pleas from his colleague to let him back in. In a desperate attempt to stop the fatal crash, Mr Sondheimer spent up to five minutes attempting to smash his way into the cockpit using an axe. Mr Sondheimer used an axe to try to break down the door to the cockpit after Lubitz (right) locked him out before accelerating into a mountain . All of the 144 passengers and five crew members died in the crash. Lubitz, 27, had been plotting the disaster online under the name Skydevil . On recordings retrieved from the plane’s black box Mr Sondheimer can be heard shouting: ‘Open the goddam door’ in the moments before his death. The display in memory of the staff who died was created before it was revealed that Mr Lubitz had intentionally crashed the plane in the French Alps on March 24. Alongside the two men, sit the photographs of the other four crew members killed during the tragedy. All four are seen smiling broadly at the camera. The picture was taken at Dusseldorf airport, according to German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. Last night, Mr Sondheimer’s heartbroken mother paid tribute to her ‘hero’ son at her home 15 miles from the German town of Dusseldorf. Mrs Sondheimer said: ‘He died a hero but he still died, and we are devastated. The light has gone out of our lives. I am too upset to say any more.’ Shortly before the crash, Mr Sondheimer, the father of a six-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy, had switched from long-haul to short-haul flights in order to spend more time with his young family. During a memorial on March 29, his grandmother Marianne Sondheimer said her grandson’s lifelong dream was to become a pilot. She said: ‘My grandson is dead and all because of an idiot who did this to his whole flight and killed so many people.’ During the service, Captain Sondheimer was described as a man who ‘radiated happiness’. Black box recordings revealed Mr Sondheimer frantically appealed to Lubitz to open the door as the plane plunged further towards a mountain.

"At least 35 workers have been killed at a dairy factory in Yemen as Saudi Arabian warplanes continue to bomb Shiite rebel positions in both the north and the south of the country. Today's airstrikes targeted rebel-controlled army camps in the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, and hit warehouses belonging to a factory that produces dairy products. The jets drew return fire from anti-aircraft guns as the Saudi-led campaign to defeat the Iran-backed Shiite rebels loyal to Yemen's deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh entered its seventh day. The attack on the dairy factory comes as Saudi Arabia hinted that it was prepared to launch a ground invasion in Yemen in the hope of forcing the Houthi rebels to allow current president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to return to the country, after he fled the southern port city of Aden last week. Hit: Smoke rises from the dairy factory hit by an air strike in Yemen's western port city of Houdieda today .

Yemeni supporters of the Saudi-led coalition hold pictures of Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud alongside Saudi and Yemeni flags during a demonstration against the Shiite Houthi rebels in Taez city today . Since their advance began last year, the Houthis have overrun the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and several provinces, and have forced current president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Following today's airstrikes on the dairy factory in Hodeida, the Houthi's anti-aircraft guns returned fire before the factory itself was set ablaze. Parts of its main building collapsed from explosions with workers still inside, according to at least five eyewitnesses and officials. According to the medical center in Hodeida, at least 35 workers were killed, many of them crushed by the rubble or burned to death. Two military officials said the factory had been used as a rebel weapons cache, and that while the airstrikes flattened the warehouses, the main factory building was only partially destroyed - suggesting it might have been hit from ground. All the officials and witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Families of stranded Pakistanis in Yemen hold their pictures in a rally for their rescue in Multan today . Yemeni men chant slogans while holding posters of  the Shiite Houthi rebel leaders they support . The airstrikes come as Saudi Arabia hinted once again that it could carry an ground invasion in Yemen in the coming days. Authorities  reiterated that the Sunni alliance, which was set up by the Arab nations against the Houthi Shiite rebels, is boosting its military presence in the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border. Saudi Arabia shares a 1,120 mile-long border with Yemen -- much of which is incredibly porous. 'The Saudi-led air campaign may be accompanied by an operation on the ground,' Saudi Arabia's Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri was quoted as saying by the International Business Times. 'One should not expect a sudden ground attack,' he reportedly added. 'The Houthis are moving from one place to another in search of safe havens. We will make sure that there will be no safe place the militants to hide on the land of Yemen,' General Asseri went on to say.

Yemeni men in Tehran hold a burning photo of Saudi King Salman, with Arabic writing reading 'Horn of Satan' The Hodeida death toll came a day after international aid groups expressed alarm over high civilian casualties in Yemen's escalating crisis. A report published yesterday by the U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, said 62 children were killed and 30 wounded during the fighting in Yemen over the past week. It was not clear if the deaths were the result of airstrikes or ongoing clashes between rival groups across the country. The U.N. human rights office in Geneva also said its staffers in Yemen confirmed that at least 19 civilians died when airstrikes hit a refugee camp near the Houthi stronghold of Saada in northern Yemen on Sunday, with at least 35 wounded, including 11 children. Critics of the Houthis charge that they are an Iranian proxy — a claim the rebels deny. Iran has provided aid to the rebels, but both Tehran and the Houthis deny it has armed them. In Tehran, dozens of Yemeni expatriates, including clerics and students, took to the streets on Wednesday to denounce the airstrikes. The protesters burned photos of Saudi King Salman and marched outside the Saudi Embassy.","Dairy factory in Red Sea port city of Hodeida was destroyed earlier today .

"After many years of speculation, Bunkie King has finally laid to rest rumours about the nature of relationship with Australian actor Jack Thompson and her older sister, Leona. Ms King shocked and intrigued the Australian public when she entered into a relationship with Thompson, who was twice her age, while he was also involved with Leona – who is nicknamed Le. The 60-year-old’s first meeting with Thompson was when she was 15 years old Sydney school girl, and has now revealed the salacious details of their 15-year affair and unconventional arrangement. Scroll down for video . Bunkie King, 60, has revealed how her three-way relationship with Australian actor Jack Thompson and her sister worked . Ms King, also appeared with Thompson in 1975 movie Scobie Malone, had a 15-year affair with the womanising actor . Speaking with A Current Affair about her book, Somebody I Used to Know: Love, Loss and Jack Thompson, Ms King said she decided to pen a novel during an argument with her son. At one point, he shouted: 'I'm not proud that my mother had sex with her sister.' This was the moment Ms King realised there were many misconceptions about her relationship with the womanising actor. 'That really shocked me because that wasn't our relationship,' she said. 'It never entered my head [that's what people thought], so I put it down warts and all.' Ms King, who has two children with her ex-husband, also revealed how she shared one man with her sister, 20. A young Bunkie King pictured here with her sister Leona - nicknamed Le - and Jack Thompson . Le (pictured left) was 20 years old when she started a relationship with the Australian actor . Jack pictured in 1980 (left) and 2013 (right), was written about under the headline 'Jack and his Jills', when he told a newspaper he felt 'like a bone being fought over by two dogs' But from the start the siblings made it clear they were not going to sleep with him in the same bed. When Ms King first moved in with Le and Thompson she was 'allocated one night a week' with the actor. But then they relocated to Collaroy - on Sydney's North Shore - and the sisters would see him on alternating nights. Ms King said she had never close to Le and there were times where she felt her sister, who she is now estranged from, wished she had Thompson all to herself. But it was all or nothing with Thompson, who starred in Spyforce - an action series following Australian Military Intelligence operatives in the South West Pacific during World War II. 'I was happy for whatever crumbs came off the table. It did cause problems with jealousy and things like that. I don't think either of us would have chosen it that way,' Ms King said. Cleo magazine featured him reclined naked on a sofa catapulting him to sex symbol status overnight . Talking to New Idea, Ms King said their relationship in many ways was 'quite old-fashioned'. 'We had separate bedrooms. He was just sleeping with both of us,' she said. In her interview with ACA, Ms King said her relationship was not a 'unique situation'. 'It is in western society but it's not a unique situation for a man to have more than one wife,' she said. 'In western society, a man generally speaking has a wife and a mistress or maybe a couple of mistresses.' But despite his commitment to two women, Ms King claims Thompson still had time to be unfaithful to her and Le. She said what hurt her the most about his alleged infidelities was the fact he was not open, honest and upfront about it. Ms King also revealed her sister did not know about her regular afternoon visits from Thompson at their mother's house when he started to court her. The visits in the 1970s increased  to three a week and, after months of spending time together, she fell hopelessly in love knowing he was with Le. Ms King has revealed in her memoirs how, as a virgin, she struggled to dampen her feelings for the blond tanned hunk and desperately craved his love even after her sister caught them kissing. Heyday: The actor, pictured centre (moustache), starred alongside David Bowie (right) in 1983 movie Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence . Seventies hit: The star (right) was catapulted to fame for the series Spyforce, based on the adventures of Australian Military Intelligence operatives in the South West Pacific during World War II . Ms King writes: 'One night, he and I are kissing and cuddling in their bedroom when Le [Leona] bursts in the door yelling, ""What the hell are you doing?"" 'He jumps up off the bed and tries to calm her down. I bolt out of the room, down the stairs, through the front door and out into the street. 'I know there's something wrong with what we've been doing. He's obviously Le's boyfriend and I feel bad for her, but I don't know how to give him up.' It was the same for Jack too and, with his popularity at its height in the mid-1970s, the Wake In Fright star bought a rambling farm in the hills above Coffs Harbour, on the NSW mid-north coast, and convinced the sisters to share an 'open' and 'honest' relationship with him. New Idea magazine is on sale now . They moved in together, Ms King confined to the smaller room, while Leona shares the master bedroom with the actor, now dubbed 'Jack The Lady Killer' by the media. In her book, the 60-year-old also speaks frankly about her drug use, ranging from marijuana to acid to heroin. But she did not classify her drug use as 'hardcore'. 'Hardcore to me is someone who is basically mainlining. It was the 60s and the 70s,' Ms King said. During the early years of their relationship, Cleo magazine featured Thompson reclined on a sofa in a pose emulating a classic nude, Titian's Venus d'Urbino, catapulting him to sex symbol status overnight. In 1972, Ms King evealed she fell pregnant for the first time, having forgotten to take the Pill, and underwent the first of three terminations over 15 years. As Jack's fame grew, journalists clamoured for details about the nature of his threesome relationship and in October 1974, he granted Sydney's Daily Telegraph an interview. Published under the headline 'Jack and his Jills', he claimed that he occasionally felt 'like a bone being fought over by two dogs.' The truth, however, no doubt lies somewhere in between. Ms King says a serious showdown in Spain forced her to finally flee and maintains throughout her 15 years as Jack's lover, she never knew if she was genuinely wanted or was 'just an interloper.' Today she works in nursing and is divorced with a son Stephan, 17, and daughter, and lives a quiet life south of Sydney. And for his part, Jack remains with Leona, with whom he shares a son Billy, and the pair lead a reclusive life in Ulong in New South Wales.","Bunkie King was a 15-year-old Sydney schoolgirl when she met the actor .

Police in the wealthy Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a 'person of interest' in an active investigation into criminal threats. Scroll down for video . Everything was rosy between the ex Bon Jovi guitarist and his lover and business partner Nikki Lund last July. But Lund has claimed in a statement to police that Sambora recently threatened her saying he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her,' Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. The rock star is believed to be on vacation in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and daughter Ava but faces questioning when he returns. Lund, 33, founded the Nikki Rich clothing line with Sambora and confessed last year that the pair had been having an on-off personal relationship for eight years. When their affair ended it plunged the business partnership into turmoil, just as the duo were preparing to open a boutique on swank Robertson Boulevard. Sambora's alleged threat came just days after Lund launched her first signature solo show at the opening of LA fashion week on March 18. 'They are in the midst of unraveling their fashion business Nikki Rich,' a source told Daily Mail Online. 'Things have become very bitter in recent weeks. 'The threat happened in the midst of Nikki launching her solo line. Richie apparently went mad on the phone at her and threatened to kill her. 'He said words to the effect that he was going to dig a hole in the desert and bury her.' Nikki, a close childhood friend of Kim Kardashian, filed a report Wednesday night with detectives from the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. Back to back: The couple posed for the cover of the new edition of  LA Fashion Magazine before they went their separate ways . 'She held off going to cops hoping that the situation would resolve itself,' added the source. But after advice from lawyers and business associates she made the report. 'Richie has been drinking heavily for months and acting erratically . 'He has threatened violence in the past.' Nikki and Kim K are friends from way back . Lieutenant Jennifer Seetoo confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a person of interest in the case. Under Californian law making criminal threats can be a felony offence punishable by up to four years in jail. 'A report was taken regarding criminal threats,' Lieutenant Seetoo said. 'It's an active investigation.' A representative of Mr. Sambora said there was no truth in Nikki Lund's claims. 'This is a cluster of fabricated lies in retaliation for Mr Sambora's decision to cease further funding of the unprofitable partnership, plain and simple,' said the rep. Sambora suddenly quit Bon Jovi during their 2013 world tour because of 'personal issues'. The New York Post later reported that Jon Bon Jovi had kicked out his longtime songwriting partner due to substance abuse issues. Sambora and Lund reportedly began their romance in 2006 - a year before his divorce from Dynasty actress Locklear was finalized. Denise Richards dated Sambora . Sambora is believed to be in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and their daughter Ava . They are said to have carried on seeing each other despite Sambora going on to date another Hollywood beauty, Denise Richards. The long-time fling became public last December when Lund was doing publicity for the new fashion line. The curvy blonde confessed to Playboy TV: 'He's amazing in bed ... how could you stay away from the guy?' Their joint venture collapsed at the last moment, however, despite the pair appearing on billboards together and on the cover of Los Angeles Fashion magazine. Sambora is now dating Australian guitarist Orianthi despite a 26-year age difference. Lund's attorney declined to comment on the complaint.

"It may have been Bugs Bunny's favourite treat but an animal charity has warned that too many carrots are making the nation's pet rabbits fat. The PDSA has said that obesity levels in pets is at an all-time high, with experts predicting that more than half will be classed as overweight within five years. Around one in three dogs and one in four cats are already said to be overweight. Too many treats, the wrong type of food and lack of exercise were to blame for turning some of the nation's bunnies into giants,  the charity added. Scroll down for video . Grace the giant overweight rabbit has joined the PDSA's annual Pet Fit Club competition for overweight animals . Carrots were named as the worst culprit as the vegetables are very high in sugar and so should only ever be given as the occasional treat, not as regular feed. Nicola Martin, PDSA Head of Pet Health and Welfare, said: 'Sadly, many of our 1.3 million pet rabbit population in the UK are 'unhappy bunnies', as many of their welfare needs are being neglected. 'The good news however is that pet obesity is entirely preventable. Experts have warned that more than half of pets will be overweight in five years with carots named as the worst culprits for bunny obesity . Now in its tenth year, the Pet Fit Club puts pets on a six-month diet and exercise programme overseen by vets, leading to one being crowned a super slimmer . 'So we're advising owners that, while feeding their pet a treat may be rewarding in the short term, as a way of showing affection, the long term impact is serious. They could be killing them with kindness.' PDSA research revealed that four-out-of-five veterinary professionals had seen an increase in pet obesity cases in the last two years. The problem of fat pets has become some widespread that the runs an annual Pet Fit Club competition to put them through their paces. Porky pets are placed on a six-month diet and exercise programme overseen by vets, leading to one being crowned a super slimmer. A veterinary nurse holds bulldog Daisy from Middlesbrough, who weighs 28kg - she is one of 17 of the UK's podgiest pets, who are competing in an annual competition known as Pet Fit Club . Andy Cage from PetAID hospital says that obesity is one of the biggest animal welfare problems . Last year's candidates included Daisy the obese bulldog from Middlesbrough, who at 4st 6lb, was double the weight she should have been. Fellow rabbit Poppy was a third heavier than she should be at more than 7lb – mainly due to a taste for popcorn. Owner Donna Manson said that her rabbits are not dissimilar to us, piling on the pounds over winter, the peak time for comfort eating. Zorro, a three-year-old ginger Tom from Dundee, became so fat he could no longer groom himself and would often wake owner Linda Petrie in the middle of the night for his favourite snack: cheese and onion crisps. Donna said that she had no idea that some of the treats she was giving to her bunnies were so fattening. A happy bunny: Poppy the rabbit was one of last year's competitors in the PDSA pet fit club who has slimmed down now (right) forweighed 7lbs (left) when she entered . Ginger Tom Zorro has become so overweight he is unable to groom himself . 'I've tried to cut down on the carrots and apples, as I've recently learned that they are both high in sugar and not the healthy snacks I thought they were,' she added. Other candidates included a cat that can open the fridge and a Jack Russell with a taste for doner kebabs. PDSA Pet Fit Club was launched in 2005 and has already helped 57 dogs, 24 cats and 3 rabbits lose a total of 295kg (46 stone 6lb). This weight loss is the equivalent of nearly 300 bags of sugar, more than 4,400 sausages, 740 tins of dog food or over 1,000 blocks of lard. Senior Veterinary Surgeon, Andy Cage, from Dundee PetAid hospital, said that having over weight animals is not just a nuisance, it is also an issue of cruelty. 'Obesity is one of the biggest welfare issues affecting pets in the UK today. Sadly, it also means millions of pets are at risk from potentially life-threatening health problems related to obesity. 'But the good news is that obesity is entirely reversible.'","Too many carrots are making the nation's spoilt pet rabbits overweight .

"Arrested: Arnold Quintero from San Antonio, Texas . A man has been arrested after a 13-year-old girl was imprisoned, beaten, sexually assaulted and burned with a lighter in America. Arnold Quintero, 21, from San Antonio, Texas faces a string of charges after the girl told police she was punched and forced to undress in front of her attacker. He faces two charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, one of sex performed by a child under 14, bodily injury to a child, evading arrest and possession with intent to deliver, according to the Houston Chronicle. The girl was interviewed by the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office Criminal Investigations Division last month, according to the arrest warrant statement. She said she had been held in a 'trap' house between January 21 and February 8 and was punched in the face, resulting in black eyes and a bleeding nose. A 'trap house' is a term normally used to define a crack house, or a place where drugs are sold. The girl told police a lighter was held to the side of her face, burning her. According to the Houston Chronicle, the girl was forced to undress and the man took  photographs and had sex with her. The statement said the 13-year-old identified Quintero about a month after the interview in a photographic lineup. He was held in jail and posted bond (an amount of money) on three of his charges, with three remaining as of Friday night, the paper reported.

"Teachers complained they are now expected to be 'frontline stormtroppers' in the fight against Islamist extremism in school, a conference has heard. They said they are now being forced to spy on children during sensitive discussions as a result of new-counter terrorism rules. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) suggested that Government strategies designed to tackle extremism and terrorism have instead 'shut down debate' in schools. Teachers said they now feel nervous discussing controversial issues over fears they will be pressured to report youngsters who share their opinions. They also claimed young people  feel unable to express there views on certain subjects, such as the Charlie Hebdo killings, for fear of being branded an extremist. Scroll down for video . Christine Blower, NUT general secretary, said there is a need keep a 'safe space' for discussion . Jan Nielsen, an NUT member from Wandsworth, south-west London, said: 'We have to be clear that we are being put in the position where we are really being expected to be the frontline stormtroopers, who listen, who spy, and notify the authorities about students that we may be suspicious of.' The conference heard an example of a student being pulled aside after prayers one Friday because children coming out of the prayer room were talking about extremism, despite the fact that the boy had put a strong argument against joining jihadi groups. In another case, a boy who applied to go to Pakistan to visit his dying grandfather had his laptop taken from him and searched, with three potential examples of the youngster viewing jihadi websites found. When the pupil was questioned, he asked how he could argue against something if he did not understand it. In response, the pupil's non-Muslim classmates questioned why they would not be seen as suspicious if they applied to visit their grandparents in Holland, the conference was told. Delegates at the annual conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, raised concerns about the move to require schools to promote fundamental British values as well as the Government's Prevent strategy, which is aimed at tackling extremism. The strategy suggests school staff can help to identify and refer youngsters whose behaviour suggests that they are being drawn into extremism or terrorism. Alex Kenny, of the union's executive, described Prevent as a 'blunt instrument that will do damage and inhibit debate in schools', adding that Ofsted should be allowed 'nowhere near these issues'. Ofsted now checks that schools are actively promoting British values like tolerance and democracy as part of regular inspections. In the wake of attacks on the Charlie Hebdo journalists there were, in some schools, Muslim pupils who did not feel they could say they were offended by the newspapers cartoons . Mr Kenny said: 'We live in a damaged and volatile world, and like us, young people are trying to make sense of it, like us, they're trying to come to conclusions about cause, effect and solutions, and like us they want a space to discuss it. 'Schools are places where that discussion, on ethical and political issues should take place, in an environment of enquiry, and it may be an environment where young people say things we don't like, or say things that concern us that we want to address with them, that we want to discuss with them. 'But Prevent conflates a notion of British values and an elastic notion of non-violent extremism that is shutting down that debate.' He added: 'We have measures to deal with safeguarding, we have child protection measures, we don't need Prevent and we don't need to involve the police as the first instance. 'We are hearing young people telling teachers that they don't want to discuss things, that they don't want to discuss what happened with the Charlie Hebdo shootings, young people who were offended by the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, but saying they don't want to say it in class, they don't want to say it in schools. The conference heard that Prevent was shutting down debate in schools . 'Prevent is shutting down debate and we must oppose it and we must say schools are places where children and teachers should be allowed to discuss these issues.' To loud applause, delegates passed a resolution which includes an amendment calling on conference to confirm it believes 'that schools should be places where young people can discuss events in a spirit of enquiry and openness, and that teachers are well-placed to facilitate such discussions and deal with the expression of unacceptable viewpoints'. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Teaching about the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and tolerance and respect for others is part of our promotion of British values, and is at the heart of what every school has to deliver for children. 'We want all schools to promote these values throughout the curriculum, not just as a bulwark against extremism, but as a vital part of preparing young people to get on in life.' He added: 'Our guidance makes it clear that no teacher or school leader should feel unable to talk about difficult or sensitive issues - indeed teaching about fundamental British values actively encourages such discussions - but no-one should be using a school to promote views, opinions or beliefs that discriminate against other people on the basis of their background.'","National Union of Teachers discuss Government strategies on extremism .

"A woman who was kidnapped at knife-point by her ex-boyfriend has been found by police  after she made contact with a family member. Billy-Anne Huxham, 18, from Caboolture, Queensland, was found at 9.45pm at Aerodrome Road in Maroochydore, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, after police found the Nissan SUV that was used in her abduction earlier that day. Ms Huxham's ex partner Carl Garry Chapman, 32, has been detained and charged with a string of offences including assault, torture and deprivation of liberty. Scroll down for video .

Her ex partner Carl Garry Chapman has been charged with unlawful use of a motor vehicle, entering dwelling with intent, assault occasioning bodily harm, torture, deprivation of liberty, dangerous conduct with a weapon, possession of a weapon, evading police, unlicensed driving and breach of bail . The 32-year-old was out on bail charges at the time of the abduction where he used a firearm to subdue the victim. While Chapman was holed up in a friends home Ms Huxham allegedly escaped her captor and fled to a local restaurant where she called her parents who then contacted police, The Courier-Mail reports. The man is due to appear in the Maroochydore Magistrates Court Saturday morning. Police located the silver 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander the teen was forced into early on Tuesday morning. The vehicle was found abandoned  on Kift St in Kallangar  at around 11.15am Thursday morning. This news came as Ms Huxham's Facebook page was inundated with posts by friends concerned with her welfare. A worried friend wrote: 'Can't believe what I'm hearing and seeing'. 'I know you're a staunch b**** and would put up a fight no matter what but my girl please just come back home safely.' After hearing of Ms Huxham's abduction her friends took to Facebook to beg her to turn her life around and 'stay away from those type of people' Ms Huxham's Facebook account was made private shortly after the abduction . Another said: 'Time to pull your head in woman get out of that… scene! Get home safely'. Ms Huxham, who also goes by the name of Billy-Anne Kunst, made a post to her Facebook page just 20 minutes before she was reportedly abducted. It reads : 'Well good morning f*****s; today looks like its FINE FORM yeeeeeow don't be getting lippy unless yas wanna have crack 4510, Mwa xo'. Shocked neighbours heard yelling and screaming moments before Ms Huxham was abducted from her home . Relatives of Ms Huxham, 18, told officers she was forced into a car at gunpoint outside a Caboolture home, just north of Brisbane, at around 6am. Shocked neighbours heard yelling and screaming moments before Ms Huxham was abducted from her home by a man who reportedly attacked her with a machete. The abandoned vehicle was found on Kift St in Kallangar at around 11.15am Thursday morning . Ms Huxton posted to Facebook only 20 minutes before she was allegedly assaulted with a machete and taken by her ex partner - 'Well good morning f*****s; today looks like its FINE FORM yeeeeeow don't be getting lippy unless yas wanna have crack 4510, Mwa xo' A neighbour, who didn't want to be identified, said she heard screaming before the Mitsubishi took off down the street.

"Tattoo-loving soldiers in the U.S. Army will soon be able to get inked on their arms and legs thanks to changing rules, officials announced Wednesday. Ink may extend all the way to the wrist once the rules go into effect. Regulations about the size and number of tattoos are also set to be dropped, according to Sergeant Major of the Army Dan Dailey. 'As long as it's not visible in the Army uniform…that's the spirit of what we went after,' Dailey told the Army Times. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno announced policy change at the Association of the United States Army conference in Huntsville, Alabama. Inked: Tattoo-loving soldiers in the U.S. Army will soon be able to get inked on their arms and legs thanks to changing rules, officials announced Wednesday . An Army spokeswoman said they will go into effect in the 'very near future.' The changes came as a result of feedback from soldiers. But it wasn't so long ago that the Army made a much different announcement concerning its tattoo policy. Highly unpopular regulations that went into effect in March 2014 banned tattoos below the knee or elbow. Soldiers who already had the ink were grandfathered in. Under those regulations, any soldier with tattoos was barred from seeking a promotion to warrant officer or commissioning as an officer. Tattoos have long been a part of military culture, but as they have become more popular, and more prominently displayed on the body, the various branches have been regulating them in to try to maintain a professional look. 'Society is changing its view of tattoos and we have to change along with that,' Odierno said. 'It makes sense. Soldiers have grown up in an era when tattoos are much more acceptable and we have to change along with that.' New rules: Ink may extend all the way to the wrist once the rules go into effect. Regulations about the size and number of tattoos are also set to be dropped, according to Sergeant Major of the Army Dan Dailey .","The new rules come barely a year after deeply unpopular restrictions enacted last March burned many inked soldiers .

"It's a brave politician indeed who is willing to expose their own battle with their squeezed middle for the cameras. As the election gets underway the gloves have come off between the main parties, and for three frontbenchers the tops have come off as well. Tory health minister Dan Poulter, Lib Dem minister Tom Brake and Labour frontbencher Gavin Shuker imposed strict cuts on their calories and put themselves at the mercy of a personal trainer for Men's Health magazine. Scroll down for video . Health minister Dan Poulter saw his weight fell from 105kg to 102.5kg, losing two inches off his 35in waist. His body fat fell from 24 per cent to 18 per cent . Cooped up in the Department of Health, he admitted it is difficult to practice what he preaches on keeping healthy . Skipping breakfast, grabbing lunch on the go and late nights in Parliament's bars and restaurants can take its toll on MPs when they arrive in Westminster. After five years of the coalition government, the three MPs agreed to take part in the feature for the Men's Health magazine, which is better known for its front covers of rippling muscles and toned six packs. Each was given strict orders to eat more healthily, do more exercise and take better care of their bodies. There was the inevitable unflattering 'before' photo shoot, followed by a full-length portrait to show off their new physique. Mr Poulter, a GP first elected in 2010, could be expected to already know what it takes to stay healthy. But cooped up in the Department of Health, he admitted it is difficult to practice what he preaches. 'I have an erratic diary, working 15-hour days, so it does require real dedication to get gym sessions in', he said. His personal trainer Stephen White put him on a regime of fat-burning intervals and muscle-building resistance training. He said: 'Dan really struggled at first because of his back – we focused on loosening and developing it to pull his shoulders back and correct his terrible posture.' In the end Mr Poulter's weight fell from 105kg to 102.5kg, losing two inches off his 35in waist. His body fat fell from 24 per cent to 18 per cent, and he boasted of feeling 'fitter, stronger, more awake and motivated in my work'. Lib Dem deputy Commons leader Tom Brake was told to build his upper-body strength and after six weeks of training could swim the 750m of the sprint distance triathlon without reverting to breast stroke . As deputy leader of the Commons, Mr Brake's job involved a lot of sitting on the green leather benches listening to debates. The Lib Dem MP and keen marathon runner could have been forgiven for thinking he was fit. But after casting an eye over his 'before' physique, personal trainer Daniel Marshall declared: 'Tom neglected every muscle from the waist up.' The 52-year-old was told to build his upper-body strength and after six weeks of training could swim the 750m of the sprint distance triathlon without reverting to breast stroke. He lost only a kilo of his 83.5kg starting weight, but his chest size grew from 38in to 48 in, while he lost an inch from his waist. Mr Brake said: 'I used to think going to the gym was a waste of time, and that you were much better off going for a run. Not anymore.' Labour MP Gavin Shuker embarked on an intense weight loss regime, forced to shun carbs and alcohol when being wined and dined in Westminster . Labour MP Gavin Shuker was elected as MP for Luton South in 2010, after incumbent Margaret Moran was forced out over her expenses. A shadow International Development minister, he says that he succumbed to the 'parliamentary stone' - the extra 14 pounds new MPs put on in their first year after arriving in Westminster. In fact he went even further, and put on three stone within 12 months. Men's Health rather unkindly remarked: 'The fact that the shadow minister hadn’t done any exercise since his school days compounded the problem – the only internationally perceptible development being around his waistline. 'The only internationally perceptible development being around his waistline.' He embarked on an intense weight loss regime, forced to shun carbs and alcohol when being wined and dined in Westminster. 'I’m sure at one point an MP’s life was all big boozy lunches and champagne dinner receptions,' he said. 'The reality now is that if you eat lunch at all, it’ll be out of a box at your desk, like most people.' Surprisingly, he was told to eat more, not less, but make it healthy. The 33-year-old had got into the habit of not eating during the day and gorging at night. For the first time in decades he started eating porridge for breakfast. In the end he managed to lose more than 10kg, taking him down to 85kg. His waist slimmed down from 44in to 37in, while his biceps expanded from 32cm to 35cm. The magazine suggested the spectacle of three MPs naked from the waist up could inspire its readers to get fit themselves. It said: 'If they can juggle work and fitness, you sure as hell can too. It may not be easy, but then in this age of austerity, the biggest cuts never are.'","Tory Dan Poulter, Lib Dem Tom Brake and Labour's Gavin Shuker get fit .

Bonnie Edwards said her grandsons were 13 and 7, and granddaughters were 15, 12, 10, 9 and 6, respectively. Eldest: Todd's eldest son Cameron, 13, is pictured with his sister, 15-year-old Tynijuiza . Birthday boy: On March 10, Todd posed for a photo with his son, 7-year-old Zycheim (left and right), saying his birthday was coming up soon . Police responding to a missing persons report found their bodies Monday after friends, school workers and Todd's supervisor at work had knocked on the door with no answer. 'The children were all in beds and it appears as though they were sleeping,' Keller said. 'They didn't have electricity. Probably it was bedtime and they decided they needed some light and probably some heat, because toward the end of March even though it was spring we were having some pretty chilly nights.' Why Todd ran the gas-powered generator inside his kitchen wasn't clear. The chief speculated that the noise would have bothered neighbors, had it been outside. Todd got some welfare money, but it wasn't enough, said Sarah Hardy, his close friend. 'How can a man survive off of basically minimum wage with seven kids, and you can't help him with a utility bill?' Hardy asked. 'This man was working. And Delmarva Power cuts the lights off?' Lloyd Edwards said his stepson had bought the generator after the power was shut off due to unpaid bills at their one-story wood frame home in the small town of Princess Anne on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Horrified: A woman looks away as bodies of the family of eight are removed from a house . Grieving: Lloyd Edwards, left, and Bonnie Edwards, the stepfather and mother of Rodney Todd stand outside the home where Todd and his seven children found dead Monday . Welfare check: Officers responded to the house in the 30500 block of Antioch Avenue after getting a call from the father's employer saying he had not shown up for work Monday morning . 'It's so hard. How can you understand something like this?' Edwards said. 'He was an outstanding dad. ... To keep his seven children warm, he bought a generator, and the carbon monoxide consumed them.' Todd got help paying utility bills in the past, but did not apply this year, said Tom VanLandingham, who directs the Office of Home Energy Programs in Somerset County. Families can apply once a year, and assistance is based on household income and energy use, among other factors. 'We're all kind of baffled as to why he did not apply this year,' VanLandingham said. 'That's the million-dollar question.' Todd retained full custody of his children when his divorce from Tyisha Luniece Chambers was finalized last September. Sheets are held as a body is removed from a residence where a gas generator in the kitchen had run out of fuel . 'The mother left, not only the seven kids by Rodney, but she left her oldest son with him as well,' Hardy said. 'She abandoned him and the kids.' Todd served 16 months behind bars for assaulting his wife in a domestic dispute, Hardy said. Upon his release, 'he came home, caught her in bed with another man, and the man was abusing the kids. He took his seven kids and her son and raised them on his own.' Chambers denied that she abandoned them, and said she had been paying child support. 'He wasn't a single parent. I was in their lives. I don't have drug problems. I love my kids and I'm sorry their father passed as well,' she said, adding that she planned to meet Todd's relatives at a funeral home on Wednesday. Bonnie Edwards said her son taught his children how to talk with elders and the value of education. He bought each a cake and a gift on their birthday, even though money was tight. 'There was nothing he wouldn't do for them,' she said. 'All he was trying to do was to keep his kids warm.' A co-worker at the nearby University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Brittney Hudson, said Todd 'was always smiling and laughing.' 'He's the man you need to know and the man you want to be,' said Bilel Smith, who lives nearby. 'They were their own football team, their own basketball team. This is breaking our hearts.'

"It is seen as extremely rude in most human societies, but it appears apes also use whispers to pass on information they do not want others to hear. Gibbons - better known for their deafening songs that reverberate around the forests they inhabit - have been found to regularly use the secretive form of communication. The apes, which are found in the forest of south east Asia, produce a variety of soft call types, known as 'hoos', that are almost inaudible to the human ear. Scroll down for video . Lars gibbons like this one in Khao Yai National Park Thailand use soft 'hoo' calls that are similar to whispers . Yet scientists have found the animals use these whispers to communicate specific information to each other about predators, foraging and when meeting neighbours. The researchers found that predator 'hoos' in particular were produced at frequencies well below the threshold of hearing for eagles and other birds of prey. A dictionary that decodes the calls produced by gibbons is being developed by scientists. Researchers at Wisconsin University in Madison have been using computer algorithms to analyse the whoops and songs produced by the apes. Gibbons singing usually consists of a crescendo of notes, particularly in response to predators. This usually starts with a series of soft 'hoo' noises that are only audible at close range but this rapidly grows to become much louder. In most studied cases these songs are produced in response to predators but they also duet together in social song. This suggests the quiet calls were designed to alert other gibbons nearby without alerting the raptors. Similarly biologists studying lar gibbons found they used a different whisper call to when a tiger or leopard was in the area. Dr Esther Clarke, who led the research at the University of Durham, said the findings could also help to provide valuable clues about human speech evolved and perhaps even why humans began using whispers. She told Mail Online: '(Hoo calls) have been overlooked in favour of the more conspicuous songs. 'We just didn't know they were using context-specific calls at close range. 'It opens up the possibility that their vocal repertoire is much larger than we previously imagined.' She added: 'These animals are extraordinarily vocal creatures and give us the rare opportunity to study the evolution of complex vocal communication in a non-human primate. 'In the future, gibbon vocalisations may reveal much about the processes that shape vocal communication, and because they are an ape species, they may be one of our best hopes at tracing the evolution of human communication.' Gibbons have one of the loudest calls in the natural world, creating whoops that can travel for miles through the dense forests where they live. Most research until now has concentrated on their loud songs which the animals use to communicate with each other over long distances. However, Dr Clarke and her team, whose work is published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology, decided to focus on the softer hoo call types. While these calls have been known about since the 1940s, they have not been studied in detail due to their low volume and because they are almost indistinguishable to the human ear. Lar gibbons used hoo calls to warn each other of predators but also during more intimate moments like this . The researchers used models like of this snake to test whether certain hoo calls were specific to predators . Different hoo calls appeared to be related to the activity the gibbons were taking part in like foraging (above) Using modern recording technology and computer analysis, Dr Clarke and her colleagues have been able to detect subtle differences in frequency, pitch, length and volume of these calls. They recorded 450 hoo sounds and found there were six different types of calls being produced by the gibbons. The researchers have been able to identify which of these calls are associated with particular situations. The researchers spent almost four months following lar gibbons around the forests of Mo Singto in Khao Yai National Park, north east Thailand recording their calls and behaviour. They found that the gibbons produced individual hoo calls in different situations, including when they were foraging, when they encountered neighbours, during duet songs between paired mates and when they detected predators. This model of a bird of prey produced short, low frequency and extremely quiet calls from the gibbons . This model of a leopard also produced low frequency and quiet calls from the gibbons when they spotted it . The researchers used a series of models of predators to test whether the calls were associated with specific predators. They found raptor hoos were less intense, shorter, lower pitch and had a small frequency span. They were the least audible of the calls. Raptors hear best in the 1-4kHz range while the gibbon hoos were consistently below the 1kHz threshold. Tiger and leopard hoos were similar, suggesting that callers perceived these two predators as belonging to the same ‘big cat’ class. While both gibbon sexes displayed similar hoo calls, female calls were lower in frequency than male ones. The researchers say this is surprising, as among mammals, males tend to have lower frequency voices than females. Females also typically did not produce hoo vocalisations when encountering neighbours and often remained passive. This video shows a white handed gibbon singing the more distinctive and audible calls while in a zoo enclosure . Males, however, often interacted with neighbouring individuals. The gibbons also seemed to use whispering during more intimate moments - much like humans do too. Writing in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology, Dr Clarke and her colleagues said: 'Duet hoos tended to be higher in frequency than the other contexts, significantly so when compared with feeding,leopard, tiger and raptor hoos and raptor and tiger hoos.' The researchers say the study is of direct relevance for the on-going debate about the evolution of human speech. Researchers say the findings could shed light on the evolution of human speech and why we began whispering . The ability to produce calls that are context-specific is necessary for communication to direct the attention of others. This behaviour appears to be widespread and was likely present in the ancestor of modern primates and humans. The acoustic variation seen in gibbon hoos in particular may be similar to human speech, in which subtle acoustic parameters, like pitch, can be important carriers of meaning. Chimpanzees bash out distinctive drum solos on the roots of trees as a form of 'signature' and to tell others in their group where they are. Biologists studying the primates have found over the years that male chimps grip the buttresses of tree roots with their hands and beat them with their feet. The noises produced - which is normally accompanied with loud hooting -  are known as pant calls, and can be heard more than half a mile (1km) away, even in the dense jungle. But now one group of scientists studying the animal in the Sonso Community in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, have found that this drumming contains distinctive rhythmic patterns that can be used to identify a specific individual. Each male used a different number of beats and used a style of doublets and pauses that was distinct to them. The researchers also discovered that the chimps tended to use drumming far more often when their group was travelling. They believe this may help keeps tabs on an individual's whereabouts.","Biologists at Durham University spent four months recording gibbon calls .

"Real Housewives Of New Jersey star Joe Giudice has had his driving license suspended for two years by a state judge who called his driving record the worst he's ever seen. Giudice, who is preparing to head to federal prison for bankruptcy fraud, lost his driver's license and was fined the maximum of $10,000. He pleaded guilty in October to unlawful use of an ID and impersonation. His guilty plea included an 18-month sentence. Scroll down for more . Real Housewives Of New Jersey star Joe Giudice has had his driving license suspended for two years by a state judge who called his driving record the worst he's ever seen . That will run concurrent with his 41-month federal sentence for bankruptcy fraud and failing to file taxes. His wife, Teresa, is serving a 15-month federal sentence on the fraud charges. He will begin his sentence when hers is over. Superior Court Judge Adam Jacobs said Joe Giudice has a 'general disrespect for the law,' citing dozens of previous driving infractions and suspensions. He said he came close to rejecting the plea deal with prosecutors but wanted to follow a federal judge's intention to allow Giudice to remain free while Teresa is in jail so he can care for their four daughters. The judge permitted Giudice to drive home from court but said he would be sent to jail immediately if he drove again after that. Jacobs said: 'If you so much as back down your driveway... that will constitute a violation of the conditions of your release, of your bail, and it will result in you being remanded immediately to Passaic County Jail,' Joe's lawyer tried to argue that he is 'destitute' and unable to pay the hefty fine. Giudice's lawyer tried to argue that his client is 'destitute' and unable to pay the hefty $10,000 fine, but after the reality star recently got paid $75,000 for prison photos alongside his wife Teresa, the judge refused . Tough times: The 42-year-old will serve 18-months in prison which will run concurrently to the 41-months he was sentenced to last year on separate charges for bankruptcy fraud. He is pictured with Teresa and their four daughters on January 4 before she started her 15-month sentence . But after his less than transparent financial history and recently getting paid $75,000 for prison photos alongside his wife Teresa and a tell-all interview, the judge refused to lower the fine. Prosecutors in Passaic County said Giudice used his brother's identity to obtain a driver's license while his own was suspended for driving while intoxicated in 2010. The Giudices pleaded guilty in the federal case in March 2014, admitting they hid assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitted phony loan applications to get some $5 million in mortgages and construction loans. Joe Giudice also pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes totaling more than $200,000. The couple also was ordered to pay restitution of more than $400,000. Joe Giudice is an Italian citizen by birth who never became a U.S. citizen. He is expected to be deported once his prison term ends.","Real Housewives Of New Jersey star has had his driving license suspended for two years and was fined the maximum of $10,000 .

"The family of a charity worker who drowned while volunteering to help youngsters in one of South Africa's poorest townships have paid tribute to their 'bubbly tomboy'. Summer Robertson from Shrewsbury died after being overpowered by fierce currents off a picturesque beach in December near Kenton-on-Sea, a small town on the country's south-eastern coast. Miss Robertson was with three other British members of a team that had completed a 10-week charity adventure together with the Latitude youth volunteering group, at a remote camping resort. Summer Robertson, 21, who died after drowning off the coast of South Africa, where she had been helping youngsters in one of the country's poorest townships . Miss Robertson's parents Sarah and John have been remembering their daughter who they described as a 'bubbly tomboy' But she soon got into difficulties in the water and died before she was brought to shore. Another volunteer, 19-year-old Alice Barnett, from Canterbury in Kent also passed away after her body was washed up on the beach a day later. Now four months after the incident, her parents John and Sarah, who also have two sons Michael and Sam, have been remembering their daughter, who died while on a trip of a lifetime working with deprived youngsters. Her father Mr Robertson, a 51-year-old works foreman, said he spoke to his daughter on the day she died. He explained: 'I spoke to her that Thursday morning. Summer pictured volunteering in South Africa. The 21-year-old had spoken to her father John just hours before she had died . Miss Robertson, left, died alongside fellow volunteer Alice Barnett, right, after they went for a celebratory swim after finishing their volunteering course . 'She said everything was great, they had finished their work and were having a few days relaxing before they came home. 'I was due to pick her up on the Tuesday. She contacted us at least once a week and said she was living the dream.' Her mother says she had no worries about her daughter taking part in the trip, but Mr Robertson added he did warn her to stay out of the sea, as she was not a confident swimmer. He added: 'She was only paddling in shallow waters. It's just horribly sad. 'On the night of her death, two policemen came to the door at 11.30, and I knew straight away. 'I knew it was either Summer or our son Sam, who was living in digs in Birmingham at the time while at university. 'As soon as they said Summer's name, I knew something had happened.' Miss Robertson's death came soon after she landed her dream job as an apprentice in the parts department at Hatfield Jaguar in her hometown. Summer, fourth from left helping to deliver Christmas presents. death came just after she landed her dream job as an apprentice in the parts department at Hatfield Jaguar in her hometown . Summer, pictured as a youngster at school, left, and celebrating her birthday. Her family have now launched an appeal to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind as a tribute to her . And while they are heartbroken over their daughter's death, her parents say they take great comfort from the fact that she died doing something she loved. Her mother said: 'It has motivated us to want to do something positive in her memory. 'We've decided to take a leaf out of Summer's book, and not take life so seriously. 'Now I don't mind so much if the phone doesn't work. There's more to life than worrying about work and paying the mortgage. 'That's only stuff, as Summer would say.' The family have now launched an appeal to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind as a tribute to Miss Robertson. It came after £1,500 was donated to the appeal through a collection at her funeral. It is hoped they can raise £10,000, which would allow them to name a guide dog puppy after Miss Robertson.

"Ed Balls was today accused of 'letting the cat out of the bag' on tax rises after leaving the door open to trapping more middle-class workers in the 40p tax rate. In an interview the shadow chancellor repeatedly refused to rule out trying to balance the books by lowering the amount workers have to earn before they pay the higher income tax rate. The number of people paying 40p tax has already risen from about 2million to 5million in two decades, but the Tories have promised to lift the threshold if they are returned to power. Scroll down for video . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, pictured giving a speech in Glasgow today, has repeatedly refused to rule out using the point at which the higher income tax rate kicks in to raise money to balance the books . The Shadow Chancellor was joined by the Scottish Labour Leader Jim Murphy at the Royal Concert hall in Glasgow today . Labour has vowed not to increase VAT or National Insurance as part of measures to bring down the deficit if they win the election. But pressed on income tax, Mr Balls refused to rule out freezing or lowering the threshold to raise millions from people earning more than £41,865. In an interview on ITV Westcountry, Mr Balls was asked if was 'leaving the door open tonight to changing the tax thresholds that mean people in that 40 per cent bracket could be paying more tax under you'. The shadow chancellor refused to rule it out: 'What I would like to do is find ways in which I could have fewer people in the 40 per cent tax bracket. Of course I would. 'But I have to be honest with people. The deficit is going to be £90 billion. I have got to find a way to get the deficit down in a careful, and staged and balanced way.' He said he would not be 'raising the higher rate of income tax' but left open the possibility of holding or lowering the point at which it kicks in. 'What I cannot do is go through every detail of the tax system. It's really complicated. 'I am not going to make unfunded commitment to do so, because I fear in the end that will be a VAT rise from the Tories. You won't get that from me.' Pressed on whether he plans to change the income tax bands, Mr Balls said: 'I can't go through every detail.' He went on: 'I can make a promise not to increase the basic rate of income tax or the higher rate of income tax. The threshold is also an important detail and that's complex.' Chancellor George Osborne, visiting the Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton with David Cameron today. claimed Mr Balls had 'let the cat out of the bag . The number of people paying 40p tax has already risen by about two million to five million in two decades . Chancellor George Osborne said: 'Ed Balls has let the cat out of the bag and confirmed a tax assault on middle earners. He has confirmed that he and Ed Miliband will put up taxes on middle Britain. It is part of Labour's £3,000 tax rise for working families. 'By contrast, the Conservative plan is to increase to £50,000 the threshold at which people pay the higher rate of tax. So there is a clear choice. 'Economic security and lower taxes with David Cameron and our long-term economic plan. Or economic chaos and higher taxes under Ed Miliband.' David Cameron has warned the 40p tax rate is hitting too many people on 'middle incomes'. The Prime Minister claims it is wrong that millions of people doing normal jobs like teaching are now paying a tax rate that was 'only ever meant for the better off'. The Conservatives go into the election pledging to raise the threshold for paying 40p tax from £41,865 to £50,000 by 2020. Workers would also pay no income tax on the first £12,500 they earn. But Labour says the policy is a £7billion unfunded tax cut at a time when billions are needed in spending cuts. A Labour spokesman said: 'Under the Tories around 2 million more people have been dragged into the 40p tax band, but Labour supported the increases in the 40p threshold in the recent Budget. 'Tory promises to raise the 40p threshold further are completely unfunded and will cost billions of pounds. Together with their extreme spending plans, these unfunded commitments will mean the Tories end up raising VAT again and cutting the NHS. 'When we make tax promises, such as introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax to help millions on middle and low incomes, we have set out where the money is coming from. 'Working people are paying more under this government, which is why the only tax changes we are proposing are on the very richest in society like reversing the Tory tax cut for millionaires.'","Shadow chancellor refuses to rule out using threshold to raise money .

"A former air stewardess who was struck down by a devastating illness is making her catwalk debut today in a wheelchair. Gemma Flanagan, 31, from Liverpool, was left paralysed after suddenly being hit by Guillain Barre Syndrome, a rare condition which attacks the nervous system. The aspiring model was working for British Airways when the condition first struck. But the aspiring model, 31, isn't letting that hold her back as she makes her catwalk debut today . Air hostess Gemma Flanagan, pictured strengthening her legs, left, and in a wheelchair, right, was left paralysed after being hit by Guillain Barre Syndrome . She said: 'I had just come back from Las Vegas and felt odd, like I was jet-lagged. My legs were heavy and I had pins and needles.' Gemma assumed partying in six-inch heels during her stopover was the cause of the pain in her legs. But for seven months her family watched on as she was left frozen in her own body, unable to move, speak or even swallow as the illness - which affects only one in 50,000 people in the UK - took hold. She assumed partying during a stop over was the cause of her pain - but she had Guillain-Barre Syndrome . After returning from a flight she felt jet-lagged; her legs were heavy and she had pins and needles . Gemma was used to getting sore feet from partying in heels and never thought she might end up paralysed . Tests in October 2011 confirmed the diagnosis which led to Gemma first having to use crutches - and now a wheelchair. She spent seven months in the specialist Walton Neuro Rehabilitation Unit in Merseyside where she learned to talk, write and even partly walk again. Today, the aspiring model is taking part in a show called 'The Beauty Within' by Models of Diversity at London's Olympia. It is designed to show anyone can be beautiful, whatever their age, size or disability. Gemma said: 'People think sexy and disability don't go together, that you can't be sexy in a wheelchair, that you can't be glamorous, but I want to show that you can. 'It is more difficult because when you are walking you can maybe do a little dance but, in a wheelchair, you're a little more limited. After tests confirmed her diagnosis, Gemma spent months in the specialist Walton Neuro Rehabilitation Unit . 'But I'm looking forward to it - and I just hope I don't roll off the end!' Gemma will soon move to a bungalow with her boyfriend because she finds it increasingly difficult to get upstairs. And she admits having to use her wheelchair more frequently has previously left her in tears. She added: 'It's about seeing beyond the metal and the rubber, the wheelchair, to see the person behind it or in it.'

"A woman who notoriously flashed her K-cup breasts on Google Street View has been charged by police with disorderly behaviour. Karen Davis, from Port Pirie in South Australia, was captured streaking by a camera car for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. Police released a statement alleging the 38-year-old mother 'pursued' the Google car to make sure she was captured exposing herself, and that it was an illegal act. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . 'The woman’s actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the public expectation is that we take action,' said Superintendent Scott Denny of Port Pirie police. 'Recently in Port Pirie we arrested a man for exposing himself in public - this incident is no different,' he said. 'It is not appropriate for anyone to expose themselves in public places. Our community should be able to expect a bit of decency.' Ms Davis will be summonsed to appear in the Port Pirie Magistrates Court at a date to be determined. In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. The 38-year-old, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at the controversy over her actions, claiming that 'flat-tittie chicks' are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Ms Davis had issues with her size-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I  always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.","Karen Davis was photographed on Google Street View flashing her breasts .

"A man who was lost at sea for 66 days, surviving on just fish and rainwater, has left hospital and is in surprisingly good health. Louis Jordan, 37, who was stranded 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina, suffered no sun damage, was not dehydrated and refused treatment when he was checked over in hospital, despite more than two months exposed to the elements. The Coast Guard crew who rescued him said he had a small smile on his face when they landed on his vessel, expecting him to be covered in blisters and have severe sunburn. Scroll down for video . Louis Jordan, second from left, walks from the Coast Guard helicopter to the Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. He left hours later on Friday in good health . A pilot lifts him into the helicopter after 66 days stranded 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina . A four-man helicopter team hoisted Jordan off the German vessel on Thursday. In interviews Friday at Coast Guard headquarters in Portsmouth, they said they did not see Jordan's boat and did not know any details about his time at sea. By the time they picked him up — about 5 p.m. Thursday — Jordan had been on the German vessel for a few hours and had been able to take a shower and speak to his family, the guardsmen said. 'He walked over to me as soon as I landed on deck and had a small smile on his face,' said Petty Officer 3rd Class Kyle McCollum, who had the first contact with Jordan. 'My initial impression of him was he was in pretty good health. ... We were expecting worse with blisters and severe sunburn and dehydration.' 'He was in a fairly good condition for a guy that you would normally expect to see after 60-plus days offshore,' added Lt. Jack Shadwick, the helicopter's co-pilot . The crew of a German-flagged container ship found Jordan on his single-masted 35-foot boat Thursday afternoon, Coast Guard officials said. Medical officials said he suffered no dehydration, no significant sun damage and was in good health . Neither he nor the Coast Guard said exactly when Jordan's vessel capsized. Jordan managed to catch and eat fish, according to the Coast Guard, and despite reports of a shoulder injury and dehydration, he arrived at a hospital in good condition and refused treatment, a facility spokesman said. Jordan said he initially didn't believe the container ship was real when he saw it. He said the ship's crew didn't see him until he began waving his arms. Asked about his good condition, Jordan claims he tried to stay inside the boat and conserved as much energy as possible. During an interview with WAVY-TV, he said: 'Every day I was like, 'Please God, send me some rain, send me some water.' 'I waved my hands real slowly, and that's the signal 'I'm in distress. Help me,'' he told WAVY. 'I blew my whistles. I had three whistles. They never heard them. I turned my American flag upside down and put that up. That says, ""Rescue me.'' Jordan had been living on his 1950s-era boat at a marina in Conway, South Carolina, near Myrtle Beach, until January, when he told his family he was going into open water to sail and fish, said his mother, Norma Davis. He set out January 23, Coast Guard officials said, and hadn't been heard from since. Jordan told WAVY that he was traveling north when his boat hit bad weather. He said he saw a wave crash into his window, and the boat eventually filled with water. Helicopter pilots were also surprised at his condition when they landed on his vessel. One said Jordan approached him with a smile on his face . In interviews Friday at Coast Guard headquarters in Portsmouth, the crew who recused Jordan (pictrued) said they did not see Jordan's boat and did not know any details about his time at sea . He said he rationed his water to about a pint a day, but 'for such a long a time I was so thirsty.' Jordan said that at one point he was flying through the air, and he thinks he broke his shoulder. McCollum, of the helicopter crew, said Jordan had slight bruising on his right clavicle, but it didn't appear serious: 'He was moving that arm so fluidly, without any skip and there wasn't any sign of pain in his face as he was moving.' On Jan. 29, the Coast Guard in Miami was notified by his father, Frank Jordan, that he hadn't seen or heard from his son in a week, agency spokeswoman Marilyn Fajardo said. Alerts were issued from New Jersey to Miami, according to the Coast Guard. Officials searched financial data to determine whether Jordan had come ashore without being noticed, but they found no such indication, Fajardo said. A search began Feb. 8 and lasted 10 days, the Coast Guard said. Some sailors reporting seeing Jordan's boat, but no sightings were confirmed. The Coast Guard said Jordan didn't file a 'float plan,' the nautical equivalent of a flight plan, with his route or destination. Jeff Weeks manages the Bucksport Plantation Marina, where Jordan docked his boat. 'He is somewhat of a person who stays to himself,' Weeks said. 'I consider him a gentle giant with a good personality, but he likes to be self-sufficient. 'Here at the marina, he liked to catch most all of the food that he'd eat. He would eat a lot of rice and fish. And he would know what berries and what mushrooms to pick. He was really knowledgeable on some survival skills.'
