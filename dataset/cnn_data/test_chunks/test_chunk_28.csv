"Horticulturalists have urged people to halt the 'grey sprawl' in Britain which is seeing grass and flowers in front gardens replaced by concrete. More than 7million front lawns in Britain have now been paved over - raising the risk of flooding and reducing available habitats for wildlife. And there are not just environmental consequences of replacing grass and wild flowers with brick, as the sight of a green garden is said to boost people's mood. More than 7million gardens in Britain have now been paved over and the RHS is calling for people to plant hedges, trees and flowers to turn the UK green again - as grassy well kept gardens boost mood . The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) is calling on people to plant trees, shrubs, climbers, hedges or flowers to attract wildlife, improve air quality and reduce urban temperatures and the risk of flooding. Alistair Griffiths, RHS director of science and collections, said: 'Many of us get a boost by simply looking at a beautiful garden or having access to green space. 'So instead of paving over green we can all play a part in reducing the grey and brightening it, and us, up with some plants. 'On top of making us feel better and happier, if hundreds and thousands of people across the country across the country grew more plants of different varieties in gardens and community spaces, it would all help to improve our air quality, benefit us, our wildlife and reduce temperatures and flooding risks. The society has issued advise for people to transform their gardens by planting a tree, hedge and a shrub . The RHS has launched a three year 'greening grey Britain' campaign in a bid to transform 6,000 unloved grey, concrete spaces into planted-up areas. A survey of 2,000 people by the organisation found that 95 per cent thought being in a beautiful garden lifted their mood. More than 60 per cent said looking at a street of paved-over front gardens saddened them. The RHS says replace paving with plants . The RHS has suggested people can transform their concrete front gardens by planting five things; . a tree - intercept intense rain and slow run-off, helping reduce risk of floods . a hedge - provide areas of shade . a shrub - create extra habitats for wildlife which can promote growing of more plants . a climber - cool buildings . a perennial plant - reduce pressure on drains which can lead to flash flooding . The poll also found that 60 per cent of people worry about paved front gardens and flooding. The society is offering tips on how to transform grey areas. Tips include pulling up a paving stone and planting it up, to creating window boxes and planting trees and climbers in front gardens which can cool buildings. Around 30,000 volunteers who worked on the Britain in Bloom competition will also help transform concrete Britain into a greener space in the three years of the campaign.","The RHS has warned about the 'grey sprawl' with front gardens paved over .

"Police have been left stunned after coming across a car parked on a busy street covered in hundreds of chili peppers. NSW Traffic and Highway Patrol Command shared the bizarre image on their Facebook page, showing a silver car on the side of the road laden down with a vast amount of large red chillies . According to several commenters on the post, the incident occurred on Bridge St in Hornsby on the Upper North Shore of Sydney and is a regular occurrence. NSW police have been left stunned after coming across the above car covered in chili peppers on the side of a busy road . 'He's been doing this for years.... he lives in one of the units in Bridge Road. Parks outside my unit block (Cnr Albert & Bridge) for some reason. Sometimes he puts it out on the grass on a tarp.' one commenter said. NSW Police also shared the image with the caption 'The heat is on', leading many to question what the car owner's offence actually was. While Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW Police for comment, a spokesperson said it may well be one of the weird and wacky things sighted by highway patrol cars on the road.

"Charles Kane (above) was arrested Thursday as he met up with a 14-year-old girl for sex . A married band teacher with two young daughters was arrested as he tried to meet an underage girl for sex. Charles Kane of Spencerport, New York had communicated with the girl online after posting a Craigslist ad seeking a young girl for a daddy/daughter relationship and showed up to meet her at a local theater. He was arrested when he arrived at the theater with a full box of condoms as the young girl was in fact an undercover police officer. CBS 8 reports that authorities first took notice of Kane, 46, when he posted an ad last October that said 'daddy/daughter. Love younger women.' An undercover officer began communicating with him, pretending to be the father of a young girl, corresponding for months. Then, on January 26, an officer noticed another sexually explicit ad which they again traced back to Kane, and this time a cop posed as a 14-year-old girl. According to the criminal complaint, Kane sent numerous photos of himself while also requesting photos of the girl over the past few months. Scroll down for video . Kane, 46, is a married middle school music teacher with two young daughters (above) The Hilton Middle School music teacher said in one message; 'I could get a room and I could sneak you there.' He also stressed he could get in 'big trouble' if anyone found out about what was happening, and said at one point; 'this is between you and me.' He had been communicating with the officer for months before he planned the meeting at a local movie theater  where he was arrested (above) with a full box of condoms on him . The Hilton School District said in a statement; 'The Hilton Central School District was informed by law enforcement about the arrest of a district employee. We are cooperating fully with the investigation. The district has suspended the employee in question and banned him from campus as per disciplinary policy. 'It is important to note that none of the charges allege criminal activity by this individual involving any Hilton Central School District students. The District is activating its District Crisis Team and will have resources available to our students when they return on Monday. Student safety is our top priority and will be foremost in our minds throughout this investigation.' Kane has been charged with enticement of a minor to engage in sexual activity and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.","Charles Kane of Spencerport, New York was arrested Thursday as he met up with a 14-year-old girl for sex .

"A lesbian couple are suing a Georgia sperm bank for false advertising - claiming their 'PhD student, eloquent-speaking' donor turned out to be a schizophrenic with a criminal record. Angela Collins and Margaret Elizabeth Hanson from Port Hope, Ontario, decided to use Xytex Corp to start a family in 2006, believing they had a strict vetting process. According to a lawsuit seen by the Atlanta Constitution Journal, the pair were told their donor had an IQ of 160, a bachelor of science degree in neuroscience, a master’s degree in artificial intelligence, and was working on his PhD in neuroscience engineering. Angela Collins and Margaret Elizabeth Hanson of Port Hope, Ontario, decided to use Xytex Corp to start a family in 2006, believing they had a strict vetting process. But they have accused the firm of false advertising . He was also described as being mature beyond his years and an eloquent speaker. But in June 2014 they discovered his name was James Christian Aggeles, according to the suit, after the company inadvertently revealed his identity in a number of emails. Through their own research they found that he had dropped out of college and had been arrested for burglary, and that his pictures had been doctored to remove a large mole from his cheek. Aggeles was charged with one count of burglary in 2005 and his case was discharged in May 2014 under terms of the First Offender Act, said Kimberly Isaza, spokeswoman for the Cobb County District Attorney’s office. The Constitution Journal reported that he served eight months in jail, with the rest of his 10-year sentence on probation, ending in May 2014. In June 2014, the pair discovered their donor was called James Christian Aggeles, according to the lawsuit. He is said to have schizophrenia, has spent time in jail and dropped out of college. The company (Atlanta headquarters pictured) allegedly inadvertently revealed his identity in a number of emails . According to the lawsuit, the pair will now have to spend more to evaluate the care of their son. They also claim they have suffered emotional and financial hardship as a result. The couple's lawyer Nancy Hersh told the paper she is representing 15 mothers who used Aggeles as a donor. The claimants have more than 20 children by him - but are concerned for the health of their children because of his medical history. However Hersh insisted that the lawsuits do not mean the mothers do not love their children.","Angela Collins and Margaret Elizabeth Hanson of Port Hope, Ontario, decided to use Xytex Corp to start a family in 2006 .

"Mohammad Liaqat launched into a 'racist tirade' after Mount Carmel School headteacher Xavier Bowers (pictured) banned Muslim pupils from growing beards . A Muslim father stormed into a Catholic school and launched a tirade of racial abuse at teachers after two teenage pupils were banned from lessons for refusing to shave their beards. Mohammad Liaqat even assaulted the headmaster during the rampage in which he hurled insults at white teachers in front of shocked parents as they picked up their children. The 34-year-old objected to the strict uniform policy at Mount Carmel High School which stated that pupils could not have beards. Liaqat launched into a 'racist tirade' at white members of staff after 14-year-old boys were told they could not keep their facial hair, police said. After being arrested, Liaqat was told to stay away from the school, so went to another  school nearby where he continued his rant. When Jeff Brown, headmaster of St Oswald's Roman Catholic Primary School, asked him to move on, Liaqat shoulder barged him, Burnley Crown Court was told. He has a child at the secondary school in Accrington, Lancashire, but was not related to the two 14-year-olds who wanted to have facial hair for religious reasons. Liaqat launched his first outburst even though the situation involving the students’ beards had already been resolved at Mount Carmel. During a three-day trial this week, Liaqat was found guilty of one count of assault and five counts of racially or religiously aggravated behaviour. He was remanded into custody at Burnley Crown Court and will be sentenced in June. Mount Carmel school said the ruling on beards was part of the school's dress code, but the 14-year-olds wanted to keep their facial hair for religious reasons. After being taught in isolation for breaking the school rules, Mount Carmel governors decided that the students could keep their beards so long as they signed up to a programme at their mosque to show their faith. After the trial, Xavier Bowers, headteacher at Mount Carmel said: 'We are pleased that justice has been done in this instance. 'My staff were simply doing their job at the time, supervising our children leaving school and making sure they were safe. 'Without provocation, they were verbally assaulted and abused in front of the children and parents. 'We always try to work towards good relationships with our families. This was an unfortunate incident, but we can now draw a line under it and move on. We are largely a happy school and we have good relationships with our local community.' Mohammad Liaqat racially abused teachers at Mount Carmel Roman Catholic High School (pictured) in Accrington after Muslim students were told they could not grow beards . Liaqat then moved on to another school, where he assaulted the headteacher after he was asked to leave, Burnley Crown Court (pictured) heard . Mr Brown, from St Oswald's school, said: 'I am glad this matter has now been concluded and I am looking forward to getting back to concentrating on school life.' PC Dave Hall, from the hate crime and cohesion unit at Lancashire Police, said: 'Ultimately, the issue at Mount Carmel was amicably resolved, but Liaqat decided to take it upon himself to stage his own personal protest. 'He racially abused several of the school staff and he kept referring to Mount Carmel as a racist school. He went on a racist tirade towards the white members of staff. He made it quite clear he was deeply upset. 'After being arrested, he was released on bail. He decided to vent his fury at St Oswald's Primary. 'He had reason to be there but not to behave in the way he did. 'Liaqat was causing problems, which led to the headteacher asking him to leave the premises. He reacted by racially abusing staff there and assaulting the head. 'What he did was completely unacceptable. Whatever his motives, we cannot accept this kind of behaviour.' Liaqat was remanded in custody and will be sentenced in June. Although growing a beard is not obligatory under Islam, the Prophet Mohammed is thought to have had one and worshippers seek to emulate this tradition.","Mohammad Liaqat racially abused teachers at his child's Catholic school .

"A Florida man arrested this weekend for pointing a laser at passing cars was later found hiding a bag of marijuana up his rectum, according to police. Jesse Roepcke, 27, from Summerfield, was busted in Ormond Beach Sunday on charges of pointing a laser at a driver or pilot and possession or use of narcotic paraphernalia. While in jail, police discovered that the man had stashed a quantity of pot in his backside. Surprise find: Jesse Roepcke, 27, pictured left and right, was taken to jail Sunday for allegedly pointing a laser at passing cars. As he was been strip-searched, a bag of marijuana fell out of his rectum . Dangerous pastime: Police say Roepcke spent Sunday evening riding around Ormond Beach, Florida, with his fiancee Brandie Tate (pictured) and shining a light in other drivers' faces . Roepcke was then hit with additional charges of possession of marijuana and smuggling contraband into prison. According to an arrest report, officers received a 911 call from a concerned motorist saying that someone shined a laser in her face as she was driving along South Atlantic Avenue, reported The Daytona Beach News Journal. Investigators said the suspect also pointed the laser at other drivers as his fiancee, Brandie Tate, drove him around Ormond Beach Sunday night. When officers tracked down the couple and pulled them over at a stoplight, Mr Roepcke allegedly said that he was just having some fun, and that he didn't know it was illegal to point a laser at people, reported the station WFTV. His 28-year-old fiancee reportedly said to the arresting officers that she had warned Roepcke not to shine the laser in people's faces. Police also seized a ‘smoking device’ from the pair's car, which reeked of pot. It later tested positive for cannabis. Ms Tate told officers she had warned Roepcke not to play with the laser on the road . Fun-loving guy: The 27-year-old told police he was just having fun with the laser and did not know it was illegal . The 27-year-old Mr Roepcke was hauled off to Volusia County Jail, where during a strip search he was ordered to cough, causing an 18-gram bag of marijuana to fall out of his rectum, the report stated, according to MyFox Orlando. Roepcke was ordered held in jail on $4,250 bail. Online records indicate that the 27-year-old had served six years in prison for an armed burglary and grand theft.","Jesse Roepcke, 27, charged with pointing a laser at a driver or pilot and possession or use of narcotic paraphernalia .

"Until now, it has been a hidden world, protected by hundreds of feet of freezing water and 20 metres of ice. Now, researchers have created a special robo-explorer to borrow into the ice and record the first footage of what lies on the seabed below the Ross Ice Shelf. The icefin was deployed (and retrieved) the vehicle through a 12-inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor. Scroll down for video . One of the unique creatures spotted on the seabed.The icefin was deployed (and retrieved) the vehicle through a 12-inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor. A first-of-its-kind robotic vehicle recently dove to depths never before visited under Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf and brought back video of life on the seafloor. 'We built a vehicle that's a hybrid between the really small probes and the ocean-going vessels, and we can deploy it through bore holes on Antarctica,' said Britney Schmidt, an assistant professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Tech, and the principle investigator for the Icefin project. The technologies developed for Icefin will also help in the search for life on other planets, namely Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Antarctica's icy oceans are remarkably similar to Europa'sice-capped oceans. 'At the same time, we're advancing hypotheses that we need for Europa and understanding ocean systems here better. 'We're also developing and getting comfortable with technologies that make polar science -- and eventually Europa science - more realistic.' The robotic vehicle carried a scientific payload capable of measuring ocean conditions under the ice. Icefin's readings of the environment under Antarctica's ice shelves, and video of the life that thrives in these harsh conditions, will help understand how Antarctica's ice shelves are changing under warming conditions, and to understand how organisms thrive in cold and light-free environments. The icefin was deployed (and retrieved) the vehicle through a 12-inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor. A team of scientists and engineers from the Georgia Institute of Technology assembled the unmanned, underwater vehicle on Antarctica. Icefin was deployed as a part of the Sub Ice Marine and Planetary–analog Ecosystem (SIMPLE) program, funded by NASA and supported by NSF, with Schmidt as the principle investigator. The research team returned from Antarctica in December 2014. Icefin is planned to make its Arctic debut in summer 2016, with a return to Antarctica that fall, the team hopes . At McMurdo Station, Schmidt and a team including Georgia Tech scientists and engineers from the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), led by principal research engineer Mick West, deployed Icefin to explore the underside of the ice shelves flowing off the continent. 'What truly separates Icefin from some of the other vehicles is that it's fairly slender, yet still has all of the sensors that the scientists like Britney need,' West said. The icefin was deployed (and retrieved) the vehicle through a 12-inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice (pictured) and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor. 'Our vehicle has instrumentation aboard both for navigation and ocean science that other vehicles do not.' The Southern Ocean can be as deep as 5,000 meters. Icefin is capable of diving 1,500 meters and can perform three-kilometer-long surveys. Previous vehicles in Icefin's class were rated to a few hundred meters. 'We saw evidence of a complex community on the sea floor that has never been observed before, and unprecedented detail on the ice-ocean interface that hasn't been achieved before,' Schmidt said. Video captured by Icefin shows eerie footage of an active seafloor 500 meters under the Ross Ice Shelf. 'Biologists at McMurdo were just amazed at the amount of biology at that location which included sea stars, sponges and anemones that were at the ocean bottom,' West said. 'To have our very first deep-ocean dive happen through a small hole in the ice and go all the way to the ocean bottom and get the video we did was pretty amazing.' A partnership between research-focused GTRI and academic-focused School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS) enabled the team to design, build and deploy Icefin under the ice in less than a year.Traditional design cycles for these types of vehicles typically are two to three years. The team had to design for a number of challenges associated with deploying Icefin in such an extreme environment. For example, standard electronics systems are not typically rated to the extreme temperatures found under the Ross Ice Shelf. Icefin carries forward and up/down imaging and sonars and several different sensors. Icefin is also modular, similar to vehicles used on space missions. Scientists can swap sensors or point them in different directions as needed. Mick West poses with Icefin, the robotic underwater vehicle built by GTRI and Georgia Tech. Traditional GPS does not work under the ice, so Icefin uses a navigation system called SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) to triangulate its position based on measuring the range and bearing of features on the seafloor or under the ice. Traditional underwater vehicles deployed on Antarctica are either 'roving eyes' because they carry only a camera, or much larger vehicles that are deployed in the water on the edge of the ice shelf. Icefin fills the gap between these two kinds of vehicles: able to be deployed easily by small teams in any environment, yet still able to record oceanographic information traditionally done by much larger vehicles. 'We had probably 100 contingencies for if something went wrong,' West said. 'Through lots of analysis and robust design, we were fortunate not to have to initiate any of them.' Once Icefin was assembled, the vehicle was deployed through a bore hole in the ice that was 12 inches in diameter and 20 meters deep. Bore holes are often drilled on Antarctica for ocean moorings and sediment sampling. Traditional GPS does not work under the ice, so Icefin uses a navigation system called SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) to triangulate its position based on measuring the range and bearing of features on the seafloor or under the ice. 'Using algorithms such as SLAM allows us to construct a map of the unknown under-ice environment. 'When you can do that, you can begin to get a 3D picture of what's going on under the water,' West said. Massive icebergs clog McMurdo Sound after breaking off from the Ross Ice Shelf in Antartica, October 2003. The sensors on Icefin are helping scientists understand how the ocean affects properties of the ice, and how the ice affects properties of the ocean. The exchange between ocean and ice is a process that mediates biology, affects the climate system and controls the stability of glaciers. 'Those are important processes that we can work out here in our backyard at the same time as we're answering how an ice shell would reflect the ocean chemistry on Europa,' Schmidt said. 'The ice shell is built out of the ocean, but how that process works is not well understood.'","Footage reveals huge variety of life on the seabed .

"Arrest: Kayla Mooney, pictured, allegedly had sexual contact with a male student off campus last year . A 24-year-old high school teacher has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a male student and for providing him with alcohol. Kayla Mooney, who is in her first year teaching science at Danbury High School in Danbury, Connecticut, turned herself into police at 5pm on Tuesday. Her arrest came after the school's administration contacted police in February with the allegations and the Danbury Police Department's Special Victims Unit launched a seven-week investigation. She was accused of engaging in sexual activity with the boy while off campus late last year, the News Times reported. Following the accusations, Mooney was also put on paid administrative leave on February 10. She is still on paid leave, according to the school district's superintendent. A judge granted police a warrant to arrest Mooney and she has now been charged with second-degree sexual assault and providing alcohol to a minor and was released without bail. Sal Pascarella, the superintendent of schools, sent high school parents a message on Tuesday to inform them of the teacher's arrest. 'We are all very disappointed that this has happened to one of our faculty members,' Pascarella said, but added: 'Obviously, there is a whole process we have to go through with this investigation. At this point, these are allegations.' School: Mooney, 24, is only in her first year of teaching science at Danbury High School in Connecticut . She is due in court on April 14. Mooney, who grew up in Danbury, attended North Dakota State University and Western Connecticut State University.. Property records show she still lives with her family in Danbury. She taught chemistry and physics classes at the school, the Danbury Daily Voice reported. She is the third area teacher to face sexual misconduct charges since February. The first, Sacred Heart University instructor Timothy Leonard, was put on leave on February 11 after allegedly sexually assaulting a 14-year-old boy in an SUV parked in a movie theater parking lot. Then a first-grade teacher, Brian Stroh, resigned from Bethel Elementary School on February 19 and has been charged with sexually abusing three children. He has been released on bail.","Kayla Mooney, who is in her first year teaching in Danbury, Connecticut, 'engaged in sexual contact with a male student off campus last year'

"Did you blink? There was a total eclipse of the moon on Saturday - but it was an unusually short one. The lunar event - where Earth's shadow completely blocks the moon - lasted only five minutes, making it the shortest eclipse of the century, NASA said. The so-called 'blood moon' could be seen by billions of people across the western U.S., Canada and Australia. Scroll down for video . Blood moon: Skygazers in the western U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand were treated to a total eclipse of the moon before dawn on Saturday (pictured over New Zealand) The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. The next one will be visible from Europe. The best spot this morning was at the Mississippi River, where spectators caught the entire five minutes of the orb around 5am PT, astronomers said. Sky-gazers in the Midwest and East Coast only caught part of the lunar show. The eclipse could also be seen in its entirety on Saturday night from eastern Australia, New Zealand and Japan. But observatory staff in Sydney were unable to see the eclipse due to cloudy weather and instead wrote on Twitter: 'Our live feed from the Griffith Observatory [in America] is showing gorgeous totality pink!' Don't blink! The moon may have shone red for three hours but it was only visible to citizens for five minutes (pictured over New Zealand) On the west coast of North America, the total eclipse — what astronomers call totality — began shortly before 5am PT . They accompanied their tweet with a picture of a bright pink moon. 'Blood moon' refers to its orange or red appearance, which is the result of sunlight scattering off Earth's atmosphere. Whether the moon appears dark red, copper, bronze or another shade depends on several factors including the amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere. Unlike more lengthy eclipses, the moon in this case only skimmed the upper part of Earth's shadow. Normally, the moon passes through the middle of the shadow, making the eclipse lasts longer. Sydney Observatory astronomer Andrew Smith said before the event: 'Some sources indicate it will be around 10 minutes of totality, which will make it the shortest since 1917, but other sources say it will be less than five minutes which makes it the shortest since 1592.' 'Blood moon' refers to its orange or red appearance — the result of sunlight scattering off Earth's atmosphere, seen here in Santa Barbara . Unlike solar eclipses which require eye protection, you only need clear skies to view this lunar eclipse (pictured over Santa Barbara) Whether the moon appears dark red, copper or bronze depends on several factors including the amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere . As well as California, the eclipse could also be seen in its entirety on Saturday night from eastern Australia, New Zealand and Japan . The total lunar eclipse is observed above cherry blossoms in Shiraishi city, Miyagi district, northeastern Japan on Saturday . Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington added that it was the changes in colour that makes lunar eclipses so interesting. The full eclipse of the moon in September will be visible across the U.S. and Canada, as well as western Europe and Africa. 'Totality' will last around an hour and 20 minutes. But those who missed out in Australia will have to wait until January 31, 2018, for the next lunar eclipse. Unlike solar eclipses which require eye protection, you only need clear skies to view a lunar eclipse. A pair of binoculars or backyard telescope will enhance your view, but are not necessary. Japanese sky-gazers caught the moon when it was still white and out of the Earth's shadow . It is the third of four consecutive lunar eclipses separated by six months - a tetrad - which is very rare . Atmospheric: The sky (pictured in Japan) burned a deep red as the gleaming orange light shone through the clouds . In New York, where the sun was rising, the sky glared orange from the reflection of the sun's rays from the moon . The full moon is seen over the Santa Monica Mountains in Topanga, California, shortly before it turns red during the lunar eclipse . The moon is seen behind downtown high-rise buildings during the shortest total lunar eclipse of the century before dawn . Sky-gazers will have a better chance of catching the next full lunar eclipse on September 28, that will last over an hour .","The moon skimmed across the Earth's shadow on Saturday, reflecting the red glare of the sun .

"Foreign GPs now account for 11 per cent of family doctors, new figure show . The number of GPs from abroad is up by 11 per cent in a decade as the NHS tries to combat a shortage of staff. Foreigners now account for almost one family doctor in five although in some areas the proportion is more than two-thirds. Senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the NHS is so short of homegrown medics. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that 22.0 per cent of current GPs gained their qualifications overseas, up from 19.8 per cent in 2004 . But the figure is 71 per cent in Barking and Dagenham, east London, 63 per cent in Medway, Kent, and 58 per cent in North Lincolnshire. The NHS is facing a shortage because many GPs are retiring early. Others are moving overseas in search of better conditions. The Royal College of GPs estimates that the NHS will need to hire at least 8,000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising, and ageing, population. The NHS employs 40,584 GPs, of whom 8,941 are from overseas. This is up from 6,921 in 2004 when there were 34,855 family doctors in total. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘We need GPs from around the world to support the Health Service, and we simply don’t train enough. ‘We need to encourage more students and junior doctors to choose general practice, and to expose them more to general practice, so they see it more as an attractive option for the future.’ The figures do not state where the foreign GPs trained but separate data from the General Medical Council shows many are from India, Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria. Earlier this year UKIP leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy by claiming that foreign GPs should not be working on the NHS as they didn’t speak good enough English . Earlier this year Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy by claiming that foreign GPs should not work for the NHS because they lack good English. He said: ‘Don’t we want to live in a country where we speak the same language? And isn’t it scandalous that we are not training enough nurses and doctors in our own country?’ Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘The NHS – general practice included – is staffed by hardworking healthcare professionals from all over the world. 'We are very grateful for the work that doctors from overseas are doing.’ The NHS should train more staff rather than spending £2.5 billion a year on locum doctors and agency nurses, a think-tank has suggested. A larger pool of dependable permanent staff would also enhance workforce stability and patient safety, the cross-party Civitas said. The subsequent increase in competition for jobs would also help fill less desirable roles such as those in A&E departments and general practice. The think-tank said the typical charge for a consultant from an agency was £1,760 a day, equivalent to a salary of £459,000. Because the salary of an NHS consultant was between £75,249 and £101,451, four consultants could be employed for the price of one agency staff member.","Foreign GPs now account for 1 in 5 family doctors, new NHS figures show .

"A new model for HIV progression shows that it spreads in a similar way to some computer 'worms'. HIV specialists and network security experts at University College London (UCL) made the disovery after creating a simulation of how the virus spreads . They worked together to build a model for this 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off AIDS. Scroll down for video . Researchers creates a model 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say the spread was similar to a computer virus . HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases. As HIV progresses, it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system cannot function correctly, a state known as 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' or AIDS. Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. The teams noticed that the spread of HIV through the body using two methods - via the bloodstream and directly between cells - was similar to how some computer worms spread through both the internet and local networks respectively to infect as many computers as possible. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. Lead author Changwang Zhang, of UCL, said: 'HIV and Conficker have a lot in common. 'They both use hybrid spreading mechanisms, persist for a very long time and are incredibly difficult to eradicate. 'Our model enables us to explain these important properties and to predict the infection process.' Changwang's supervisor co-author Dr Shi Zhou said: 'Although the cybersecurity community organised an unprecedented collaboration to tackle Conficker, they still failed to eliminate Conficker from the Internet. 'HIV researchers face a similar problem. We hope that our new understanding of hybrid epidemics will help us to fight against Conficker and HIV.' Detailed sample data from 17 HIV patients from London were used to verify the model, showing that hybrid spreading provides the best explanation for HIV progression and highlighting the benefits of early treatment. HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases. As HIV progresses, it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system cannot function correctly, a state known as 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' or AIDS. Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. Co-senior author Professor Benny Chain, of UCL, said: 'The number of HIV cells in the bloodstream is always relatively low, and our model shows that HIV spread through the bloodstream alone would not be enough to cause AIDS. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. 'It is likely that when HIV gains a foothold somewhere with a high T-cell population, such as the gut, it uses a cell-to-cell transfer mechanism to efficiently spread directly between them. As such, if HIV has already spread to an area rich in T-cells by the time treatment begins, preventing its spread through the bloodstream will not stop AIDS. 'Our model suggests that completely blocking cell-to-cell transfer would prevent progression to AIDS, highlighting the need to develop new treatments.' Laboratory research, led by co-senior author Dr Clare Jolly, has previously shown that some drugs are better than others at stopping HIV from spreading directly between cells. However, it's not possible to directly measure cell-to-cell spread in patients because it takes place inside internal organs. Dr Jolly said: 'With this new model, we should be able to assess the effectiveness of drugs against different modes of HIV spread in real patients. 'This could prove invaluable when interpreting the results of drug trials to understand what works and why. Using computer models to understand processes that we cannot directly observe is common in the physical sciences and supports many fundamental theories. 'Our model provides strong evidence that cell-to-cell spread is an important part of HIV spread, and we hope to show this directly in future animal studies.'.","New model accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS .

"Older workers are suffering dismal pay rises while those awarded to the youngest workers have gone up by nine times as much. The gap between wage rises for young and older staff has widened significantly during the past five years, amid claims the over-50s are being left behind, official figures reveal. Critics said employers were cynically taking advantage of older workers who stay with the same company for longer by failing to train and promote them or give them decent annual pay rises. The under-25s saw their wages rise more than eight times faster than the over-50s, as they quickly climbed the rungs of the career ladder . Last year, workers aged 18 to 24 received bumper 10.6 per cent pay rises, falling to 3.8 per cent for people aged 25 to 34 and to 2 per cent for workers aged 36 to 49. For workers aged 50 to 64, pay rises plunge to a meagre 1.2 per cent, official figures show – significantly below the UK average of 2.1 per cent. The Office for National Statistics revealed in its latest Economic Review that the under-25s are five times as likely to have moved jobs in the past three months than workers over-50. But while younger workers often receive greater pay rises because they move jobs more frequently, official data shows that the gap is widening. In 2009, Britain’s youngest workers received pay rises three times greater than older workers, but this has now widened to nine times greater. In the last three months of 2014, 5.4 per cent of 18-25-year-olds changed jobs, compared to only 1.2 per cent of 50-64-year-olds . Experts said the growing gulf between the generations could signal a reluctance by employers to train and promote older members of staff. Ros Altmann, a Whitehall adviser on older workers, said: ‘Younger people’s pay is rising faster than average and the rate of increase is accelerating. ‘It could be because younger people are the most likely to receive training, with employers keen to focus on the newer workers and spending far less on training older workers. ‘With the pace of change in technology and processes being so rapid nowadays, the need for ongoing training is more important than ever, so people do not fall behind in terms of pay and productivity.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband today renewed his attack on the government, claiming the Tories 'believe in the old idea that as long as the rich and powerful are OK then everyone else will succeed' She also criticised the Government for subsidising training for under-25s, ‘so that employers find it much cheaper to train youngsters than older workers’. She added: ‘The increase in pay for younger workers is great news and shows they are progressing well. On the other hand, those who are in their later years seem less likely to be treated so generously and have not been able to enjoy the same kind of pay growth as younger colleagues.’ Lisa Harris, at over-50s specialist firm Saga, said: ‘Many older workers have spent years climbing the career ladder and are more likely to value the job satisfaction and security of doing the job they know well over the pursuit of more money. ‘However, it’s important that employers properly value the contribution and commitment of older workers and ensure they are fairly paid for the job they do and are not taken advantage of.’","Workers aged 18-25 saw wages rise eight times faster than over 50s .

"A real-life Willy Wonka has laid claim to making the most extravagant chocolate creation - a seven-foot-tall, five-foot-wide Easter Egg made using 352lbs (160kg) of chocolate. Jan Hansen's egg is so big that it took him three days to put together and is made from layers of Belgian chocolate which covers an iron frame. The creation had to be completed using a step ladder and is the equivalent of 1,600 chocolate bars. Jan Hansen with his 7ft tall Easter egg which he will sell off in pieces to raise money for St Barnabas Hospice . Mr Hansen hopes to raise £1,000  from the sale of the egg for St Barnabas Hospice. The giant treat, which has since been wrapped in cellophane complete with a bow on top, was made with melted chocolate which had to be tempered overnight. The 58-year-old chocolatier commissioned an iron worker to make a special frame for his egg, which was then wrapped in grease proof paper and cling film, before being covered in chocolate. Due to the nature of chocolate contracting after it cools, Mr Hansen had to add layer upon layer of chocolate using a palette knife over a three-day period. He then finished the egg off using a 'rough bark' finish. Mr Hansen, who has been in the chocolate business for almost three decades, currently has the egg on display at his shop Hansen's Chocolate House in Folkingham, Sleaford, Linconshire . Layers of chocolate cover an egg-shaped iron frame which the chocolatier had specially commissioned . In the past he has made giant Easter eggs but never one that has sized up to his current creation which  measures five feet in width. On Easter Sunday the egg is to be cracked using a hammer before it is sold off to punters who have already been sizing up the egg. Mr Hansen said: 'It is a fair size and it makes a massive difference compared to the others I have made in the past. 'It's quite fortunate that the conservatory has air conditioning and that it has double doors so we can get it out. 'The actual making was the easy part but I did have a few sleepless nights thinking about it. It was almost like chocolate cladding, I made big sheets of chocolate and put them on the side of the frame. 'It's pretty thick. Nothing tastes quite as good as Easter Egg chocolate and on Easter Sunday customers are going to take it apart and I'm going to crack it with a big hammer. It was exhausting, but it is fantastic to see the look on people's faces. 'I didn't expect people would want to buy the chocolate but it helps to raise more money for the hospice. When they see it they almost don't have to say anything you just have to look at their faces.The kiddies are lost for words, one little boy who was four and funnily enough called Charlie couldn't take it in that it was an Easter Egg. I think it scared him.' The iron frame was wrapped in grease proof paper and cling film . Mr Hansen lost his brother Cullum, 59, two years ago after he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and towards the end of his illness had need of the services provided by a hospice. He added: 'People have been very generous. I'm well on target to hit the £1,000 mark. 'Most people know somebody who has gone through the hospice and know it's a very important part of the health care. People are more than willing to support the hospice and I've felt very proud I've been able to help with this gesture.' He added: 'I've always had a sweet tooth and on a Saturday morning I used to go into the sweet shop and look at the sweets before deciding what to spend my pocket money on. 'Chocolate is my passion, I love it and working with chocolate is better than any medication or therapies. 'I say that we're so lucky working in this industry because 99.9 per cent of customers are always smiling when they walk in, and then they see this and are beaming. 'When I look at it I think ""wow"" but now I'm beginning to think ""what can I do next"" - next year I'll perhaps need a crane and scaffolding.'","Jan Hansen's giant egg is the equivalent of 1,600 chocolate bars .

"The Rubik’s Cube is notorious for having boggled many a bright mind since its official inception in 1980. But for Youtube user Joe Penna, who is based in Los Angeles, and animator Jeff Schweikart it is merely a toy in which to create amazing pieces of artwork. Penna, who is best known online as MysteryGuitarMan, solved a whopping 1,296 mini Rubik's Cubes 961 times to create a short animated video. Youtube user Joe Penna (pictured) and animator Jeff Schweikart took between three-to-four days to complete the project . With the help of Schweikart, the pair produce arguably the greatest love story ever told between a pair of robots with a lot of Rubik’s Cubes. The short narrative features a robot entering a workshop, building a spaceship and heading off into the atmosphere. After encountering some trouble, he crash lands on a planet and is first greeted by a dog before he meets the love of his life. The robot love story was created by Joe Penna solving a whopping 1,296 Rubik's Cubes a total of 961 times . The animated video features a robot building a spaceship, heading off into the atmosphere and finding love .

"Bending and rising in spectacular fashion, these stunning pictures capture the paddy fields of south east Asia and the arduous life of the farmers who cultivate them. In a photo album that spans over China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, extraordinary images portray the crop's full cycle from the primitive sowing of seeds to the distribution of millions of tonnes for consumption. The pictures were taken by professional photographer Scott Gable, 39, who spent four months travelling across the region documenting the labour and threadbare equipment used to harvest the carbohydrate-rich food. Scroll down for video . Majestic: A farmer wades through the mud with a stick as late morning rain falls on top of Dragonsbone terraces in Longsheng County, China . Rice is a staple food for more than one-half the world's population, but for many consumers, its origin remains somewhat of a mystery. The crop accounts for one fifth of all calories consumed by humans and 87 per cent of it is produced in Asia. It is also the thirstiest crop there is - according to the UN, farmers need at least 2,000 litres of water to make one kilogram of rice. Mr Gable said he was determined to capture every stage of production with his Rice Project - from the planting to the harvesting all the way down to the shipping of the food. After acquiring some contacts from experts at Cornell University in New York and conducting his own research, he left for China last May and spent the next four months traveling. He said: 'The images were taken over a four month period from April to July last year across Asia. I visited China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as part of my Rice Project.

'The industrialisation of our food and mono-culture food staples have interested me for some time so that's probably what inspired me to do this project. 'I shot the whole project using a Canon SLR and GoPros. The actual shooting took four months and then post production took another four more months. 'The reaction to my work has been incredibly positive - I was able to secure a solo gallery show and create quite a bit of interest online which has been great.'

Arduous labour: Employees of Taiwan's state-run rice experimental station are pictured beating rice husks by hand as the sun shines on them . Mr Gable spent months learning Mandarin Chinese in preparation for his trip, but the language barrier was still his greatest challenge. In an interview on photographic blog  Slate, he added: 'I had enough Chinese that I could get around in the big cities, but once I got into the highlands or mountains they don't speak Mandarin. 'There are so many different languages in China. That was very difficult. There's no iPhone translation for these dialects.' Mr Gable is already working on a new related project documenting corn production and after that, he plans to do a similar investigation of wheat.

"Concerns are raised about Labour's policy under shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt . The heads of some of Britain’s best state schools today warn of the dangers of a Labour government reversing radical education reforms. In a letter to the Daily Mail, 80 current and former leaders say there is clear evidence that academy-style freedoms are benefiting a generation of children. But they say Labour – and some senior Lib Dems – appear to be threatening to reimpose state controls. The letter, signed by the heads of good and outstanding autonomous schools, was backed yesterday by David Cameron. In it, they claim there is evidence that the most successful education systems benefit from schools with academy-style freedoms. They say such schools are more likely to be ranked ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and more likely to improve. ‘Secondary schools which have converted to academy status outperform other schools – by a margin of almost 10 per cent,’ they wrote. But the heads expressed alarm at comments by Ed Miliband that Labour would reimpose ‘a proper local authority framework for all schools’. Senior Lib Dems were also accused of suggesting they no longer support freedom for acdemies, which are able to control pay, conditions and the curriculum. ‘This is not the time to stop something that is working to the benefit of so many children in schools,’ wrote the heads. Schools on the letter include Torquay Boys’ Grammar School, ranked in the top 100 for GCSE results this year. United Westminster Schools in London is also on the list, and includes Grey Coat Hospital – where Mr Cameron’s daughter Nancy starts this year. Tom Clark, chairman of Freedom and Autonomy for Schools National Association, which organised the letter, added: ‘Our only concern is that the autonomy which has worked well for pupils stays in place.’ Mr Cameron said yesterday: ‘Ed Miliband would put all this at risk.’ The letter, signed by the heads of good and outstanding autonomous schools, was backed by David Cameron . As the General Election campaign turned to education yesterday, the Prime Minister also attacked Labour yesterday for opposing the expansion of free schools – which are run by groups such as teachers, parents and charities and are outside of local authority control. He said the opposition’s antipathy appeared to be based on a concern that ‘if we set up a good new school, everyone will want to go there’. ‘Yes – that’s the whole point,’ he told the Mail. ‘How can you possibly be against an excellent school setting up another excellent school?’ He accused Labour of being ‘anti free schools’ for suggesting it wants to scrap the scheme. ‘It’s that mindset that says choice, freedom, responsibility, aspiration – that these are things to worry about rather than celebrate,’ he added. The education reforms, masterminded by Michael Gove, have been hailed by Mr Cameron as the most important ‘for a generation’. Ed Miliband has said Labour would ‘have a proper local authority framework for all schools’ We write as current and former headteachers and school leaders of good and outstanding autonomous schools across the country committed to the very best in state education. FASNA — the Freedom and Autonomy for Schools National Association — has helped build a consensus over 25 years which recognises that diversity and self-determination help shape outstanding education. We are firmly committed to the maintenance of current academy freedoms. International evidence shows that the most successful education systems benefit from schools with academy-style freedoms. The freedoms which have come with academy status have helped FASNA schools to improve education for children in our own schools and also enabled us to work better together to raise standards in other schools. The evidence shows that primary schools which have converted to academy status are doing better than other schools — they are more likely to be ranked ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and are more likely to improve from ‘good’ to ‘outstanding’. Secondary schools which have converted to academy status out-perform other schools by a margin of almost 10 per cent. But as school leaders we are concerned that recent statements from Liberal Democrat and Labour politicians suggest they might not protect all the freedoms which schools and teachers now enjoy and which are helping to drive up standards across the board. Though Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt said that Labour would not ‘go back to the old days of the local authority running all the schools’, Ed Miliband has said Labour would ‘have a proper local authority framework for all schools’. And a Liberal Democrat education spokesman told a recent FASNA conference that he could not support the freedom for schools to vary pay and conditions or to vary the curriculum, and he felt that schools needed local control. Any erosion of school freedoms through local authority or government regulation or overbearing ‘middle-tier’ structures will reduce the capacity of schools to perform well in the future. We call on all political leaders to guarantee that all current academy freedoms, including those relating to pay and conditions and the curriculum, will be maintained after the General Election. This is not the time to stop something that is working to the benefit of so many children in schools. The letter was signed by: .

"A man was allegedly bashed by a family with glass bottles and windscreen wipers at a McDonald's drive-through after he waved at them thinking they were his friends. Colin Mcinerney, 28, claims he was beaten and had his head stomped on by a man, two teenagers and a boy aged only about 10 on Friday night at the fast food restaurant in Coolalinga near Darwin. The man's 22-year-old girlfriend, Rachael Sheppard, told the NT News he had just gestured at the family by waving with his little pinky as people do in Darwin. Colin Mcinerney, 28, claims he was beaten and had his head stomped on by a man, two teenagers and a boy aged only about 10 on Friday night at the fast food restaurant in Coolalinga near Darwin . 'Then we arrived at Maccas and pulled up and the same car came through the drive through and the man got out and started yelling at us and asking what the hand gesture was all about and going right off his head,' Ms Sheppard said. Despite telling the family they thought they were someone different, the older man allegedly started bashing Mr Mcinerney. 'He even smashed a beer bottle over Col's head... it didn't look good,' Ms Sheppard said. 'I was yelling for him to stop and next thing you know three boys have jumped out of the back of their car and started bashing Col too.' Ms Sheppard said a woman behind the wheel of the car allegedly tried to ram her as Mr Mcinerney ran for cover at a nearby petrol station. '(They) caught up with Col and kept bashing and choking him,' she said. 'The younger boys were grabbing windscreen cleaners and water bottles and even had a windscreen wiper off their own car that they were using to attack Col with.' NT Police Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen says officers were called to the McDonalds about 7.15pm following reports of a 'violent disturbance'. NT Police Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen says officers were called to the McDonalds near Darwin about 7.15pm following reports of a 'violent disturbance' 'It was confirmed that two groups were travelling in their respective vehicles in the rural area when they pulled up beside each other at a set of traffic lights,' she said in a statement. 'One did a hand gesture to which another took offence. Both vehicles pulled over in McDonalds and a nasty altercation ensued.' Supt Jorgensen said most of the passengers in the vehicles became involved, including the girlfriends and children of both drivers. 'There were accusations of weapons being involved and one of the parties ramming the other's vehicle,' she said. Police arrived when the altercation had moved to the service station. Supt Jorgensen said Mr Mcinerney and the 35-year-old male drive and his 36-year-old female companion were arrested and later released without charge. The men were taken to Royal Darwin Hospital for treatment. Witnesses are urged to contact Police on 131444 or Crimestoppers on 1800 333 000.","Colin Mcinerney, 28, was allegedly beaten outside Darwin McDonald's .

"A jobless alcoholic has boasted of fathering 40 children who have cost the taxpayer more than £4million in benefits and care costs. Shameless Mike Holpin – who at 56 says he wants more children – claims he had them by 20 women and admits he would not recognise many of his offspring in the street. Now engaged again, the three-times married man keeps track of their names with an ever-growing family tree tattooed on his back. 'I won't stop': Father of 40 Mike Holpin, left and right with his fiancée Diane, says he wants more children because it is 'God's will' His relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising, and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives. If they had completed just one year in care each, it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for £2.4million. Mr Holpin or the children’s mothers would also have been able to claim at least £500,000 in child benefit and a further £800,000 in child tax credits. On top of this, he has claimed at least £675,000 in benefits himself. Yet the feckless dad, of Ebbw Vale in South Wales, said: ‘I’ll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply. I’m doing what God wants.’ Keeping track: Mr Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, shows off his family tree tattoo - which includes his children and grandchildren . He was the subject of a Channel 5 documentary this week, but last night former friends said Holpin’s claim to 40 children – aged between three and 37 – was nonsense. And as 40 Kids By 20 Women aired, his ex-wife Petrina told of her embarrassment on Facebook, writing: ‘Feeling Asshamed’ (sic). Mr Holpin, who lives in a council house and claims benefits, said he was a changed man who no longer drank alcohol. But he still wants more children. He added: ‘I’m as fertile as sin. I don’t believe in contraception and I love sex. Most of my kids have gone through the care system. 'It makes me feel like s*** because they’ve suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I’m an alcoholic. I’m still an alcoholic – I just don’t practise it.’ Family: Holpin says that he loves sex and won't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care . TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: ‘It is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious. 'It is sheer arrogance to keep having children as if they were hot dinners and expect other people to pick up the bill.’ But former friends say Mr Holpin’s boasts are off the mark, and that he has fathered as few as 16 children with three women. One said he had ‘padded’ his numbers by including his ex-partner’s stepchildren. He added: ‘He’s no angel after a drink but he isn’t the big ladies’ man that he likes to think he is. 'He’s definitely had a football team’s worth of little ’uns – maybe 16 – just because he’s not fussy and not careful. But no way has he got two rugby teams and all the subs to make it up to 40.’ Offspring: Holpin admits his lifestyle led to 16 of his children being taken into care but says he wants to make it up to them . Mr Holpin and his family are infamous in the former mining town of Ebbw Vale, where locals have launched petitions to stop him moving into their street. He now lives with his fiancee Diane Morris, ten years his junior, in a council house in the village of Cwm. Mr Holpin’s daughter Rhiannon, 19, said on Facebook yesterday: ‘You can all hate but it doesn’t matter, there’s plenty of us to stick up for each other and we can take on the lot of you. ‘I feel like I can’t even leave my house without people judging. Get off my back, I didn’t ask my dad to do what he’s done with his life.’ Dream: Mr Holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect . Day out: Mike and Diane with some of the children at their local bowling alley . New life: The father-of-40 lives with his fiancée Diane Morris, ten years his junior, and they live in a two-bed council house in South Wales. Mr Holpin’s brother, David, 59, said the former fairground worker’s ‘shocking’ behaviour had brought ‘shame’ on the family. David Holpin, from Erith, Kent, added: ‘I lost touch with Mike when I moved to Kent 18 years ago – he didn’t have a phone so we couldn’t keep in touch. ‘It wouldn’t surprise me if he had 40 children, the way he carries on. His behaviour is shocking. I’m not ashamed of Michael, but I’m upset about the way our family name has been tarnished. ‘He has brought shame on us, and we are a good family.’","Mike Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, has at least 40 children .

"A merry widow from Edinburgh who loves to party the night away dancing on tables admits her lifestyle is a far cry from her own grandparents. Pat Ingles, 69, remembers her grandmother sitting by the fire knitting in a pinny and slippers. In comparison, the retired hairdresser, prefers to dress up in kinky outfits and go out drinking until the early hours. Pat, 69, pictured left in her police woman fancy dress outfit, enjoys pole dancing with friend Julia, 67, right . 'I really enjoy myself, I party hard,' she admitted on the Channel 5 show OAPs Behaving Badly. 'I have heard of the saying ""grow old gracefully"" but I don't understand it.' Grandmother-of-three Pat lost her husband 12 years ago to prostate cancer after dutifully caring for him during the last nine years of his life following his diagnosis. Now she's focused on enjoying herself and wants to make the most of the time she has left. She said: 'I have cared for people all my life. I don't want to look after someone full-time again, I want to look after me now. 'Whatever time I have left I am going to party and love it till I die.' Pat in another of her risque outfits gets to grips with an Elvis impersonator in Menorca . While Pat likes to hit the town at night, during the day she hits the gym and also enjoys pole-dancing lessons. Thanks to keeping fit and active, she says she feels confident about her appearance as she nears 70 and as a result, she is happy to show off her body in a number of 'kinky' outfits. Her wardrobe includes a risque fancy dress police woman look, air hostess and French Maid outfits, as well as a leather jumpsuit, and she teams them all with stilettos. She said: 'I like to dress sexy, if I can't walk in high heels, I won't go outside. I just like to have fun and feel good in whatever I wear. 'For my age I don't have a bad body. I can walk into a room and I still turn heads and I like that.' Pat, pictured again with the Elvis impersonator, loves to party and stay out dancing on tables . Far from being embarrassed by their party pensioner grandparent, Pat's family think she's great fun and love it if she joins them on nights out. Her granddaughter, Paris, 20, said: 'She stays out till 1am dancing on the tables, it's not embarrassing, I don't think ""my nanna shouldn't do that"", it's cool.' Pat isn't alone in her desire to party. She has a partner in crime in her friend Julia Church, 67, who now lives in Menorca. Julia, also a retired hairdresser, moved to the Spanish island with her husband and now parties with her fellow British expats following his death seven years ago. Pat regularly visits her and the pair get glammed up for nights out where they drink and dance the night away. Pat on a night out with Julia, left, who says 'we'll just keep going till we fall to bits' The friends often party all night in Menorca where Julia now lives . Julia said: 'You can't judge others like us, we're not normal, we're crazy. Being 67 or 27 it doesn't make any difference, we're exactly the same. 'I don't like the thought of getting old, we'll just keep going till we fall to bits. There's no point worrying about it, you'll make yourself depressed.' Pat has been single for years following the death of her husband and said she has dated some younger men - including a man in his 40s who was younger than her 49-year-old son. But now she's found happiness with Colin, 66. She said: 'We have a fantastic time together, we have good sex, we enjoy each others' company. 'I realised how much I missed that, having someone to care for me and protect me and treat me like a lady.' Julia shows off her pole dancing skills. She admits: 'I don't like the thought of getting old' OAPs Behaving Badly is on Channel 5 Wednesdays at 9pm .","Pat Ingles, 69, from Edinburgh, loves to wear high heels and party .

"France today voted to punish anyone who 'incites' people to become dangerously thin with prison  and huge fines. In a drastic step which will be studied closely in Britain, MPs particularly highlighted the irresponsibility of fashion websites which encourage women to keep their weight as low as possible. Now these ‘pro-anorexia’ sites will face a year in prison and a fine equivalent to just over £7,000. Deputies in the National Assembly in Paris voted through the amendment to a law on public health and it is expected to be rubber-stamped by the Senate. Scroll down for video . Unhealthy: French MPs have voted to punish anyone who 'incites' people to become dangerously thin with a year in prison and fines of up to £7,000 weeks after rejecting  a ban on super-skinny models . It singled out those who 'provoke people to excessive thinness by encouraging prolonged dietary restrictions that could expose them to a danger of death, or directly impair their health.' Around 40,000 people suffer from anorexia in France, the vast majority women and teenage girls. Maud Olivier and Catherine Coutelle, the MPs who proposed the law, said in a joint statement that 'certain sites known as pro-Ana can push people into a vicious circle of anorexia and authorities cannot do anything about it.' They said the new law was not designed to threaten 'freedom of expression on the Internet', but was a long overdue health reform. Anorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of a psychiatric disorder and is extremely difficult to treat. In March, MPs in France rejected a proposal that would have seen ultra-slim models banned from the fashion runways. However, the MP behind the planned law has vowed the fight is not over. At the time, Olivier Veran said: 'I believe that models should eat well and look after their health. French socialist politician Olivier Veran (pictured) has vowed to continue the fight to ban ultra-thin models from the catwalk in France . 'This is an important message to young women who see these models as an aesthetic example'. He also proposed a new law that punish the 'glorification of anorexia', especially online. France's National Union of Modelling Agencies (SYNAM), has complained that new laws could harm the competitiveness of French modelling. A SYNAM statement read: 'French modelling agencies are in permanent competition with their European counterparts. As a result, a European approach is needed.' The French legislation comes after countries including Spain, Italy and Brazil have all clamped down on skinny models at catwalk shows. Spain has barred models below a certain body mass index from the Madrid fashion shows, while Italy has insisted on health certificates for fashion show participants. And Brazil is considering demands to ban underage, underweight models from its catwalks. Medical experts around the world have warned against the dangers of ultra-skinny catwalk models, and images airbrushed to make girls look thinner, which they say encourage anorexia in girls as young as six. Fashion guru Giorgio Armani said recently that the fashion industry had a duty to 'work together against anorexia'. He added: ""The industry has to recognise the link between its preference for abnormally thin models and the growth in eating disorders among young women.' French restaurants are to be banned from offering free fizzy drinks refills to customers. MPs in the National Assembly voted to back the measure, which is aimed at cutting down on obesity. The ban applies to all fizzy drinks sold in places open to the public, whether they are fast food chains, bars, cafés or conventional restaurants. The amendment to a health bill written by UDI MP Arnaud Richard reads: ‘It is the role of the law to fix a framework to protect the population against commercial competition which aims to make something free to entice customers and encourage them to consume unhealthy products excessively.’ It has won the backing of Health Minister Marisol Touraine, and public health campaigners worried about increasing obesity in France. Ms Touraine said: ‘This habit is common in other countries and it is increasingly taking hold in France.' Free refills are the norm in most American restaurants, and were were introduced by Quick, one of France’s most popular fast-food chains, last year. Customers are given an empty cup with their food and they are then free to serve themselves from the soda fountains. Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants also introduced the marketing ploy.","Anyone 'inciting' extreme thinness faces prison and fines of up to £7,000 .

"One diner found her meal had extra crunch  this week when she found 50 pearls inside the baked oyster she was feasting on. Toni Elliot, 53, thought she had hurt a tooth when she sat for dinner at Puckett's Boat House in Franklin, Tennessee, on Thursday. However, when she spat out the mouthful she was chewing she discovered a pearl in the palm of her hand. Forty-nine precious stones followed. Instead of being horrified by the bizarre discovery, Elliot reportedly remained calm and even posed for photos with her treasure afterwards. Scroll down for video . Not what I ordered: Toni Elliot, 53, (right) found her meal had extra crunch this week when she found 50 pearls inside the baked oyster she was feasting on at Puckett's Boat House in Franklin, Tennessee . As naturally-occurring pearls are rare, it's expected that Elliot's stash could fetch a princely sum. Eric Horton, who was serving Elliot at the time, said he couldn't believe what he saw happening. He swiftly grabbed a container to collect the pearls up from Eliot's dinner plate. Recalling the incident, he told WSMV News: 'It happens sometimes, every once in a while. 'However, this young lady continued to pull pearls out of her mouth, and the only thing we were missing was a string because she found 50 pearls in this one oyster.' Puckett's Boat House thought it could have broken a record for the most pearls in one oyster but apparently the number stands somewhere in the eighties .

"Small businesses and restaurants will be forced to close over the Easter long weekend as they struggle to cover the costs of penalty rates on public holidays. Many operators across the country will face penalty rates of up to two-and-a-half times regular pay that would allow young workers to earn around $50 an hour as a casual. But the Australian Chamber of Commerce has launched a campaign in a bid for small businesses to voice their concerns and call on the federal government to make changes to the penalty rates. The Too Big to Ignore campaign will allow small retailers and hospitality businesses to put up posters in their windows explaining why they are closed. 'We're sorry we're closed today. We'd like to be able to serve you. We'd like to give local people jobs. But the ­penalty rates are too high,' the posters will read. Some young workers who earn up to $50 on public holidays will not be able to earn money this weekend . The campaign will allow small businesses to put up posters in their windows explaining why they are closed . ACCI chief executive Kate Carnell said businesses that remain open are expected to lose money, with the extra holiday trade cancelled out by the extra wage costs. 'This is a lose-lose situation,' Ms Carnell said. 'Customers lose because the services they want are harder to access; staff lose because they don't get the hours many are seeking at work; and business proprietors lose because they get little benefit from the holiday traffic.' The campaign will also allow businesses that remain open over the public holidays the option to display a sign in their windows to explain why they are operating with reduced staff. 'We will be open today to serve our loyal customers. We will have fewer staff than we wished. We'd like to give local people jobs. But the penalty rates are too high,' the poster will read. The penalty rates will come into force  from Good Friday to Easter Monday  in retail, restaurant, hotel, pharmacy, fast food, dry cleaning, amusements and hair and beauty sectors. This means a casual retail shop assistant or a fast food employee is paid a minimum $50.94 an hour and a person working behind a bar  is paid at least $49.55 an hour on public holidays. The penalty rates will come into force across Good Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Easter Monday . The campaign will also allow businesses that remain open over the public holidays the option to display a sign in their windows to explain why they are operating with reduced staff . Small businesses will struggle to open their doors due to the cost of penalty rates on public holidays . But the Australian Unions has claimed workers are being subjected to a false and misleading campaign about penalty rates by employer groups in the lead up to Easter. ACTU President Ged Kearney said the business community are using the Easter break as a justification to attack penalty rates by saying it's unaffordable to hire more workers. 'The truth is the share of business income going to wages in retail and hospitality has fallen in recent years,' Ms Kearney said in a statement. 'There is no evidence this will create new jobs, but plenty of evidence it will hurt low-paid workers. 'We know most retail and hospitality workers are paid less than Full Time Average Weekly Total Earnings and working over the Easter break allows them extra disposable income to spend in shops and cafes – the very businesses that are driving this attack. 'Cutting penalty rates have nothing to do with job creation or productivity - it is about cutting people's pay packets and disposable income.'","Small businesses will be forced to close over the Easter long weekend .

"Picture the scene. You’ve just bought a new outfit and you’d really like a new nail polish to co-ordinate with it. Or perhaps you’ve picked up a dress for a party the same night and it needs more of a glitzy make-up look than usual. Now, you no longer need to hotfoot it to the department store or chemist to stock up on make-up — because fashion retailers have got in on the beauty act. Fashion retailers have started to get in on the beauty act with plenty of shops now offering their own make-up ranges as well as clothing . From Marks and Spencer to Primark, they’re all at it, flogging foundation and lippy alongside frocks and leggings. But are any of them worth splashing your cash on? Claire Coleman put some of the biggest fashion beauty brands to the test . . . Topshop Beauty . The High Street giant has all of this season’s beauty looks, from a rainbow of nail polishes (£6) to Lip Ombre (£9) — sets of two cream-to-powder formulation lip colours to be worn in tandem (caution: lips must be very well moisturised). The Foundation (£16) was a rather pleasant surprise. It has a good amount of silicone, so slides on easily, and coverage is smooth — but there are only four shades and the dropper applicator is a bit of a gimmick. Topshop Beauty's eye shadow (top left and right) creates an iridescent shimmer and the Lunar colour is perfect for a smokey eye while the High Street giant also stocks a wide range of nail polish and lip colour . Star buy: Mono Eye Shadow (£5). Don’t be put off by their initial glittery appearance. Once on, they’re not nearly as sparkly, with more of an iridescent shimmer. Lunar, a purplish black, is perfect for a smokey eye. Don’t bother with: Concealer (£10). The pump bottle dispenses more than you need. It covers well, but the result is flat, with not enough luminescence to brighten the under-eye area. Next Make Me Beautiful . This collection, in its chunky silver and transparent packaging, was a real surprise. With everything from Confetti Effects Nail Colour (£4) to Eye Shadow Quads (£7.50), which can be used wet or dry, in elegant, wearable shades, there’s something for everyone. But I wish they wouldn’t package stuff together, like the Face Primer and Face Illuminator (£20 for both) — the former has too much silicone and feels greasy, while the latter has a subtle glow to wear alone or under foundation. Next's Make Me Beautiful Matte Lip Colour (pictured) is moisturising with tonnes of pigment and almost matches up to Charlotte Tilbury’s Red Carpet Red lip colour . Star buy: Matte Lip Colour (£8 or £20 for three). I loved the Classic Red almost as much as Charlotte Tilbury’s Red Carpet Red, which is miles more expensive. Moisturising and with tonnes of pigment, just blot and reapply to get a bit more staying power. Don’t bother with: Sheer Chubby Stick (£8) — it was greasy and a bit disappointing. Primark P.S. Love . It’s bargain basement and, on the whole, it looks it, feels it — and smells it. The range is all either synthetically sweet or a bit plasticky. I worry even pre-teens would turn their noses up at this. But if you absolutely had to go straight from Primark to a party, had no make-up and only £5 to spend, it would do. Just. The Matte Long Last Lipstick (£1.50) looked a bit chalky, but I liked the chubby brush on the Volumising Ultra Mascara (£2), even if it was a bit clumpy. Star buy: Stick Foundation (£2). I wouldn’t use this as my everyday foundation, but I’d definitely keep it in my handbag for on-the-go touch-ups. It feels a bit greasy, but the coverage is decent and the finish is matte enough not to require powder. Don’t bother with: Kohl Eyeliner (£1.50). It comes in innovative, twist-up packaging, like a lipstick. But there’s no way of sharpening the point, and it has zero staying power (unlike the Liquid Liner, £1, which, once dry, doesn’t budge). Marks & Spencer Autograph . The sleek, black and glossy packaging feels substantial and very Bobbi Brown in style. But then, at £6 for a nail varnish and £10 for a lipstick, this is the most expensive of the brands I tried. Its formulations are good. The Matte Velvet Lipstick (£10) is moisturising, with a matte — but not flat — finish, while the Ultra Rich Twist Up Lips (£9.50) are a cut-price version of Clinique’s famous Chubby Sticks. Marks and Spencer Autograph Pure Luxe Powder Bronzer (pictured) has a great, buildable colour with a slight shimmer but no sparkle . These have decent staying power — even if they do only come in four shades. On the downside, for a brand that targets the older consumer, there’s a lot of sparkle in their eye shadows. Star buy: Pure Luxe Powder Bronzer (£15). A lovely, moulded bronzer that looks a little Bottega Veneta in style. Great, buildable colour with slight shimmer, but no sparkle. Don’t bother with: Neverending Lashes Lengthening Mascara, (£10). The absurdly long wand and very thin brush gave little control — I ended up daubing it on my eyebrows! New Look Pure Colour . If you’re not a teenager, you probably won’t be shopping in New Look — and, on the whole, its make-up range reflects that. The Baked Eye Shadows (£3.99) are as heavy on glitter as they are on pigment, while the packaging is inelegant. New Look's Pure Colour nail polishes (pictured) come in a range of great colours, go on evenly and dry really quickly while the Baked Highlighter Powder in Gold gives skin a beautiful sheen . But the brushes (from £1.99) aren’t bad, and don’t moult like many cheap brushes do. Also the Matte Lipstick (£3.99) isn’t drying and, while theb comes with more of a cocktail stick applicator than a brush, once applied it stays put. Star buy: I was torn between the Matte Nail Polishes (£2.99), which come in plenty of great colours that go on evenly and dry really quickly, and the Baked Highlighter Powder in Gold (£4.99), which gives skin a beautiful, almost soft-focus, sheen. Don’t bother with: Pure Volume Volumising Mascara (£4.99). It comes out of the tube thick and cloggy — and goes on thick and cloggy. One of the worst budget mascaras I’ve ever used.","Fashion retailers have started to produce their own make-up ranges .

"Harold Ekeh has a very tough decision to make. The 18-year-old Long Islander has waited anxiously for weeks since sending off his college applications. But  he didn't expect this. Harold has been accepted by every single one - including all eight Ivy League schools. It comes a year after another high schooler from Long Island, Kwasi Enin, was met with the same news. He chose Yale. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Whiz kid: Meet Harold Ekeh, the Long Island senior who has been accepted to every Ivy League college . Incredible achievement: Harold, 18, insists he had no idea he would be accepted by all 13 colleges . Star: The high school senior moved from Nigeria to Long Island 10 years ago with his parents Roseline (pictured) and Paul Ekeh. He says his parents' struggle inspired him to take every opportunity he was afforded . 'It was crazy. My mom was sat next to me and it was just letter after letter after letter. I couldn't believe it,' Harold told DailyMail.com as he recounted the five minutes when acceptance emails came in from Yale, Harvard, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Pennsylvania, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, NYU, MIT, Vanderbilt, and SUNY Stony Brook. His celebration? 'I went to Chipotle with my friends for a half steak half chicken burrito bowl. It was perfect.' Born in Nigeria, Harold and his parents moved to the US when he was eight. He is now a straight A student, with an SAT score of 2270, at Elmont Memorial High School in Long Island, New York, where he has served as editor-in-chief of his student newspaper and chief executive of the Model United Nations. His success, he explains, is down to the submission essay, in which he described his family's struggle to fit in after emigrating to America. It was the resilience of his parents, former Target clerks Paul and Roseline Ekeh, that gave him the drive to achieve the best. His story: Harold says his winning essay described the struggle of  fitting in after emigrating to America . Speaking to DailyMail.com, Harold admitted he has set a high bar for his four younger brothers (pictured) 'Sky isn't the limit': Harold, pictured aged 13, three years after arriving in the U.S., told his brothers (pictured) that they will surpass his accomplishments. 'People say the sky is the limit - it won't be for them,' he said . He told DailyMail.com: 'It was such a huge thing for my parents to uproot our family, a family of six, from our home to a new country. 'I was worried as a kid about speaking with an American accent, but they had to worried about actually finding jobs. 'They joked that they came over for the 24-hour electricity. But I know it was so we would have opportunities as children. 'No matter how many times they got knocked down, they stayed positive, and kept telling me that the secret to success in unbridled resolve.' His achievement has been hailed as the American Dream, but Harold downplays it. 'I just worked hard and took every opportunity that was afforded to me. 'I came over with a very heavy Nigerian accent, but I did everything I could to integrate. Learning American history was really hard but I was determined to tackle it so I signed up for AP History as a junior.' With four younger brothers, he has set the bar high. He doesn't think that'll be a problem, however. 'They are going to beat my accomplishments. They were very excited by the news, they look up to me and follow my lead. 'When I got the news, I told them they can achieve anything. I said people say the sky is the limit but they can go even further than that. I know they will.' Ultimately, he plans to be a neurosurgeon to study Alzheimer's, a disease his grandmother suffers from. But insists he won't just be studying. 'I'm torn because each school offers something different, and there are so many different things I'm looking for,' he said. 'I want to go to a good school where I can study hard, but I also want somewhere where I feel comfortable; somewhere I could imagine calling home. 'I also want to meet other students, make friends, travel, and do other activities. 'When people ask me which one, I have said Yale so far because I have a connection with Yale. I went to Yale with the Model United Nations, and got to see how inspiring and interesting it is there. 'I'm visiting a few this month and will decide at the end.' Proud parents: Paul and Roseline Ekeh, former Target clerks, inspired their son to work hard to achieve . His father, who now works in the NYPD's traffic division, shared the news on Facebook with an elated message . His mother, who works for a human resources agency in Queens, could not contain her delight . Elated, his mother Roseline, who now works for a human resources agency in Queens, posted on Facebook: 'All glory to the most high God!!!' His father Paul Ekeh, who works in the NYPD's traffic division, spoke to DailyMail.com to describe the moment he found out. 'It was like a thunderbolt,' he said. 'I didn't doubt that he could achieve good things but it was the sweep that made it so different. I don't know how to say how I feel. It's amazing.' Sharing the news of his son's achievement on Facebook, Mr Ekeh wrote: 'Bless the LORD... Congrats Son, in Jesus' name!!' With three weeks and four days to make a decision, Harold said he is keeping an open mind and plans to visit Harvard, MIT and Princeton. Harvard only accepts 5.9 per cent of applicants - roughly 2,000 of the 34,000 submissions they receive. Take two: Last year another Long Islander, Kwasi Enin, chose Yale after being accepted by all eight Ivies . Yale accepts 6.3 per cent of the 30,000 students who apply, and Columbia only 6.9 per cent of 32,000. Cornell has the highest acceptance rate of the eight Ivies - a minuscule 14 per cent of the 43,000 applicants. Right now, Harold is leaning towards Yale. 'I got to see how passionate people are at Yale,' he told ABC. 'That skewed me to start leaning towards Yale in my junior year.' Last year, another Long Island high school student, 17-year-old Kwasi Enin, picked Yale after being accepted to every Ivy League college. The son of Ghanaian immigrants, Kwasi had an SAT score of 2250, straight As, and wrote an essay describing his love of music which 'sparked my intellectual curiosity'.","Harold Ekeh, 18, was editor of his student paper and CEO of the Model UN .

"More than 200 Yazidi prisoners have been set free in northern Iraq after nearly a year in Islamic State captivity, Kurdish military has said today.

Free at last: A mother hugs here young child in celebration at being released. The freed Yazidis were taken away by ambulances and buses to receive treatment and care . Saved: This elderly Yazidi woman was one of the lucky ones to be released. No reason was given for the decision by ISIS . The 216 prisoners have been held captive in the Islamic State since last summer when militants attacked their villages in the area around Sinjar in northwestern Iraq. General Hiwa Abdullah, a peshmerga commander in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, said that about 40 children are among those released, while the rest were elderly, some of whom were too exhausted and disoriented to speak. No reason was given for the release of the prisoners, which took place in Himera just southwest of Kirkuk, 180 miles north of Baghdad. The freed Yazidis were taken away by ambulances and buses to receive treatment and care. One elderly woman said she had been captured by the . insurgents last August when they overpowered Kurdish forces in . the Sinjar area and proceeded to purge its Yazidi population, . killing hundreds and taking thousands captive. Emotional scenes: Once the Yazidi prisoners, made up of women, children and the elderly, realised they were not being executed but freed, many broke down by the roadside .

"Many thrill seekers have slipped into a cage to get up close and personal with a shark – now they can do the same with the king of the jungle, putting them just a paw swipe away from a lion - with nothing but cage bars between them. A New Zealand zoo is giving visitors the thrilling opportunity to step over the fence and into the depths of a lion's den during feeding time, if they dare. Orana Wildlife Park in New Zealand's Christchurch is one of the few zoos in the world which has installed a moving cage to bring spectators as close as possible to lions in an open habitat. During 'The Lion Encounrter', the spectators are mere centimetres away from the huge animal, sitting inside their lair to see every whisker, tooth and hair - close enough for a cuddle if they choose. Just trying to be friends? A lion puts its paws up against the bars to try and become better acquainted with the visitors inside . Orana Wildlife Park in New Zealand's Christchurch is one of the few zoos in the world which has installed a moving cage to bring spectators as close as possible to lions in an open habitat . Tucker time: The zoo keeper uses a flat palm to feed the feline, keeping it distracted with constant treats in the form of raw meat . 20 people, including visitors and zoo keepers, climb inside to have lunch with a lion with a pack of the hungry beasts clambering over the cage - clawing and licking at the mesh! On the prowl: The lion clambers on top of the cage and examines the scene from all angles - perhaps looking for another entry into the cage . 20 people, including visitors and zoo keepers, climb inside to have lunch with a lion with a pack of the hungry beasts clambering over the cage - clawing and licking at the mesh! Park spokesman, Nathan Hawke, said: 'The Lion Encounter is a genuinely unique visitor experience. 'While people can see lions in numerous places, we think we can get you as close as you would safely want to get to view these magnificent animals. Feeling excluded: A lion vocalises its annoyance that it is not allowed to hang out inside the cage with everybody else . Cuddly: Father-of-two Ekant Veer took part in the Lion Encounter and the lion looked so soft he felt the surprise urge to reach out and pat him . King of the jungle: In the video, the inquisitive felines climb on top of the moving cage to stare straight at the human inhabitants, while the minders keep them content with snacks . Ekant Veer, a the 35-year-old Associate Professor at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, filmed the lions at Orana Wildlife Park from his incredible vantage point in the cage. In his video, the inquisitive felines climb on top of the moving cage to stare straight at the human inhabitants, while the minders keep them content with snacks. Ekant said instead of feeling scared, he was surprised by his gut instinct when facing off with the kings of the jungle. Kisses: It looks like butter would melt in his mouth as the feline pokes his tongues through the mesh, as if to try and lick the inhabitants .

A New Zealand zoo is giving visitors the thrilling opportunity to step over the fence and into the lion's den during feeding time, if they dare . 'I was fascinated - some people were worried but I really wanted to reach out and pat them. 'Some of the lions were huge but they all seemed very calm. There were a couple of times when they would roar and it just sent vibrations right through you, which was scary but also really cool.' He described it as an 'intimate' experience, as you are 'more open and exposed' to the lions than ever. Look, no hands! A lion is incredibly close in the video as it devours a treat - showing off its long claws and sharp teeth . I surrender! The lion tries everything to try and lure the humans out of the cage to explore the depths of the lion's dens . 'I prefer these up-close experiences to more controlled ones. It's more unpredictable and different every time, especially when dealing with animals. Orana Wildlife Park is New Zealand's only open range zoo.

New Zealand has more than its share of thrill-seeking activities, ranging from bungee jumping, white water rafting, speed boat rides and beautiful sky dives. However, for Ekant this topped his list of adrenaline-inducing activities – and lunch with a lion will only cost $40. 'I would definitely encourage others to do this. If you're coming to New Zealand it's definitely one of the crazier things we do.'

"A personal injury claims company has collapsed after being fined £80,000 for plaguing households with nuisance calls (file picture) A personal injury claims company has collapsed after being fined £80,000 by the privacy watchdog for plaguing households with nuisance calls. Direct Assist, based in Bolton, Lancashire, told one complainant that they were likely to be called for three years until they made a claim, despite repeated requests for their details to be removed. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) registered 801 concerns about the  company between January 2013 and July last year. Every complaint came from someone who was registered with the TPS and who had not given permission for the company to call them, the ICO said. One elderly and deaf complainant said the callers left them in fear of answering the phone that they relied on to maintain contact with family. Direct Assist, which offered access to solicitors for claims, continued to call despite being given this information, the ICO said. The ICO found that Direct Assist instructed its staff to deliberately use phone numbers from lists that included people on the TPS, even claiming that the calls were being made by someone else using their company name. ICO head of enforcement Steve Eckersley said: 'Direct Assist's behaviour shows a blatant disregard for the law and the customers they tried to contact. 'Even though the TPS contacted them 525 times to warn them about complaints being made they continued to market their services through unsolicited phone calls. 'This penalty sends a clear message that this type of irresponsible marketing is totally unacceptable. Companies need to think about their responsibilities, the law and the consequences if they try to break it.' Direct Assist has now gone into liquidation and the ICO said it intended to register as an unsecured creditor in an attempt to obtain the fine. Direct Assist, based in Bolton, Lancashire, told one complainant that they were likely to be called for three years until they made a claim, despite repeated requests for their details to be removed . Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'This company has driven a coach and horses through cold calling rules and it's good the ICO has acted decisively. 'We want to see more fines when the rules change next week to make it easier for regulators to punish firms making these calls. 'We also want to see senior executives held personally responsible for their company's behaviour on nuisance calls, which could include disqualifying company directors if they flout the rules.' From April 6, the legal requirement on the ICO to prove 'substantial damage or distress' will be removed to make it easier to impose fines.","Bolton-based Direct Assist has gone into liquidation after receiving the fine .

"A 21-year-old woman, who attended a prestigious military academy high school, has been charged with the murder of a married lawyer found stabbed to death in an upscale DC hotel. Jamyra Gallmon, of Washington D.C., was arrested on Wednesday, according to police. She has been charged with first-degree felony murder while armed over the killing of 30-year-old David Messerschmitt. Police had released surveillance video of a 'person of interest' who was seen entering the Donovan Hotel shortly after Messerschmitt texted his wife Kim Vuong at 7.45pm to tell her he would be home in an hour on February 9. Messerschmitt never returned and the next day he was found dead after being stabbed in the back at his hotel room with 'various credit cards strewn about'. Scroll down for video . A woman has been arrested in connection to the murder of 30-year-old Washington, DC lawyer David Messerschmitt. Above, the 'person of interest' who was caught on surveillance video entering the hotel where Messerschmitt was killed on February 9 . Jamyra Gallmon attended Forestville Military Academy in Maryland and was an exemplary student, a cteacher said on Thursday . David Messerschmitt (pictured with his wife Kim) was found dead in his DC hotel room in February. Police have not revealed exactly what he was doing at the hotel. A computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit were recovered from the scene . Police sources told NBC Washington that the woman in the video is Gallmon and that she went to the hotel that evening for a 'sexual encounter'. Among the  items recovered from the room were a computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit, Fox DC reported. Fingerprints were also found in the room. Law enforcement sources told the Washington Post that it was believed Messerschmitt's death was motivated by a robbery. Gallmon's mother spoke to NBC and said that her daughter had never been in trouble before and had an ambition to join the military. Gallmon attended Forestville Military Academy in Maryland, a coach told Fox 5, on Thursday and had been an exemplary student. Coach and teacher, Vincent McDuffie, told the station that she had wanted to play basketball in college but had suffered a knee injury. He said that her supportive family always turned up to watch her high school games. Gallmon graduated from the military academy in 2011. The 21-year-old is due in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday. Authorities  have arrested a Washington, DC woman named Jamyra Gallmon for the crime. On the left, another view of the person of interest on CCTV and on the right, Messerschmitt.

Widowed: Messerschmitt texted his wife Kim Vuong on February 9 that he would be home in an hour but never showed. Police still haven't said what he was doing at the hotel . Gallmon's mother said that her 21-year-old daughter (pictured) had never been in trouble before and had an ambition to join the military . According to the police report, Messerchmitt left his work at law film, DLA Piper, around 7.45pm on February 9 and texted his wife a couple of hours later to say he would back at their Capitol Hill home in an hour. The couple reportedly had not seen each other since February 8, but Vuong didn't think anything seemed wrong with her husband. She reported him missing at midnight, saying it was unlike him to disappear and that usually he got home before her. Messerschmitt was found dead in his room the next day. Police have not revealed exactly what he was doing at the hotel. Last week, Messerchmitt's wife gave an emotional speech, asking for help in finding her husband's killer. 'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. A Cincinnati native, Messerchmitt attended Ohio State University where he met his wife. He went on to study law at Boston University before working at a firm in Chicago. He then worked at two more firms in the D.C. area before transferring to DLA Piper last year, as a specialist in intellectual property law. Emotional: Last week, Messerschmitt's wife, Kim Vuong, held a press conference, asking for help in locating her husband's killer .

"A few blocks from the finish line and even closer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 Boston Marathon, race organizers are building a combination clubhouse, interactive museum and retail store that, for the first time, gives them a year-round, public presence. The Boston RunBase scheduled to open April 16 will allow visitors to learn about the world's most prestigious road race, run a replica of the course on a treadmill or see artifacts from its 118-year history. It will give runners a place to gather before going for a jog by the Charles River, and then shower and change before heading back to work or to the convention center across the street. Construction: Joe Clifford paints the ceiling of RunBase near the 26-mile mark of the Boston Marathon, in Boston on Wednesday . Champion: A gold laurel wreath, which is awarded to the winner of the Boston Marathon, is displayed at the Boston Athletic Association. The wreath, and other historic items from the race, will be on display when RunBase opens later in April . Location: RunBase is just a few blocks from the marathon finish line, and even nearer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 race. Runners are seen here during the 2013 Boston Marathon . If they want to pick up a pair of shoes or a Boston Marathon jacket, they can do that, too. 'This RunBase is the front door,' Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, said this week before checking in on the construction at the Boylston Street storefront. 'It is intended to be a place where the visitor can touch the history, the tradition of the Boston Marathon, and then get out and do something, go for a run themselves.' A combined effort between the B.A.A., Adidas and longtime shoe-seller Marathon Sports, which is providing the staff and retail know-how, the Boston RunBase is a shoeseum of sorts: part shoe store, part museum. It is the sixth RunBase for Adidas 0 the first in the U.S. But it will differ from locations from Tokyo to Prague, as well as the Nike store nearby, because of its association with the Boston Marathon. 'Not only is the Boston Marathon the Carnegie Hall of running, but Boston is an amazing running community,' said Mikal Peveto, Adidas' director of running innovation. And that became even more apparent after two bombs interrupted the 2013 race, attacks that galvanized runners and turned the Boston Marathon into a symbol of the city's resilience. 'It drew the global running community together over something that's kind of ours, as runners,' Peveto said. 'It changed everything. From something so tragic, it was incredibly powerful what came out of that ... realizing that we had something even more special than we had before.' A running club that had long been associated primarily with its flagship race, the B.A.A. had spent the last 15 years expanding its calendar to include a half-marathon in the fall and a 5K and 10K in the spring and summer. But the organization remained tucked away a few blocks from the course in offices decorated with memorabilia that can be seen, Grilk said, by 'essentially nobody.' Down the street: Boylston Street, the site of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing - as well as the finish line for the marathon itself - is now how to a Boston Marathon-themed store and clubhouse . Legacy: A cyclist pedals over the  finish line of the Boston Marathon on Wednesday. Year-round visitors to Boston have had limited options to learn the history of the race, besides visiting the course, until this month when RunBase opens . Leader: Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, smiles during an interview regarding RunBase . 'We thought: Why not take all this stuff and bring it out to the street?' he said. 'If you can be engaged with the community, you have a chance. You may still screw things up, but you have a chance. Otherwise, you're just the guys who are stopping traffic.' The B.A.A. plans to use the RunBase for special events, including clinics and meet-ups where recreational joggers can connect or get tips from coaches before heading out on a run. Lockers and showers will save them a trip home to change; those staying at one of the Back Bay's dozens of hotels might be sent by the front desk to find a running partner or a good route for, say, a leisurely 5K. The site is about one block after marathon runners turn off of Hereford Street for the final stretch to the finish line, not far from the Charles River Esplanade that is one of the city's prettiest backdrops for a run. It is across the street from the Hynes Convention Center, which hosts a shoulder-to-shoulder runners' expo on marathon weekend and events throughout the year. 'For me, it doesn't matter if it's a dental convention or a running convention,' Peveto said. 'Right outside on Boylston Street, when they walk outside, they're going to see that RunBase.' Much of the memorabilia had been on display in the B.A.A. offices. Other items, like the sweatshirt Kathrine Switzer wore when she became the first woman to enter the race — and when a race official tried to bodily remove her from the course — were locked away in drawers. Now they will be included in rotating exhibits, along with records of every Boston Marathon competitor in one place for the first time. 'You could go in there and say, ""Hey, my dad ran this in 1972."" And click, click, click, you could look up your dad,' Peveto said.

Addressing the plagiarism accusations, Ms Bines explained she left recipe sourcing to a nutritionist who was 'better qualified' to give advice in a video seen by Daily Mail Australia. 'By outsourcing... to a nutritionist I was trying to give you all something of value and to come up with delicious recipes from the food I suggested,' she said. 'Unfortunately I may have been too naïve to think that I wouldn't have check the origins of each recipe, instead trusting that the work would be completed in an honest and professional manner.

Ms Bines did not make it clear in her video if she had discontinued her association with the nutritionist or if they had been compensated for their work. The health expert also claims people had been making negative remarks about her unborn child, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported. Ms Bines hit back at the social media user who said they hoped her unborn child would get Down's Syndrome . While a supporter helped defend Ms Bines from the online troll, telling them to 'grow up and mature' Examples of the comments include 'I hope it gets down syndrome, you dirty liar' and 'you are a bitch, I pray a truck runs you over'. Ms Bines expressed disbelief at the comment involving her unborn child. 'To wish a baby gets Down syndrome gosh I actually didn't think you could sink any lower [sic],' she wrote on her social media account in response to the woman's comment.

"Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has placed higher safety restrictions on Thai Airways, but avoided following the footsteps of its Asian neighbours by banning future flights. China, South Korea and Japan have all banned new charter flights of Thai carriers after an audit by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reported that it found 'significant safety concerns' with the country's aviation safety to Thailand's Department of Civil Aviation. According to CASA, Thai Airways is the only Thai airline that regularly operates in Australia. Scroll down for video . UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reported to Thailand's Department of Civil Aviation that it found 'significant safety concerns' with the country's aviation safety . The regulator claims to have made contact with the airline and the Thai aviation safety regulator for 'further detailed information'. 'CASA has increased the number of ramp inspections of Thai Airways flights operating into Australia. These inspections look at the condition of aircraft as well as flight and aircraft documentation,' a statement from the government body said, according to Crikey. 'At this stage CASA has not placed any additional restrictions on Thai Airways flights to and from Australia. 'This is subject to the results of increased surveillance and any additional information that may be provided by Thai Airways and the Thai air safety regulator. While some countries have now banned new charter flights from any Thai airlines, Australia has 'increased the number of ramp inspections of Thai Airways flights operating into Australia'. According to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, 'these inspections look at the condition of aircraft as well as flight and aircraft documentation' 'Any request for additional flights by Thai Airways or changes to their currently approved operations will be considered in the light of the issues raised by the International Civil Aviation Organization and CASA's surveillance and safety checks.' Amongst the country's airlines that have been affected by bans are Thai Airways and budget airlines Thai AirAsia X, NokScoot and Asia Atlantic Airline. Audits assess a country's overall ability to ensure aviation safety. Among the areas considered are personnel licensing and training, airworthiness assessment and certification, accident investigation and airline operations oversight, according to a report by Watson Farley and Williams, an international law firm with a commercial transport practice. Amongst the country's airlines that have been affected by its neighbour's bans are Thai Airways and budget airlines Thai AirAsia X, NokScoot and Asia Atlantic Airline . An ICAO spokesperson told AFP that some of the concerns with Thailand's aviation related to 'air operator certification procedures'. A statement from the Thai ministry did not give details of the ICAO's concerns or recommendations. It said that it planned to inform countries about the status of Thailand's aviation safety and 'the solutions to fix the faults that were found in the inspection as soon as possible.' Japan has since temporarily lifted their ban for the next two months on the condition of stricter inspections, due to a huge number of travellers hoping to visit the country.","UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reported 'significant safety concerns' with Thailand's aviation safety .

"Angry parents continued to protest outside a Texas middle school this week after an eighth grade boy who wrote a violent and disturbing story about killing his classmates was allowed to stay in class. The Tidwell Middle School student - aged 13 or 14 - started a blog on a writers website called Wattpad in August last year that was called 'Killing Children', with the tag line: 'This is a continuous story about me murdering people I hate.' There were 11 chapters published online up until  January this year, featuring stories titled 'Massacre', 'Thrown Under The Bus' and 'Blood, Blood, And More Blood'. Some of the names of students at the school featured in the blog, with one section reading: 'He tries to hold in a scream, but it escapes him when I drive the scissors down his body.' Disturbing: The blog, Killing Children, on website Wattpad has been pulled down, but this is the title page for the blog. The 11 stories were given names like 'Massacre' and 'Blood, Blood, And More Blood' Anger: Despite the outrage expressed by parents, the eighth grade boy was allowed to return to school last month, and the District Attorney has confirmed no charges will be laid, saying the stories were 'horror fiction' The children who were named eventually came across the blog and alerted their parents, who reported the incident. The boy was then removed from class, and his parents subsequently withdrew him from the school. The blog was also taken down. However late last month, as students returned from spring break, so did the boy. The Northwest Independent School District confirmed they allowed the eighth grader to return. The district and the boy's parents maintained the blog was a work of fiction, describing it as a horror story. The Tarrant County District Attorney's Office also ruled the  blog was protected by the First Amendment. The decision has caused outrage among parents, who say they are scared for the safety of their children. 'I'm in disbelief. I can't even believe it,' parent Cindy Copeland told NBC DFW. Mrs Copeland has kept her daughter, who is in the 6th grade, out of school for eight days, frightened that something might happen at the school. Mrs Copeland said she read the blog and was disgusted. 'The description of what he will do to these peers and classmates, it's despicable,' she told NBC. 'It's not therapeutic writing. And if it was then it should have been kept private, not broadcast for the entire world to see. 'It's a threat.' Outrage: Local parent Cindy Copeland was one of many protestors outside Tidwell Middle School on Friday. She has kept her daughter out of school for eight days . Protests: Parents brandish signs and placards demanding the eighth grader be removed from the school . Fighting: The district and the boy's parents maintained the blog was a work of fiction, describing it as a horror story, but the parents of his classmates aren't buying it . Another parent, Angela Dean, told the network she has been forced to explain to her children about what to do in the event of an incident at the school. 'The fact that I have to have those kinds of conversations with my children on how to my protect themselves against harm from another classmate, it's very disheartening as a parent,' she said. The situation was reported to the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, who investigated the boy and his writings. An official decision was made this week not to file any charges. In a statement to NBC, the District Attorney said: 'Although the blog in question contains many disturbing, graphic, and offensive descriptions of violence, it does not meet the legal requirements for a charge of criminal or delinquent conduct under Texas law.' However parents say they will continue protesting and holding demonstrations until the boy is removed from the school permanently.

"Scientists in Italy have extracted the oldest ever DNA sample to be taken from a Neanderthal. Calcium formations on ‘Altamura Man’ - a skeleton found in a cave in 1993 - suggest he was 128,000 to 187,000 years old. Now researchers plan to sequence his DNA to see if they can reveal new details about the evolution of our ancient ancestors. Scroll down for video . Calcium formations on ‘Altamura Man’, a skeleton found in a cave in 1993, suggest he was 128,000 to 187,000 years old. Now researchers plan to sequence his DNA to see if they can reveal new details about the evolution of our ancient ancestors. Researchers have, up until now, held off from excavating the remains as they believed it would cause irreparable to the skeleton. An earlier study of the head and part of a shoulder of suggested the skeleton belong to a Neanderthal. The current project has been ongoing for six years with researchers taking a tiny part of shoulder bone and analysing it in the lab. It is believed that Altamura Man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck. Altamura is a city of Apulia, in southern Italy. It is believed that Altamura Man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck . Researchers have, up until now, held off from excavating the remains as they believed it would cause irreparable to the skeleton. An earlier study of the head and part of a shoulder of suggested the skeleton belong to a Neanderthal. Pictured is ‘Altamura Man's’ skull from different angles . Scientists assume he starved to death, or died from lack of water - but not much else is known about his life. Analysis revealed that the calcite on skull was formed 172,000 to 130,000 years ago, during a period when ice sheets were expanding significantly from out of Antarctica and Greenland. The team say samples of DNA have also been retrieved from the sample, and because of the age, represent the oldest such samples ever recovered from Neanderthal remains. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. If they manage to sequence the DNA, they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the Neanderthal. Separate research earlier this week found that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today - and this may be what killed them off. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies .","Altamura Man was discovered in a cave in 1993 in southern Italy .

"Terrorists are undergoing training in rural areas of west Wales, it has emerged. Locations in Ceredigion, Powys and Pembrokeshire are also being used to radicalise Muslims, according to an officer from the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit. Those involved in such activities 'take part in seemingly ordinary activities' in the community but 'have an ulterior motive', Detective Constable Gareth Jones said. Training: Locations in Ceredigion, Powys and Pembrokeshire in west Wales, illustrated above, are being used to radicalise Muslims, according to an officer from the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit . Speaking to Ceredigion Council, DC Jones stressed that issues surrounding terrorism were not confined to large cities. Incidents of Islamic extremist activity in Wales can be traced back to 1998, when it is claimed hate preacher Abu Hamza sent a group of 10 extremists to train in the Brecon Beacons, in Powys. The area is one of several locations used by the British military for training. Its rugged terrain helps prepare soldiers, including elite forces personnel like the SAS, physically and mentally for warfare. In 2005, two of the 7/7 bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer, were photographed white water rafting at the National Whitewater Centre in Bala, North Wales. Five years later, three would-be terrorists from Cardiff were arrested as part of an Al-Qaeda inspired gang who plotted a 'Mumbai-style' series of terror attacks on Britain.

"The mother of a three-year-old boy who was killed when a runaway two-tonne trailer mounted the pavement and crushed him to death is being targeted by online trolls who blame her for the incident. Donna Hussey, 32, has also been branded a 'bad mum' by trolls on Facebook over the death of her son Freddie - who was killed when a huge portable cabin came loose from a passing Land Rover. Mrs Hussey, who had just dropped her eight-year-old son Archie to school, was helpless as the runaway trailer mounted the pavement and crushed young Freddie against a wall in Bedminster, Bristol. Donna Hussey, 32 (right), has been targeted on Facebook and branded a 'bad mum' by trolls who blame her for the death of her son Freddie (left) - who was killed when a runaway trailer crushed him against a wall . A passing lorry driver tried to resuscitate Freddie and paramedics arrived within minutes, but he died shortly afterwards at Bristol Children's Hospital. Police investigators found the trailer had not been correctly attached to the Land Rover but driver Tony Davies avoided prison after admitting causing death by careless driving. His sentence infuriated Mrs Hussey and Freddie's father Scott, 37, who blasted his punishment of a six-month driving ban and 200 hours of community service as a 'joke'. Mrs Hussey said her torment has now been worsened further by hateful Facebook trolls who have bombarded her with messages calling her a 'bad mum' since the tragedy in January last year. The insurance worker said: 'Something that has been difficult was the reports that Freddie was behind me (when it happened) and that was not true. 'I've had lots of hurtful comments and people Facebooking me, sending abusive messages that I was a bad mum. 'I see little kids a few steps in front or behind their parents every day. 'I have to live with what happened. 'I loved that little boy and I love Archie so much. Those kids were my world and I just never would have put them in harm's way. 'I just want people, before they start making nasty comments, to really think about how they are with their children and how they feel it is right to judge. 'It has been very hurtful and we have already gone through hell.' Freddie (left) died after being hit by a trailer which cameoff a Land Rover driven by Tony Davies (pictured outside court last week, right). Davies, 38, was spared jail after admitting causing death by careless driving . A trailer used as a workmen's cabin came off Davies' Land Rover and crushed Freddie to death against a wall . This is the trailer coupling which failed, allowing the trailer cabin to detach from the Land Rover in Bristol . Bristol Crown Court heard last week how the tow hitch between the Land Rover and the trailer was not secure because the position of its handbrake prevented it from being locked down. Prosecutor Anna Vigars said Freddie had been walking behind his mother, playing in the puddles and laughing and joking when the accident happened. They had just dropped off his brother at Parson Street Primary School when the portable cabin detached, travelling around 10 or 12 car lengths before mounting the pavement and crushing the toddler against a wall and telegraph pole. The trailer is used on building sites as an area for workers to relax and contained a kitchen area with a table and basic facilities, as well as a toilet. Davies, 38, was spared jail after admitting causing death by careless driving but Freddie's family slammed the 'lenient' sentence and have started a petition to get mandatory safety checks for towing equipment. When Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC handed Davies his sentence, Mr Hussey branded him a 'f****** joke' and called Davies a 'f****** t***'. Mrs Hussey agreed, calling the sentence 'disgusting, no justice at all' before shouting at Davies: 'I hope you rot in hell. You are scum. He was a beautiful little boy.' Mr Hussey revealed how he has suffered panic attacks since the tragedy and lost his HGV driving job because he cannot get behind the wheel. Freddie's parents Scott and Donna Hussey denounced the sentence of a six-month driving ban and 200 hours of community service given to Davies as a 'f****** joke'. They have set up a petition calling for tougher rules . Mrs Hussey (pictured left with her husband Scott) said she has received 'lots of hurtful messages' over the death of Freddie (right) who was killed in by the runaway trailer in Bedminster, Bristol in January last year . He said: 'If the law can change then that would be great it is not all for nothing, but we also want to get the sentence changed. 'We feel we have been wronged by the justice system. 'We thought we would get justice but we are back at day one again. It is hard and it feels the past 14 months have been for nothing.' His wife added: 'Since the sentencing we feel we are back at day one again, we don't want to get out of bed and carry on. 'We feel like we lost our little boy for nothing. 'He was giggling at me and then out of nowhere the trailer came, it all happened so fast. I couldn't get to him in time and these moments will live with me forever. 'I saw things no one should ever see. I know we did nothing wrong but still go over what ifs.' In a moving statement, she earlier described the impact on her family of Freddie's death, and said: 'We have all suffered with nightmares and flashbacks and we have had to put Archie to bed most nights crying as he is missing his little brother, his best friend and playmate and cannot comprehend how or why this has happened. 'Archie doesn't want to watch cartoons on Saturday morning any more, as this is something he used to do with Freddie. 'It is devastating as a parent when you have already lost one child and your other one talks about killing himself so he can be with his brother. He is only eight years old. What can you do or say? 'Archie and I have started therapy. I get flashbacks of the incident and events before and after every day. I have woken up at night screaming as I relive what happened in my dreams and it is terrifying.'","Donna Hussey, 32, targeted by trolls online over three-year-old son's death .

"Some of the oldest surviving photographs of the Houses of Parliament and Windsor Castle, dating back more than 150 years, have been found. The remarkable images were shot by photographer Victor Albert Prout, who developed the negatives in an improvised dark room on board his punt which he sailed along the River Thames. And despite being more than 150 years old, most of the images capturing the iconic landmarks along the river are instantly recognisable today. Scroll down for video . Prout travelled along the River Thames in a makeshift boat where he installed a dark room (centre, front), capturing and developing his images on site, like this one of Windsor Castle (top right) Prout's collection is the oldest documented record of Britain's best known landmarks, such as Windsor Castle, seen from the banks today . A photo of taken of Richmond Bridge shows the familiar arches of the 18th century stonework, clearly recognisable today. While a picture taken from the banks of the Thames of Windsor Castle, showing Prout's floating dark room in the foreground, is remarkably similar to contemporary pictures of the iconic building. Another shows the Houses of Parliament in the 1850s when Henry John Temple The Viscount Palmerston was Prime Minister, and is strikingly similar to photos taken today. The pictures are to be sold as a collection at the Oxford Book Fair and are estimated to sell for around £30,000. Prout travelled around the Thames on his boat to capture images of the well known landmarks, developing them on the spot His floating dark room construction is often seen tethered to a skiff in some of the photographs. As an artist and photographer was renowned for his panoramic pictures, captured along the stretch of the River Thames - featuring images from the Houses of Parliament to Magdalen Bridge in Oxford. He was commissioned to take the collection of pictures for The Book of the Thames: From Its Rise to its Fall, by Mr and Mrs S.G. Hall. The photographer was known for his panoramic images, such as this one taken overlooking the River Thames, of Richmond Bridge . Richmond Bridge today is busier than the scene surrounding the 18th century stone bridge captured by Prout around 150 years ago . The buildings and riverside of Marlow was captured in a photograph taken by Prout, who then developed his pictures as quickly as he could . Today's picture of Marlow - with the church spire dominating - bears a striking resemblance to that taken by Proust, more than 150 years ago . The images, such as this of Iffley Mill, were saved by Prout in his book of pictures of the Thames in the mid 1850s and will now be auctioned . Some of the photos capture how the areas have changed, such as at Iffley where the watermill no longer stands after it was burned to the ground in 1908, having survived for almost 800 years . Prout's photography along the River Thames included this shot of Twickenham in the 1950s, with his darkroom boat in the foreground (right) Twickenham has been significantly developed since the 1850s when Prout captured his image of the London suburb along the Thames . The photos - believed to be the the first documented collection of the UK's greatest river - were eventually published by Prout's father's publishing company, Virtue and Co, in around 1862. Only a handful of copies of the photographs are known to exist, with most in specialist collections. The last to appear at auction was at Sothebys in 1981. Each of the photographs captured a historical record of the area at the time -  with some also showing how changes have occurred in the last 150 years. At Iffley, a watermill built during the 12th century, was a focal part of Prout's image. But in photos from today the mill is absent - after it was burned to the ground in the early 1900s. Prout's image provides a historical record of the construct, which produced malt, barley and corn for almost 800 years. But most of the photos show how little things have changed - such as the photos of the Houses of Parliament and Marlow Lock. An image of the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Bridge, taken by Victor Albert Prout, is believed to be one of the oldest photographs . Prout's picture of the Houses of Parliament is thought to be the oldest surviving image of the landmark, which looks similar today . A black and white photograph of Hampton Court features in Prout's groundbreaking photo album of panoramic views of the River Thames . Hampton Court is in full view overlooking the River Thames in an image taken from the exact same spot today as the one several years ago . The images capture how London's landmarks appeared in the nineteenth century, such as at Great Marlow Lock, as he travelled past . Marlow lock and weir lies on the River Thames today after being built in 1773 and captured by Prout almost 100 years later . The collection will be sold by Antiquates Ltd - Fine and Rare Books, at the Oxford book fair, held on April 25 and 26, for £28,500. Last month an image taken by Prout of young men playing cricket at Eton was discovered and at 150 years old, was believed to be the earliest ever photograph of a school cricket match, and the second oldest of any cricket anywhere. The image, which showed men playing in waistcoats, was signed in pencil by Prout and taken just five years after the first ever image illustrating the sport. This was captured by Roger Fenton in 1857, a founding member of the Royal Photographic Society and famous for his photographs of the Crimean War. Prout's photo captures the calmness at Wallingford Bridge - which connected Wallingford with Crowmarsh Gifford in Oxfordshire . Today Wallingford Bridge is still a calm stretch of waterway on the River Thames, with most traffic now crossing Winterbrook Bridge instead . Snapshots in the collection, including this of barges in Oxford, will be sold when it is sold at the Oxford Book Fair for around £30,000 . The busy waterways in Oxford, pictured in 2009, bear a striking resemblance to the bustling river captured by Prout 150 years earlier .

"Ukip figures insist the party would carry on if Nigel Farage left, and that there are future leaders waiting to 'put their hats in the ring'. Mr Farage has vowed he would stand down as leader if he fails to win the parliamentary seat he is contesting in Thanet South. A private poll, paid for by a Ukip donor but carried out by experts ComRes put the Conservatives on course to retain the seat by a small margin. UKIP MEP Diane James (right) has insisted the party would carry on if Nigel Farage failed to become an MP . But Diane James, an MEP and the party's justice and home affairs spokesman, insisted the show would go on without him and that Ukip was 'not at all' a one-man band. She said: 'Nigel stated categorically a few weeks ago that if he were not to be elected to the House of Commons he would stand down, that's fact. 'We've got a very, very high-calibre of individuals within Ukip… There are people there waiting. When the leadership race is announced then I'm sure individuals will put their hats into the ring.' Miss James who recently stood down as a parliamentary candidate for family reasons, said she had said she 'no aspirations' to lead Ukip, but named three possible successors to Mr Farage – deputy leader Paul Nuttall, economics spokesman Patrick O'Flynn and deputy chairman Suzanne Evans, who are all standing as MPs in May. The poll put the Conservatives on 31 per cent, Ukip on 30 per cent and Labour on 29 per cent in the seat, where Tory MP Laura Sandys – a moderate, pro-European - is standing down. The Labour vote has shot up in the past month triggering fears in Ukip that Mr Farage could finish in third place. A poll in February, heavily publicised by Ukip, put him on course to win. Ms James named Ukip MEP Patrick O'Flynn, MP Douglas Carswell and deputy chair Suzanne Evans as potential future leaders . Mr Farage said in his recent autobiography: 'The consequences of me failing to secure a seat for myself in the Commons would be significant for me and the party. It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat of my own. 'Am I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms pub? No – if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.' The Ukip vote across the country has dropped in recent months, having shot up after they topped the poll in last year's European elections. Pundits now predict it will win a maximum of five seats in Westminster including that of Tory defector Douglas Carswell in Clacton, Essex. At least six Tory MPs will defect to Ukip if David Cameron tries to form another coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Nigel Farage has claimed. The Ukip leader said many Tory backbenchers will rebell if there is another power-sharing deal with Nick Clegg. He told Mr Farage told Sunday Times that he had had conversations with 'more than a handful' of Tories about joining Ukip if the Prime Minister caves into Lib Dem demands on the terms of an EU referendum. Mr Farage said the possible defections were 'potentially very exciting stuff'. He said: 'If Cameron comes back as prime minister in a coalition deal with Clegg and the terms of the referendum are on Clegg lines, not Farage lines, then you may very well see a more serious fracture in the Conservative party than you've seen thus far. 'There is the potential in the next parliament, if there are a decent number of Ukip MPs, that resolve could be stiffened all round.'","Nigel Farage has vowed to stand down if he loses in Thanet South .

"Ephedra foeminea (pictured) waits for the full moon to bloom and produces a sugary droplet to attract pollinating insects . It may not turn into a bloodthirsty beast in the moonlight, but a peculiar plant does rely on the lunar cycle to survive. Called Ephedra foeminea, the plant waits for the full moon to 'bloom' and is the only plant species so far that’s known to behave in this way. At night, the non-flowering relative of conifers secretes tiny droplets of sugary fluid to attract pollinating insects. They ooze from the plant’s female organs where seeds are produced. When a nocturnal butterfly or insect lands on one of the tasty transparent orbs at night, the pollen it’s carrying is used to fertilise the seed. Researchers from Stockholm University noticed the droplets at the same time of the year having conducted four years of research, New Scientist reported. When they went to study the plants in Macedonia, Greece and Dalmatia in Croatia in 2013, they were baffled as to why the orbs were not there, but after abandoning their field work to get some dinner, noticed that there was no moon this time. They checked data to see whether the creation of the globules coincided with the full moon and were shocked to find they did. Researcher Catarina Rydin said: ‘It all fitted, and all we had to do was wait for 2014's full moon in July to see if that was what the plants were waiting for, and it absolutely was.’ The study, published in Biology Letters, says: ‘The exact timing of pollination in E. foeminea varied considerably from year to year, but was correlated with the full moon of July.’ The study, published in Biology Letters, says: ‘The exact timing of pollination in E. foeminea varied considerably from year to year, but was correlated with the full moon of July.’  A stock image showing the phases of the moon is pictured . Dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung. Badgers tend to raise their leg to urinate at full moon, to mark their territory before mating, LiveScience reported. Corals release huge amounts of sperm and eggs at full moon. By synchronising spawning, they increase the chances of eggs being fertilised. While lions hunt most effectively at night, they sometimes kill during the day when there's a full moon. Pets injure themselves more when the moon is full, although there is no reason why. A study found a 28 per cent increase in dog visits to the vets and 23 per cent increase for cats. ‘To our astonishment, even cones that appeared too young to be pollinated… secreted pollination drops from a pore-shaped micropylar opening during the peaking period at full moon. ‘One to two weeks earlier, when the moon was new and in its first quarter, we observed the exact opposite; drop secretion was weak to non-existent and pollinators were absent.’ While the globules materialised on E. foeminea at full moon, the same was not true of a relative found in the area. It’s unknown how the plant ‘knows’ when it’s full moon, but they can detect different intensities of light during the phases of the moon as well as gravity, which they could potentially use to identify lunar phases. While E. foeminea may be the first plant to respond to the lunar cycle, numerous animals are known to experience behaviour changes at different times during the cycle. For example, dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung and crabs and seabirds are also said to use the moon to carry out daily activities. Ephedra foeminea is the only known plant species to follow the lunar cycle, but dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung (a stock image is shown) and crabs and seabirds are also said to use the moon to carry out daily activities . ‘Correlation with the lunar cycle has been described regarding activity, reproduction, communication and navigation for a number of vertebrates and invertebrates,’ the study says. ‘Even eyeless animals such as reef corals correlate their reproduction with the phases of the moon. ‘Therefore, it is not surprising that the moon can influence plants as well, e.g. as a consequence of plant–animal interactions.’ Dr Rydin said: ‘To the best of our knowledge, this is a first. ‘At night, the many pollination drops glitter like diamonds in the full moonlight, a spectacular sight also for the human eye.’","Ephedra foeminea waits for the full moon to produce nectar .

"Banned: Joseph Getty was caught driving his Range Rover through Belgrave Square while drunk . A member of the ultra-wealthy Getty family was today banned from driving after being caught behind the wheel of his Range Rover while double the legal drinking limit. Joseph Getty, 26, pleaded guilty to drink-driving and received a 20-month ban as well as a fine of £1,000, which he paid immediately. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that Getty had 83 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath when he was stopped while driving through Belgrave Square, near his west London home, two weeks ago. His conviction came just a day after his relative Andrew Getty was found dead at his Hollywood home having suffered a 'traumatic injury to the rectal area'. The court was told that Getty, who is a director of the jewellery company run by his wife Sabine Ghanem, earns £40,000 a year as a financial analyst and was given a £96,000 bonus last year. Prosecutor Kate Shilton told the court Getty was stopped just after 11pm on March 17, and had difficulty walking. 'He was stopped due to the manner of the driving, and officers could smell alcohol on his breath', she said. 'Mr Getty got out of the car and appeared unsteady on his feet. He had to be helped on to the footpath by the officers.' Rebecca Lee, defending, said Getty had made a 'stupid decision' to drive home from an evening celebrating his wedding with friends who lived less than a mile away. 'The friends hadn't been able to come to his wedding, they offered him a glass of wine and he agreed, she said. 'It was at home, a large glass, and maybe the glasses were topped up without close attention being paid to how much exactly was being drunk. 'He just didn't think, it was half a mile to drive home and that's what he did. He wishes he could turn the clock back but he can't.' Socialite: Getty with Princess Beatrice, centre, and his jewellery designer wife Sabine Ghanem, right . The court heard that Getty had previously given up drinking in a bid to lose weight. 'It was pretty unusual on this evening that he had taken alcohol,' Ms Lee said. Magistrate Paul Brookes said: 'Mr Getty, until today you were a man of good character and unfortunately you will lose your good character. 'In your own words it was a very stupid thing to do, but it was more than stupid - it was dangerous.' He was disqualified from driving for 20 months and ordered to pay a fine of £1,000, costs of £85 and a surcharge of £120. Ms Lee told the court: 'He offers his very sincere apologies for driving when he had taken alcohol. 'He very much regrets doing that and understands it was wrong. He recognises he made a serious error in judgement and it is behaviour he does not intend to repeat. 'He is acutely conscious of the effect on his wife and family, he knows they will be very disappointed with him and extremely angry with him for doing something so stupid.' Tragic: Andrew Getty has been found dead at his mansion in Hollywood, naked from the waste down . Ancestors: Joseph Getty is great-grandson of J. Paul Getty, left, and grandson of Sir John Paul Getty, right . Getty is the son of Mark Getty, the founder of leading photographic agency Getty Images, and the grandson of philanthropist Sir John Paul Getty. The Getty dynasty was started by J. Paul Getty, Joseph's great-grandfather, who became the richest man in the world thanks to the Getty Oil Company and went on to set up a number of acclaimed art institutions, despite being a notorious miser. But the super-rich family has been touched by tragedy, most recently when Andrew Getty - son of John Paul's brother Gordon - died after years of drug-taking and hard partying. He was found unconscious in his mansion, naked from the waste down and suffering from a brutal injury to his 'rectal area', according to the authorities. Sir John Paul Getty, who died in 2003, was an Anglophile who became a British citizen and built a replica of The Oval cricket ground at his country estate in Buckinghamshire, Wormsley Park. But he also suffered family tragedy as his second wife Talitha died of a heroin overdose, and his son John Paul Getty III was kidnapped in Rome. The family thought that John Paul III was faking his own kidnapping until his ear was cut off and sent to them. He was left paralysed after a drug overdose led to a stroke, and he died four years ago at the age of 54.","Joseph Getty, 26, drove his Range Rover through Belgravia while drunk .

"The pizza delivery driver who is accused of stabbing and strangling his roommate then having sex with her corpse seemed to revel her talking about the pain he inflicted on her, prosecutors revealed today at the first day of his trial. Bryan Santana of Orlando, Florida, who is accused of killing Shelby Fazio and her dog last October, was described by prosecutors as 'delighting' in the pain he allegedly caused the young woman. 'He delights in every moment of telling explicitly what he had done to Shelby,' Assistant State Attorney Mark Interlicchio told jurors during opening statements. Jurors also heard the after allegedly wrapping a belt around Fazio's neck and stabbing her in the throat with a pen, Santana then reportedly had sex with her corpse, killed and mutilated her dog and wrote messages in blood on the wall. One of those messages read: 'I'm not sorry for what I did.' Scroll down for video . Bryan Santana (left) of Orlando, Florida has been charged with murder in the death of his former roommate Shelby Fazio (right) He is also charged with attempted murder for allegedly attacking their third roommate with a knife and killing Fazio's dog (above), and using its blood to write messages on the wall . The Orlando Sentinel reports that jurors also heard that Santana even messaged a friend and forewarned what was to come, claiming he was going to 'gut' someone, and then saying; 'I have zero money to pay my $400 rent so I'm going to do what I want. I will fulfill my deepest desires.' Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Charlie Murphy also took the stand on Wednesday, describing the grizzly scene he discovered when he arrived at the residence Fazio and Santana shared. 'I noticed a body laying on the ground, the door hit the left leg of the body,' he said. 'She was naked. I remember she had a belt around her throat and some type of pen or pencil shoved into her neck.' This came just days after Santana's lawyer argued that he is not competent to stand trial following an incident where he smeared feces all over himself and tried to hit a corrections officer at the courthouse during opening statements in the case. 'He has now soiled himself and smeared himself in feces and smeared the wall,' said Judge Renee Roache after the incident, according to WKMG. 'I've ordered security to clean him up and bring him up here in full restraints.' And while she allowed two doctors to examine the young man, she has made it clear that she has no time for this behavior. 'He certainly knows how to behave himself in the courtroom. He behaved himself very well yesterday. Now that the train is coming down the tracks at full speed, we are seeing some other behavior,' she said. 'I will not tolerate disruption in this courtroom. If I have to gag him, I will. If I have to remove him I will.' In earlier court documents, Santana confessed to the strangling, stabbing and sexual intercourse. He is now claiming he has multiple personalities, including one named 'Michael.' In court documents, Santana (right) admitted to strangling and stabbing Fazio (left), a Disney World employee, to death, and then having sex with her corpse . Fazio, 23, had moved in with the young man to begin a job at Disney World. The two had a third roommate who Santana also allegedly tried to kill, and for which he faces an attempted murder charge. That roommate claims Santana pepper sprayed him and came at him with a knife. 'He came at me, pepper sprayed me, I tried to knock the knife out of his hand and was successful in doing that,' said John Heermance. 'And then we wrestled in the living room area.' Heermance then testified on Wednesday that at this point Santana told him to go into his room and everything would be fine. After the incident, Santana is believed to have taken Fazio's car and tried to go to a Walmart to buy a toy gun in hopes that he would be shot dead if he pointed it at police, a jury heard. He also went and got a haircut. Friends say the young man no longer wanted to live. Laura Ramirez, a friend of Santana, said on the stand: 'He just said he was going to fulfill his fantasies.' She then added: 'He said he was going to gut her.'","Bryan Santana of Orlando, Florida has been charged with murder in the death of his former roommate Shelby Fazio .

"A man who shot himself in the head while waiting in a Las Vegas hotel buffet line sent a 270 page letter to a local newspaper explaining his shocking public suicide. In the angry and emotional package delivered to the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Monday, John Noble, 53, said he was going to kill himself because he lost his lifetime free pass to the M Resort's buffet for harassing female employees in 2013. Included in the detailed package was a two hour DVD in which a clearly upset Noble addresses the camera and a letter entitled 'The Curse', wishing harm on the women he blames for having him banned from the casino. Scroll Down for Video . Explanation: John Noble sent a 270 page package to the Las Vegas Review-Journal complete with two hour DVD to explain why he shot himself on Easter Sunday at the M Resort . Grevience: John Noble (pictured here with an employee of M Resort) was reportedly upset because he had lost free buffet eating privileges he'd won from the casino in a suburb of Las Vegas . Revoked: This the Biggest Winner free buffet ticket that was taken away from Noble after he allegedly harassed female members of staff at the M Resort after the death of his mother . 'Today, I end my life due to the M Resort Spa Casino and its employees,' said Noble, who included a huge dossier on the members of staff at the resort he blamed for having his free food pass revoked. On Sunday afternoon at around 4.50pm,. Noble shot himself in the head in front of stunned hotel guests at the resorts famed Studio B Buffet after setting his car on fire in the parking lot. Inside the package that Noble sent to the Review-Journal are reams of notes and documents including a table of contents, photographs and his video bemoaning the loss of his free buffet access which he won in September 2010. 'In this video, you will learn the reasons why I, John Noble, one-time Biggest Winner, was suicidal on Easter Sunday.' During his video, Noble demonstrates encounters he has had with the M Resort staff who all try to patiently explain to him why he cannot be granted access anymore. Explanation: An agitated Noble included videos of his futile interactions with employees at the M Resort as they tell him he can't eat at the buffet . Ominous: At the end of his DVD recording, Noble flashes text that reads 'The End' and heralds his own suicide . Fury: This is the Facebook posting from Easter Sunday in which Noble attacks staff members at M Resort for taking away his free buffet for life pass . 'You gotta fight for what you believe in and I believe that I was unjustly kicked out, cause if they do have a policy that team members aren't allowed to fraternize with customers and guests then they broke the policy.' Becoming increasingly agitated, Noble begins to lash out at people for not helping. 'That's the trouble, people do not get involved,' says Noble. 'That's why this world is so screwed up.' On Easter Sunday, just hours before he took his own life, Noble uploaded a furious invective to Facebook attacking the women he believes got him banned from the casino and the buffet. He writes, 'If you noticed on my friends list are a few lawyers & judges I been trying the past few years to find an attorney to represent me against the lies and slander the M Resort has falsely made about me, even though a few attorneys I met say it’s a good case trying to find one on contingency or pro bono has been a difficult task.' Angry, Noble writes that everyone at the M Resort are 'hateful' and pathetic' and says, 'It is sad that this is what our society has become. I’ve been destroyed because I told the truth, I never thought any type of backlash would be so brutal to destroy me in this way. I’m a genuine person proved by my inability to properly deal with everything that happened.' He then goes onto give address and names of the women he says got him barred, which the Daily Mail Online is not publishing. In the disturbing and detailed package sent to the Review-Journal, Noble mentions a prior suicide attempt from Easter Sunday 2013 just after he lost his pass, which also happened to be three weeks after the death of his beloved mother, Norma. According to a Henderson police report included by Noble, he was accused by an employee of the casino for stalking, which is believed to be the reason they revoked his pass and banned him from the premesis. Indeed, after the police arrested him for stalking he spent three days in a state psychiatric hospital after presumably suffering a breakdown. Devastated: John Noble's mental state appeared to deteriorate after the death of his mother, Norma (pictured) which appeared to set in motion the chain of events that led to him losing his buffet pass . John Noble said the M Casino Resort and Spa gave him a free lifetime gift of daily buffet meals in September 2010 but revoked it in 2013 over alleged harassment of female restaurant employees, according to newspaper accounts . After he recovered sufficiently, Noble began to contact local media in the hope they would tell his story and even met a reporter from the Review Journal in a Las Vegas Starbucks. The reporter has said that Noble was paranoid and nervous talking about the hotel and repeatedly attacked its employees and management during their conversation. Noble's death set off panic at the casino, as people dined at the packed Easter buffet around 5pm on Sunday. The Las Vegas man apparently described his plans for the suicide in a letter to the Las Vegas Review Journal , which was received by the newspaper Monday. Michael Hengel, the editor of the newspaper, confirmed the package was from John Noble. Police spokeswoman Michelle French said the Review-Journal contacted Henderson police reporting the package and that investigators will meet with the newspaper to review it. Police said a 53-year-old man was found dead with an apparent self-inflicted wound and that a car fire in the parking garage is linked to the shooting. The death set off panic at the casino, as people dined at the packed Easter buffet around 5 p.m. Sunday . The incident happened at the M Resort Spa and Casino in Henderson, Nevada on Easter Sunday . On Sunday, Noble wrote in a Facebook post 'I been trying the past few years to find an attorney to represent me against the lies and slander the M Resort has falsely made about me.' The message also included the addresses and names of several women who apparently were casino employees. Both employees and the casino were targets of Noble on social media for some time, the Review-Journal reported. Marina Rizk, a 21-year-old college student from Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview she was with three people on Sunday evening and had waited an hour to get into the buffet. They had just finished eating and were outside of the restaurant when people shouted about a man with a gun in the line. 'There were people in Easter dresses,' she said. Rizk described a chaotic scene. As she ran out of the casino, she said she warned others before going to hide in the bushes outside. 'I remember this one little boy. I remember telling the family, ""Get the baby. Run. There's a guy with a gun,""' she said. 13-year-old Sierra Abanilla told the Review-Journal while on a buffet line '[Me and my family] heard this loud boom, and it sounded like a balloon that popped but it was too loud to be that. 'I was in shock...I couldn't think, hear, or feel. It was like my senses just stopped working.' No one else was shot but two people suffered minor injuries. One person was taken to the hospital after a fall and another was checked out at the scene. A spokeswoman for the casino did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment from Daily Mail Online.

"Women paid 62p an hour in Mauritius to make ‘feminist’ T-shirts have been beaten by police during protests over pay and conditions at their ‘sweatshop’ factory. Dozens of workers at the factory – exposed by The Mail on Sunday for its low wages and prison-like accommodation for women making the ‘This Is What A Feminist Looks Like’ T-shirts – have been sacked and deported for staging what bosses called ‘an illegal strike’. At the end of a peaceful three-day protest, Bangladeshi migrant workers – who produce clothes for Whistles, Topshop and Next – were surrounded by officers who charged at them, hitting out with batons, before dragging the screaming women away. Scroll down for video . Beaten: Workers were treated roughly by police during protests over pay and conditions at their ‘sweatshop’ factory . As many as 1,800 workers at the Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile (CMT) factory went on strike last week about their pay, harsh treatment, food and concerns about a missing worker. Now 69 of the women have been deported to Bangladesh and scores more now fear for their jobs. Whistles, in partnership with feminist charity The Fawcett Society and Elle magazine, enlisted the factory to make the £45 T-shirts last year and they were proudly worn by Labour leader Ed Miliband, his deputy Harriet Harman and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. After this newspaper revealed the female workers’ poor pay and living conditions – they sleep 16 to a room – Whistles and The Fawcett Society defended the factory, claiming it conformed to ‘ethical standards’. Exposed: The 62p-an-hour factory where 'This is what a feminist looks like' T-shirt was made . But last night, Whistles and Topshop announced investigations, while Next cancelled its orders from the factory. A Labour spokesman condemned the violence. One Bangladeshi worker, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: ‘Police charged at us, beating us with sticks. We started screaming and running. They hit us and dragged some of the women away. I’m really scared I’ll be deported as well. If I lose my job, my family will be ruined.’ Fighting back tears, she lifted the lid on life inside the factory, revealing that employees were told by bosses to lie to auditors about their working conditions or face being sacked. She said they are often forced to work from 7.30am until 11pm to meet unreasonable targets of making 300 garments a day. She added that the women, who work six-day weeks, are not paid for all of their overtime. The strike was sparked after factory worker Nazma Aktear went missing on March 26 following a hospital visit. Her colleagues grew increasingly worried when bosses failed to provide information about her whereabouts. They downed tools on Tuesday. The day after, as protests escalated, police and government ministers ordered the employees back to work. A dedicated band of 200 women continued the strike on Thursday despite Miss Aktear being found. Bosses paraded a frail Miss Aktear in front of the protesters and repeated orders for them to return to work. But the workers, who receive less than the island’s living wage, refused and the violence ensued. Unrest: A striker is led away by police at the Mauritius factory amid unrest of pay and conditions . Violence: Dozens of workers at the factory have been sacked and deported following the strike at the Mauritius factory where police are accused of brutality . Following our exposé in November, Next met with factory bosses and ‘identified a number of specific shortcomings that required addressing by CMT’ and last week it carried out another inspection and found ‘there are still some outstanding areas of concern’. It has now cancelled its most recent order and future orders pending an inquiry. A Whistles spokesman said: ‘We are deeply concerned by reports of recent events concerning the CMT factory. We are investigating these allegations as a matter of urgency.’ A spokeswoman for Topshop owner Arcadia said: ‘We have started a full and detailed investigation into the reported incident.’ A spokesman for Miliband and Harman said the T-shirts were ‘a campaign run by Elle and The Fawcett Society to promote feminism and we were happy to support it’. Elle, The Fawcett Society and CMT refused to comment.","Women beaten by police during protests over pay and conditions .

"A grandfather who couldn't afford his own cruiser has come up with an innovative solution - putting his caravan on a boat and taking it out on the water. Peter Thurston, 80, takes his vessel, dubbed the 'catamavan', out on the River Swale in Kent regularly and enjoys the views of the countryside. He says his small yachts were too cramped for leisure cruising, and he couldn't buy a bigger vessel, so two years ago he built the caravan boat to take his mind off his recent divorce. Bizarre: This 'catamavan', a cross between a boat and a caravan, has been spotted on the River Swale in Kent . The catamavan has an oven, fridge freezer, shower, toilet, double bed and two tables, and it is fitted with a small engine that reaches four knots. Hundreds of two-litre bottles fill the twin hulls, so the boat won't sink even if it gets a hole as he travels up and down the same stretch of river. Mr Thurston said: 'I wanted something that had a nice, stable platform and was really comfortable because all my boats are quite cramped. 'I've got a number of yachts and if you have ever been in a yacht you will know that you can never see out the window. Project: Peter Thurston started building the unusual vessel while he was doing through a divorce . 'In the Swale you get lovely nights and mornings but sometimes it's a bit cold to sit outside and have a meal so you eat below deck and don't get any views. 'I couldn't afford a cabin cruiser, the sort of thing you need to have big windows and eat outside, so this was a better alternative because I didn't have to spend so much money and I could make it whatever size I wanted. 'I sleep on it regularly during the summer but in the winter it's quite cold, although I do check on it regularly.' Peter says he spent around £4,000 building the hull and added: 'Most of it was done flat pack at home. 'Then I took the catamaran down to the ship yard and we lifted the caravan onto it. 'It is not intended to go fast and it only has a small engine but it still goes about four knots. 'I also did it because when I was down at the harbour all day working on my boats it would give me somewhere to stay the night. 'You are allowed to anchor anywhere along the Swale unless it is a restricted area and there's nothing wrong in what I've done.' The father of four keeps the catamaran anchored in Conyer, Kent, which is 19 miles away from his home in Herne Bay. Mr Thurston said he started his project after the break-up of his marriage and began building the boat in his front garden before moving it to a local boatyard. 'I started building it as a bit of a distraction really,' he said. 'It gave me something to focus on because things weren't going well back home. Home: The catamavan cruises up and down the River Swale in Kent, near Mr Thurston's home . 'I used to build paragliders and para-motors and I have always worked on boats, but I wanted to do something a bit different.' A spokesman for the Marine and Coastguard Agency said it was unclear whether or not the vessel is legal, but added that it appears to be seaworthy. She said that officials would only investigate Mr Thurston if they receive an official complaint.","John Thurston started building the bizarre vessel while getting divorced .

"Britain's aid budget may have to soar by hundreds of millions of pounds a year because of new EU rules, it has emerged. Despite the fact that the UK has now met the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid, changes to Brussels accounting rules could bump up the bill even more. Official figures released this week reveal that Britain met the target last year, spending £11.7billion on foreign aid projects. The UK is now the second largest aid donor in the world. Spending on foreign aid is set to increase by an extra £1billion over the next two years because of new EU rules . But new EU accounting rules – to which Britain has signed up – are being brought in which change the way national income is measured. The new total includes estimates of parts of the black economy such as prostitution and drug running. It means that Gross National Income will rise – pushing up the amount that will need to be spent on aid to meet the 0.7 per cent target. One aid expert said it could mean an increase of £500million in the aid budget in 2016 and 2017. The news that Britain’s overseas contributions will swell even further was unpopular with Tory backbenchers, many of whom believe it was wrong to spend so much when the defence budget faces cuts. Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Tory defence minister, said: ‘What is the point of this arbitrary figure of spending 0.7 per cent of GDP? ‘The idea that if we spend this amount all the world’s problems will end is absurd, or that by providing that magic figure we suddenly become paragons of virtue. ‘If a change in the formula means the British taxpayer has to contribute yet more in overseas aid ... a lot of people will start questioning the largesse of this country. There are many military figures who just don’t see the logic of putting money into aid instead of defence.’ The new accounting rules are being phased in and the Department for International Development said they would only apply from 2016. Britain met the 0.7 per cent aid target thanks to a frantic effort that meant increasing the budget by 30 per cent in one year. A highly critical Commons report found that ministers had splurged large amounts in the final months – with few checks – just so they could say they had met the target. And last November an independent report slammed DfID for a failure to tackle corruption in developing countries. Late last year, the change to EU accountancy rules landed Britain with a huge £1.7billion increase in contributions to Brussels. Nigel Farage (left) has called for the foreign aid budget to be cut by up to £10billion . Millions of pounds of British aid money could be sent to war-torn Eritrea – despite warnings it will be misused by the brutal regime. Diplomatic sources say the European Commission is drawing up plans for a potential £240million aid package to help stem the tide of asylum seekers heading for the EU. The move would mean a six-fold increase in the level of EU aid to the African state, with Britain’s share amounting to around £31million. Campaigners say Eritrea has one of the worst human rights records in the world, with thousands of political activists locked up and tortured and citizens forced to do military service into their seventies. The move will also raise concerns about the lack of accountability attached to the £1.1billion Britain hands to the EU to disperse each year. More than 20 campaign groups and academics have signed an open letter calling for a halt to the aid package until Eritrea agrees to comply with a UN inquiry. They say the EU may be acting illegally by handing money to the country, which has been ruled by dictator Isaias Afewerki since 1993.","UK spent £11.7billion on overseas aid last year but that is set to increase .

"Rip up a piece of paper, and you can piece it back together. Burn a book, and you could theoretically do the same. But send information into a black hole, and it's lost forever – or at least that's what many physicists have been arguing for nearly half a decade. Now, one scientist says this may not be true, and that interactions between particles emitted by a black hole can reveal information about what lies within. For nearly 40 years, physicists have argued that black holes suck in information and then evaporate without leaving behind any clues as to what they once contained. Now, one scientist says this may not be true . 'According to our work, information isn't lost once it enters a black hole,' says Dejan Stojkovic, an associate professor of physics at the University at Buffalo. 'It doesn't just disappear.' His new paper presents explicit calculations demonstrating how information is preserved, he says. This is an important discovery because even physicists who believed information remains in black holes have struggled to show, mathematically, how this happens. The research marks a significant step toward solving the 'information loss paradox,' a problem that has plagued physics for almost 40 years, says Dr Stojkovic. The paradox posed a huge challenge for the field of physics because it meant that information inside a black hole could be permanently lost when the black hole disappeared. Last year, Hawking revised his theory by declaring that black holes were in fact 'grey'. The grey hole theory would allow matter and energy to be held for a period of time before being released back into space . In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes were capable of radiating particles, and that the energy lost through this process would cause the black holes to shrink and eventually disappear. But last year, Hawking revised his theory by declaring that black holes were in fact 'grey' The grey hole theory would allow matter and energy to be held for a period of time before being released back into space. He says that the idea of an event horizon, from which light cannot escape, is flawed. He suggests that instead light rays attempting to rush away from the black hole’s core will be held as though stuck on a treadmill and that they can slowly shrink by spewing out radiation. Hawking told the journal Nature: 'There is no escape from a black hole in classical theory. [But quantum theory] enables energy and information to escape from a black hole'. A full explanation of the process, Hawking admits, would require a theory that successfully merges gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature. This is a violation of quantum mechanics, which states that information must be conserved.

But last year, Hawking revised his theory by declaring that black holes were in fact 'grey' The grey hole theory would allow matter and energy to be held for a period of time before being released back into space. How exactly it's possible to recover information from a black hole has remained a topic of debate. Instead of looking only at the particles a black hole emits, the latest study also takes into account the subtle interactions between the particles. Interactions between particles can range from gravitational attraction to the exchange of mediators like photons between particles. Such 'correlations' have long been known to exist, but many scientists discounted them as unimportant in the past. 'These correlations were often ignored in related calculations since they were thought to be small and not capable of making a significant difference,' Stojkovic says. 'Our explicit calculations show that though the correlations start off very small, they grow in time and become large enough to change the outcome.'","Comments made by Dr Dejan Stojkovic from the University of Buffalo .

"Concerns have been raised over a program which allows school students to gain entry to university without completing their final year certificate - and is only being offered to pupils at a prestigious Sydney private school. Tuition, sporting and curricula fees for Scot's College, one of Sydney's most prestigious schools, reportedly top $30,000 . The University of Sydney is running a pilot of a 17-week bridging diploma for Year 11 students at the elite school Scot's College, Fairfax Media reported, stirring fears among student groups and university staff that the program allows parents to 'buy' their sons entry to the sandstone university. The program was devised by the university's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, and students who completed the course successfully were guaranteed places in a number of undergraduate level courses, including bachelor degrees in health sciences, liberal arts and science,  animal and veterinary bioscience, visual arts, music and oral health, or in a diploma of law. Minutes of a university Academic Board meeting show staff were worried over how the course was being advertised to Year 11 students 'as an alternative to completing the HSC', with 'concern noted about possible implications for the university's reputation'. Eight Scot's students gained 'direct entry' to the university after completing the program in 2014, according to a letter sent to parents by principal Dr Ian Lambert, while 166 students completing the HSC. Rose Steele, the president of the National Union of Students, told Daily Mail Australia that while it was important there were alternative pathways available for students to gain entry to university, it was 'really concerning' if this program was only open to students who could afford it. 'NUS really believes education should be open to all and not just those who can afford it,' Ms Steele said.

"The Large Hadron Collider was restarted today after being turned off for two years during a major renovation project that cost £100million. The world's largest atom-smashing machine is most famous for proving the existence of the Higgs boson - but scientists hope it will now unlock even more fundamental secrets of the universe. Physicists at Cern, the Geneva-based organisation which runs the LHC, are aiming to see dark matter for the first time ever thanks to the device's upgrade. Scroll down for video . Back to work: The Large Hadron Collider is operating again after two years being upgraded . The LHC is situated underground below the border between Switzerland and France, and consists of nearly 17 miles of circular tunnels. It was shut down two years ago - after confirming the discovery of the Higgs boson - so that its energy levels could be almost doubled, allowing scientists to carry out more extreme experiments. The re-opening was delayed by another couple of weeks thanks to a short circuit in the system, but this morning it started operating again at last. After two beams of particles were sent flying through the tunnels at a speed just slower than light, Cern's director general Rolf Heuer said: 'Congratulations. Thank you very much everyone... now the hard work starts.' Workers - who were earlier given Easter eggs by one of the centre's bosses - cheered when it was confirmed that the machine was back in operation. Ambition: Scientists hope the machine will be able to detect and describe dark matter for the first time . The LHC, which cost nearly £4billion, is currently running at a low 'injection' energy of 450 giga-electron volts (GeV), but in June it will increase to a record-breaking 13 tera-electron volts (TeV) - up from 7 TeV at the time it managed to detect the Higgs boson in 2013. British scientist Peter Higgs was awarded the Nobel Prize after the discovery of the particle, which he and others predicted would exist but which had never been seen until the construction of the LHC. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. Now the physicists operating the machine have their sights on dark matter, the invisible, undetectable material that makes up 84 per cent of matter in the universe and binds galaxies together yet whose nature is unknown. If they are able to detect and describe dark matter, it will mark a huge leap forward in our understanding of the universe. Cern spokesman Arnaud Marsollier said: 'The LHC will be running day and night. When we will get results we don't know. What is important is that we will have collisions at energies we've never had before. 'If something interesting appears in this new window we will see it. It might be two months from now or two years, we're not able to say. 'It took 50 years to find the Higgs boson and 20 years to build this machine, and it will be running at least until 2035, so we can be patient.' Particles of protons, the 'hearts' of atoms, travel round the LHC at just three metres per second below the speed of light. When experiments begin they will be smashed together in four giant detectors located around the beam ring, sparking the creation of new particles and hopefully opening up a new era in physics. The search for dark matter involves moving beyond the Standard Model, the all-encompassing theory describing the particles and forces of nature that has stood firm for the past 50 years. Inside: The LHC consists of an enormous circular tunnel which is nearly 17 miles long . A 'new physics' model of the universe called supersymmetry predicts that every known particle has a more massive partner - and one of these elusive supersymmetry particles might be the source of dark matter. Professor Jonathan Butterworth, from University College London, said: 'It all seemed to go very well this morning. We'll all be watching very excitedly to see what develops over the next few weeks. The LHC's operating again for the first time in two years and that's a really important milestone in physics. 'You can think of the LHC as the world's greatest microscope looking into the heart of matter. At this higher energy level we don't know what we'll see - no-one has looked there before. 'It would be absolutely lovely to find a candidate for dark matter. That's a fairly glaring hole in our theory. Supersymmetry particles are a good candidate, but they're not the only candidate. 'The fact that we don't know what most of the universe is made of is really what drives me on.' As well as dark matter, the team is hoping to discover more Higgs bosons and other 'exotic particles' which have never been detected before. They also believe they could uncover the existence of extra dimensions, which may explain why gravity is weaker than theoretical models would predict. And the LHC could cast light on antimatter, particles which are identical to normal matter but with the opposite charge. However, some have expressed concerns that the machine could be seriously unsafe, as its high-energy experiments create conditions similar to black holes which could have catastrophic consequences. Professor Andy Parker, head of physics at Cambridge University, said: 'This is a very exciting time for scientists as the Large Hadron Collider restarts after a major upgrade. 'The current Standard Model explains the known particles and forces, and the discovery of the Higgs completed that picture. But the Standard Model does not explain dark matter, which is believed to make up most of the universe, nor dark energy, a mysterious force driving the galaxies ever further apart. 'Interestingly, the answers to these problems in cosmology might lie in the realm of sub-atomic physics studied at Cern. The LHC might be able to produce dark matter particles for example, which would be glimpsed in the debris of collisions detected by the Atlas and CMS experiments. 'Even more exciting is the possibility that the universe could have more than three space dimensions, and that other spaces are hidden all around us.' And Professor Dave Newbold, who heads the particle physics group at the University of Bristol, added: 'The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 was a huge breakthrough, but the real excitement starts now. 'The upgraded LHC will allow us to probe further than ever before, and to explore brand new scientific territory such as dark matter.'","The Large Hadron Collider has spent the past two years being upgraded .

"A drug company has been accused of trying to block trials aimed at promoting a ‘cheap, safe and effective’ treatment for sight loss on the NHS. It has ‘bullied’ experts who have tried to prove that a cancer drug can be used to treat one of the most common forms of blindness, according to the BMJ. The respected medical journal says Avastin is just as effective at tackling wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as the current treatment, Lucentis. Drug company Novartis has been accused of trying to block trials aimed at promoting a ‘cheap, safe and effective’ treatment for sight loss which would save the NHS around £102million a year . Avastin is much cheaper and it is estimated that widespread use of the drug would save the NHS around £102million a year. But the BMJ says the drug company has consistently tried to ‘undermine and divert attention’ from trials to prove Avastin works – even turning to the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) for help. Wet AMD is the most common form of blindness in people over 50. Findings from clinical trials suggest Avastin is safe and effective in treating AMD – but it costs £70 per treatment compared with £740 for an injection of Lucentis. Novartis, which markets Lucentis in the UK, has allegedly tried to ‘do everything’ it can to stop trials of the cancer drug. The BMJ obtained emails under a freedom of information request showing that clinicians with ties to Novartis had urged some primary care trusts to pull out of one Avastin trial, while efforts were made to ‘derail’ a second publicly funded UK trial. The trial’s chief investigator, Alex Foss, a consultant ophthalmologist at Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham, told the BMJ how, during the planning stage, a Novartis representative tried to divert him to Novartis funded work – with the prospect of future funds for personal research projects. The BMJ says drug company Novartis (pictured) has consistently tried to ‘undermine and divert attention’ from trials to prove Avastin works – even turning to the Royal National Institute of Blind People for help . Dr Foss said: ‘He stated Novartis would do everything to stop the trial and challenge its ethics. He stated the challenge would not come from Novartis itself but from the RNIB.’ Dr Foss said the Novartis representative, whom he met in a pub, had funded an RNIB campaign to get Lucentis made available to patients before approval by the NHS watchdog. BMJ editor in chief, Dr Fiona Godlee, said the new evidence ‘raises questions about the legal and regulatory positions that have skewed clinical practice, fuelled NHS drug costs, and left doctors confused about what they can and can’t prescribe’. Loss of vision that develops with age, known as age-related macular degeneration, is the most common cause of blindness in people over 50. Most AMD starts as a ‘dry’ form but for one in five it progresses to the more severe, but treatable form of wet AMD. AMD robs people of the central vision necessary for reading, driving or simply recognising people’s faces. Wet AMD is caused by abnormal growth of blood vessels around the eye. It can be treated by using drugs to stop the growth of a natural protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, which prevents the formation of new blood vessels. Research suggests the number of Britons with AMD will rise by a quarter in the next decade, up from 600,000 at present to 750,000. She said: ‘Doctors and academics have carried out clinical trials despite threats and intimidation – and doctors leaders should follow suit and not allow themselves to be bullied either. ‘Doctors’ leaders also need to sort out the web of misinformation about drug prescribing that has been generated behind closed doors and is costing the NHS hundreds of millions of pounds a year by scaring doctors from using cheap and effective medicines.’ The RNIB told the BMJ that last year only 0.3 per cent of its total income was from drug companies. A spokesman said: ‘We stand by our decision to challenge the trial, which was motivated entirely by our aim to protect patients’ right to timely sight-saving treatment.’ A Novartis spokesman said: ‘Novartis does not tolerate unethical behaviour by its associates in any country, and has a comprehensive compliance programme in place to help ensure that our associates comply with the company’s code of conduct and all applicable laws. ‘Novartis strongly believes that patients have the right to the highest standard of care and that this right should be defended to promote safety and quality.’","Drug company accused of trying to block trials aimed at promoting a 'cheap, safe and effective' treatment for sight loss on the NHS .

"These dramatic images show the moment an Audi pulled out of a road and deliberately crashed into the side of a bus as part of a £1million 'crash for cash' scam. The elaborate fraud involved cars and vans being driven into the side of First Group buses so passengers - who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam - could falsely claim from insurers. The crashes took place between October 2010 and January 2012 and earned ringleader John Smith 45, from Connah's Quay, North Wales, £159,000. As the pictures show, all the collisions followed similar scenarios in which a car would collide with the side of a bus, causing both minimal impact and damage. In each case, the driver of the car would admit full liability, allowing all of the passengers from the bus to submit personal injury claims. Scroll down for video . The blue Audi pulls out from Whitchurch road, in Chester and accelerates into the side of the bus . It then collides into the bus as part of the £1million 'crash for cash' scam that took place over three years . The elaborate fraud allowed passengers on the bus, who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam, to falsely claim from insurers . Smith, the managing director of Swift Accident Solutions, stage-managed the crashes around the Chester area over the three-year period, in a bid to create new claimants for his business. He then personally processed 218 personal injury claims - which totalled more than £1million - to no win no fee lawyers. All of the bogus claims submitted by the Smith's company were for whiplash and 'soft tissue injuries,' meaning they could not be verified by the insurance companies. Instead, insurers were forced to rely on the individual claimants and usually settled out of court. John Smith (right), 45, from Connah's Quay, North Wales is facing jail after stage-managing several collisions in a £1m 'crash for cash' fraud; Luke McQuillan (left) was found guilty of of conspiracy to commit fraud . Police uncovered Smith's plot after being alerted by First Direct insurance to the unusually high volume of claims. They also found more than 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another. The majority were friends or relatives of the 12 defendants, the court was told. The court heard how Smith had introduced 177 new claimants to a lawyer for which he received £960 each time. Investigators later found that the bogus claims accounted for more than 75 per cent of the total gross income at Swift Accident Solutions during the period. Smith was convicted yesterday at Manchester Crown Court Smith of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, following a 41-day trial. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud. Four more people had already pleaded guilty to the charge, while two defendants were found not guilty. Police believe more arrests will still be made over the scam. During the trial, the court was told how Smith masterminded the scam by finding drivers who were willing to carry out a fake crash. More than 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another and were mainly said to be friends and relatives of the 12 defendants. Pictured: Richard Flynn (left) and Barry Cooper (right) were both found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud following the 41-day trial at Manchester Crown Court . The drivers would then pull out at low speed, using vehicles provided by Smith, and collide with the buses. The single and double decker buses had been chosen out of 'greed' because of the sheer number of claims that could be lodged, the court was told. Bus driver John Griffths told the court how he was caught up in one of the accidents while driving a park and ride bus towards Chester in June 2011. He told how he broke gently when he saw the Rover car pulling out of the side road, in a bid to prevent his standing passengers from being flung along the aisle. He added: 'I couldn't brake harshly because I had standing passengers, if I'd have done that they would have gone forward, so I had to go gently. The driver of the car said it was his fault, that his foot slipped off the brake on to the accelerator.' But he said one woman quickly reported that she 'wasn't feeling well'. He was also approached by three men, one of whom claimed he had hurt his leg on the bus steps, despite having no visible sign of injury. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud including Dean Brown, 42, (left) and Barry Cooper, 35 (right) When an ambulance was called to the scene, treatment was declined, he added. A passenger who was on the bus with his wife also told how he saw the Rover driver, at a side junction, actually looking at the bus just before to the collision. Although there was a 'minimal jolt', a fellow passenger was overheard exclaiming 'oh my back', he said. Smith was also accused of making a false representation by not declaring two outstanding county court judgments when applying for a licence to operate his claims management business. After the case Detective Inspector Simon Lonsdale from Chester CID said the force would continue to investigate the case. He said: 'This was an extremely complex investigation spanning nearly three years and involving a large number of defendants. 'It has been a challenging process for all officers involved and has required considerable professional skills in relation to the investigation and the subsequent prosecution. 'As part of our investigation conducted a significant number of interviews, to gather the required evidence to prove that Smith and his associates had stage these collisions for the sole purpose of financial gain. 'The crime that they committed was not a victimless crime, had all of the false claims created by Smith and his associates been successful we believe that the total cost would have been over £1 million, which would have been paid for by law abiding citizens through their car insurance policies.' Det Con Stephen Owens added: 'The Police have a duty to protect life, and although these collisions were all minor, they could have been much more serious. 'Yet despite the fact all of the collisions were minor, with minimal damage to both vehicles, they all resulted in multiple claims for personal injury claims, with the vast majority of these claims submitted via Smiths company. The trial at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard how the elaborate fraud involved cars and vans being deliberately driven into the side of buses so 'injured' passengers - who were mainly friends and relatives in on the scam - could falsely claim from insurers . 'Through our investigations and the evidence we have gathered, we have been able to identify a ""passenger Network"" which shows that a large proportion of the claimants can be linked to each other. This network proves that over 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions are linked to each other. 'Although the trial against these defendants has now concluded, we will continue to investigate this case and further arrests are likely.' Other defendants found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud were: Charlotte Watts, 28, from Wrexham; Daniel Shaw, 27, from Blacon, Chester; Dean Brown, 42, from Chester; Luke McQuillan, 40, from Blacon; Michael Gentile, 45, from Chester; Sean Kettyle, 43, from Ellesmere Port; Richard Flynn, 48, from Connah’s Quay; Andrew Shaw, 57, from Rodsham and Barry Cooper, 35, from Connah’s Quay. Cooper was found not guilty on one count of conspiracy. The following defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud before the trial: Howard Christopher Taylor, 36, of Seaforth; Christopher John Bethell, 30, of Eastham; Rachel Cooper, 32, of Great Sutton and Jason Power of Chester. David Clancy, 36, from Connah’s Quay and Jamie Stokes, 22, from Mold, were found not guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud.","'Crash for cash' fraud involved cars being deliberately driven into buses .

Last night, defence officials refused to disclose exact details of the crash – including where or when it happened – but they were adamant that HMS Talent struck ‘floating ice’ rather than a Russian sub. But the collision, which ripped a 6ft hole at the top of the conning tower, comes at a time of heightened tension between Britain and Russia in the airspace over the North Sea and beneath the waves. Britain is understood to be mounting frequent patrols of the North Sea and areas as far north as the Arctic Circle, while the Russians have increased their submarine activity by half in the past 18 months. Navy sources say the damage to the nuclear-powered submarine, which will cost as estimated £500,000 to repair, is consistent with striking an object while trying to surface. Surfacing can be a risky manoeuvre because sonar equipment on a submarine tends to look ahead for threats rather than above. In addition, radar scanners do not work underwater. After the crash, engineers from HMS Talent’s 130-strong crew found that the impact had devastated the submarine’s outer layer of acoustic tiles. These square-shaped 2in-thick tiles minimise the vessel’s transmission of sound waves and other signals that could reveal her position. The Royal Navy’s explanation that HMS Talent struck ice was also used to explain damage to British submarines during the Cold War which was later found to have been caused by enemy vessels. In 1981, the crew of HMS Sceptre were ordered to say they had hit an iceberg after their collision with the Russian submarine K-211. HMS Talent, which was launched in 1988, is a ‘hunter-killer’ submarine used to attack ships and other submarines, and also to perform a surveillance role. She is fitted with Tomahawk cruise missiles, cameras and thermal imaging periscopes. In 2009, she suffered loss of primary and alternative power supplies to her nuclear reactors. Navy sources insist there was no such power problem on this occasion. Scroll down for video . The 5,300-ton HMS Talent limped back to port with a huge dent and will be out of action for several months. Above, the submarine is pictured before the crash off the Egyptian coastline . A Navy source said: ‘Striking ice is a problem of the environment we work in. Some patches of ice show up on our scanners but not all, with the density of the ice also being a factor. On this occasion some damage was sustained by HMS Talent. ‘A submarine is a very pressured environment and a lot can go wrong. You’re in a tin can under the sea tracking Russian subs and trying not to get found ourselves. HMS Talent’s captain, helmsman and her officers will have been making multiple calculations simultaneously and working in very testing conditions.’ The activity of Britain’s fleet of nuclear submarines is strictly classified. Last night, the Royal Navy would say only that the incident happened last year. The submarine was photographed last month on her arrival at the Submarine Refit Complex at Devonport, where the repairs are taking place. A Royal Navy spokesman said: ‘HMS Talent suffered minor superficial damage after striking some floating ice last year. She remained fully operational and continued with her deployment.’","5,300-ton HMS Talent has a huge dent and will be out of action for weeks .

"A premature baby, born weighing a tiny 558 grams, astounded doctors by being able to go home almost five months after a medically complicated birth. The parents of Etienne Gould Nunan, who was born at Melbourne's Monash Hospital in July last year, have praised medical staff for taking care of their son who came into the world not breathing, with a hole in his heart and a brain bleed. 'He just looked so fragile. Literally a few hours after I met him for the first time, the doctors said he wasn't going to make it,' his mother Carman Gould, who had an emergency caesarean at just 26 weeks, told Nine News. Scroll down for video . Etienne Gould Nunan was finally allowed to go home after spending almost five months in hospital . He was born premature, after just 26 weeks in the womb, and weighed only 558 grams . She and her partner Jonathan Nunan would spend the next four and a half months practically living at the hospital and watching as their son developed pneumonia, suffered a collapsed lung and endured 58 blood transfusions to fight infections. 'Given the way he started, a lot of times both the family and us were very worried about him, whether he would be able to make it at all,' Monash's associate professor Arvind Sehgal said. But slowly, 'tough little fighter' Etienne began to experience his first milestones in life. A touching home video shows the moment the tiny baby, not much larger than a can of soft drink, was allowed to touch his mother for the first time, 10 days after his birth.

'You've watched this baby through this plastic window for ten days and so to finally hold him skin to skin; it's the moment that you've been waiting for,' Ms Gould said. 'It's the moment you start to think ""yeh, I am a mum"".' The proud parents said they celebrated each day as it came, alongside the little joys it brought, from Etienne's first bath to his first hug with dad and his first feed with mum. 'Etienne came home after 138 days in the NICU needing only vitamins and a little breathing support...and we expect him to grow out of that in the next few months. All his other issues were resolved, some spontaneously,' the couple wrote in a compilation video of their son's five month long hospital battle.

"Forget the must-have wine cellar, hot-tub or £1,700 Italian coffee-maker — the latest domestic fashion is for private home cinemas. Many of the super-rich are having them built — complete with huge comfy seats and cup-holders, eardrum-blasting surround-sound systems, massive screens and even cocktail bars and popcorn-makers. Celebrities with a home cinema include the Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch, retail tycoon Sir Philip Green and Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. And this week we learnt that the Beckhams want one, too. Forget the must-have wine cellar, hot-tub or £1,700 Italian coffee-maker — the latest domestic fashion is for private home cinemas . A planning application submitted for their 1860s home in London’s Holland Park shows drawings for a lower-groundfloor ‘cinema room’. And the word ‘cinema’ — suggestive of a large scale — is entirely appropriate. The ceiling height would be 9.5ft, and the room measures some 300 sq ft — just over twice the size of the average British living room. That means the Beckhams could easily fit 20 seats — enough for their family of six plus friends — in the room which would adjoin a 500 sq ft playroom. In this ‘Beckham Odeon’, a projector and pull-down screen would be built into the ‘non-historic’ ceiling. Having hired the ultra-swish interiors guru Rose Uniacke, one can safely assume it will be much classier than your local multiplex. Meanwhile, George Clooney, who has recently purchased a £10million manor house with his barrister wife Amal on an island in the Thames in Sonning, Berkshire, is also building a home cinema. It will be in a new complex, set apart from the house, that includes a pool, a ‘professional kitchen’, a pergola and a bar. Draft layouts lodged with the local planning office reveal that the cinema will have 12 seats, behind which there will be an audio/video room which will house the banks of electronics required. George Clooney, who has recently purchased a £10million manor house with his barrister wife Amal (right) on an island in the Thames in Sonning, Berkshire, is also building a home cinema . And it is unlikely that Hollywood celebrities such as Clooney are waiting for films to come out on DVD — no doubt eager publicists and production companies send George et al movies even before they are issued on general release. Not far from the Beckhams in West London, pop star Robbie Williams lives in a 46-room house that was previously owned by the late film director Michael Winner. A planning application submitted for David Beckham's (above) home earlier this week showed plans for a 'cinema room' Williams has sought planning permission to build an underground complex that features a pool and home cinema (although Winner had already installed an impressive cinema with photos of his own movies on the walls). However, as well as these celebrities, Russian oligarchs and retail tycoons, there is an increasing trend for normal families to install home cinemas. Magdalen Rees, owner of Chelsea Connected, an audiovisual and internet installation firm, says: ‘Like swimming pools, home cinemas set the status of the house. ‘Many clients want the whole cinema experience, complete with banks of theatre-style seating.’ She says that one client had his own study-sized cinema built in his ‘man cave’ — complete with a solo cinema seat that was a present from his wife. So, how much does a home cinema cost? ‘I’ve installed all the technology — projector, screen, amplifier, speakers and control unit — for less than £10,000,’ says Mrs Rees. ‘But the real expense is on the rest of the room — the seating, decoration and lighting which automatically dims when the movie starts, giving that complete cinema feel.’ But with the average cost of a family visit to the cinema costing £100 (including tickets, transport and food), it almost starts to look like good value. No matter your budget, it is possible to get something approaching the multi-millionaire home cinema experience. If you have a spare room that you can dedicate, then so much the better — but you don’t have to be a Hollywood star to watch in film‑star style. While the home cinemas found in celebrity homes might have popcorn makers, it is easy to make some yourself . Here are the best ways to get your home cinema up and running... Under £1,000 . At this level, buying a projector is out of your league. Your best bet is to shop around for a discounted 55in TV, such as the Samsung UE55H6670 — £799 from Currys. To improve the sound quality, invest in a soundbar — a slimline unit that houses lots of small speakers — such as the Yamaha YAS103, available from Richer Sounds for £149 (richersounds.com). This leaves you with £52 to spare, which you may consider spending on six old cinema chairs currently available on eBay for £48. With the remaining £4, you can buy four boxes of Butterkist salted microwave popcorn, available from Tesco for £1 per box. Installation can be done yourself. Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch (above) also has a home cinema . Under £5,000 . Although you can buy a decent projector for under this price, that will leave you with very little for speakers, seating and all those other extras. It makes more sense to buy a 75in TV, such as the Samsung UE75H6400 — £2,498.97, also from Currys. This could then be combined with a soundbar, a subwoofer speaker that delivers thudding bass and two wireless surround-sound speakers. The best package for all this is the Sonos playbar + SUB + 2 X play: 1, which costs £1,534 (smarthomesounds.co.uk). With nearly £1,000 left over, you can buy four LC7027 leather cinema chairs from Amazon at £219 each, and have enough to buy almost £100 worth of snacks. If you are handy with a power drill and have enough muscle around to lift up the TV set, installation can be DIY. Over £5,000 . If you have a big budget, consider buying a projector. You can plug any media device into it, including a set-top box such as an Apple TV, or a Blu-ray or DVD player, or stream the internet. The Epson EH-TW9200 costs £2,799 and is almost as good as what you’ll get at the cinema. Don’t skimp on the screen or just project on to a white wall. To get the best picture, look at the FrontStage Motorised Home Cinema Projector Screen HDTV, 197in x 147in, which is £1,078 on Amazon. You will then need an amplifier, and at this level you should invest in anything that features Dolby’s stunning new Atmos technology for the most advanced surround-sound. Try the Denon AVRX5200 Networked 4K Home Cinema Receiver at around £1,329. Buy a range of at least 11 speakers, including wall and ceiling units, as well as multiple subwoofers. Aim to spend £250 per speaker at the very least. Finally, invest in some Premiere Home Cinema chairs from Drinkstuff on eBay at £1,299 each. These feature incliners, footrests and backrests, storage boxes, cup-coolers and even cup-warmers. Installation will have to be done by a professional, as projectors and screens need careful mounting.","Sir Philip Green and Benedict Cumberbatch also enjoy home cinemas .

"CPRE president Sir Andrew Motion, who is demanding a national clean-up . Council chiefs were condemned last night after claiming it was too dangerous to collect the roadside litter blighting Britain. Winchester Council in Hampshire said its annual clean-up of roads around the city had been hit by new Health and Safety Executive rules designed to protect litter-pickers from traffic. But the HSE denied tightening rules – and said councils were ‘over-interpreting’ legislation. Last night, former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion, now president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, accused town hall bosses and the Highways Agency of ruining the countryside by failing to remove rubbish. He said: ‘Every day, people tell us that they are disgusted, angry and ashamed of the state of England’s roads. ‘Nobody wants to drive through our beautiful countryside or approach a vibrant city, heralded only by discarded rubbish.’ Although laws to fine people who throw litter from vehicles were now in place, their implementation had been delayed by ‘shameful time-wasting’, Sir Andrew said. ‘Without funding to tackle the problem, I fear our roads will become corridors of waste,’ he added. Highways England – the Government-owned company launched last week to replace the Highways Agency – is required to keep the motorway network clean, but responsibility for clearing A-roads and trunk routes is divided between the agency and councils. Scroll down for video . Peter Silverman, of pressure group Clean Highways, said: ‘Of course safety is paramount but councils are always looking for excuses and this is just the latest. They are shutting their eyes to the problem of litter.’ Roadside litter has become a problem almost everywhere in the UK. Disgrace: Winchester Council chiefs claimed it was too dangerous to collect roadside litter. Pictured: rubbish beside Crookilley Way, Stockport . Andrew Gwynne, who is standing for re-election as Labour MP in Denton and Reddish in Greater Manchester, said: ‘The Highways Agency is atrocious when it comes to removing rubbish. The worst case I’ve come across is Crookilley Way in Stockport, which is littered with plastic bags and bottles.’ A Highways England spokesman said: ‘Although we spend at least £6 million a year collecting more than 150,000 sacks of litter from England’s motorways, we still find the level of litter unacceptable. We will continue to investigate what more can be done.’ Winchester Council insisted that the HSE had ‘clarified’ last June that litter-picking was covered by the same code of practice that governs employees involved in highway maintenance – requiring a wider separation than was previously the case between workers and passing traffic.","Winchester Council in Hampshire claimed annual clean-up hit by new rules .

"This dramatic footage shows a climber as he scales a sheer 60ft rock face in the Cairngorms. Julian Lines was filmed edging towards the top of the cliff - without any equipment to stop him plummeting into the freezing water below.

Edging towards the top: Mr Lines was captured grappling to find footholds and handholds in the sheer rock face as he scaled the cliff . Don't look down: The solo climber clings to the side of the cliff - hugging his body to the stone - as he climbs further from the freezing water . While the ascent would leave most with their palms sweating, Mr Lines, from Northern Ireland, said 'life's problems evaporate' when he is climbing. But he admitted there had been times he had fallen and had 'really close calls'. He said: 'There's a lot of feeling and emotions going on when soloing. It's quite complex, yet so simple. 'Although you have to be clear headed before you start soloing, once you're up there life's problems just seem to evaporate. 'Of course there are fears and nerves, more so now that I'm older. In fact I don't really like it anymore if I'm more than about 60ft up . 'I don't worry about slipping, I worry about my arms tiring rapidly and not being able to hold on. It's all about speed and precision. 'Slipping is uncommon unless I'm really tired or the standard of the climb is of the upmost difficulty. Risks: Mr Lines said slipping is uncommon, but he worries about not being able to hold on if his arms tiring rapidly during an ascent . Fearful: Mr Lines said 'his inner mortality was catching up' with him, which makes climbing more difficult than it used to be . Struggle: Face contorted in concentration, Julian Lines clutches to another rock face, high above the rough woodland below . Planning: The 42-year-old said solo climbing is about risk assessing, calculating and fine tuning in order to 'minimise the inevitable' 'In more than 25 years of soloing, I've had some really close calls. Soloing is all about risk assessing, calculating it all correctly and fine tuning to minimise the inevitable. 'There have been times when I've actually fallen and been so lucky with the way I've landed it's close to miraculous.' All of these stories are written in Julian's book 'Tears of the Dawn' which was published last year and won the prestigious Boardman Tasker award for mountain literature in 2014. Alastair Lee, director at Posing Productions, who recorded the footage said: 'Jules is very much the dark horse of British climbing and easily the most accomplished free soloist in the UK. 'Filming soloing isn't for the faint hearted but it was a spectacular journey we embarked on as Jules guided around many of his favourite climbing destinations.'

"Ambulance bosses are routinely making a 21,500-mile round trip to Australia to hire paramedics on £4,500 ‘golden hello’ payments because it is far cheaper than training them in Britain. Managers from the London Ambulance Service, the largest in the NHS, have just filled 225 vacant posts with applicants from Sydney and Melbourne. They were recruited on the back of a series of practical demonstrations on dummies, a written exam and an interview that lasted in all between four and six hours. Ambulance bosses are routinely making a 21,500-mile round trip to Australia to hire paramedics on £4,500 ‘golden hello’ payments . The selection process, held at five-star hotels, was so quick that by 8am the next day applicants had received an email informing them if they had a job. It is the latest example of how the NHS is recruiting overseas because it has failed to train enough staff in Britain to meet the needs of the rising and ageing population. Hospital managers have been flying out to Spain and Portugal to hire batches of 30 nurses at a time. The ambulance service is also severely understaffed and, across England, around 1,250 posts are unfilled – a tenth of what is needed. The Mail attended a fast-track recruitment event last month at the five-star Sydney Harbour Marriott Hotel, overlooking the famous Opera House. Our investigation discovered how: . Growing numbers of paramedics are quitting the NHS. Many are frustrated at having to spend hours queuing outside A&E units which are too full to accept their patients. They are also being called out to a growing number of non-urgent calls from patients unable to see a GP. The selection process, held at five-star hotels, was so quick that by 8am the next day applicants had received an email informing them if they had a job . The increasing demand on ambulances means they are taking longer to reach the seriously ill. As a result, many paramedics are choosing to take up posts as ‘advanced practitioners’ in A&E, GP surgeries and call centres for the 111 helpline where the work is less stressful and they can earn more. London Ambulance Service has been the hardest hit by this exodus. Currently 340 posts are vacant, a fifth of the total workforce needed. Last year alone more than 230 paramedics quit. However, Australia has a surplus.Other understaffed ambulance services in the UK are also going abroad, including to Poland. As well as the 225 paramedics hired from Australia last month, London Ambulance Service hired 175 from there and New Zealand in September. Managers are considering flying out again later this year and calculate that the first recruitment drive saved the NHS £9million. It costs £50,000 to train one paramedic in Britain. Each trip to Australia costs the ambulance service £90,000 in flights and hotel bills, but they return having hired on average 200 paramedics. They are offered a £30,200 salary including London weighting. Jason Killens, director of operations at London Ambulance Service, said: ‘It’s not our long-term solution but is helping us fill a skills shortage while we train more people to become paramedics in the UK.’ He said the paramedics had initially been filtered via an online form. Tim Jones is one of the many Australians being lured to Britain to work as a paramedic. He will join the London Ambulance Service when he finishes his degree course in October. The 22-year-old said it was ‘exciting helping people’, but also hopes it will enable him to see more of Europe. He said: ‘It was pitched as a lifestyle and a job – they really sold it to me.’ He said friends who were offered jobs in September ‘are absolutely loving it’ – including having the chance to see the Tour de France. A lifestyle and a job: Tim Jones, left, during a skills test last month held at Sydney Harbour Marriot Hotel . Kate Tranter and fiancé Will Skelly, from Sydney, will move over together in the hope of furthering their careers. Miss Tranter said: ‘We are big travellers so it will be a good adventure together. We will spend a minimum of two years there.’ Mr Skelly said: ‘I’ve always wanted to go to London as a paramedic because you get a variety of work and then you can shoot off to Spain for the weekend.’ Celia Potter, 23, from Katoomba in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales, said she was encouraged to move to London after talking to friends given jobs in September. She said: ‘One friend said they are thrown straight into it, but you also get a mentor for the first year which is good.’","Managers from the London Ambulance Service just filled 225 vacant posts .

"Raising the retirement age is unfair on Scottish pensioners because they die younger, Nicola Sturgeon declared yesterday. The SNP demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds - as the latest price of propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street in the event of a hung Parliament. Miss Sturgeon said the rising retirement age was particularly unfair for pensioners in Scotland because they don’t live as long as their counterparts in the rest of the country. Raising the retirement age is unfair on Scottish pensioners because they die younger, Nicola Sturgeon declared yesterday. She is pictured at the Westerton Care Home during an election campaign visit in Glasgow . The SNP leader demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds . At the same time, she issued a demand for a huge inflation-busting increase in the State pension, which would cost billions of pounds more. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113. Parts of Scotland have among the lowest life expectancies of any part of the UK. In central Glasgow it is less than 73 years for men and for women less than 79. Across Scotland the figure is about 76 for men and 80 for women. In England and Wales the figures are nearly 79 for men and nearly 83 for women. But various studies have linked lower life expectancy in Scotland to higher rates of alcohol consumption, smoking, and poor diet. It is also linked to levels of poverty and housing. Her comments will raise concerns that the SNP will demand a more expensive pension system across the whole of the UK which will benefit Scotland most. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113 . Speaking on a visit to a care home in East Dunbartonshire, Miss Sturgeon said: ‘The Tory/Lib Dem government’s plan to further increase the state pension age is a worry to people across the UK who are planning for their future, but the failure to take Scotland’s specific circumstances into account is particularly unfair. ‘Our comparatively low life expectancy rate is an issue which I will do everything in my power to change but in the meantime it would be completely unacceptable for people in Scotland who have paid in to a state pension all of their lives to lose out.’ ‘That is why SNP MPs will reject any plans for a further increase in the state pension age.’ ‘Our pensioners have contributed hugely to society and are entitled to get a fair deal in their retirement in return. She said the SNP would ensure that ‘the contribution older people have made throughout their lives is recognised’ if they hold the balance of power after the election. Miss Sturgeon also issued a demand for the single tier pension to increase to at least ‘to ensure pensioners are no longer subjected to the scourge of means-tested benefits.’ The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped . A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘Capping the state pension age in Scotland will cost hardworking taxpayers across Britain more than £12.5 billion. ‘This gives another glimpse into a future with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, in the SNP’s pocket – meaning more borrowing, more spending, and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’ On Sunday Miss Sturgeon said the SNP would be prepared to prop up a minority Labour government even if Ed Miliband lost the election. She said the party’s MPs would vote to support Labour even if the party won fewer seats than the Conservatives on May 7. The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped. For many years, the UK state pension age for men was 65 and the state pension age for women was 60. But from 2020, both men and women’s retirement age will be 66, increasing to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and then linked to life expectancy after that. The government will then review the state pension age every five years. During last year’s referendum campaign, the SNP argued the level should only increase to 66 in Scotland, because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £10,000 and £11,000 less.","SNP said retirement age should be frozen, in a move costing billions .

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has slammed the Iran nuclear deal, claiming it threatens the Jewish state and puts his people in mortal danger. After speaking to President Barack Obama on the phone, he said in a televised statement just hours after the agreement was signed on Thursday: 'A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel. He added: 'Such a deal would not block Iran's path to the bomb. It would pave it.' Scroll down for video . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the Iran nuclear deal, claiming it threatens the Jewish state and puts his people in mortal danger . One of Netanyahu's scathing comments was shared on his Twitter page during his speech . The preliminary agreement set out a framework where Iran would scale down plans to enrich uranium and make weapons-grade plutonium in return for Western powers dropping stringent economic sanctions. They will also be subjected to inspections. If they are found to be in violation of the terms, the sanctions will be put back in place. The deal does mean however that Iran's nuclear program will be able to operate for the next 10 years, even though it is ceasing its enrichment activities at Fordow - an underground facility discovered by the Americans. It prompted Netanyahu to urge more pressure to be placed on Iran by Western powers until a better deal is reached. He said: 'This deal would legitimize Iran's nuclear program, bolster Iran's economy, increase Iran's aggression & terror throughout the ME [Middle East] & beyond. 'Such a deal would not block Iran's path to the bomb. It would pave it. 'Such a deal would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war. 'The alternative is standing firm and increasing the pressure on Iran until a better deal is achieved. In response, The White House said in a statement, seen by NBC, that 'progress on the nuclear issue in no way diminishes our concerns with respect to Iran's sponsorship of terrorism and threats towards Israel,' adding that 'the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to the security of Israel.' The deal made in Lausanne, Switzerland was announced by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and the European Union's head of foreign policy Federica Mogherini. They said negotiators had reached an agreement with Tehran over its nuclear program and talks would move into the next phase. After speaking to President Barack Obama (pictured Thursday during the announcement of the agreement) on the phone, he said in a statement: 'A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel . Obama (pictured making a speech on the economy in Louisville, Kentucky' added that if Iran follows through then one of the greatest threats to American security will be resolved . Speaking in the Rose Garden on Thursday, Obama said: 'If we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully. But, he added: 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it.' And 'If there is backsliding' and Iran doesn't meet certain specifications 'there will be no deal.' As Zarif and Mogherini were preparing to give a joint statement in Lausanne, Switzerland, this afternoon Iranian President Hassan Rhouianni tweeted: 'Solutions on key parameters of Iran case reached. Drafting to start immediately, to finish by June 30th.' Zarif insisted that the program is 'exclusively peaceful' and will remain that way as the framework takes shape. From left Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond speaks to US Secretary of State John Kerry as European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat take their positions before making a statement on the Iranian deal . U.S Secretary of State John Kerry admitted there was still progress to be made when the deal was signed. He said: 'We have no illusions about the fact that we have a ways to travel. We still have many technical details that have to be addressed.' British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond also said there was much more work to be done, but highlighted the success of the talks. He said: 'This is well beyond what many of us thought possible even 18 months ago and a good basis for what I believe could be a very good deal. ' German Chancellor Angela Merkel added: 'We are closer than ever to an agreement that makes it impossible for Iran to possess nuclear weapons. That is a great credit to all negotiating partners.' The White House had repeatedly said that in order for it to enter into a commitment with Tehran it must promise to 'shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon' and 'comply with intrusive inspections that would ensure that they’re living up to the agreement.' The date for work on that accord to be completed is June 30. The preliminary agreement announced in Switzerland on Thursday is spelled out in a four-page document (below) released by the White House and the State Department.

"The NYPD  detective caught on video screaming at an Uber driver has apologized in a televised interview. Detective Patrick Cherry was stripped of his shield and gun and will be placed on administrative duty following the outburst which was viewed more than three million times on YouTube. Reacting to the mass outcry, Cherry appears on NBC 4 New York on Friday night to say: 'I apologize. I sincerely apologize.' He adds: 'People shouldn’t be treated that way. I let my emotions get the better of me and I was angry. 'My intention was to be courteous and then we got into an argument. There was no intention to berate or hurt deeply the driver.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Apology: Detective Patrick Cherry appears on NBC tonight to 'sincerely apologize' for shouting at an Uber driver . Screaming and raging: Detective Patrick Cherry, pictured in the blue shirt, launched his tirade after the Uber driver hooted at him . The New York Post reported in addition to being stripped of his badge, Detective Patrick Cherry will be placed on modified duty before being transferred out of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. 'No good cop should watch that video without a wince,' NYPD Police Chief Bill Bratton said at a press conference announcing Cherry was being placed on modified duty. 'Because all good cops know that officer just made their jobs a little bit harder,' Bratton added. 'In that kind of encounter, anger like that is unacceptable. In any encounter, discourtesy and obscene language like that is unacceptable.' The New York Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau launched an investigation into the incident, which occurred in the West Village, after footage captured by a passenger was posted online. The officer was named by the New York Daily News as Detective Patrick Cherry of the NYPD's Joint Terrorism Task Force. Shell shocked: The driver, named only as Humayun, pictured, tried to repeatedly apologise to Detective Cherry . Detective Cherry was in plainclothes and trying to park his unmarked Hyundai without signalling when the Uber driver known only as Humayun honked his horn. The angered detective pulled over the Uber cab and launched a tirade, questioning the diver's command of the English language as well as his driving ability. Cherry's case was transferred to the Civilian Complaint Review Board following a complaint of 'discourtesy'. Detectives' Endowment Association President Michael Palladino said Cherry was returning from a visit with his colleague Detective Harry Hill. Hill had recently had a heart attack while undergoing surgery and Cherry was reportedly very stressed. 'The past five days have been emotionally draining for the members of the JTTF dealing with their fellow detective's health,' Palladino said. 'Despite what some people think, cops have feelings, too.' During the three-minute video, Detective Cherry shouts at the driver, screaming, 'I don't know where you're coming from, where you think you're appropriate in doing that.' 'That's not the way it works,' he continued. 'How long have you been in this country?' The two passengers in the backseat of the car can be heard assuring the driver that he has done nothing wrong, with one of them saying; 'It's not your fault; this guy's just a d***.' Moments later the cop returns with a ticket, this after he has pounded on the car and, according to one of the passengers, thrown things in the vehicle. As the driver agrees with everything the cop says, he manages to cut off the man, which sends him into another tirade as he screams; 'I don't know what f****** planet you're on right now!' The officer also mocks the driver's accent throughout and his pronunciation of certain words. Passengers in the cab claimed that Detective Cherry failed to indicate before attempting to park his Hyundai . 'Our Uber driver, Humayun, was abused by a police officer today in New York,' Sanjay Seth, who took the video, wrote on his Facebook page on Monday. 'The unending rage, door slamming, throwing items into the car, threatening arrest without cause was bad enough - but the officer's remarks at the end really took it to another level.' 'The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident,' Uber said in a statement. 'We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs.'","Patrick Cherry will appear on NBC New York on Friday night to apologize .

"Some 35,000 gathered on the White House South Lawn Monday morning for the 137th annual Easter Egg Roll festivities. Pop band Fifth Harmony and duo MKTO brought music to the event, and Mrs Obama joined the So You Think You Can Dance All Stars on stage taking the spotlight during a choreographed routine. This comes only days after she sported her mom dance moves on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon during a segment called The Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2. On Monday, another highlight of the day's festivities was Mr Obama's annual reading of his favorite childhood book Where the Wild Things Are, which he has done since 2009. However, this year there was a disturbance when bees started buzzing near the children gathered for story-time on the South Lawn. Not breaking character, Mr Obama settled the shrieking children by saying: 'If you're a wild thing, you can't be scared of bees!'

However, President Obama did confess to having a bit of not-so-healthy Easter chocolate when asked by a reporter at the event. 'I had a few, I have to admit,' Mr Obama said. Notably not in attendance were first daughters Sasha, 13, and Malia, 16, Obama. The president said they were occupied by 'a little school stuff going on'.

Celebrating spring: Above, the scene on the White House's South Lawn Monday morning as the Easter egg roll kicked off . Monday's events included sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, and of course, the traditional egg roll in which kids compete to move their egg to the finish line first using only a wooden spoon. Staying true to the roll's theme, the president kept active during the event, playing tennis with Danish racket star Caroline Wozniacki and basketball with members of the Washington Wizards. Despite all the pick-up games he stages on the South Lawn courts, Mr Obama appears not to have improved his game much since he was hit in the head while shooting hoops Monday.

A Malayan flying fox named Kamilah, was also brought in to teach the children about bats and their ecosystems. For this year's celebrations, the White House collaborated with Snapchat and asked attendees to send out pictures on the social media app so that people around the world can follow along.

Mr Obama blows a whistle to signal the start of the Easter egg roll where children compete to move an egg down a course the fastest using only a wooden spoon . The egg roll is one of the longest-standing White House traditions. In 1878, a sympathetic President Rutherford B.

A 9-year-old girl named Sofia, from Massachusetts, made headlines last year when she sent a letter to the president, asking him why there weren't any women on U.S. currency. The president responded to the adorable letter and told little Sofia she had a great idea and had come up with a list of outstanding women. Each president has put his own spin on the event, such as President Jimmy Carter who added a petting zoo in 1977.

"The artist behind a statue of Lucille Ball so terrifying it has been nicknamed 'Scary Lucy' has admitted to being 'disappointed' in his work, offering to fix the sculpture for free. Residents of Celoron, New York, hometown of the famous comedienne, reacted with shock and horror when the 'I Love Lucy' statue was unveiled in 2009. Following a recent social media campaign to have the bronze statue removed, sculptor Dave Poulin  called it 'by far my most unsettling sculpture', and pledged to make a new one. Following a campaign to have the statue of Lucille Ball sculptor Dave Poulin has pledged to make a new one . The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue' has attracted more than 600 likes. Yahoo reports that the anonymous man behind the page says he's a 'big fan of Lucy's.' 'Lucille Ball was not only an amazing comedienne, but she was a stunning beauty. Her sense of humor only made her more beautiful,” he told the site. 'This statue looks nothing like the beautiful Lucy we all know. If for no other reason than that... the statue should go.' However, in a letter to the Hollywood Reporter, Poulin admits: From the day of its installation, I have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy’s beauty or my ability as a sculptor. 'In retrospect, it should have never been cast in bronze and made public, and I take complete ownership of that poor decision.' For residents of Celoron, N.Y., say a statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is 'monstrous' The statue is based on a famous moment from Ball's show 'I Love Lucy,' in which she pitches an intoxicating health tonic while drunk . He adds that he offers to return to Celoron and 'remove the current statue with the promise of creating a new beautiful and charming ""Lucy"" in its place.' It would cost an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 for Poulin to recast the statue, according to the Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost. While the organizer said he is a fan of Poulin's work, this time he failed to do his subject justice. 'I think it looks like a monster. That is just my opinion,' he told Yahoo. 'When you see it at night, it is frightening.' The statue depicts Ball during one of her most loved moments on the pioneering show 'I Love Lucy,' her intoxicated pitch for the Vitameatavegamin health tonic. The statue was the latest way the town has tried to honor its most famous resident, with the Jameston area already home to a Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum & Center for Comedy.","The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy!

"A milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the EU to scrap quotas restricting production . A milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the EU to scrap quotas restricting production. The quota system was abolished today after 30 years - allowing dairy farmers to produce as much milk as they like without suffering a financial penalty. The move is expected to drive a spike in production, particularly in countries like Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, who plan to boost exports of milk and other dairy products to the UK. As a result, a price war over the cost of milk is likely to break out, bringing down the price for consumers. However, British farmers are likely to find the price they are paid by supermarkets is driven down, which will be particularly difficult for smaller family businesses. Milk quotas were introduced in 1984 to address the oversupply during the late 1970s and early 1980s that had led to the infamous milk lakes and butter mountains. Farmers who produced above their quota were hit with punishing cash penalties. The new free-for-all will promote dairy factory farms, where super-size Holstein cows have been bred to produce more milk than any calf could drink in order to cut production costs. The industrialisation of dairy farming has seen the number of UK farms producing milk fall from 50,000 to 14,116 over the last 30 years. At the same time the average herd has risen from 64 cows to 134. The average milk production from Holstein dairy cows, which have been labelled ‘udders on legs’, has risen by 55per cent to 7,327 litres per animal per year – around 12,900 pints. In some cases this has been done through selective breeding programmes designed to create supersize cows, which are bulked up with high protein feed and kept inside for much of the year in what are known as ‘zero grazing’ barns. Dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint, making it cheaper than some bottled water. Some dairy processors have starting to raise farm gate prices recently, however farmers remain concerned the end of quotas could bring enormous price swings. Chairman of the dairy board at the National Farmers’ Union, Rob Harrison, has urged all EU countries to act responsibly and collectively in order to manage future volatility. Mr Harrison said: ‘Farmers and dairy processors here do have some concerns about how other EU countries will react to the ending of quotas. ‘Some are rapidly increasing their output without an end market for these goods. With milk prices yet to show any strong signs of recovery, this could push farmgate milk prices down further in the EU, and stall any recovery in the dairy markets. ‘It’s vital that expansion in any Member State is planned in accordance with available market opportunities.’ Dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint, making it cheaper than some bottled water . Mr Harrison said the new freedom could allow British dairy farmers, who are particularly efficient, to win new sales in Europe and around the world, particularly the Far East. He said: ‘We also need UK dairy processors to recognise and promote potential markets both at home and abroad and look to develop new products such as sports drinks.’ The idea of milk being promoted as a sports drink has been given credence by Coca-Cola, which has recently launched its own brand of milk in the United States. The new Fairlife milk costs more than twice as much as regular milk, but the firm believes consumers will pay more on the basis it contains 50per cent more protein and half the sugar. Earlier this week, some European farmer groups mounted a protest over the changes outside the European Parliament in Brussels, which involved a funeral march the lighting of a warning fire. The European Milk Board, a federation of dairy farmers with member organisations from 13 countries, said it was likely that the market would not be able to cope with significantly expanded production in a reasonable way. Its president, Romuald Schaber, said the changes are a particular threat to small dairy farmers, who tend to have higher costs. ‘Chronic price collapses are inevitable, the next crisis is on its way,’ he said. ‘Prices will be rock-bottom, as Europe’s farmers will have even less market power to achieve a cost-covering milk price in the future.’ Maria Heubuch, an MEP for the Greens, warned about the loss of small farmers. ‘Europe could see more factory farms with 1,000, 2,000 or even 5,000 cows, merely providing raw materials for the industry,’ she said. The European Dairy Association, which represents milk processors, has backed the end of quotas. Its Secretary General, Alexander Anton, said: ‘It goes without saying that the end of the quota will lower the administrative burden on all levels. This will naturally further enhance the competitiveness of the whole sector.’ Irish dairy farmers have embarked on a massive expansion plan and will be looking to make big in-roads to the British market. A study by the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) estimated the ending of quotas would create 9,500 extra jobs in Ireland, and at least 1.3 billion euros (£950m) in extra exports. While productions restrictions have been scrapped, the EU will provide a safety net for dairy farmers. Brussels will have the power to buy-in butter and skimmed milk powder at a guaranteed figure if there is over-supply, which will shore up the price.","Quota system abolished so farmers can produce as much milk as they like .

"It appears nowadays that it is not an official holiday until you've uploaded your pictures to Instagram with the intention of letting all those at home know how incredible your time away is. From the food you ate for dinner, to the bags you lovingly packed for the plane, every detail of our 'luxurious' travels can be documented for social media feeds. However sometimes we are guilty of not showing the entire story, and the truth can paint a whole other picture. Scroll down for video . Instagram: The wondrous Great Wall of China (pictured without visitors) weaves its way through the rolling countryside . Reality: Brace yourself to battle your way through your walk, not only physically, but also through the hordes of tourists . The Great Wall of China was created in 500 BC to protect the country's northern border against foreign invasion. While you may have visions of a peaceful stroll along the historic walkway, the truth is you need to be prepared for a slightly different scenario. The wall attracts over 10 million visitors annually so you could be battling your way through the crowds and not just the steep inclines. Instagram: Private planes comes with plenty of legroom and leather interiors, making travel incredible for stars such as Justin Bieber . Reality: Most of us travel with barely any legroom with hundreds of strangers and possibly screaming babies . It is sad to say that flying on a private jet, and on a commercial flight are polar opposite travelling experiences. While it is still fun to get on a plane, with the promise of a holiday on the other side, seeing Instagram pictures from Justin Bieber's luxury spacious aircraft could make us wishing we had won the lottery. Battling with the person in front for their reclining chair not touching your lap, and craning to see the in-flight movie are all part of the fun that comes with the reality of economy flying. Instagram: Beyonce snapped this close-up shot of herself right next to Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa at The Louvre, making us all believe we can get easy front-row access to the painting . Reality: Be prepared to wade through hordes of tourists and avoid getting other cameras in your shot while visiting the Mona Lisa . The Louvre attracts 9.7 million visitors a year, more than any other museum in the world. Despite Beyonce making us all believe we can just stroll up and get a front-row shot, the reality is less than rosy. Huge crowds could be blocking the way between you and the mysterious smile, and it is an art in itself snapping the portrait without getting a few cameras in  shot. Instagram: Russian photographer Murad Osmann follows his stunning girlfriend to the world's most famous sights and landmarks, including the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin . Reality: Walk to the other side of Germany's famous landmark and the traffic of the city somewhat destroys the romance . Brandenburg Gate is the main entrance to the German capital of Berlin and features a picturesque 18th-century neoclassical triumphal arch. Photos posted on Instagram show celebrities strolling up to the iconic structure. But what would make this landmark more appealing would be if it was not surrounded by busy road traffic, and pollution from cars. Instagram: Model Karlie Kloss revealed her essentials for travel on Instagram, perfectly laid out in the X-ray tray at customs . Reality: Not everyone has time to arrange their ultra-stylish hand luggage items neatly as they join long queues to pass through security . Often travel and packing a suitcase can look effortless and sophisticated, when photographs have been carefully selected, with a tactical filter applied. For some, this is the norm, but for others, the sit and zip method of packing, and the rushed cram are the travel scenarios they are most accustomed to. We can all dream of the day we achieve the relaxed and organised packing experience. Instagram: Having roof access to the best partying scenes, overlooking a pool looks easy when you are Khloe Kardashian . Reality: Battling through the crowds to get a drink, surrounded by thousands of other partygoers trying to not get a drink spilt on you . Attending the biggest and best parties in Miami is a challenge, both in getting a ticket to get inside, and surviving once you are there. It can look so easy on Instagram, as Khloe Kardashian showed us, enjoying her time on the roof overlooking the pool. But almost all visitors are crammed onto the floor with heads obstructing their views of the DJ on the stage. Instagram: The glorious Taj Mahal is resplendent, with or without an Instagram filter and the internet is full of spectacular sunset pictures . Reality: Unfortunately, the reality of trying to capture that all-important sunset picture is a little more crowded . It is undeniable that the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, is one of the most beautiful mausoleums in the world. This thought is shared by the three million tourists who go to photograph the iconic landmark. Sadly the outskirts around the temple have less attention than the marble temple, with litter collecting on the banks of the Yamuna River. Instagram: The beautiful Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen looks impressive against a dramatic sky . Reality: If you can push past the crowds you will be able to see the mermaid, which sits at 4.1ft tall . The bronze mermaid statue by sculpture Edvard Eriksen was erected on a rock at the Langelinie promenade in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1913. It was based on the Little Mermaid fairy tale by Danish author Hans Christian Anderson and has drawn a lot of attention over the years. It once had its head sawn off by politically oriented artists of the Situationist movement in 1964, and again by an unknown culprit in 1998. Instagram: Stretching out on the plane while enjoying fine cuisine such a lobster, as you soar to your luxurious holiday . Reality: Plastic trays litter your tray table as you wait for the flight attendant to collect whatever it was you ate . Plane food has never had the reputation of being the best meal travellers have ever had. This is not helped by people snapping the first class alternative, and then applying a filter to make the lobster look even more delicious. Sometime you can't complain though, and getting a meal, whatever it is like, can brighten your flight. Instagram: Colourful and tasty food awaits the intrepid explorer, sampling a slice of culture on their holidays . Reality: Sometimes it is safer to eat at the hotel if you aren't sure what animal it is that is being served at the side of the street . It is great to want to experience as much of another culture as you can while you are there for your visit. Immersing yourself in the local markets and sampling the cuisine can seem like a good place to start. While a lot of tasty delicacies can be found, you will inevitably stumble upon a questionable dish at some stage, that will make you crave something safer. Instagram: Pop star Rihanna gets up close and personal with a giraffe at a zoo . Reality: Sometimes the encounter is too close for comfort if you are lucky enough to approach an animal in an enclosure . Getting to see animals close up at the zoo is rare on a busy day. However if you do have an encounter with the animals, you could be hoping for an experience like Rihanna's, who met a giraffe and posted a snap on her Instagram account. Sadly sometimes the animals have other ideas and you can be faced with a less than dignified situation. Instagram: Girl group The Saturdays posted this photo of their tour bus, which has plush leather interiors and flat-screen televisions . Reality: Waiting in a queue of tired explorers, wondering who you will be sat next to, and praying your seat is not next to the toilet . Celebrities make transport seem easy, with luxurious tour buses or limousines waiting to take them to their next destination. For the rest of us, public coaches can be the cheapest way to reach our holidays. Sadly stretching out with flat screen TVs is not the norm in this case. Instagram: An exotic shot of the famous pyramids while sat on a camel for an authentic desert feel . Reality: Take a short trip from the bustling city to see the landmarks, or see it from Pizza Hut, which is located nearby . It is easy to give the impression of a long camel ride to the pyramids in Egypt. What some people don't realise is they are actually located just on the edge of the busy city. Furthermore, a Pizza Hut is located across from pyramids in Giza.","Tactical filters used on the mobile phone app Instagram can paint a different picture of holiday  away .

"Gloating as he relaxes with his AK-47, these pictures show an al-Qaeda commander relaxing inside a palace in Yemen just days after terrorists liberated him from prison. Khalid Saeed Batarfi was a senior leader with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) before he was jailed by Yemeni officials. Two days ago he was freed, along with 300 other inmates, as the terrorist group stormed the prison he was being held in, killing two guards. Scroll down for video . Khalid Saeed Batarfi poses for photographs inside the governor's palace in Mukalla, Yemen, days after he was released from prison by terrorists . Batarfi is among AQAP's top regional commanders, known for his leading role in a 2011-2012 battle with government troops during which extremists seized large parts of the south and east of Yemen. Pictures posted online today show the high-ranking terrorist grinning as he sits in the governor's palace in the city of Mukalla, pretending to be on the telephone as he wields an assault rifle. A second photograph shows Batarfi standing on a Yemeni flag in the abandoned building. The militants stormed the Central Prison of Mukalla with machine guns and rocket launchers during a midnight raid on Thursday.

After taking over the prison and freeing a number of members of AQAP, the terrorists overran government buildings and the city's port. According to CBS, AQAP Twitter accounts tweeted after the prison raid: 'All the brothers have been liberated, including Sheikh Batarfi who is now amongst his brothers, all praise to Allah.' Mukalla was previously under control of forces loyal to President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, however it is not clear what resistance to the terrorists remains after he fled the capital Sana'a to Saudi Arabia as rebels launched an attack on his palace.","Khalid Saeed Batarfi was freed from a Yemeni prison by al-Qaeda this week .

"They may not be the most glamourous of scientific instruments, but tampons could help experts clean up polluted rivers. Engineers believe the super absorbent properties of tampons could be used to detect pipes that shunt sewage into streams instead of treatment plants. They found that the cotton products absorb chemicals commonly used on toilet paper, laundry detergents and shampoos, which glow under UV light, meaning that they could shed light on previously undetectable misplumbed pathways. Engineers believe the super absorbent properties of tampons could be used to detect pipes that shunt sewage into streams instead of treatment plants. Here, a discharge pipe dumps raw sewage into a river . It’s estimated that around five per cent of homes in the UK have pipes that are misconnected, causing them to leak sewage. Professor David Lerner, who led the study at the University of Sheffield's Faculty of Engineering, explained: ‘More than a million homes have their waste water incorrectly connected into the surface water network, which means their sewage is being discharged into a river, rather than going to a treatment plant. ‘Unfortunately, it's very difficult to detect where this is happening, as the discharge is intermittent, can't always be seen with the naked eye and existing tests are complex and expensive’ But now his team have shown that tampons can glow in ultra-violet (UV) light, because they absorb chemicals found in products containing ‘optical brighteners’ which are used to whiten and brighten colours. Experts think tampons (pictured left) could be a cheap solution to detecting pollutants in rivers. On the right,  Professor Lerner tests for sewage pollution in a stream in Sheffield, UK, using a conductivity and temperature meter - a more expensive but less effective method than using tampons and UV lighting . Tampons absorb chemicals commonly used on toilet paper, laundry detergents (pictured with a stock image) and shampoos, which glow under UV light, meaning that they could shed light on previously undetectable mis-plumbed pathways . Engineers have shown that tampons can glow in ultra-violet (UV) light, because they absorb chemicals found in products containing ‘optical brighteners’ which are used to whiten and brighten colours. Optical brighteners are found in toilet paper, laundry detergents and shampoos. Lab trials determined that just five seconds exposure in a solution containing 0.01ml of detergent per litre of water - over 300 times more dilute than would be expected in a surface water pipe – enabled a tampon to glow for 30 days. Therefore, if a tampon is dunked in a river and glows under UV afterwards, experts can be sure there are pollutants in it. By using this technique at the opening of different pipes, they can trace the source of the sewage to certain households so that pipes dumping sewage into rivers can be redirected. When tampons are suspended in water contaminated by even very small amounts of detergents or sewage, they will pick up these ‘optical brighteners’ and glow. ‘The main difficulty with detecting sewage pollution by searching for optical brighteners is finding cotton that does not already contain these chemicals,’ Professor Lerner said. ‘That's why tampons, being explicitly untreated, provide such a neat solution. Our new method may be unconventional - but it's cheap and it works.’ Lab trials determined that just five seconds exposure in a solution containing 0.01ml of detergent per litre of water - over 300 times more dilute than would be expected in a surface water pipe – enabled a tampon to glow for 30 days. The technique was then trialled in the field by suspending tampons for three days in sixteen surface water outlets running into streams and rivers in Sheffield and then testing the tampons under UV light. The scientists found that nine of the tampons glowed, confirming the presence of optical brighteners - and therefore sewage pollution. With the help of Yorkshire Water, the team followed the pipe network back from four of the nine polluted outlets they'd identified, dipping a tampon in at each manhole to see where the sewage was entering the system. This enabled them to successfully isolate the sections of each network where the sewage originated, narrowing down the households which would need to be inspected in more detail. A visual inspection in one area immediately revealed a house where both a sink and soil stack were connected to the wrong sewer, according to the results of the study, which were published in Water and Environment Journal. The technique was then trialled in the field by suspending tampons for three days in sixteen surface water outlets running into streams and rivers in Sheffield and then testing the tampons under UV light. This image shows a 'scum' caused by detergent in the Peak District National Park . When tampons are suspended in water contaminated by even very small amounts of detergents or sewage, they will pick up ‘optical brighteners’ and glow under UV light. Here, fluorescent powders glow under UV light . Professor Lerner said: ‘Often the only way to be sure a house is misconnected is through a dye test - putting dye down a sink or toilet and seeing where the coloured water appears in the sewer.’ ‘It's clearly impractical for water companies to do this for all the households they supply, but by working back from where pollution is identified and narrowing it down to a particular section of the network, the final step of identifying the source then becomes feasible.’ Pollutants found in domestic waste water change the bacterial and invertebrate life in rivers, encouraging pollutant tolerant species and leading to the build-up of 'sewage fungus', which is visible as a grey lining to the river bed. Waste water discharges can also carry pathogens such as norovirus. Most misconnected households are unaware they are discharging their waste water into the wrong system and - once it has been identified - immediately rectify the problem. Local authorities do have the power to complete the work and charge it back to the householder, but in practice, this power is rarely used. Now that Professor Lerner has proved his method works in practice in the field, he hopes to trial it at a larger scale to identify all the sources of sewage pollution on the Bradford Beck, the river which runs through the city of Bradford.","Engineers at the University of Sheffield made the discovery .

"V Stiviano showed off two new accessories while enjoying lunch in Los Angeles on Thursday. The 32-year-old was seen with an older male companion and some new braces on her already straight teeth while dining al fresco. This just days before a judge will decide if she must hand over $2.8million in gifts she received from her ex, embattled former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Scroll down video . V Stiviano (above) showed off new braces while out to lunch Thursday . She was joined for the male by an older male companion (above) Stiviano and her friend enjoyed lunch at Il Pastaio, a favorite of the Kardashians . On Thursday however, Stiviano and her new friend, whose idnetity is not yet known, enjoyed some food at Il Pastaio in Beverly Hills. The Italian restaurant, owned by chef Giacomino Drago, is known for its celebrity clientele, and is a favorite of stars including the Hiltons and Kardashians. Stiviano was also showing off a new hairstyle for the outing as well, with her normally straight hair very curly and looking particularly full. She also appeared to receive a present from her gentleman friend at one point, pulling something out of a pink bag. Meanwhile, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge is set to decide if Stiviano must return gifts to her ex Sterlung after he and his wife Shelly took her to court. Shelly laid out some of the items in a court document, including a $1.8million home, $1.2million in cash, $400,000 in cars and even a $12 lace thong. The couple want back the house and another $1million. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Donald Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers basketball games. In the furor sparked when the remarks were made public, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2billion. The identity of Stiviano's male companion is not yet known . She also appeared to receive a present from her gentleman friend at one point, pulling something out of a pink bag . This just days before a judge will decide if she must hand over $2.8million in gifts she received from her ex, embattled former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling . Stiviano testified last week that the 80-year-old billionaire real estate mogul spent far more time with her and members of her family during the two and a half years she spent as his personal assistant, driver and confidante than he did with his own wife and children. ‘We were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual. He became my everything and I became his all,’ she said, though she repeated under oath that the relationship was never sexual in nature. She also said; ‘The real Donald Sterling is a con artist, a bigot ... he's mean, he's despicable,’ Stiviano replied, before quickly adding that to her, he was ‘kind, loving, sweet ... a mentor, a father. ... He treated me as he treated no one else.’ She added that tolerating his racist moments was 'part of the job' that had its rewards in the way he treated her and her family. Stiviano broke down in tears as she described the Clippers owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boys. Shelly, who accused Stiviano of fraud in her testimony, painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and is now out to hurt him.","V Stiviano showed off new braces while out to lunch Thursday at Il Pastaio in Beverly Hills .

"Ian Walters, 51, allegedly killed his wife Tracy by deliberately driving their truck into a tree at 84mph . A church treasurer accused of murdering his wife deliberately veered his 4x4 off the M1 causing it to explode as it hit trees, a court heard today. Leicester Crown Court was told that two dogs and suitcases were also thrown out of the pick-up truck being driven by Ian Walters as it crashed into a line of trees near Markfield, Leicestershire. Yesterday the court was told that his wife, Tracy Walters, died after making a flurry of calls to police about sex-obsessed husband in the days leading up to the M1 crash, including one that morning. Prosecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse. Walters, 51, denies the murder of his wife, who died in hospital two days after the high-speed crash. A jury of nine women and three men was told yesterday that Walters, of  Swindon, was returning home with his wife from a 'make-or-break' week away in North Yorkshire which ended in an argument. Giving evidence to the second day of Walters' trial, several witnesses described how passing motorists went to aid the couple, both trapped in the wreckage of the 4x4. The first witness, Robin Goss, told jurors the driver of the pick-up appeared to have made a 'conscious, deliberate' decision to steer towards the hard shoulder. Mr Goss, a 39-year-old training consultant from Buckinghamshire, told jurors he was up to 150 metres behind the L200, doing around 70mph in the inside lane. 'Everything was normal,' Mr Goss told the court. 'Then all of a sudden I saw this car just swerve violently across to the left. 'It completely disappeared and I remember looking into the hard shoulder. Then I saw what looked like a little explosion. 'Bits of tree and bits of plastic came out in front of me. When I saw the dogs, I started to put together what had happened.' Child protection worker Gary Donald, who was driving a Kia Picanto on the southbound carriageway, also gave evidence to the court about the crash on March 21 last year. He told jurors he saw the pick-up veer sharply from right to left - performing 'almost a straight turn' - and move towards a line of trees. The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard . 'The canopy of all the trees shook - I would use the word 'imploded' - and there was luggage, bits of car, and parts of tree flying into the air,' Mr Donald said. Under questioning from defence QC Christopher Millington, Mr Donald agreed that time-lapse CCTV footage of the L200 showed a 'rather less dramatic' veer than he had described to the court. Witness Steven Prince, a passenger in a Range Rover which stopped at the scene, told how he attempted to reassure Mrs Walters before she was cut free. Giving his recollection on the aftermath of the crash, Mr Prince told the jury panel he did not witness the moment of impact but had seen a cloud of dust. 'I looked left and I saw two dogs out where they shouldn't be and I saw the car that was already in the tree.' After the crash, the metalwork of the vehicle had to be 'unpeeled' from around Mrs Walters by emergency crews, the court was told . The Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crash . Prosecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse . After getting out of his mother's car, Mr Prince said, he ran along the hard shoulder towards the crashed vehicle. 'The car was a hell of a mess,' Mr Prince added. 'I didn't bother looking at the driver's side because I thought whoever was in there was going to be squashed.' The court heard that the witness then made his way to the passenger side of the vehicle, where he saw a hand sticking out of the wreckage. He said: 'She said she was dying. I told her she would be alright and that I wasn't going anywhere, just to calm her down and make her feel at ease as much as I could.' Prosecutor Charles Miskin QC asked Mr Prince if Mrs Walters, who was aged 48, had said anything else. 'No, other than that she couldn't breathe,' Mr Prince replied. 'She kept on telling me that and she kept on saying that she was dying.' The trial, which may last for up to a month, was adjourned until next week.

"A noose was discovered hanging from a tree at Duke University outside a building that houses several offices focused on diversity on the campus. The disgusting symbol of racial hatred is now under investigation by Duke University and the police who are attempting to work out who hung the rope on the tree. Police said the thin yellow rope was tied into a noose at about 2 a.m. Wednesday on  the Bryan Center plaza in Durham, North Carolina. Disgusting: Officials said the rope was tied into a noose at about 2 a.m. in the Bryan Center plaza in Durham North Carolina . The area in which the noose was found is home to several offices focused on diversity including the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity and the Center for Multicultural Affairs. Larry Moneta, Duke's vice president for student affairs said in an email to students that anyone found responsible for 'committing this act of intimidation' would be held accountable. She wrote: 'To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect.' 'Today, fear will be among the reactions students, and especially, students of color, will have. Be assured that the Duke community will provide all the support necessary to help us all get through this. 'In time, each of these cowardly acts of bias and hatred will strengthen our resolve to love and support each other.' Duke University students took to social media sites to discuss the issue, with many believing it was  racially motivated. On twitter, @DPickett12 wrote: 'They're still hanging nooses from trees.....

Students chanted: 'We are not afraid we stand together,' according to a tweet by Amanda Lamb from WRAL . However, the incident comes just two weeks after  students allegedly chanted a racist song at a black female student. The race hate incident led Duke President Richard Brodhead and Provost Sally Kornbluth to send an email to the student body affirming the university's commitment to racial equality. It also spawned the creation of a group called The Duke People of Color Caucus which released a statement on Tumblr along with a photo of the noose. The statement read: 'To all black students, staff, faculty, and/or Durhamites on campus and in the area: Please take care of yourselves and each other. 'This campus is not a safe space, and has proven beyond any doubt that it is a hostile environment for any and all black people.' School spokesman Keith Lawrence said both Duke administrators and the police are now carrying out an investigation. University and student leaders have scheduled a forum for 5 p.m. Wednesday on the steps of Duke Chapel. Speakers will include President Richard Brodhead. Duke has about 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students. It costs about $60,000 a year to attend as an undergraduate, including room and board, according to the school's website. About half of all undergraduate students receive financial aid. @cierane tweeted: 'The fact that black students at Duke pay $60,000 a year and constantly feel unsafe on campus is ridiculous.'","Duke officials are attempting to work out who hung the noose on the tree .

"The Boy Scouts' New York chapter said Thursday that it has hired the nation's first openly gay Eagle Scout as a summer camp leader, which is in public contrast to the national scouting organization's ban on openly gay adult members. The Boy Scouts' Greater New York Councils said they hired Pascal Tessier, an 18-year-old Eagle Scout who has been a vocal advocate of opening the 105-year-old organization to gay scouts and leaders. Board member Richard G. Mason said the councils see Tessier as 'an exemplary candidate for employment as a camp leader.' Scroll down for video . Boy Scout Pascal Tessier, 18, center left, and his brother Lucien Tessier, 20, who had earned the rank of Eagle Scout, pose for a portrait with their parents, Oliver Tessier, left, and Tracie Felker, at their home. On Thursday the Boy Scouts New York chapter announced it hired Pascal Tessier as the nation's first openly gay Eagle Scout as a summer camp leader . 'We welcome him,' Mason said in a statement. The Boy Scouts of America didn't immediately respond to an inquiry about the hire. The national organization changed its policy in 2013 to allow openly gay kids as scouts, but not adults as leaders, after a bitter debate over its membership policy. The change took effect in January 2014. Advocates for letting gays participate in scouting hailed Tessier's hire. 'This is a watershed moment,' Zach Wahls, executive director of Scouts for Equality, said in a statement. 'We are proud to see such an important Boy Scout council standing up for the full inclusion of gay members.' When the national Boy Scouts began allowing gay boys as scouts, liberal Scout leaders and gay rights groups celebrated the shift but called for allowing gay adults to participate, too. Conservatives involved with the Scouts, including some churches that sponsor troops, decried letting any gays — including kids — participate, and some threatened to defect if the ban were lifted. The Boy Scouts of America has said it doesn't ""proactively inquire"" about members' sexual orientation — in effect, a form of 'don't ask, don't tell.' Tessier's hiring is in contrast to the national scouting organizationís ban on openly gay adult members . But it has expelled adults who were open about it, including a gay troop leader in Seattle who was removed last year after he disclosed his orientation during a TV interview. Regardless, some local Boy Scout councils have let it be known they are open to gay employees, but the New York councils' move presents an unusually acute departure from the national policy. The 103-year-old New York group says it has never denied membership to a youth or adult based on sexual orientation, and it didn't want its policy to be affected by the national group's stance. The New York councils serve over 46,000 scouts. Tessier achieved scouting's highest rank last year after being one of the most prominent openly gay scouts speaking out to change the ban on gay participation. The Kensington, Maryland, teen said then he was relieved finally to have his Eagle badge approved by the Scouts' national headquarters in Irving, Texas. 'Even if I had been kicked out along the way, I wouldn't have changed anything,' he said. 'The whole experience was something worth having, not only for myself but also for all the other people involved — and for all the people it affects.'","The Boy Scouts' Greater New York Councils said they hired Pascal Tessier, an 18-year-old Eagle Scout .

"Police in California have released surveillance images of a man who robbed a bank dressed in women's clothing - leading investigators to compare his outfit with Mrs Doubtfire. The eccentrically-disguised man entered a branch of the U.S Bank in the city of Santa Cruz at around 3pm last Friday and handed the cashier a note demanding money. His blonde wig, female clothing, glasses and purse immediately prompted comparisons with Mrs Doubtfire from the 1993 movie of the same name in which Robin Williams played a divorcee who dresses as an elderly female nanny to spend more time with his children. Cross-dresser: The eccentrically-disguised man entered a branch of the U.S Bank in the city of Santa Cruz at around 3pm last Friday and handed the cashier a note demanding money . Santa Cruz Police Department released the surveillance images yesterday as they stepped up their efforts to find the cross-dressing bankrobber. The 25 to 35-year-old man made off with an unknown sum of money after the U.S. Bank employee responded to his demand without raising the alarm. No weapon was used or mentioned during the robber and nobody was injured, according to the San Jose Mercury. Authorities searched the area around the bank shortly afterwards, but he was not found. Lieutenant Bernie Escalante said a man wearing exactly the same outfit had been seen 'acting suspiciously' outside a nearby Rabobank roughly an hour before the U.S. Bank robbery. Rabobank staff went out to speak to the man and he left the area without incident, Escalante said. Uncanny: The bankrobber's blonde wig, female clothing and spectacles prompted comparisons with Mrs Doubtfire from the 1993 movie of the same name starring the late Robin Williams . Santa Cruz police said the man appeared to be aged between 25 and 35, was about five foot five inches tall and weighed 160-170 pounds. He was described as having dark skin and wore prescription glasses and a wavy blonde wig. His outfit was listed as navy blue hospital scrubs with a light-purple long-sleeved shirt underneath. 'We believe these are great photos of the suspect, and somebody in the community has to recognize this person,' Lt Escalante said as he urged anyone with information to contact his officers. Mrs Doubtfire was released in 1993 to mixed reviews from critics but was a massive box office hit - only falling behind Jurassic Park as the highest-grossing film of the year.

"Family members and friends have been left heartbroken and baffled after an 18-year-old high school senior died suddenly on Tuesday, just hours after feeling ill. Madison Small, from Ashburn, Virginia, left school early on Monday and, after she woke up in the night with a severe headache, she was rushed to hospital. By Tuesday afternoon, her father, Tim Small, had contacted the Broad Run High School to let staff know that his youngest daughter had passed away that morning. The Virginia Medical Examiner's office is now investigating her death and an autopsy has been ordered, but no cause has yet been given. Loss: Madison Small, pictured, passed away suddenly on Tuesday morning after feeling ill on Monday; the Virginia Medical Examiner is looking into the cause of her death but so far a diagnosis has not been given . Mr Small told WUSA9 that the family has also not received a diagnosis for his daughter's illness. He said she had seemed the picture of health over the weekend, when they played catch together. The medical examiner said it would likely take at least a week to determine what had killed her. Her close friend Devan Rook told the Washington Post that she had thought nothing of it when her friend went to the school nurse on Monday afternoon. 'Didn't think anything was wrong with her,' she said. 'In the middle of the night, she woke up complaining of headaches and stuff, and they took her to [Inova] Loudoun Hospital and realized it was pretty serious. 'They couldn't handle it there, so they medevac-ed her over to [Inova Fairfax Hospital]. At that point, she wasn't doing too well, and several of her organs were shutting down.' Public Health and school district officials said they do not have reason to believe her illness poses a risk to other students, particularly because last week was spring break, WUSA9 reported. Loved: Madison's family said she was otherwise healthy when her health suddenly declined on Monday . Family: Her father Tim Small, pictured center, spoke at a candle-lit vigil held for the teenager on Tuesday evening. Madison is pictured left with her older siblings and parents . On Tuesday night, just hours after news of their her death, hundreds of friends, classmates and family gathered for a candle-lit vigil at the school. Friends remembered Small as a talented softball player who had happily mentored younger members of the team. She was also excited about starting Virginia Tech in the fall, they said. School Principal Dave Spage, who broke the news to parents in an email on Tuesday, said he thought there were as many as 400 or 500 people at the vigil, which he said 'speaks to her circle and her involvement here', NBC reported. Madison's father, who also has an older daughter and son with his wife, spoke to those who had gathered. 'Life can be short, we found that out today,' he said. 'Make the most of it: love each other. Don't get bogged down in the little nitpicky crap. Put that aside. Life's too short.' Remembered: Hundreds of people gathered for a candle-lit vigil following Madison's death on Tuesday . Support: Her varsity softball teammates wear their jerseys and line 2nd base as a tribute to Madison . Vigil: Friends lit candles as they shared memories of the beloved 18-year-old on Tuesday . Memorial: Classmates places flowers on Madison's desk after she was taken fatally ill . In a Facebook post shared widely between Madison's friends online, she wrote a touching post in 2011, quoting Winnie The Pooh. 'If there's a tomorrow when we're not together, there's something you must always remember,' she wrote, beneath a smiling photo of herself. 'You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is even if we're apart, I'll always be with you.' Counselors will be at the school to help students, Spage said.","Madison Small woke up feeling ill on Monday night so was rushed to hospital, but her organs began shutting down and she died on Tuesday .

"A pigeon-lover from Utah has had a giant aviary in his backyard torn down following a three-year legal battle with the city council. Boris Majnaric, 75, of South Jordan, built the 384-sq-ft, four-room bird house in 1996 and went on to rear more than 200 birds - five times over the legal limit. Over the years neighbors filed a torrent of complaints about the pigeons, detailing excess droppings and noise and last Tuesday the structure was finally demolished. Majnaric, who was so fond of his flock he once delivered CPR to an ailing member, was not present for the demolition. Heartache: In this Tuesday, March 31, photo workers clean out and begin to tear down a pigeon loft in 75-year-old Boris Majnaric's backyard in South Jordan, Utah . The retired middle school French teacher told The Deseret News that his doctor advised him to stay away from his home to 'avoid  stress' as he'd recently been hospitalized for pulmonary problems. When officials told Majnaric the birds had to go, he spent more than $40,000 fighting the city in court. But in late March, a district judge did not sign an order to stop the demolition. 'I will feel very incomplete because pigeons have been part of my life,' said Majnaric, who is also facing three misdemeanor charges related to his backyard birds. 'It's going to be an empty thing for me,' he said. 'I don't think it's fair what they've done to me.' His conflict with the city began about four years ago, when neighbors noticed an explosion of pigeons and complained to the city about the birds 'dropping things' on their property. Kathy Brown, who lives across the street from Majnaric, said the birds didn't bother her. 'The pigeons are his children. He's taken good care of them,' she said. 'I feel for him, but you have to obey the laws, too.' On Tuesday, the flocks of pigeons were replaced with South Jordan animal control offices and public work employees who gathered to watch the loft come down. Yellow caution tape lined Majnaric's yard and Utah Disaster Kleenup removed pigeon droppings and prepared to dismantle the structure. The city has also given Majnaric 30 days to relocate a gazebo that served as a roosting place for dozens of the birds. City officials say they decided to take down the loft after Majnaric failed to comply with multiple court orders to reduce his yard's pigeon population. 'We really, really tried to work with him and get the population under control,' said South Jordan spokeswoman Tina Brown. All gone: Majnaric is distraught after city officials tore down his backyard house built to house 200 pigeons _ five times as many as allowed under city rules . But she said the numbers never went down to the level they agreed upon. Majnaric agreed last summer to move the loft and gazebo himself to a house in Cottonwood Heights, said John Walsh, his attorney. But his structures didn't meet the zoning requirements there. Majnaric stopped keeping pigeons in mid-January, although some still visit his yard. He traveled to California and Oregon to find homes for some of his pigeons, spending thousands of dollars to move them. Some of his favorites are starting a new life on a farm. 'This is how much I love these birds,' said Majnaric of the cost the lawsuits and relocation. 'I wanted to defend them.' Majnaric said raising pigeons fulfilled a childhood dream. His parents gave him two birds in his native Croatia when he was 12 years old and he said he cried when they died.","Boris Majnaric, 75, of South Jordan, built the 384-sq-ft, four-room bird house in 1996 and went on to rear more than 200 birds .

"Thinking about vacating the White House  probably isn't President Obama's favorite thing to do, but it isn't his impending departure that stresses him the most - it's the prospect of his eldest daughter leaving 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and heading off to college that really gets him down. Malia Obama, 16, is already visiting colleges in preparation for when she heads to school in the fall of 2016. She hasn't even finished high school, but President Obama said the thought of her heading off to college has him crying on a daily basis.

Can't let her go: The 11th grade student (left) is already visiting schools and will go to college in the fall of 2016 . So sad: President Obama said he's 'sad' and he 'starts tearing up in the middle of the day and I can't explain it' He said on Tuesday during the Easter Prayer Breakfast: 'I start tearing up in the middle of the day and I can't explain it, why am I so sad? 'They're leaving me.' The 11th grade student, who attends the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., has already visited at UC Berkeley, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Harvard, Brown, Princeton, Yale and Wesleyan, the Washington Post reported. Malia's younger sister Sasha, 13, won't start thinking about college for a few years yet. Obama continued: 'I want to thank everybody here for their prayers, which means so much to me and Michelle, particularly at a time when my daughters are starting to grow up and starting to go on college visits. 'I need prayer.' Thankfully: Malia's (right) younger sister Sasha, 13 (center), won't start thinking about college for a few years yet . If Malia attends Columbia for an undergraduate degree, she will be following in her father's footsteps. However, based on comments he made in February when he addressed a cybersecurity summit on Stanford's  campus in Palo Alto, California, President Obama might want his daughter to go there. President Obama said of Stanford: 'I've got to admit, like, I kind of want to go here. 'I was trying to figure out why it is that a really nice place like this is wasted on young people who don't fully appreciate what you got. 'It's really nice. And everybody here is so friendly and smart, and it's beautiful. And what's there not to like?' 'Let's face it, I like Stanford grads.' The last president to send a child straight from the White House to college, Bill Clinton, sent daughter Chelsea to Stanford in the fall of 1997 to begin her freshman year. When she graduated in 2001, Bill and wife Hillary Rodham Clinton were there blowing kisses.

"An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed. The drug was developed by the British pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca with the original aim of treating certain types of tumour, but was shelved after it proved ineffective. Scientists at Yale University in Connecticut in the US have revealed how the treatment, called AZDO5030, restored memory in mice given Alzheimer's disease. An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed (file picture) The drug worked by blocking a process that breaks nerve connections in the brain used to store memory. Researchers say the study has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of the drug in Alzheimer's patients. Stephen Strittmatter, the author of the report, published in Annals of Neurology, said: 'With this treatment, cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation, and the animal’s memory, which was lost during the course of the disease, comes back. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health which launched a programme to test failed drugs on different diseases. Mr Strittmatter and his co-author Christopher van Dyck have already started a 'multi-site clinical trial' to determine whether the drug can also benefit Alzheimer's patients. According to the Alzheimer's Society, there are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain - a figure that includes 40,000 younger people. The charity estimates that 60,000 deaths are attributable to dementia every year and that there will be one million people with the disease in the UK by 2025. It reports that the financial cost of dementia to the UK is £26billion a year. The Daily Express reports the charity's head of research Dr James Pickett as giving the latest treatment a cautious welcome. He said: 'Drug development can take decades, so repurposing pre-existing drugs for dementia is a promising avenue to find new treatments as they have been shown to be safe to use in people and can lead to clinical trials sooner. 'As we learn more about the causes of dementia, there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia.'","Drug called AZDO5030 originally designed to treat certain types of tumour .

"A teenager who received a life-saving heart transplant two years ago after initially being denied because of his bad behavior has died following a high-speed car chase with police. Anthony Stokes, 17, died on Tuesday after he crashed a stolen Honda into a pole as he fled the scene of an attempted burglary at an elderly woman's home in Roswell, Georgia. His death comes less than two years after he was given a second chance at life following a heart transplant at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. The boy, from Decatur, suffered from a dilated cardiomyopathy so his heart was unable to pump enough blood. The condition can lead to irregular heartbeats, blood clots or heart failure. Scroll down for video . Killed: Anthony Stokes, pictured, died on Tuesday afternoon as he fled police after allegedly breaking in to a home in Georgia. He is pictured right in a mug shot from a January arrest . Life-saving: When he was 15 (pictured), Stokes received a transplant. His story made headlines after the boy was initially refused a transplant because doctors said he would not be compliant with the treatment . He had been given just six to nine months to live but the hospital initially refused to put him on the waiting list for a new organ because they thought he would be 'non-compliant' with the treatment. Patients can be disqualified from getting a transplant if a hospital doubts they'll stick to the medication regimen after the operation. At the time, the hospital said that Stokes had failed to take his medication in the past, so his history of non-compliance meant he was not put on the waiting list. But family and friends alleged that his low school grades and brushes with the law were the real reason he had been ruled out. Stokes' mother, Melencia Hamilton, told reporters  that her son, who wore a court-ordered monitoring device, had been stereotyped as a troubled teen. Following pressure from national media coverage, the boy's family and civil rights groups, the hospital backpedaled in August 2013, and the teenager received a new heart. 'After reviewing the situation, they said Anthony would be placed on the list for a heart transplant and that he would be first in line, due to his weakened heart condition,' spokesman Mark Bell said. Video courtesy of CBS46.com . Deadly: He crashed this stolen Honda into a pole as he fled from police in Roswell on Tuesday afternoon . Scene: He hit a woman and crashed into a SunTrust Bank sign (pictured) and later died in hospital . Violent: He is also believed to have carried out an attempted robbery at an elderly woman's home before the deadly crash. During the robbery, the intruder fired at the woman, leaving this bullet hole in the wall . In 2013, the Orlando Sentinel reported that the average cost of a heart transplant is between $550,000 and $650,000. That year, 63 Georgia patients received a heart transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Just six of those were between the ages of 11 and 17. The hospital that carried out the transplant, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, had long been quiet about the surgery and its cost - citing patient privacy laws - and declined to comment on Wednesday, saying only: 'We are deeply saddened by this loss.' Photographs on Stokes' Facebook page show him shirtless with a large scar to his chest from the surgery. Other images show him pointing a firearm at the camera or holding up wads of cash. On January 10 this year, he was arrested and charged with possession of tools for the commission of a crime and criminal attempt, according to DeKalb County jail, and he was released from jail on February 3 after posting $5,000 bond. Then on Tuesday, Stokes put on a mask and allegedly kicked in an elderly woman's door in Roswell and shot at her after finding her watching television inside, police told CBS46. She fled to a back bedroom and was unharmed but bullet holes could be seen in her walls and a black car was seen fleeing from the scene . Stokes is pictured pointing a gun and holding cash in multiple photographs on his Facebook page . Police responding to a nearby call spotted a car that matched its description and took chase. With police on his tail, Stokes clipped a car on an intersection and hurtled towards the curb - knocking down a 33-year-old woman before smashing into SunTrust Bank sign and wrapping the car around its pole, Officer Lisa Holland said. The injured pedestrian, Clementina Hernandez, is in good condition in hospital but Stokes passed away after he was cut from the car and taken to hospital. The crash remains under investigation. The vehicle had been reported missing from Dunwoody so Dunwoody Police are also involved in the investigation. Channel 2 recalled how, back in 2013, Stokes had said he was excited that the heart transplant would give him a second chance at life. 'So I can live a second chance,' he said. 'Get a second chance and do things I want to do.'","Anthony Stokes died on Tuesday after he crashed a stolen car into a pole while fleeing from the scene of an attempted burglary in Roswell, Georgia .

"This garden gnome might not look like much but he is now worth £17,000 – with a little help from his friends. The cardboard gnome was signed by all four members of the Beatles after starring on the iconic cover of the Fab Four's 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Cardboard cutouts or waxworks of more than 60 celebrities including Bob Dylan and Marlon Brando were on the cover picture, which was the brainchild of artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth and photographer Michael Cooper. The cardboard gnome was signed by all four members of the Beatles after starring on the iconic cover of the Fab Four's 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band . The tiny cardboard gnome is next to the legs of George Harrison, who is wearing red on the album's cover art . The gnome is next to the legs of George Harrison, who is wearing red on the album art. Following the shoot on March 30, 1967, Mr Cooper's photography assistant was given the 20-inch tall cardboard gnome as a souvenir by the band, who each signed it. The model has emerged for sale almost 50 years later after being listed for auction by a private collector. Auctioneers in the US have valued the gnome, which has some water damage, at about £17,000. Dean Harmeyer, of Heritage Auctions, said: 'This is a true rarity and a cornerstone piece of any Beatles collection.' The album cover ended up being so extravagant that the final cost of producing the artwork was £3,000 - a whopping £50,000 in today's money. The front and back of the gnome were then mounted alongside an unopened copy of the Sgt Pepper's vinyl LP. 'Designer Peter Blake worked with the Beatles to stage the cover of Sgt. Pepper's, which was filled with life-size cardboard likenesses of famous figures - Mae West, Bob Dylan, Marlon Brando - behind the Beatles,' Mr. Harmeyer explained. The Gnome has been valued at £1,700 and was singed by all four members of the band after the shoot . On the shoot: Assistants organise the set for the artwork which cost £3,000 - the equivalent of £50,000 today . 'At the end of the cover session on March 30, 1967, the gnome was chosen as a memento by an assistant to cover photographer Michael Cooper, and it was signed by the Beatles immediately following the shoot. 'The gnome is in two parts - both front and back were created by Blake for the shoot, and presumably joined together, which may explain the small holes at the top and bottom of each. 'The Beatles have all signed the back in the lower, lighter portion in green marker. 'There appears to have been a liquid spill to on the back after the signing, which has affected the Ringo and John signatures.

"Builders in Turkey have accidentally found one of the largest and most complex underground cities in the otherworldly region of Cappadocia. The area is famous for its stunning rock formations, deep valleys and ancient subterranean hideouts, which have been carved from volcanic ash rock. The latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in Cappadocia, consisting of 3.5 miles (7km) of tunnels, secret churches, tombs and safe havens. Scroll down for video . Builders in Turkey have accidentally found one of the largest and most complex underground cities in the otherworldly region of Cappadocia.  The city lies beneath the Nevşehir fortress (pictured). Three entrances to the impressive complex can be seen, leading to vast, winding tunnels . The subterranean city dates back around 5,000 years and was discovered when builders saw signs of a massive network of tunnels while moving mounds of Earth. It lies beneath the Nevşehir fortress and the surrounding area, which was being excavated during a construction project carried out by Turkey's Housing Development Administration (TOKİ). The multilevel settlement is likely to include living spaces, kitchens, wineries, chapels, staircases, according to a report in National Geographic. The find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement.

The latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in Cappadocia, consisting of 3.5 miles (7km) of tunnels, secret churches, tombs and safe havens. Scientists have yet to discover all its secret passages . Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations. Millions of years ago, volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash. Erosion then created a landscape of rock formations and spires known as 'fairy chimneys.' The volcanic rock, or 'tuff,' was soft and highly malleable, and proved ideal building material. The idea for underground cities came during the Byzantine-era when residents used them as hideouts when threatened by invasion by the Persians, Arabs and Seljuq Turks. The latest find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement.

"Lauren Crawley was given a new platinum implant . Facial palsy, or weakness of the facial muscles, can stop the patient's eyelids closing properly. Lauren Crawley, 54, a housewife from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again, as she tells THEA JOURDAN. THE PATIENT . A few years ago I started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus - my GP referred me for scans which showed I had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear. Surgery was the only option. Thankfully the operation, in July 2012, was a success. But my facial nerve, which was wrapped around the tumour, was damaged. I'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side-effect, but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy. Apparently, it's the same thing that can happen after a stroke. I felt very self-conscious, but the problems weren't just aesthetic. I'd lost the hearing in my left ear as well as my sense of taste, and my mouth became dry. Eating and speaking were difficult - and, worst of all, my left eye was permanently open and I couldn't even blink with it. To close it, I had to push the upper lid down with my hand. The eye itself was dry and painful. To sleep, I had to seal it closed with tape. I'd been told that about half those with the condition do improve, so I was hopeful. I tried lots of things to improve the muscle tone, including facial massages, taught by a physiotherapist. I also had electric impulse therapy to shock the muscles back to life. But nothing worked. It was very stressful - I stopped socialising as much, in case people stared. After a year, it was clear the nerve would never work again so I was referred to Raman Malhotra, a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the Queen Victoria Hospital. He explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - I'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this wasn't affected. Apparently, surgeons used to use gold, but platinum is better because it doesn't irritate the eye's inside lining. It is also more dense than gold, so you need only a thin chain, which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid. I had the operation under sedation and local anaesthetic in February last year. Surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it . My eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye, then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place. It was strange watching it all but didn't hurt. I went home that day, and the difference was immediately obvious. The eye gently shut, and stayed shut, of its own accord. I could go to sleep without needing tape. I can't feel the implant, no one can see it, and I can blink normally. The procedure has made me look more normal - people don't stare as much. It's really boosted my confidence. THE SURGEON . Raman Malhotra is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Around 100,000 people in Britain have facial palsy. It can be caused by a stroke, if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve. It can also be a result of traumatic injury, damage after surgery, or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve - this happens in Bell's palsy, which affects more than 28,000 people a year. Facial palsy affects not just appearance, but lots of functions, too. The facial nerve - which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides, then sends branches across the face - controls the tongue's taste buds, for instance, and the salivary glands, so patients may suffer from dry mouth. Most also have difficulty blinking, because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut. However, it does not control the levator muscle, which holds it open. While many patients will recover, with symptoms easing within eight weeks, Lauren's facial nerve was too damaged to regain function. When she first saw me, her left eye was wide and staring because the lower lid was also pulled down and sideways. This can cause all sorts of problems, from dryness to injury. Five years ago, I would have recommended a gold implant - in the shape of a very thin bar - fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid. The extra weight makes the eyelid heavier, so it closes automatically when the levator muscle relaxes. This procedure is used widely across the NHS. But I now believe platinum is much better. It's 10 per cent more dense than gold, so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight. Platinum is also inert - gold will cause reactions, such as irritation and inflammation, in about 5 per cent of people. The left side of her face was droopy - until now . I helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight. For Lauren, I used three links weighing 0.4g each. This is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light. This way, we can easily add or remove a link. In 2013, we carried out a study at Queen Victoria Hospital, using platinum chain implants on 18 patients. Only two needed adjustments and 80 per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant, compared with just 20 per cent of patients who had a gold implant (the study will be published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology). First, we anaesthetised the skin around Lauren's eye. Then, on a workbench, I linked the correct number of platinum links to form the weight I required (I'd previously done a trial run, sticking temporary weights to the outside of her eyelids to check the weight). I made an incision across the outside of her eyelid, where it makes a natural crease, making sure not to cut through to the eyeball. I placed the links inside this incision, above the eyeball, stitching the chain in place from the outside in, before closing the incision. These nylon stitches stay in place for several years before being reabsorbed by the body. By then, the links will be embedded in surrounding tissue. When the chain was in place, and the eye was open, it sat above the eyeball so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye. Even when the eye is shut, the implant doesn't touch the cornea. When Lauren wanted to blink, her brain switched off the levator muscle, which keeps the eyelid wide open. The corresponding muscle, the orbicularis occuli muscle, which should pull the eyelid down, does not work in Lauren's case because it is controlled by the facial nerve. The percentage of stroke patients who are affected by facial weakness . However, the new chain meant that the eyelid was sufficiently heavy to fall, thanks to gravity. Although it wasn't a perfect solution - at first, Lauren's eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid - at least she could blink again. Over time, the blinking gets better as muscle tone improves. Risks include infection and bleeding, but these are rare. I hope the implant will last Lauren a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice. ANY DRAWBACKS? 'Gold upper eyelid implants have been used for decades for facial palsy,' says Saj Ataullah, a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. 'Platinum is more expensive, but seems to be better since it is inert and does not cause reactions. And as the implants are less bulky, it's also superior cosmetically. 'This chain segment innovation seems to work well. Any procedure can result in post-operative problems, but these appear to be rare. 'Longer-term follow-up is needed before we can conclude that chain-link implants are truly superior to other platinum weights, such as bars. But they are promising so far.' The operation costs around £3,000 privately. The NHS does not automatically fund it .","Lauren Crawley had surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear .

"A mother whose son suffered severe brain damage during birth is set to receive potentially the biggest medical negligence payout in history. The High Court ruled today that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of £14.6 million  for birth injuries, after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour. The hospital's negligence led to her son James Robshaw, now 12, being born with cerebral palsy. The decision, believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court-ordered award for birth injury, reflects the lifetime care that James needs. Suzanne Adams' son James Robshaw was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a Caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour . James cannot speak, dress or feed himself (without assistance of a machine) and must use a wheelchair. His intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye-gaze equipment. He will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life. While the exact sum has yet to be confirmed, MailOnline understands the minimum payout  will be £14.6m. To date, the biggest medical negligence payout has been around £15 million - and Ms Adam's lawyers hope to exceed this amount. Ms Adams was in  labour when she was admitted to Lincoln County hospital in 2002. Although her baby's heart was monitored after her arrival, midwives either ignored or could not interpret the CTG trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly. James had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and Mrs Adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour. Today, the High Court ruled that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay Ms Adams in excess of £14.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court-ordered award for birth injury . James, now 12, cannot speak, dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair. He will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life . The confusion about CTG interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely Caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering James. Resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit. The sum ordered by the High Court includes money to pay for all James’ needs including: . * 24 hour care provided by a team of live-in carers. * Significant modifications to his home to allow James to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom, kitchen etc. * Hoisting and tracking equipment to lift James in and out of wheelchairs/bed. * Disability equipment. * Therapists including physiotherapist, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, AAC therapist, orthotist, orthoptist, psychologist. * Adapted vehicle to enable James to travel in his wheelchair. * Sophisticated eye-gaze equipment to enable James to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work. * Funding for James’ additional educational needs. Ms Adams' lawyer, Denise Stephens, a partner with law firm Access Legal, argued that had the Caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby’s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that James was in distress. In either event, he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury. Ms Stephens said: ‘This is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries. 'James is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life James could have had if he had not been injured.’ The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust finally admitted liability for James’s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth. However it took a further six years to fight for damages for James. Speaking today, Ms Adams said: ‘The family has been through a very difficult time. '[The situation] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and I am still on medication for depression and anxiety. 'It was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives. 'The award will help James realise his potential. 'But no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others.' Pauleen Pratt, acting chief nurse at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust and the NHS Litigation Authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon James and his family. 'The Trust accepted, in 2009, liability for the injuries which James sustained during his birth some 12 years ago. 'Although we cannot turn back the clock, we hope that the compensation, once agreed, will provide the reassurance that James’ future care needs will be met.'","Suzanne Adams' son James was starved of oxygen and has cerebral palsy .

"A make-up artist has applied her formidable skills to transform herself into a very seasonal figure - the Easter bunny. Maria Malone-Guerbaa, 41, from London, used nothing but paints to turn herself into an uncanny painting of a grey rabbit with blue eyes, wearing a red bow tie. The mother-of-two said she didn't use any prosthetics or special effects to achieve the amazing result. Scroll down for video . Make-up artist Maria Malone-Guerbaa (left) just used paints to transform herself into a bunny . The final result took three hours to achieve after Maria simply googled pictures of bunnies, picking one she liked best and replicating the image on her face. She used her own brushes and kryolan paint, special dense, long-lasting make-up used by professionals working with stage actors. Maria began her project by painting a white base layer to create the shape of the rabbit's face and ears, adding the animal's eyes (below her own) and nose and mouth (over her own). The sides of her face and forehead was then painted with black paint, to form the bunny's entire head. With grey paint, black dots stippled over the top and finally details like whiskers, and the bow tie that is drawn from Maria's neck up to her chin, the look was complete. Maria explained her inspiration for her rabbit scheme: 'My last couple of projects have been animal-themed so, with Easter coming up, it had to be a rabbit this time around. 'It takes me about three hours in total and I'll stop every 20 minutes or so to take a picture of my progress. 'I just went on my iPhone and searched for rabbits on Google Images. You get so many then that you can just form your own picture.' The final result has earned thousands of likes on Instagram, along with her other posts showing how she transformed her face into Jack Nicholson from The Shining, Stevie Wonder, a cougar and Freddie Mercury. Maria used only her brushes and professional kryolan paints to create bunny ears, bright eyes and a nose . She captioned the picture: 'I've got #hare in my face!' She said: 'It's amazing to see other people enjoying my work. I can't quite put into words how flattering it is and it makes the whole thing worthwhile. 'One lady even got in touch who'd been inspired to try it out herself. That was the pinnacle for me: it was so humbling to think that my work had inspired someone else to do the same thing.' Originally from Limerick, Maria says she's always had a passion for art but only began doing celebrity lookalikes after she started face painting for parties for her children Sophia, 14, and Adam, 11. She posted pictures online and added the caption, 'I've got hare in my face'","Maria Malone-Guerbaa, 41, used just brushes and paint to transform face .

"A woman who fractured her neighbour's skull with a hammer during a street fight as part of an eight-year feud has been jailed. Lisa Williams, 49, hit taxi driver David Coleman three times after finding the 54-year-old brawling with her brother in the street, a court heard. The two families had been 'neighbours at war' since the Colemans moved in next door to the Williams family on St Catherine’s Road, Chingford, in 2007. Lisa Williams (pictured leaving court, left) hit taxi driver David Coleman (right) three times with the hammer during a street fight . On the morning of the attack, the court heard that William's sibling Jonathan had smeared mud all over the Coleman's front bay windows. When the victim went to confront him, they got into a fight. James Benson, prosecuting, said: ‘Mr Coleman is not a small man but fairly well built, Jonathan Williams is bigger built still and is in fact a younger man than Mr Coleman,’ he said. ‘Between the two of them punches were thrown by both parties, this was before Lisa Williams had anything to do with the incident. ‘Ultimately the parties say Mr Williams gained the upper hand in the fight as the bigger and younger man, and both me went to the ground.’ At that point the bigger man allegedly straddled Mr Coleman as Williams emerged from their house holding a claw hammer, she then struck him three times to the head. She was only stopped when a third neighbour Bernard Mason, pulled the hammer out of her hands, and his wife Pamela was forced to sit on the her until the police arrived. Williams admitted striking Mr Coleman with a hammer, but claimed she believed he was about to kill her brother and she acted out of panic. Warring neighbours: The two families were described as ‘neighbours at war’ after the Colemans (left) moved in next door to the Williams' home (right) Before fetching the hammer she called 999 from  house she shared with her brother and mother, who can be heard screaming ‘leave him alone, leave him alone’ in the background. Williams was convicted of unlawfully wounding Mr Coleman after a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in February. Mr Benson described the two families as ‘neighbours at war’. The victim told the court that the Williams family had an irrational hatred of him. He claimed they would throw dog faeces over their garden fence and let their pet bark all hours of the day. Mr Coleman also believed they would be deliberately noisy and bang on the walls in the morning so he couldn't sleep after a night shift. However, Recorder Richard Sutton told the family ‘it takes two to Tango’. In a victim impact statement, Mr Coleman said he still suffers headaches and anxiety as a result of the attack, and often has to take days off work as a result. Isobel McCarroll, for Williams, said: ‘On the day in questions they were doing home improvements, her brother was out the front and she was doing some gardening, the hammer was in the hallway. ‘She came across an incident that was in full swing, she was nothing to do with the initial fighting - she came across something that must have been a terrifying scene and she rang 999 first.’ Williams, 49, was jailed for 30 months today at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London (pictured) after she was found guilty of maliciously wounding Mr Coleman . ‘She then went and tried to split the parties up, she went back in and she didn’t know if she was going to call 999 again and when she was in she saw the hammer - it might go a considerable way to mitigating the actions that followed. ‘It was three blows in quick succession and thankfully it was stopped by Mr Mason.’ She said Williams, who has no previous convictions, has been living apart from her family for two years since the incident and the family are now selling their home on St Catherine’s Road. Jailing Williams for two years and six months, the judge said: ‘You find yourself in a very, very sad situation as you no doubt appreciate, and it has come about because of the situation that has evolved between you and your neighbours. ‘This in my view was an incident waiting to happen and it was going to be serious and both sides were quite prepared for confrontation as and when it arose. ‘That’s the problem if it becomes violent, you never quite know where it is going to end - I understand that you thought the only way to respond to what was taking place was to arm yourself and it’s that action that the law finds unallowable and therefore criminal. ‘I accept that there was a substantial amount of provocation’. Williams was also barred from contacting the Coleman family indefinitely and ordered to pay a £120 surcharge.","Lisa Williams hit neighbour David Coleman with a hammer three times .

"Masked raiders used an angle grinder to try and break into a cash machine before they fled police in a stolen Audi at speeds of up to 145mph. The gang of four were seen trying to hack into an ATM outside a Waitrose supermarket in Kenilworth in Warwickshire, before they fled police in the stolen car after nearby residents reported seeing sparks flying from the cash machine. When they were arrested at a flat in Tamworth a list of ATMs was found. The thieves were caught after a police helicopter followed the gang of four as they tore up the northbound carriageway of the M42 in the stolen car. They were tracked to a block of flats in Tamworth in Staffordshire. Scroll down for video . Police tracked the masked gang as they fled the scene of the attempted raid in a stolen Audi RS7 (circled) after they had spent around eight minutes trying to hack into an ATM outside a Waitrose supermarket . The group reached speeds of 145mph in the stolen car as they headed towards flats in Tamworth . Members of the gang used a circular saw, crowbars and a hydraulic cutter - known as an angle grinder - usually used by firefighters to rescue people from car crashes. They spent eight minutes trying to access the vault - causing £20,000 of damage - before speeding off in a stolen Audi RS7 at 3.20am on September 29 last year. The Audi had been stolen from a house in Bicester in Oxon on September 10 in a bid to shake off officers in a chase to the Tamworth apartment. Gang members Mark Kirk, 34, Pedro Taylor, 30, and Jason Hadley, 27, were then found hiding in the Tamworth apartment and arrested. Dean Beech (left) and Mark Kirk (right) were jailed after they worked as part of the four-strong gang . Pedro Taylor (left) and Jason Hadley (right) were also part of the gang of four, who were wearing masks . Driver Dean Beech, 37, reached speeds of over 145mph in the stolen Audi. He was found by police dog handlers hiding in dense bushes close to the flat after being detected by helicopter thermal imaging cameras. The gang all admitted conspiracy to steal and aggravated vehicle taking, and have been jailed. After the hearing, police released video footage showing the foursome accelerating away from chasing police cars whose on-board cameras show them reaching a top speed of 145mph. The gang caused around £20,000 worth of damage as they tried to hack into the Waitrose cashpoint . The two minute video then shows the gang fleeing on foot after ditching their car at the flats in footage taken from the helicopter's thermal imaging camera. Police can also be seen surrounding Beech as he is arrested in nearby bushes before an officer in the helicopter says: 'Cracking job, I'm ready for a cup of tea, back to base.' When officers forced their way into the flats they found Kirk inside, who claimed to have been asleep with his girlfriend all night. Hadley and Taylor were also dressed all in black standing in the kitchen whilst Beech was arrested hiding in bushes outside. Police found cutting equipment in the Audi's boot alongside its original number plate, while a search of the flat uncovered an address list of shops with cash points. Detectives discovered the sole of Beech's ZX750 Adidas trainers, plus footwear worn by Taylor and Kirk, matched imprints left in the angle grinder dust next to the shattered ATM. Taylor and Hadley, both of no fixed address, were given three-year in jail for their part in the Kenilworth ATM theft attempt. Beech, of no fixed address, and Kirk had been on bail at the time of the botched ATM raid for plotting to rob a jeweller in Birmingham on August 1, 2013. Officers from West Midlands Police's Serious and Organised Crime Unit had lain in wait for the pair at the Jewellery Quarter after their plan to turn up wearing balaclavas and gloves. The pair, along with accomplice Darren Bowman, 47, were stopped moments before their intended raid by officers who had followed them for a month and punctured the tyres of their getaway car on the day of the planned robbery. Beech was jailed for a total of 12 years - two for the cashpoint attack, and another 10 for conspiracy to rob the jewellers. The stolen Audi is seen parked up as the thieves drove to Tamworth and then escaped from the car inside . Kirk, of Birmingham, was given a sentence of 11 years - 18 months for his role in the cash point raid, as well as 10 years for the jewellery plot. Bowman, of Moseley, Birmingham was jailed for six years and two montha after being convicted of the conspiracy to commit robbery charge. The court heard the night before the planned raid, Beech and Kirk had stolen a Toyota Land cruiser from Middleton, near Tamworth, Staffs. It was then fitted with false plates and driven to Birmingham in convoy with Beech's van, which was dumped in Erdington near the city centre. Thermal imaging cameras, which detect heat (white), show the heat generated by the car's tyres as it stops . The men (centre) are detected by the thermal camera as they make their way into the Tamworth flats . Pictures show heat coming form the tyres and the men attempting to evade officers as they went inside . The two men parked in the Jewellery Quarter just before 11am to wait for the jeweller but armed officers quickly surrounded the car and arrested them. Bowman was then arrested a few weeks later. Just a month later Kirk and Beech went on to try and break into the Waitrose ATM. Speaking after the hearing, West Midlands Police traffic officer Mitch Darby, who was involved in the pursuit, said: 'The police helicopter picked up the Audi near Hampton-in-Arden before we spotted it heading north on the M42. Officers swooped in on the gang and made their way into the Tamworth apartment where they arrested them . Police were also able to arrest Dean Beech who had hid himself in the bushes but was seen on the cameras . 'We were trying to keep pace but even at 140mph they were pulling away but they can't outrun the police helicopter. 'Camera operators on-board gave us a continual commentary of the car's movements and directed us to the flats where they tried hiding. 'Colleagues and police dogs quickly had a solid containment of the houses to make sure no-one could leave and it was only a matter of time before we arrested the offenders.'","Four masked raiders used saws and an angle grinder to break into an ATM .

"The axe wielding thug who attempted to rob a shop but was restrained by a husband and wife duo has been unmasked as a prolific offender, who has committed more than 1,000 offences since his began his crime spree at the age of 11. Shaun Andrew McKerry, 31, was arrested after he burst into Shildon Post Office and Stores in County Durham wielding an axe and demanding cash, as an accomplice stood at the door. But he was foiled after shopkeeper Sab Dhillon heard McKarry's demands and ran from the back of the shop and rugby tackled him to the floor.

He got his nickname because he always returned home after his crimes. He committed his first offence at the age of 11 and in the next five years went on to commit 1,000 crimes. His own mother even previously pleaded for her teenage son, known as a one man crime wave, to be locked up. McKerry pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court, via videolink from prison, to attempted robbery from the post office on March 15. CCTV footage of the incident shows the 31-year-old burst into the store and demand terrified assistant Andrea Brighty fill his bag with money. But Mr Dhillon heard the incident and ran from the back of the store to pounce on McKerry. After a scuffle Mr Dhillon managed to restrain the man in a stranglehold and his wife then appeared, further subduing the man - whose face was covered with a scarf and hood - by hitting him with a baseball bat. McKerry is pictured in handcuffs at the age of 15 when he was committing strings of offences in the area . As Mr Dhillon held him, the shop assistant removed McKerry's scarf so his face could be shown to the cameras. His accomplice, who had been standing guard at the door when they burst in, fled. Mrs Dhillon said: 'It was really scary. We didn't realise who he was at the time and how bad his previous convictions were.' Her husband told the Northern Echo: 'He did not hit me but there was a good chance that he could have as he was waving the axe about blindly while he was on the floor. Mr Dhillon said McKerry was waving the axe around when he jumped on him and wrestled him to the floor . 'I am OK and we're trying to get over it and we just want to put this behind us.' McKerry, who will be sentenced on April 24, is known by the nickname 'Boomerang Boy' or 'Homing Pigeon Boy' because he always returned home after his crimes. He once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. His catalogue of offending included car chases with police, a string of burglary convictions, aggravated vehicle taking, sending indecent letters, witness intimidation, threatening behaviour, assaulting a police officer, attempted robbery, shoplifting, criminal damage and countless breaches of curfew, community sentences and offending while on bail.

McKerry's case was even brought to the attention of then Prime Minister Tony Blair, who later announced a crackdown on so called 'bail-bandits'. He began offending from the age of 11, and has clocked up dozens of court appearances. On March 11, 1999, McKerry, of County Durham, had already been arrested five times between January 22 and February 10. Shaun Andrew McKerry started offending at the age of 11 when he committed his first theft in 1995. Between 1995 and 2000 he clocked up 1,000 offences. In the 12 months of 1995 he was arrested 80 times. McKerry managed to stay out of prison for 36 weeks in 1998, and was arrested 45 times. He was arrested five times between January 22 and February 10, 1999. McKerry became known as a one man crime wave and was dubbed Boomerang Boy because he always returned home, police knowing where to find him. His mother even called for her teenage son to be arrested. In 1999 she said: 'I love him as a son but I hate the person he has become.' In one of his earlier crimes McKerry  stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman. By the age of 15 McKerry had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. When he was 16 McKerry was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. At the age of 18 he was out of prison and had offended again, but was given a 'second chance' by magistrates. Just three days later he was back again. From then on he stuck to low level crimes to feed his drug habit. In 2011 he was jailed for four years after he admitted robbery after stealing £90 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. In March he was rugby tackled and restrained by Sab Dhillon when he went into the store, armed with an axe and demanded cash. He has 55 previous convictions. He boasted after one court appearance he would be back and returned just 48 hours later on suspicion of taking a car. The 15-year-old was then placed on a supervision order despite a report to magistrates that he was a danger to the public. Magistrates tried to provide him with a string of second chances and opportunities to rehabilitate himself - but each time he re-offended. In February 2000 the press won a landmark legal victory to name him when the Lord Chief Justice ruled Bishop Auckland Youth Court had done nothing legally wrong when it agreed to the paper's application to lift the juvenile's automatic right to anonymity. Lord Bingham said he had taken a great interest in the case which centred on the individual youth's right to freedom and anonymity against the public's right to be better protected by knowing his identity. As he continued to offend McKerry developed a drug problem and stole to feed his habit. Six months later McKerry, then 16, was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. This was later cut on appeal but by March 2002, aged 18, he was back behind bars again after admitting two new offences - three days after being given yet another 'last chance' by magistrates. McKerry had been granted bail after admitting theft on a Monday but was picked up 48 hours later after helping raid a Bishop Auckland clothing shop. In 2002 his mother Paula Harp, 32, pleaded for him to be arrested after she said he had ruined her life. She claimed he started to offend because he was a bit of a loner, and began doing minor things like throwing stones before his behaviour escalated. In recent years, much of his offending has been for the theft of low value items, from shops in the south-west Durham area. But in May, 2011 he was jailed for four years at Durham Crown Court which heard he only had 18 months to live if his drug and alcohol abuse continued. McKerry admitted robbery after stealing £90 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. His lawyer said he had deep vein thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver, as a result of years of substance abuse. The court heard he had 55 previous convictions for 120 offences.","Shaun McKerry started offending when he was 11 and is believed to have committed more than 1,000 crimes including theft and witness intimidation .

"A Pakistani man suspected of killing his fiancee and nine of her relatives after they appeared to be reluctant to give her permission to marry - months after he allegedly murdered his own parents. The 25-year-old suspect, who has been identified as Gul Ahmad Saeed, is alleged to have shot dead his fiancee, her parents and seven of her siblings on Sunday, police have said. Their deaths came just months after he is alleged to have killed his own parents, brother and sister-in-law after they objected to the match. Frustrated: Gul Ahmad Saeed is alleged to have gone on a killing spree after becoming angry with people obstructing his wedding plans. Pictured: Stock image of Pakistani brides and grooms at a mass wedding . Saeed has been on the run ever since, but returned to his home town in town in north-west Pakistan at the weekend - at which point he is suspected of killing his fiancee's family with the help of accomplices. He is said to have been outraged over her uncle's dithering over the marriage. 'The uncle was being very indecisive about the wedding which infuriated Gul Ahmad,' said police officer Mohammad Jamil. Police were searching for the suspects but they were believed to have fled into the semi-autonomous Pashtun tribal area along the Afghan border, where government authorities hold little sway and police are not legally permitted to go. 'We cannot follow anyone there since it is beyond our jurisdiction, and our security would be threatened,' said Jamil. Fled: Saeed, 25, is now said to be in the semi-autonomous Pashtun area, on the border with Afghanistan . The killings took place in a deeply conservative area where women there are often discouraged from going to school and have little choice when it comes to marriage. Pakistani women are often killed by men who feel their honour has been offended in some way. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that 869 women were murdered in so-called honour killings in 2013, the last year for which data is available.","Gul Ahmad Saeed suspected of shooting fiancee, her parents and siblings .

"Drank himself to death: Charles Terreni Jr had a blood alcohol level of .375 when he died . An 18-year-old University of Carolina freshman who was found dead after a St Patrick's Day party died of alcohol poisoning in a 'tragic and totally preventable death', a coroner has ruled. Charles Terreni Jr was four times over the legal alcohol limit when he died, an autopsy has found. He was found at the Pi Kappa Alpha house in Columbia, not far from campus, around 10:30am on March 18, the morning after an alleged 'kegger' at the house for the annual Irish holiday. Terreni's official blood alcohol reading was .375, according to WISTV. He is the son of Columbia attorney Charles Terreni, a former staff member for then-Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler, a former state Public Service Commissioner and a man involved in legislative redistricting. The death is still under investigation. Circumstances leading up to his death are not clear, but the house was draped in St Patrick's decorations and a beer keg could be seen outside. Neither the fraternity nor the university has explained the situation in detail. However, USC suspended the fraternity in the wake of the death. Neighbors said the house threw a party the night before, and noted the leftover keg Wednesday morning. 'I would say there are three houses there, and I don't know who exactly lives in them, but there's always a frequency of parties going on,' neighbor Mehrdad Vejdani told Fox Carolina. 'At times, there can be a hundred people in that place. Live band in the backyard, which is fine. I mean, some noise, but it doesn't bother us too much.' Scroll down for video . Suspended: The Pi Kappa Alpha house at the University of South Carolina has been suspended, after a brother was found dead in a house Wednesday morning . Rager? Neighbors said the house had a party the night before, on St Patrick's Day. On Wednesday, several stray cups and a keg were seen on the porch, as well as clover decorations . The Columbia Police Department and Richland County Coroner's Office have both labeled the death 'suspicious'. Responding the Terreni's death, the fraternity's national office released a statement saying the USC chapter had been placed on leave pending the investigation. It said: 'The fraternity’s thoughts and prayers are with the family of this young man and the brothers of Xi Chapter'. A spokesman for USC added: 'There are a lot of rumors out there about the circumstances surrounding the death but at this point the matter remains under investigation.' 'While we await further information we are focused on helping our community grieve and heal.' This is the second incident at the fraternity in a week. Last Friday, the University of Connecticut chapter lost recognition for hazing members, providing alcohol to underage students and harassing women. Pi Kappa Alpha was founded in 1868 at the University of Virginia and has now grown to include some 220 groups across the U.S. and Canada. The house has been plagued by controversy before. In November 2012, a 19-year-old student at Northern Illinois University died after a night of heavy drinking. Five frat members were charged with felonies for hazing and the chapter was suspended indefinitely. That same year, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville chapter was suspended indefinitely when a 20-year-old member was hospitalized for reportedly ingesting wine through his anus.","Charles Terreni, 18, was found dead March 18 at a frat house in Columbia .

"A mother has revealed that despite winning her wrongful arrest case against the police after she was handcuffed in front of her Down syndrome daughter, she hasn't had an apology. Valerie Cadman-Khan, 56, from Middlesbrough, appeared on This Morning to talk about the incident in which a policeman took her in for questioning amid claims of child neglect. The council worker appeared visibly upset  as she recalled the events of  2008 to presenter Ruth Langsford when her daughter Aimee, now 19, was just 12. Scroll down for video . Valerie Cadman-Khan, from Middlesborough, appeared on This Morning, with her daughter, Aimee, now 19 . The 56-year-old mother was interviewed by Ruth Langsford on This Morning about finally getting justice and winning the lawsuit against the police . Valerie recalled how she was cuffed in front of her scared and crying daughter. But she said the worst part of the arrest was the aftermath in which her abilities as a mother were called into question. She said: ‘I felt like I had to reaffirm certain things to everybody. I kept saying to people, ""I’m a good mum. I’m a good mum"".’ When questioned on whether she thought justice has been served in court last month, Valerie revisited her feelings towards Detective Sergeant Colin Helyer who arrested her. ‘I think justice has now been done. When I watched him in the dock and I saw him giving the evidence and lying about me, I felt as though he knew that I knew he was a liar and that gave me relief,' she said. 'I was in a position before where I couldn't do anything and then the tables were turned, because he was in that position and he couldn't get out of the witness box.' Following the incident involving daughter Aimee (pictured right), Valerie's (pictured left) confidence as a mother was called into question . During the interview, Valerie (pictured right) is seen visibly upset when recalling the incident involving daughter Aimee,who was 12 at the time . When asked if she has received an apology yet, Valerie admitted that she had not. ‘Not yet. They’re waiting for the outcome of the judge's determination and then they will apologise at that point.' Cleveland Police accused Valerie of negligent behaviour, claiming she left the child alone for 45 minutes in the garden. Middlesbrough County Court heard how officer Detective Sergeant Colin Helyer 'lied' to the local authority child abuse investigation to justify arresting the mother of five. On the day in question in November 2008, he had been called to her former partner's home over an unpaid tax bill. Aimee had been left in the man's care and was sitting outside when police arrived. Mrs Cadman Khan was at work. But the police officer began 'banging' on the front door and later claimed the child had turned 'purple' because she was not wearing a coat. Valerie Cadman-Khan has successfully sued Cleveland Police for wrongful arrest after being handcuffed in front of her daughter Aimee when she was 12 . The 56-year-old was led away from her former boyfriend's house in front of her daughter amid false claims Aimee, who has Down's syndrome, had been left alone for 45 minutes in the cold . Upon her arrival at the property Mrs Cadman-Khan, who left work early because she was not feeling well, was arrested and taken away by police. Aimee was forced to watch the incident, all the while screaming: 'I want my mummy,' she claimed. Her mother launched a wrongful arrest suit and has won her case against the force. Her claim for £34,000 in compensation will be assessed at a later date. Speaking of her ordeal the teacher, who works for the council at  East Coast Training, a pupil referral centre, said: 'It was never about the money - it was about clearing my name after the injustice to me and my little girl. Detective Sergeant Colin Helyer was accused of 'freestyle lying' in his version of events . 'This should never have come to court, I only wanted an apology. 'All I could hear was my little girl shouting ""I want my mummy, I want my mummy"". 'It was horrendous.' After arresting Mrs Cadman-Khan on suspicion of child neglect, Det Sgt Helyer 'lied under oath' to claim Aimee had been mistreated, the court heard. 'He falsely asserted that Aimee had been purple and suggested the client had been violent to him,' Nick Stanage, barrister for Mrs Cadman-Khan said. 'Sadly this was a witness that even when caught in a lie by the court he was unwilling to be honest about it.' 'For a woman of good character from that profession to be arrested and accused of allegations of child neglect and cruelty is of the utmost seriousness.' He denied maliciously arresting the mother of five, insisting that all of his actions were in Aimee's best interest. 'In the balance of probability it was more likely Sgt Helyer overreacted and was led by his concerns for Aimee,' said Nathan Adams representing Cleveland Police. 'He accepted in evidence he lost his temper and was banging on the door. He was concerned for the mental and physical wellbeing of Aimee.' Judge Gillian Matthews QC however told the court the sergeant had been 'freestyle lying' in his accounts. 'One of your problems is the witness has lied. He was prepared to mislead the court in what I call freestyle lying,' she said. The force will apologise pending her judgment on suitable reward, Mr Adams added. Mrs Cadman-Khan was left 'humiliated' by the ordeal throughout which Aimee, now 19, could be heard screaming: 'I want my mummy' The mother of five has successfully sued Cleveland Police. The force said it will apologise when the judge has ruled on a reward .","Valerie Cadman-Khan, 56, appeared on This Morning with daughter Aimee .

"Lib Dem campaigner Michelle Gent used her party's constituency headquarters for her bondage and porn film business . A Liberal Democrat campaigner has been exposed as a dominatrix who used the party's constituency headquarters for her bondage and porn film business. Michelle Gent directed and starred in violent films featuring whips, chains, swords and scantily clad women before selling the videos online. The former Lib Dem councillor, 50, used the party's offices in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, to hold auditions for the sordid films. Some of the clips show women bound with leather straps, while others show girls drenched in fake blood. A source told Matthew Drake, for the Sunday Mirror, that actors at auditions for one of Ms Gent's films, The Exorcist Chronicles, were told to 'prepare for anything'. The source, who walked out of an audition, said: 'They were pushing people to be more and more extreme. Michelle acted like an X Factor judge. 'There were girls flashing, pretending to play with themselves, screaming, faking orgasms and kissing each other in the hope they would be picked for the lead role.' Ms Gent, a grandmother-of-one, explained the plot of the film during an interview for a bizarre movie reviews website. She said: 'The movie is about a spate of demonic possessions. The Vatican are getting worried about the frightening increase in occurrences of the possessions and need to do something about it. They send out an unusual team – a Priest, Father Jan, and a Scientist, Daryl Lux. 'It’s a movie that has many levels of perception. If you want to look deeper into the meanings, then it’s certainly possible. Try it, have fun with it. It may take a few viewings to see everything, but I find that kind of thing fascinating. It’s been very cleverly done I think.' Ms Gent's other films include Dead Walkers: Rise of the 4th Reich and Awesome Killer Auditions.

"Ryanair passengers travelling to Edinburgh and Zadar, Croatia were delayed for hours after two of the budget airline’s planes clipped wings at Dublin Airport this morning. Photos snapped by travellers show the tip of a winglet dangling by a thread after clipping the other plane - and it's the second time in six months two Ryanair planes have collided at Ireland's busiest airport. Passengers escaped injury when the planes collided as they taxied to a runway shortly before 8am, but the incident caused disruption for hundreds of travellers. Passengers snapped photos of the damaged winglet after two Ryanair planes collided at Dublin Airport . Passengers escaped injury after two Ryanair planes clipped wings while taxiing to a runway at Dublin Airport . Passenger Shannen Murphy, who was seated on the Edinburgh-bound plane which lost part of its winglet, told MailOnline Travel: ‘We were just about to approach the runway and there was another Ryanair plane quite close, but I thought maybe it had broken down or something. ‘And then next of all there was a jerk in the plane, which felt like we had gone over a really big pothole.’ Moments later the pilot announced over the tannoy that there had been ‘an incident’ with another plane and passengers would have to return to the terminal. Shannen said passengers were stuck on the plane for up to 90 minutes, as they waited for buses to arrive, and they arrived in Edinburgh about three hours behind schedule. ‘As soon as we were off [the bus] we were taken straight to a new plane and within 30 minutes we were up in the air.’ One of the Ryanair planes' winglets was left dangling after the collision on a taxiway at Dublin Airport . Emergency services attended the scene of the collision as a precaution. Passengers on board both planes were taken back to the terminal by bus and put on replacement aircraft to continue their journeys to Scotland and Croatia. The Boeing 737s involved in the collision were taken out of service to undergo inspections and any necessary repairs. The collision caused delays for other flights, with one passenger tweeting: '2 jets hit at Dublin, my flight to Malaga delayed'. Dublin Airport said in a tweet: ‘No injuries on the two aircraft which clipped each other on a taxiway this am. Passengers in process of being taken off the aircraft.’ A passenger snapped this photo of the Boeing 737s after they collided while taxiing to a runway .

"On first glance they appear to simply be bland, bleach-white seashells, but when viewed under ultraviolet light they are transformed. Scientists have used a new technique to reconstrcut the colourful patterns on 28 fossilised cone snail shells that are up to 6.6 million years old. The technique has allowed researchers to look millions of years into the past to see how these once elaborately decorated shells would have once looked. The fossilised cone snail shells have bleached over time, like the one labelled A, but under ultraviolet light traces of pigment still in the shells are revealed, labelled B, allowing their colours to be reconstrcuted (C) Instead of being a simple white colour, they were infact covered in streaks of orange, purple, blue and even large pokadots. The scientists now believe the cone snail shells, which come from the northern Dominican Republic, include 13 entirely new species. A deadly tropical sea snail uses a super-potent form of insulin to subdue its fish prey, scientists have discovered. The geographic cone snail (Conus geographus) uses the chemical to cause a plunge in blood sugar, leaving the fish sluggish and unable to swim to safety. In this way the snail is able to entrap whole schools of small fish. C. geographus is one of the most venomous creatures on Earth, and known to have killed dozens of people in accidental encounters. It hunts in two ways, both by releasing toxins into the water and by firing a harpoon-like poison-tipped tooth into its prey.No antidote exists for a cone snail sting, which contains a mixture of nerve agents. The new research has uncovered one highly unusual ingredient in the cone snail's venom cocktail - weaponised insulin. In tests, a synthetic version of the hormone - made from shorter protein chains than normal insulin - lowered the blood sugar levels of adult zebrafish. Injected into water, it also reduced the movements of fish larvae. There are about 30 recorded instances of people being killed by cone snails, some of which have attractive and collectible shells. Dr Jonathan Hendricks, a paleontologist at the San Jose State University who led the research, said that the lack of colouration in many fosisilised cone snail shells made them difficult to identify. He said: 'Original coloration patterns — if not the actual colors themselves —sometimes become visible when fossil shells are illuminated with ultraviolet light, which causes formerly pigmented regions of the shell to fluoresce. 'Once a specimen has been photographed under UV light, it is possible to use photoediting software to reconstruct the original shell coloration pattern. 'This is done by creating a reversed, negative image, which causes bright, fluorescing markings to become darkened, corresponding with regions that were once pigmented.' Dr Hendricks used the ultraviolet technique to examine a range of fossilised shells that were discovered in the Cibao Valley of the northern Dominican Republic. Although it is now a rich and fertile inland valley, millions of years ago during the Neogene it was covered by ocean. All cone snails are venomous and predatory, with many species still around today. They use a harpoon like tooth that injects venom into their prey. In some cases the cone snail toxins are lethal to humans while many have a painful sting. Due to their bright colours and patterns they are often handled by unwary humans, leaving them vulnerable to stings. There are around 700 species of cone snail still living in tropical seas worldwide and around 1,000 species have been found in the fossil record. This image shows three of the fossil shells studied by the scientists as they currently appear without colour . Scientists used UV light to reveal tiny traces of the pigment left in the shell and the patterns they once had . However, identifying these can often be tricky as over time the bright pigments in the shells fade. Exposing them to ultraviolet light causes any remaining organic matter in the shells - like pigment - to fluoresce. It is thought that these compounds in the shells oxidise over time and so light up when UV light is shined on them. Dr Hendricks, whose work is published in the journal Public Library of Science One, compared the cone snail shells he examined with the patterns of those of modern Caribbean cone snails. He found that many of the fossils showed similar patterns, indicating that some modern species belong to lineages that have survived in the Caribbean for millions of years. UV light allowed scientists to peer back millions of years to reconstruct shell patterns and colours as above . Dr Hendricks said: 'This approach — combined with the exceptional Neogene fossil record of the Dominican Republic, as well as other regional fossil deposits — has the potential to provide a detailed understanding of the evolutionary and biogeographic development of the modern western Atlantic cone snail fauna. 'Clearly much more work needs to be done to better understand the compounds responsible for shell coloration. 'That said, it seems that oxidation - caused either naturally by exposure of shells to sunlight over prolonged periods of time, or artificially by soaking in bleach for several days - plays a role in causing formerly pigmented regions of fossil shells to fluoresce under UV light, though the reason is not currently understood.' C. geographus (above) is one of 700 existing cone snail species and is one of most venomous living animals .","Fossilised cone snail shells found in Cibao Valley of Dominican Republic .

"Scientists have discovered an Achilles’ heel of prostate (pictured) cancer that could lead to better treatment for many  men diagnosed with the disease . British scientists have discovered an ‘Achilles’ heel’ in prostate cancer which could lead to better treatments. The disease claims almost 11,000 lives a year in the UK, with most deaths occurring after it spreads around the body. The latest study gets to the root of this spread, and could mean better outcomes for the 42,000 men a year diagnosed with the illness. Scientists funded by Cancer Research UK studied samples taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten affected men. Reading the DNA revealed details of how the cancer metastasises, or spreads, allowing them to build a ‘family tree’ of how the disease changes over time. It seems that most of the cells in a tumour stay where they are. However, a small number have the ability to travel through the body, creating new tumours as they go. These cells are the ‘root’ of the cancer and for a treatment to work, they should be destroyed. In future, doctors may be able to find these key cells in individual patients. They could then be given drugs to wipe them out, with each patient’s treatment tailored to the genetic flaw at the root of their cancer. This should kill the new tumours and prevent more from forming, greatly improving odds of survival. Cambridge University researcher Professor David Neal said some suitable drugs already exist, and that new ones are being developed all the time. However, he cautioned that it will be three to five years before the latest knowledge can be routinely put to use in the NHS. Lead study author Professor Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: ‘We gained a much broader view of prostate cancer by studying both the original cancer and the cells that had spread to other parts of the body. ‘We found that all of the cells that had broken free shared a common ancestor cell in the prostate. ‘The common faults we found in each man could potentially offer new targets for treatment.’ Co-author Dr Ultan McDermott, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire, described the finding as a ‘potential Achilles’ heel’. Professor Peter Johnson, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘This research lets us look right into the molecular core of cancer.’ Samples were taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten men with the disease (pictured). Reading the DNA revealed details of how the cancer metastasises - or spreads - allowing scientists to understand how the disease changes over time .","British scientists say they have got to the 'root' of prostate cancer .

"Ed Miliband faced ridicule last night after privately billing himself as the ‘happy warrior’ ahead of last week’s televised Election debate. The Labour leader’s secret cribsheets also reveal how he planned to ‘relish the chance to show who I am’. And in handwritten notes, Mr Miliband appears to exhort himself to ‘use the people at home’. Embarrassingly for the Labour leader, the ten pages of notes were apparently left behind in the Salford ITV studios where Mr Miliband clashed with David Cameron, Nick Clegg and four other party leaders. Scroll down for video . Embarrassing: Ed Miliband faced ridicule last night after privately billing himself as the ‘happy warrior’ ahead of last week’s televised Election debate . Mr Miliband faced criticism last week for his ‘stiff’, mannered performance – including turning to look straight into the TV camera shortly after each question from the studio audience. But his discarded notes, according to the Sun on Sunday, reveal the extraordinary lengths he went to in his determined bid to get the better of his political opponents. One note appears to explain why Mr Miliband smiled serenely every time he came under fire. It read: ‘Happy warrior, calm, never agitated.’ Last night, Labour sources suggested that was a reference to the poem The Character Of The Happy Warrior by William Wordsworth. In a further self-motivational message, Mr Miliband, pictured during the debate as Natalie Bennet speaks, also wrote the words ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ connected by an arrow. But the notes also betray the vital importance for the Labour leader of landing a blow on the Prime Minister – and contrasting himself with Mr Cameron. He wrote ‘me versus DC’, followed by ‘decency, principle and values’. In a further self-motivational message, Mr Miliband also wrote the words ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ connected by an arrow. The Labour leader’s notes also reveal that several of his most successful ripostes were carefully scripted in advance. Last night, a Labour spokesman said: ‘These notes will come as no surprise. They explain why and how Ed took on David Cameron over the NHS and living standards' Looking down: Labour Party leader Ed Miliband leaves MediaCityUK in Salford following the televised leaders' election debate . For example, after Mr Cameron reminded the Labour leader of his alleged plan to ‘weaponise’ the NHS, Mr Miliband’s quickfire retort – ‘I would say to everybody at home: Use your vote as a weapon to fight for the future of the health service’ – was drawn virtually word for word from his notes. Last night, a Labour spokesman said: ‘These notes will come as no surprise. They explain why and how Ed took on David Cameron over the NHS and living standards. ‘They also show how Ed set out a positive vision for the future with Labour’s better plan, including on zero-hours contracts, lower tuition fees and rents.’ Our surveys said: After four opinion polls were released, the average poll of polls put Mr Cameron narrowly ahead on 22 per cent, with 21.5 per cent saying Mr Miliband won, 21 per cent backing Mr Farage and 20 per cent favouring Miss Sturgeon .","Labour leader's secret cribsheets revealed his peculiar set of reminders .

"Punters have reacted with a mixture of amusement and fury to the announcement Future Music Festival will not return to Australia in 2016. Many people were genuinely upset over the cancellation - blaming the festival organisers for sending themselves broke by spending too much money on headline acts Drake and Avicii. But others were quick to make fun of Future festival goers, blaming 'shirtless f***wits' for ruining the festival and joking that 'gym memberships and ecstasy dealers' would be hardest hit.

Punters have reacted with a mixture amusement and fury to the announcement Future Music Festival will not return to Australia in 2016 . 'What will we do with all the d*****bags in singlets?' Adam Connelly joked on Twitter. 'BUT WHERE WILL I WALK AROUND WITHOUT A SHIRT WHILST ON PINGAZ?!' Jake Finnigan posted on Facebook. More than 230 people were arrested over drug-related offences at Future Music Festival events around the country, which took place in Sydney, Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane between February 28 and March 9. On Thursday, organisers of the annual event released a statement announcing that it has been cancelled. Many people were genuinely upset over the announcement - blaming the festival organisers for sending themselves broke by spending too much money on headline acts Drake and Avicii . In a statement it was explained that due to low ticket sales and high operational costs, the festival could not continue . In the beginning: The festival first began in 2006 as a standalone one day festival in Sydney . 'It’s been a difficult decision to make but in the end travelling the festival in its current form across Australia simply doesn’t make financial sense anymore' the statement read. Following Thursday's announcement, music fans took to social media to express their disappointment. 'I've been to 5 out of the last 6 futures in Sydney and it's always been my favourite festival. However it was pretty obvious with your lineup this year that there was trouble in the camp,' Matt Duffy wrote on Facebook. 'I reckon Avicii and Drake alone would of sent you broke! I hope some people get crucified for this!' Following Thursday's announcement, music fans took to social media to express their disappointment . The decision comes just one month after the festival made its way through the major cities in the country . Meanwhile Faith Van Lith posted: 'These ""superstar"" DJs need to stop charging such retarded amounts of money they are destroying their own industry.' Another fan posted on Twitter: 'Future Music festival [because] DJs charge way too much. I mean is it really necessary to charge 250K for an hour?' Promoting company Mushroom Group released a subsequent statement explaining the decision. 'Despite the considerable critical acclaim of the 2015 festival, the last two years of ticket sales for the festival have underperformed, meaning Future Music Festival will not be returning in 2016'. Last time: The decision came just one month after the festival made its way around the country and was headlined by Avicii . On stage: Canadian rapper Drake was also a co-headliner at the dance festival this year . The decision comes just one month after the festival made its way through the major cities in the country this year, which was headlined by rapper Drake and DJ Avicii. Speaking to The Music  Group Chairman Michael Gudinski said: '...the cost to physically stage the events has significantly increased, even in just two years.' 'The fluctuating dollar also hasn’t helped and the increasing popularity of EDM [electronic dance music] in the States has seen DJ fees escalating out of control.' Mixing it up: Known for blending dance and rap artists in to the lineup, Macklemore performed on the 2014 bill . Gudinski believes that touring festivals will eventually be phased out altogether in Australia. '...Australia is following a trend that’s already been seen in America where touring festivals have become a thing of the past...Instead, stand-alone location festivals such as Coachella and Lollapalooza are going from strength to strength.' There is some positive news for disappointed fans as it was confirmed that the under 18 version of the festival, Good Life will continue. Crowd favoruites: Dance group The Prodigy performed at this years festival as well in 2013 and 2010 .

"A series of unpublished love letters from Mexican artist Frida Kahlo to her lover Jose Bartoli are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 when the passionate missives go up for auction later this . During her marriage to muralist Diego Rivera, Frida penned the letters to Jose, a Catalan artist whom she met while she was recovering from surgery in New York. Their steamy correspondence began shortly after she returned to Mexico following the trip and continued throughout their secret three-year romance. 'I don’t know how to write love letters. But I wanted to tell you that my whole being opened for you,' then-39-year-old Frida wrote in October of 1946. Scroll down for video . Secret romance: Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (pictured) wrote passionate love letters to Jose Bartoli from 1946 and 1949 while she was married to muralist Diego Rivera . Enduring love: A collection of 25 of the unpublished letters will be auctioned off at Doyle New York on April 15 . She continued: 'Since I fell in love with you everything is transformed and is full of beauty… love is like an aroma, like a current, like rain.' The letters, 25 of which are headed to auction at Doyle New York on April 15, were written in Spanish between August 1946 and November 1949 and saved by Jose until his death in 1995. The archive of passionate messages, which comprise more than 100 pages, were passed down through different generations his family until they reached the current owner. According to Frida Kahlo biographer Hayden Herrera, the artist told Jose to sign his letters as 'Sonja' so that Diego would think they were from a woman if he came across them. High price: The letters (pictured) are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 dollars . Pet names: Frida signed her letters to Jose 'Mara', which biographer Hayden Herrera explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her . Creative couple: Jose, a Catalan artist, can be seen sitting at an easel as he works on a painting . Handle with care: This letter from the archive shows a stain on the right hand corner of the paper . Famous works: In this letter, Frida refers to 'Tree of Hope', a painting she created shortly after she met Jose . Diego, a muralist and a notorious Lothario, who once had an affair with Frida's younger sister Cristina, endured Frida's love affairs with women, but her relationships with other men would drive him to bouts of crazed jealousy. Meanwhile, Frida inscribed her letters with the name 'Mara', which Hayden explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her. The collection also includes an original drawing of a sleeping cat, pressed flowers, ribbon, beads and drafts of a few of Jose's responses. Frida's candid messages to her lover shed light on her important paintings, an unknown pregnancy and her relationship with Diego, as well as her adoration for her Jose. Full package: The letters also include an original drawing of a sleeping cat and drafts of a few of Jose's responses . Sketch artist: Frida sent Jose this drawing of a tree in reference to 'The Tree of Life' City living: Frida posed for this photo in front of a skyline. She and Jose met when she was recovering from surgery in a hospital in New York . Long distance love: Frida ended this letter to Jose with a kiss, leaving behind a lipstick print of her mouth . Their secret affair began when Frida, who was left a partial cripple after a 1925 bus accident, was recovering from a spinal fusion performed in June, 1946 at New York’s Hospital for Special Surgery. Frida's sister Cristina was the one to introduce her to Jose, who moved to New York after fighting in the Spanish Civil War. They fell in love during his visits to the hospital and continued their long-distance courtship after she returned to Mexico. After Frida sold her 1946 painting Tree of Hope, which was inspired by her recent surgery, she wrote to Jose about his words influenced her creation. 'I remembered your last words and I began to paint,' she explained. 'I worked all morning and when I finished eating I kept on painting until there was no more light. But afterward I felt so tired and everything hurt.' An artist's life: Frida was photographed holding this statue while she stood in front of a blue cement wall . Inspired work: Frida sketched this drawing of a sleeping cat and sent it to Jose . Added images: This letter featured a picture of a women sleeping in a bed while another walked away .

In the painting one version of Frida lies in a hospital bed, while another depiction of herself sits proudly while holding a flag. While painting the piece, Frida inscribed 'Tree of Hope Keep Firm' a line of a song that she and Jose both liked. According to Hayden, Frida wrote in several of her letters to Jose that she had missed her period, in a way that suggested she was in some ways hoping to have his baby despite knowing it was nearly impossible because of her spinal injury. 'If I were not in the condition I am in now and if it were a reality, nothing in my life would give me more joy. Can you imagine a little Bartoli or a Mara?' she wrote.

"A man has filed a suit claiming he was almost killed by a retired police officer. Anthony Corrales of New Jersey claims he was driving with his wife and daughter, 10, last June near Resorts World Casino in the Queens section of New York City when a car cut in front of him after refusing to let him change lanes. He then claims that when he got out of the car to get the car's license plate number, he was mowed down by the car, and driven for several blocks at breakneck speed by the driver - a retired police officer with the New York Police Department named Robert Muller. Anthony Corrales has filed a suit claiming he was almost killed by a retired NYPD officer who was then let off the hook by fellow cops . The incident occured last June outside the Resorts World Casino (above) 'We almost crashed into him and the car behind me almost crashed into me,' Corrales told the New York Daily News of the initial incident. Corrales then said he got out of his car at a red light to take the license plate number, while Muller disputes this and claims the man followed him into the casino parking light. That is when things intensified between the two. 'He turned the wheels and I heard wheels screeching,' Corrales said. 'He hit me with the car and took off with me on the car and he was going fast.' Corrlaes claims he held on the windshield wipers to make sure he did not fall off the car, and a few blocks later Muller stooped and he was able to get off. He said of the incident; 'Seriously, the dude wanted to kill me. The look on his face was pure hate. There was an older woman and a kid in the car and I could hear them screaming at him to stop.' When he returned to his car however, police arrived on the scene and arrested Corrales for menacing behavior, harassment and cracking Muller's windshield. Muller meanwhile was let off the hook, claiming it was Corrales who jumped on the hood of his car after telling him; 'Get out of the car tough guy.' Video footage from the casino does show Corrales being driven on the hood of the car, but what happened prior to that is unclear. 'Instead of deterring Mr. Muller from future dangerous acts of road rage, the police ensured that he can continue to use his car as a weapon with impunity,' said Corrales’ lawyer Leo Glickman. 'They’re all pals and friends,' said Corrales of Muller and the police. Muller has yet to comment.","Anthony Corrales claims he was driving with his wife and daughter last June near a casino in New York City when a car cut in front of him .

"The former Miss Italy finalist who has accused film mogul Harvey Weinstein of molesting her tried to use the accusation to secure a movie role, it has been alleged. Ambra Battilana, 22, did not 'co-operate' with authorities for four days after her initial report to police saying she was groped by Weinstein during a 'business meeting' at his office in Manhattan. It has been claimed the delay was because the Italian model and her manager were working behind the scenes to try and land her a film role. But once the 'pipe dream' came to nothing, she decided to pursue the criminal case, sources told the New York Post. See below for video . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan last Friday night . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . After filing her police report on Friday, March 27, Battilana was eventually interviewed by Manhattan DA prosecutors on Wednesday, April 1, at the NYPD Special Victims Squad's office in East Harlem. Sources told the New York Post her former lawyer, Mark Jay Heller, withdrew from the case as he was concerned Battilana did not appear to be a 'serious victim'. The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and even tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat. But her new lawyer, David Godosky, refuted the claims, saying: 'She immediately went to the police, immediately cooperating with the Special Victims Squad.' Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse yesterday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Weinstein, who has produced several Oscar-winning films, such as Shakespeare in Love, Pulp Fiction and The King's Speech, is said to have met Battilana on Thursday last week at the opening of a show at Radio City Music Hall. The next day he invited her for a business meeting at his Tribeca Film Festival office on Friday night. She claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she exited the building half an hour after arriving, it has been reported. Mr Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, but a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed. 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he was aware he was being monitored, but following the call and the meeting, he voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and ever tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . Weinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a suspect past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. It was also revealed she told Italian police in 2010 she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with €2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . The relationship ended when she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Weinstein to 'discuss business'","Ambra Battilana, 22, did not 'co-operate' with authorities for four days .

"An eight-year-old boy who was made an outcast in his village and described by his own family as a 'ticking time bomb' because he has HIV has been given a home at last. In a case that was condemned around the world, Luo Kun Kun was expelled from his village when locals - including his own grandfather - signed a petition to banish him to 'protect villagers' health'. Following that cold-hearted decision, the mournful child explained how, 'nobody plays with me, I play alone'. But now a specialist school in Linfen, a city in southern Shanxi Province, has stepped in to help. The Red Ribbon School is the only school in China equipped to look after and educate HIV-positive children. Kun Kun was refused admission to schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone . The five-year-old has now been admitted a place at the Red Ribbon School in Linfen, China, . After being banished from his village, Kun Kun finally has a home where he is cared for and looked after . Kun Kun contracted the virus from his mother when she was pregnant with him, but was only diagnosed when he was five years old. His mother and stepfather worked in other provinces, so he was raised near the town of Xichong with his non-blood-related grandparents, who had adopted his stepfather as a child. The boy was refused admission to local schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone. When he was diagnosed, his grandparents found themselves isolated in their village of Shufangya in south-eastern China's Sichuan province and so sided with the locals. At a special meeting on December 7 last year, 203 village residents signed a petition asking the authorities to 'carry out preventative isolation measures by taking Kun Kun away from the village, and protect the health of the villagers and children'. It went on to say that Kun Kun 'provokes fear among the community'. He was also referred to as a 'ticking time bomb'. Wang Yishu, party chief of Shufangya village, said: 'The villagers sympathise with him, he is innocent, and only a small child. But his AIDS is too scary for us'. Kun Kun was forced to play alone in his home village, but has now been admitted to a specialist school . The Sichuan government contacted the school in Linfen when Kun Kun's plight made worldwide headlines . However the future is now looking up for Kun Kun, after he was given a place at the boarding school last week. The Sichuan government contacted the school in Linfen when Kun Kun's desperate plight made worldwide headlines. Headteacher Guo Xiaoping said: 'A good social and educational environment is important for Kun Kun and with the help of teachers, he is more open and polite than before'. He added: 'Kun Kun's physical strength is notably below that of the other students. Fortunately, he has been sent here in time, and started taking medication last November. At Kunkun's age, it's crucial that he undergoes proper treatment.' Kun Kun did not say a word when he arrived at the school, according to the headteacher, but can study and talk like a normal student now. The devastating case of Kun Kun has highlighted the stigma attached to the disease in China . The child was forced out of his village when villagers signed a petition asking the authorities to remove him . The petition signed by villagers said Kun Kun 'provokes fear among the community' and referred to him as a 'ticking time bomb' Knowledge of HIV/AIDS in China is worse in poor, rural areas, such as the community Kun Kun is from . Kun Kun was banished from the village of Shufangya, near the town of Xichong (shown on this map) The case of Kun Kun has highlighted the stigma attached to the disease in China, where many sufferers face widespread discrimination. The problem is so great, even medical workers sometimes refuse to touch those diagnosed with the disease. The latest figures released by China's National Health and Family Planning Commission showed a total of 497,000 people in China have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS since the country's first case in 1985. China has a population of 1.36billion. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS is worse in poor, rural areas, such as the community Kun Kun is from, experts have said. Officials are reportedly planning to educate the villagers who banished Kun Kun through a campaign. The Nanjing-based anti-discrimination NGO Justice for All wrote a letter to party chiefs in Sichuan calling on them to punish school chiefs and local officials for their 'Cultural Revolution style', a reference to the Mao Zedong-inspired public denunciations of 'foes'. 'We cannot imagine how Kun Kun will grow up and look back on the experience of childhood,' said a draft of the letter.","Luo Kun Kun expelled from his village in China when diagnosed with HIV .

"A man has been arrested and bailed following the 'suspicious' death of a woman found floating in the water at a boat club - just hours after a children's Easter Egg hunt took place in the grounds. The victim, who has not been formally identified but is thought to be in her 60s, was discovered at Derby Motor Boat Club in Sawley, Leicestershire, on Sunday night. A 65-year-old man was arrested in connection with her death before being released on police bail. The woman's body was found at Derby Motor Boat Club in Sawley on the River Trent (pictured) The club's Rear Commodore, Steve Bilbie, said: 'We are very upset, but we can't say anything else' The area was cordoned off for forensic examination and detectives say the investigation is in its 'early stages'. A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said a post-mortem examination had failed to establish a cause of death and that results of further tests would not be known 'for some time'. Detective Chief Inspector Mick Graham, who is leading the investigation, said: 'At this stage we're treating the incident as a suspicious death. 'Officers will be carrying out inquiries locally to locate potential witnesses to any activity around the marina yesterday evening. Police at the scene today - officers are continuing to investigate the woman's 'suspicious' death . A 65-year-old man has been arrested and released on bail in relation to the woman's death . 'If you have any information which you believe may be able to assist us then please get in touch.' The woman's body was discovered at around 10.21pm on Sunday in the marina in Warren Lane. The Derby Motor Boat club, which has an annual fee of £750, was founded in 1938 by a group of local businessmen.

"Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered £20 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.' Allegations: The rapidly-expanding mobile taxi service has been plagued by claims that drivers are not vetted .

Former Manchester United footballer Roy Keane will stand trial over an alleged road-rage incident with a taxi driver. The 43-year-old has denied committing a public order offence after it was claimed he behaved aggressively towards driver Fateh Kerar, 44, near traffic lights in Altrincham, Cheshire. He did not attend a brief hearing at Trafford Magistrates' Court today but a not guilty plea was entered on his behalf by his lawyer following the incident on January 30. He is accused of causing harassment, alarm or distress to Altrincham-based Mr Kerar - a Section 4A Public Order offence. The court heard the prosecution will call two witnesses - understood to be Mr Kerar and a taxi passenger - while the defence will call Keane and an additional witness. No CCTV of the incident was captured, the court also heard. Keane will face trial at Manchester Magistrates' Court on June 19. Keane, from Hale, Cheshire, enjoyed a trophy-laden career at Old Trafford and also played for Nottingham Forest and Celtic.

"It is the Facebook update everyone hates to read, but we all love posting. And now that status update about jetting off on holiday is set to be even easier after Virgin Atlantic announced it would allow each passenger one Facebook login for free so they can post an update from 35,000ft. The #SkyhighSelfie is one of the unusual extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes, alongside mood lighting to help with jetlag, windows that can be darkened with a touch of a button and full length windows in the toilets. Scroll down for video . All guests on the new Virgin 787 Dreamliner routes will be able to take a selfie and share it on Facebook, with specially-selected cabin shots advised . Developed in conjunction with Jiffybots, this bespoke Facebook application will allow customers to check in free of charge and share their location and photos with their friends and followers mid-flight. Virgin Atlantic is also developing certain #SkyhighSelfie spots in the cabin to offer customers the chance to take the perfect selfie onboard and share their experience. The first selfie spot will go live on Birthday Girl, the first of its 787 aircraft to be purchased, from this month and customers can take their picture with the iconic Virgin Atlantic Flying Lady carrying her celebratory champagne coupe. The app will also act as a sky high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air creating an onboard community. To access the free wifi and check in on Facebook, upload their photo or participate in the onboard discussion form, all customers need to do is click on a specially created link and log in. The mood lighting is available in all classes aboard Virgin's Dreamliner, helping passengers adjust to time zones . The 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable comes on as the plane flattens out on its journey . Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic said: 'This is just one area of our ongoing developments with technology as the connectivity on board our new 787s allows us to deliver innovative and unique digital experiences for our customers. 'Connectivity is a key focus moving forward for Virgin Atlantic and we'll continue the roll out across our fleet over the next two years.' Other key features include full-length mirrors in the bathroom, and special mood lighting. The bar area in business class has been changed so customers can even have meetings face-to-face over a glass of wine, while right, the staff will be able to help you get that perfect selfie . The lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind, fall asleep and even adjust time zones. On boarding the aircraft, a soft 'rose champagne' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey. This then changes into 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into 'amber warmth' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining. To help passengers drift into a deep sleep, 'silver moonlight' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky. Virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent Wi-Fi . One of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social. Two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other, we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar. Colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting. The innovative fixtures will be featured on all Virgin Atlantic's 787 Dreamliner routes .","Customers in all areas of the plane will be able to share one selfie shot on Facebook .

"Amelia Rose Jones was allegedly murdered by her grandfather Mark Jones when she was 41 days old . A grandfather accused of murdering his baby granddaughter complained she was a 'bloody nightmare' when he looked after her the day before she was rushed to hospital, a court heard. Mark Jones is accused of killing 41-day-old Amelia Rose Jones at his daughter's terraced home in Pontnewydd, south east Wales. The youngster died of a bleed to the brain after being rushed to hospital on the evening she was being babysat by her grandfather. Miss Jones, 25, told Newport Crown Court that after she had left her baby in the care of her father for the first time on November 16 to go on an evening out with her friends she returned home and he said he had had a difficult night with the child. She said: 'When I came home he told me Amelia had been a bloody nightmare ... I didn't think anything of it at the time. 'I trusted him with my life and my children. I had no reason not to. He was my father.' Jones, 45, of Cwmbran, denies murder. His defence is he dropped Amelia on two separate nights - first after accidentally slipping on a toy and then after suddenly fainting. But his daughter claims he never mentioned slipping over when she returned on November 16. The next day the child was being looked after by her grandfather while her mother went to the cinema. Before she returned, Jones made a 999 call saying he had gone to make a cup of coffee but came back to find the baby having difficulty breathing. She was rushed to Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport where medics managed to restore her pulse. But after failing to get her breathing the baby was quickly transferred for specialist treatment at University Hospital Wales in Cardiff. She could not be brought back to consciousness and had suffered injuries to her brain, and died on November 19. It is the prosecution's case a possible motive for the killing was the defendant's strong dislike of Amelia's father Ian Skillern, who had finished his relationship with Miss Jones before the birth of their child. The jury has already heard Jones and Mr Skillern could not be in the same room with each other. Miss Jones told the court that on November 14 - days before her daughter's death - her father had made a strange comment about her baby. She said: 'Just as he was leaving he said 'even though I don't like her father I don't hold grudges against a baby'. It was a really strange thing to say and came out of the blue.' Mark Jones, 45, is being tried before a jury at Newport Crown Court after denying his granddaughter's murder . Sarah also recalled an incident where she had left Amelia with her father during a shopping trip - and upon her return she found the baby screaming 'like never before'. She told the court Jones blamed the crying fit on another child - something which she said she had no reason to doubt at the time. Miss Jones also revealed how her father - who had little to do with her as a child until she was 16 - previously duped her into thinking he was gravely ill and even posed as a doctor in bogus phone calls as he tried to mend their broken relationship. Amelia was rushed to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after her grandfather dialled emergency services . The jury has also been told Jones, of Cwmbran in south east Wales, admitted to attempting to pervert the course of justice after lying to police about a teenage boy accidentally hurting Amelia. Prosecution counsel Paul Lewis said the defendant's 'detailed and calculated lies' demonstrated the lengths Jones was prepared to go to 'to try and conceal the truth about Amelia's injuries'. High Court judge Wyn Williams said he expects the trial to go on until the end of April. The case continues.

"A couple pocketed £66,000 in a benefits scam by pretending to be landlord and tenant - despite having three children together. Sikander Rafiq, 34, and Samara Jabreen, 32, lied to Birmingham City Council about their relationship in a scam spanning an eight year period. The couple, from Ward End, Birmingham, claimed £66,268 housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support. Sikander Rafiq, 34, and Samara Jabreen, 32, lied to Birmingham City Council about their relationship in a scam spanning an eight year period. The couple, from Ward End, pocketed £66,268 housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support . Birmingham Crown Court heard Jabreen first lodged a genuine claim for income support in 2002. But three years later, when Rafiq bought them a house, Jabreen claimed to be a private tenant and asked that her benefit payments be made to her landlord, Rafiq. Blondelle Thompson, prosecuting, said Jabreen also signed declarations saying neither she nor her children were related to Rafiq. She even claimed single occupancy discount on her council tax payments, the court was told. Jabreen pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to notify a change of circumstances and a charge of making a false representation. Rafiq admitted a charge of furnishing false information regarding the tenancy agreement provided to the city council. But after hearing of her ill-health and that she was the sole carer for their children, Jabreen was spared prison. She was sentenced to 22 weeks, suspended for 18 months, placed under supervision for 18 months and ordered to attend the Anawim probation project for 30 days. Rafiq, it was heard, acted out of desperation to pay their mortgage rather than through greed. He was handed an 18-month sentence, suspended for 18 months and ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work. Birmingham Crown Court heard Jabreen first lodged a genuine claim for income support in 2002. But three years later, when Rafiq bought them a house, Jabreen claimed to be a private tenant and asked that her benefit payments be made to her landlord, Rafiq . Miss Thompson said: 'At no time did she declare Rafiq was her partner or father of her children.' In October 2011 a report was made to the city council's fraud investigation team, prompting an investigation. Ms Thompson added: 'The house was put under surveillance and his car was seen daily and was used by Jabreen.' Life insurance documents and a Virgin Media account were both registered to Rafiq at the couple's address. Judge Roderick Henderson said Rafiq was a 'dishonest' man who had once posed as his brother to avoid getting a criminal record. He said: 'As far as you are concerned I get a very clear picture of a person who is dishonest and bends things to whatever benefits you at a particular time. 'You both pleaded guilty but when you came back to be sentenced you wanted to vacate your plea because you said you were not guilty at all. 'You then turned up and entered a guilty plea but put forward a false basis. You have behaved not only in a dishonest way in the history of the case but before the court.' Jabreen, the judge said, had played a lesser role and had been encouraged by Rafiq.","Sikander Rafiq and Samara Jabreen were in an eight year relationship .

"Fighter pilots flying the deadly F-35 Lightning II jet have very special  secret weapon - a $400,000 helmet that allows them to see through the plane. Six infrared cameras mounted around the aircraft allow its pilots to 'look through' the air-frame, giving them a perfect 360 degree view of their surroundings and enemies. And all of the information they need to complete their mission - airspeed, altitude and even warnings systems - are projected straight onto the helmet's visor rather than the traditional 'heads-up display'. Scroll down for videos . High-tech: The F-35 jet's $400,000 helmet (pictured) gives the pilot a 360 degree view around their aircraft and even allows them to see through its frame . Complex: The six infrared cameras placed around the plane means that when the pilot looks down, they see the world below them in their visor . Problems: Its staggering $400,000 price tag is millions more than the original budget because of problems in its development . Destructive: The F-35 Lightning II is considered one of the most complex pieces of weaponry ever and is programmed with 8 million lines of software code, compared to an F-22 Raptor's 1.7 million . 'When the helmet's tuned correctly to the pilot's eyes, you almost step into this other world where all this information comes in,' a test pilot for the Lockhead Martin, the plane's prime contractor told the Washington Post. Al Norman added: 'You can look through the jet's eyeballs to see the world as the jet sees the world.' Like the jet - which is estimated to cost around $1.5trillion to develop over the next 50 years - the helmet is incredibly expensive. Each custom-made piece of high-tech headgear costs nearly half a million dollars, which is reportedly millions over its original budget due to development problems. Earlier versions of the helmet did not deal well with turbulence and there was a delay in the state-of-the-art video system which caused motion sickness, the Washington Post reports. There was also a green glow in the night vision function that obscured the pilots' vision and in 2011, the Pentagon allegedly hired BAE Systems to build a backup. The F-35 Lightning II has what is considered to be 'one of the most complicated weapons systems ever'. Whereas a fighter jet like the F-22 Raptor is programmed with around 1.7 million lines of software code, the F-35 has up to a staggering 8 million. It comes in three versions, including one that is designed to take off and land on an aircraft carrier and another that lands vertically like a harrier jet. Trouble: Earlier versions of the helmet did not deal well with turbulence and there was a delay in the state-of-the-art video system which caused motion sickness . State-of-the-art: The information which would usually be on the 'heads-up display' - airspeed, altitude and even warnings systems - is projected straight onto the helmet's visor . Joint attack: The helmet is so advanced that it allows pilots to share information with other F-35 jets nearby . Military force: The U.S. government estimated the F-35 would cost around $1.5trillion to develop over the next 50 years . The helmet incredibly allows pilots to share information with other F-35's near it but that function has also had teething problems, the program's executive officer. Air Force Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan said: 'If one or two jets are flying together, they have been able to share information seamlessly. 'But when there are four jets, communication problems emerge, which can 'create an inaccurate picture for the pilot.' The Pentagon's astonishing estimate for the lifetime cost an F-35 is up almost $120billion from about year ago. But it still plans to buy 2,443 of the warplanes that can evade radar detection and can reach well over supersonic speed. The new estimate includes maintenance costs of around $1.1trillion over the plane's lifetime, the price of the aircraft itself which is $332billion and another $63.8billion for the engine. The fighter jet's developers Lockhead Martin say 'the supersonic, multi-role F-35 represents a quantum leap' in airborne warfare. Its 'advanced stealth' allows it to fly over areas without being detected by sophisticated radar systems that other jets cannot. Its constructors claim it can be used for a range of missions which include air-to-air combat, ground strikes, electronic attack and even reconnaissance because it is such a versatile machine. Its 'advanced electronic warfare' function allow it to locate and track enemy forces and even jam their radars. The state-of-the-art helmet - which costs $400,000 - give the pilot real-time access to battle space information with 360-degree coverage of their surroundings. The F-35’s stealth capabilities and ability to carry weapons inside it's airframe mean it can engage its targets from long-range without being detected. Lockhead Martin says the F-35 'will enter the battlespace first, clearing the way' for  coalition forces. The company describes it as the 'quarterback' for a joint strike force because it can share what it sees with other jets nearby, expanding the 'situational awareness across the entire network of aircraft'.","Six infrared cameras around the jet give pilots a complete 360 degree view .

Yesterday, Allie, 21, based in Minneapolis, delivered her beau the ten-question document, which she dubbed 'The Official Allie Davis Relationship Test', and informed him that he must score at least 60 per cent 'to stay in the relationship'. She posted the results of the not-entirely-serious stunt on Twitter, revealing that her boyfriend of two-and-a-half years had passed with a score of 80 per cent, for diligently answering questions mainly about Beyonce's songs.

Allie's very obedient boyfriend scrawled in response: 'A billion dollars, and Jay Z got punched.' This question referred to last year's legendary family fracas at New York's Met Gala, when Beyonce's sister Solange Knowles viciously attacked Beyonce's husband Jay Z following a heated row. Beyonce, 33, later mysteriously sang in her Flawless remix with fellow songstress Nicki Minaj: 'Of course sometimes s**t goes down when there’s a billion dollars on an elevator.'

"A man has died after falling from an apartment balcony while he was on the phone to his new wife. 29-year-old Pankaj Saw fell three storeys from a Macquarie Park balcony to his death on Thursday, while talking to his wife in India. Emergency services were called to the unit block on Cottonwood Crescent at 1am, however Mr Saw died at the scene from serious head and internal injuries. Scroll down for video . 29-year-old Pankaj Saw (right) fell three storeys from a Macquarie Park balcony to his death on Wednesday night, while talking to his wife in India . It is believed Mr Saw was leaning on a wooden railing that ran across the top of the balcony and it gave way falling to the concrete metres below. Mr Saw was in Australia on a long-stay work visa, and had been working on and off in Sydney in recent years. He was a systems support analyst for an IT firm and carried out work for Optus. Mr Saw returned to Australia on March 15 after spending six months in India, where he got married, colleagues say. Emergency services were called to the unit block on Cottonwood Crescent however Mr Saw died at the scene from serious head and internal injuries . Mr Saw was on the phone to his wife back in India at the time of the tragic fall . Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Howard Ryan, director of Housesafe, said he believed that the collapse was an accident waiting to happen after taking a look at pictures of the bracket which attaches the balcony to the wall. Mr Ryan said it appeared that rail 'has not been installed in a prudent, compliant and safe manner.' 'The metal bracket is installed in reverse, therefore the horizontal timber railing after a period of time has rotted and the fixings have pulled through the timber upon pressure of the deceased leaning on the railing pushing the timber outwards and him falling,' he said . Grief-stricken friends and workmates, including the two with whom he shared his unit, gathered at his apartment on Thursday. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph , Howard Ryan, director of Housesafe, said he believed that the collapse was an accident waiting to happen after taking a look at pictures of the bracket which attaches the balcony to the wall . Mr Saw was in Australia on a long-stay work visa, and had been working on and off in Sydney in recent years . His manager Karen Waller remembered Mr Saw as man full of life and energy. 'He is going to be badly missed,' she said. 'We just hope that something is done about what has happened here. 'You can tell that something obviously wasn't quite right about this apartment.' Investigators are looking at whether a structural fault contributed to Mr Saw's fatal fall. Detective Inspector Richard Puffett said police wanted to be sure all aspects of the balcony and the unit's structure were safe and sound. Police also hope to speak to the person who helped Mr Saw before paramedics arrived at the Cottonwood Crescent property.","29-year-old Pankaj Saw feel to his death from a Macquarie Park balcony .

"Tracy Morgan looks to be improving as he was spotted out with his family on Monday. Still, he appeared to strain and wince as he joined his fiancee Megan Wollover and their daughter Maven as they did some shopping in New Jersey. It comes almost one year after he was first hospitalized following a tragic accident which claimed the life of his friend James McNair and injured three others. Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury as well as a broken leg, a broken nose and broken ribs in the accident. Scroll down for video . Tracy Morgan was seen in public looking greatly improved as he walked with a cane on Monday, almost a year after his horrific auto accident . Morgan was accompanied by his fiancee Megan Wollover and their daughter Maven (above) for a shopping trip in new Jersey . This comes a little over a month after Morgan was forced to miss the Saturday Night Live 40th anniversary special, though he was acknowledged for his many contributions to the show in which his 30 Rock castmates Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin introduced one of his most famous characters, the eccentric zoologist Brian Fellows. Morgan's attorney recently revealed Morgan is still struggling to simply return 'to the way he was' after this trauma. Morgan was critically injured in early June when a Wal-Mart tractor-trailer rammed into a limousine bus he and his friends were travelling in on the New Jersey Turnpike. The comedian was returning home to New York City from a show at a Delaware casino. He spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home, and the extent of his brain injury is still unknown. 'He's fighting to get better, and if there's a chance for him to be back to the Tracy Morgan he once was, he's going to try to do that,' said his lawyer Benedict Morelli last November. 'But we just don't know because of the severity of the injuries that he sustained and the fact that he had such a severe brain injury.' The actor did appear much better than the last time he was spotted earlier this month, also walking with a cane. The driver of the tractor-trailer, Kevin Roper, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in a New Jersey state court. New Jersey State Police at the scene of the multi-vehicle accident on the New Jersey Turnpike last June . Morgan with his fiancee and daughter last March, just moths before the accident . Last December, Morgan and his attorneys accused Wal-Mart of stalling in a federal lawsuit they have brought against the company over their safety practices after it was reported that Roper was asleep at the wheel at the time of the crash. Following the incident, Roper took to Twitter to deny claims he was under the influence at the time of the accident, saying; 'I was never charged at the scene of the accident because once again i was not guilty of any crime. Not until all the TV cameras came.' The Georgia resident also stated that he felt 'horrible' and 'wished it was him who was hurt' before writing; 'So yes i am now most likely f****d because i had an unfortunate ACCIDENT with the wrong car that night.' Roper recently asked a judge to delay Morgan's lawsuit against Wal-Mart until his criminal case in New Jersey is settled. Morgan was forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold after the accident, though his new film with Chris Rock, Take Five, was released in December. He came out against Wal-Mart in a public statement this past September after they accused him of being at fault during the accident for not wearing a seatbelt. 'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused,' he said at the time. 'I'm fighting hard every day to get back.'","Tracy Morgan was seen in public looking greatly improved as he walked with a cane on Monday, almost a year after his horrific auto accident .

"The Earth could be suffering from shifts in its biochemical balance similar to those believed to have wiped out half of all life 200 million years ago. This is according to a British study that has discovered a catastrophic condition called 'marine photic zone euxinia' took place in one of the prehistoric oceans. This happens when the sun-lit surface waters of the ocean become devoid of oxygen and are poisoned by hydrogen sulphide. Life of the Triassic met a choking end in a runaway greenhouse climate, heating the seas into warm stagnation, according to a new study. Pictured is an artist's impression of what may have happened in the oceans 200 million years ago.  The study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences . Hydrogen sulphide is a by-product of micro-organisms that live without oxygen and is extremely toxic to most other lifeforms. The study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences caused by the amount of carbon dioxide being created through the burning of fossil fuels. A team lead by the University of Southampton studied fossilised organic molecules taken from sedimentary rocks that originally accumulated on the bottom of the north-eastern Panthalassic Ocean, which surrounded the continent of Pangaea. The rocks are now exposed on the Queen Charlotte Islands, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. A team lead by the University of Southampton studied fossilised organic molecules taken from sedimentary rocks that originally accumulated on the bottom of the north-eastern Panthalassic Ocean. The rocks are now exposed on the Queen Charlotte Islands, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada . The experts found signs of bacteria which had suffered severe oxygen depletion and hydrogen sulphide poisoning which would have been caused by massive volcanic rifts in the Earth's tectonic plates. 'As tectonic plates shifted to break up Pangaea, huge volcanic rifts would have spewed carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures from the greenhouse effect,' said Professor Jessica Whiteside. 'The rapid rises in CO2 would have triggered changes in ocean circulation, acidification and deoxygenation. The Panthalassic Ocean was the vast global ancestral Pacific ocean that surrounded the supercontinent Pangaea, during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras . 'These changes have the potential to disrupt nutrient cycles and alter food chains essential for the survival of marine ecosystems. Our data now provides direct evidence that anoxic, and ultimately euxinic, conditions severely affected food chains. 'The same CO2 rise that led to the oxygen-depleted oceans also led to a mass extinction on land, and ultimately to the ecological takeover by dinosaurs, although the mechanisms are still under study.' She explained that although the Earth was very different during the Triassic period, the rate of carbon dioxide release from volcanic rifts are similar to those we are experiencing now through the burning of fossil fuels. Professor Whiteside added: 'The release of CO2 was probably at least as rapid as that caused by the burning of fossil fuels today, although the initial concentrations were much higher in the Triassic. 'The consequences of rapidly rising CO2 in ancient times inform us of the possible consequences of our own carbon dioxide crisis.' Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth . Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species.","The rate of CO2 released from burning fossil fuels has increased .

"The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, says  he may never again see out of one eye. 'I am sightless in my right eye,' he told Fusion and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. Reid said he is 'over' the fear that he may not regain vision in that eye following a New Year's Day exercise accident that left him battered and bruised because 'I can’t see out of my eye, and that’s the way it’s going to be until something comes along that’ll change it.' 'Right now, I’ve had 11 hours of surgery. They’ve tried. I can’t see out of my right eye. And that’s okay, I can live with that,' he said, according to Fusion. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is pictured here on Monday in his home state of Nevada. Reid said in an interview this week that he might not ever be able to see out of his right eye again following a January accident . The lawmaker's tale of how he came to sustain broken bones in his face while working out in his Nevada home with a plastic exercise band is one that has been questioned, mostly by conservatives, especially after Reid announced last month that he would retire. A March 31 Breitbart News story regaled the layout of Reid's Searchlight home and the master bathroom, where Reid says the accident occurred. Rumors have persisted since the January 1 accident that the Nevada mob may have been involved, even though there's no evidence to suggest the Reid was the victim of an organized attack. Last week the conservative Powerline blog suggested that Reid may have been beat up by his brother, Larry. Recounting a story brought forward by a man who says he attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting with Larry, it suggested, based on the account, that Larry and Harry may have tussled on the day in question. Referring indirectly to the rumors, Ramos told Reid, 'It looked like somebody had hit you.' Reid told the news anchor in turn that he was 'fortunate' the band only hit him in the temple. Going into further detail about the incident than he had in the past, the 75-year-old former boxer said he was using the band because 'I was trying to maintain my firmness.' 'That was my weight training,' he said. Reid explained that he was exercising in his new home in Nevada at the time when the strip 'slipped, spun me around, about, I guess four feet.' 'I smashed my face into a cabinet so hard...' he said trailing off as Ramos interrupted him with another question. Rumors have persisted since the January 1 accident that the Nevada mob may have been involved, even though there's no evidence to suggest the Reid was the victim of an organized attack. Reid is pictured here on February 3 during a Capitol Hill news conference . The longtime lawmaker, upon announcing his retirement last month, insisted his departure from the Senate was not related to the accident. And he told Ramos in the interview that aired on Tuesday that he was leaving the legislative body in two years when his current term expires because 'I want to remembered for my first 34 years in congress, not my last six.' One of the most memorable moments from Reid's career in recent years was his 2012 charge that the GOP's nominee for president, Mitt Romney, didn't pay his taxes for a decade. Reid first made the accusation during an interview with the Huffington Post, and several days later repeated it on the Senate floor. Then the highest-ranking Senator, Reid said his evidence came from former Bain Capitol colleagues of Romney's. Reid told Ramos in the Fusion interview that the episode had been 'blown way out of proportion.' 'Mitt Romney, during the time he was running for President, refused to give us his tax returns. When I ran for the Senate in 1974 that was an issue, tax returns,' Reid said. 'This has been an issue of mine for a long time.' The Democratic leader said the onus remains on Romney to produce evidence that he did pay his taxes. Reid also refused to give up the sources of his information that Romney may not have. 'Of course he paid taxes. What he didn't do is let us see his tax returns,' Reid told Ramos, claiming he's said as much 'many many times.' 'Let him give us his tax returns. Let the American people judge that,' he stated. Reid said he has 'no repentance' for dragging Romney through the mud because 'it is an issue that was important.' Asked if he had any apologies for Romney Reid was just as direct. 'Oh none, whatsoever. Zero. None,' the retiring lawmaker said.","'Right now, I’ve had 11 hours of surgery. They’ve tried. I can’t see out of my right eye. And that’s okay, I can live with that,' he said .

"Hire: Ruba Khandaqji (here) was arrested for threatening to hire a hitman to kill Gov. Rick Scott . A Florida pharmacist was arrested Wednesday for calling 911 and telling the dispatcher she was going to hire a hitman to kill Governor Rick Scott. Ruba Khandaqji, 36, was charged with two counts of corruption by threat against a public official and resisting arrest without violence. Khandaqji called the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office on Monday telling the dispatcher to 'shut up and listen' as she explained that she was going to hire a hitman and  'kill whomever I can kill' because she wanted to be deported to Jordan. '...your trash governor is torturing me here. I'm forced to live here,' the 36-year-old is heard saying in a recording of the 911 call released by the Sheriff's Office Thursday. 'I hope that this call is recorded. Pass this to your governor. Tell him she is hiring a hitman...okay? Got the message? Great.' Investigators said Khandaqji repeated her threat to Osceola County deputies Tuesday, Bay News reports. When Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents spoke with Khandaqji at her home in Celebration on Tuesday, the pharmacist told them she did not have to abide by U.S. laws because she was being held against her will by the government, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

Authorities say she has a history of mental instability and has come to authorities' attention four times in the last three months. On March 5, U.S. Capitol Police notified FDLE agents that she was in Washington D.C. attempting to meet with Department of State members to 'demand her deportation,' the Sentinel reports.

"A sting set up by police between Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and the woman who claims he groped her has revealed he did not deny touching the model, it has been reported. Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, has claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her for a kiss and groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night. But while Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed. 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' See below for video . Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse on Thursday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police that the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night . DailyMail.com has reached out to his representatives for comment. She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he knew he was being monitored but following the call and the meeting at the restaurant at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, Weinstein voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. The alleged incident unfolded at Weinstein's Tribeca office after he invited her there for a business meeting on Friday night, hours after meeting her at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. When she arrived at the office, the married father-of-five allegedly asked if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt, she told police. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. She clearly rejected him and he backed off, the New York Daily News reported, and she fled from the building. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she quickly left the building half an hour after arriving, the newspaper reported. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with Weinstein, who is behind hit movies including Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech and Gangs Of New York. 'When she was describing what happened, her face became contorted,' said Mark Heller. 'It was that look of someone who was creeped out. She's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that.' Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Weinstein's camp have dismissed Miss Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . It also emerged that she told Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with €2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Harvey Weinstein to 'discuss business' After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004.","A sting set up by the NYPD shows Weinstein didn't deny touching Italian model Ambra Battilana, it has been claimed .

"Ex-New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez had access to a black Glock pistol, had a distrustful nature and often described his friends as ungrateful, a former friend testified at Hernandez's murder trial on Wednesday. Alexander Bradley told Bristol County Superior Court Justice Susan Garsh he would be able to testify that Hernandez had access to the type of pistol he is accused of using to murder semipro football player Odin Lloyd, but not about a separate 2013 incident in which Bradley contends Hernandez shot him in the face. Hernandez, 25, is charged with killing Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister. Lloyd was found shot dead in June 2013 in an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. During one sidebar Bradley stared directly at Hernandez, who refused to make eye contact . Scroll down for video . Alexander Bradley (above) appeared in Bristol County Superior Court on Wednesday for Justice Susan Garsh to decide what he could testify to in front of a jury in the Aaron Hernandez murder trial . Bradley, who says he was Hernandez's (above) former drug dealer and then his best friend, cannot reveal his claim that Hernandez shot him in the eye . Bradley, who has sued Hernandez over a February 2013 shooting incident, will be allowed to tell jurors he saw someone hand Hernandez a black Glock pistol in a Miami hotel. 'Another gentleman passed a firearm to Mr. Hernandez,' said Bradley. 'It appeared to be a Glock.' The murder weapon in the case has not been recovered, but prosecutors have said it was a black Glock pistol. The gun Bradley will testify about 'could have been, might have been, the murder weapon,' Garsh said. Bradley told the judge he was Hernandez's marijuana dealer before they became friends, and described the football star as a 'chain smoker' who bought the drug in quantities of up to 4 ounces  at a time. Later, he said, Hernandez became one of his 'best friends.' According to a civil lawsuit filed by Bradley last year, the friendship came to an end during a late night dispute in February 2013, when he claims Hernandez shot him in the face, causing him to lose his right eye. Bradley never filed a criminal complaint. He also said that Hernandez once said Lloyd was 'rude' in passing after the way he ignored the former footballer at his own home. Bradley will be allowed to tell jurors he saw someone hand Hernandez a black Glock pistol (similar to the one above) in a Miami hotel . Prosecutors have contended the February incident is relevant to the Lloyd murder since it shows that Hernandez had no trouble shooting his friends. The defense has argued that Hernandez would not have killed Lloyd because of their friendship. During questioning before testifying to the jury, Bradley said Hernandez often told him he had a hard time trusting people and believed that some of his friends were ungrateful for the things he did. Garsh ruled that Bradley could testify to those points. But the judge blocked Bradley from testifying that Hernandez was 'unreasonably suspicious' and would not allow Bradley to use iPhones around him, or that Hernandez believed he was being tailed by police cruisers and helicopters. The defense meanwhile worked to discredit Bradley, who they said did not mention the gun to a grand jury, once claimed he never sold drugs to Hernandez and has a long list of pending charges against him, among them assault, burglary, reckless endangerment, and multiple gun charges. This as the prosecution is expected to rest their case tomorrow. Meanwhile, Hernandez’s lawyer James Sultan has implied he only plans on calling one witness when they begin their case on Monday.","Alexander Bradley, a key witness in the Aaron Hernandez murder trial, told the jury on Wednesday the football star had access to the murder weapon .

"Professor Ninian Peckitt is accused of repeatedly punching a patient in the face to correct a fracture . A pioneering facial surgeon ‘repeatedly’ punched a patient in the head in an ‘extraordinary’ attempt to correct a fracture caused by an industrial accident, a medical tribunal has heard. Professor Ninian Peckitt, 63, claimed he had simply ‘digitally manipulated’ the patient’s face as part of hospital treatment, but witnesses said that in reality he had actually been hitting him, the tribunal was told. The world-renowned surgeon, who has lectured on the use of titanium implants to treat disfigured patients and has been published in academic texts, faces being struck off the medical register after being accused of failing three of his patients. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester was told a man referred to as Patient A had suffered ‘extensive injuries’ to the right side of his face in an industrial accident. He was admitted to Ipswich Hospital in February 2012 where Professor Peckitt was working as an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo-facial surgery since the previous month. Christopher Hamlet, representing the General Medical Council, told the hearing: ‘The case is not centred around the outcome, but the method of the surgery by way of the extraordinary allegation that he repeatedly punched the patient in the face.’ He added that Patient A had fallen out of bed which had further displaced his facial fractures. The hearing was told Professor Peckitt embarked on a ‘closed reduction’ procedure, in which a patient is given anaesthetic before the fractured bone is manually put back together without surgery, and a cast or splint applied. Mr Peckitt was working as an honorary locum at Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk at the time of the alleged incident in February 2012. A medical tribunal will decide whether he should be struck off the register . Professor Peckitt, formerly of Doncaster, later described the procedure as one in which the patient’s face had been ‘digitally manipulated as best they could be achieved’, the hearing heard. It was also alleged he treated Patient A without seeking advice from colleagues. He quit his post at the hospital days later. He was also alleged to have failed to check the medical records of a second patient, Patient B, which led to him attempting an unnecessary procedure on her, and to have treated another, Patient C, for a complex facial deformity without seeking the advice of another surgeon. Professor Peckitt, who is now working in Dubai, has submitted emails in which he ‘emphatically denies’ the allegations, and claims he has been ‘victimised’. ‘In relation to Patient A, he says they simply didn’t see any punching,’ Mr Hamlet said. Dr Timothy Mellor, an expert called for the GMC, prepared a report. ‘He confirmed it is entirely inappropriate to try to reduce a fracture with external force alone or whether the punch was additional manipulation – there is no basis you can reduce a fracture in that nature,’ Mr Hamlet said. The hearing continues.","Professor Ninian Peckitt allegedly punched man who had been in accident .

"A new comprehensive study of 3.9million military personnel who served after 9/11 has found no direct link between deployment to a war zone and elevated suicide rates. Researchers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington, concluded that military suicides may be more likely after members leave the service than during active duty deployment, particularly if their time in uniform is brief. ‘It was certainly intuitive as the wars went on and suicides went up for people to assume that deployment was the reason, but our data show that that is too simplistic; when you look at the total population, deployment is not associated with suicide,’ said lead author Mark Reger. New study: Researchers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord looked at military records of 3.9million personnel who served after 9/11 and found no direct link between deployment to a war zone and elevated suicide rates . Matter of honor: Service members with a dishonorable discharge were about twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had an honorable separation . The four-year study, the largest of its kind, was published Wednesday in the Journal of American Medicine Association Psychiatry. While the US military has traditionally experienced lower suicide rates than the civilian population, suicides among active duty service members have surged in the past decade, almost doubling in the Army and the Marines Corps, Reger said. In 2012, Pentagon reported 320 suicides by active-duty service members; another 268 soldiers took their lives last year. To understand the relationship between deployment and self-inflicted death, researchers reviewed military records for more than 3.9million active-duty soldiers and reservists who joined up between October 7, 2001 and December 31, 2007. A total of 31,962 deaths occurred, including 5,041 suicides, by December 31, 2009. Suicide rates were similar regardless of whether or not servicemen and women were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. The study did not factor in veterans’ exposure to combat and the potential effect of traumatic events on the battlefield on suicide rates. There were 1,162 suicides among those who deployed and 3,879 among those who didn't, representing suicide rates per 100,000 person-years of 18.86 and 17.78, respectively. Leaving the military significantly increased suicide risk, however, with a suicide rate of 26.06 after separating from service compared with 15.12 for those who remained in uniform. At home and abroad: Suicide rates were similar regardless of whether or not servicemen and women were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan . Those who left sooner had a greater risk, with a rate of 48.04 among those who spent less than a year in the military. Service members with a dishonorable discharge were about twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had an honorable separation. ‘This is the first time such a huge, comprehensive study has found an increased suicide risk among those who have separated from service, particularly if they served for less than four years or had an other than honorable discharge,’ said Rajeev Ramchand, a researcher in military mental health and suicide prevention at Rand Corporation who wasn't involved in the study. It's possible that pre-deployment examinations may screen out people who have mental health problems, making those who deploy several times a healthier, more resilient group, said Dr. Alan Peterson, a psychologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio who specializes in combat-related post traumatic stress disorder. ‘Those who really struggle with a deployment don't go the second time,’ said Peterson, a retired military psychologist who wasn't involved in the study. ‘Early separation from the military is often a marker for something else.’ For those contemplating suicide, access to firearms can exacerbate the problem, Peterson said. ‘It's a risk factor that sometimes gets overlooked, but we've seen when they don't have access to weapons they are less likely to kill themselves.’ Leaving the military significantly increased suicide risk, and those who left after just one year were most vulnerable . Some service members who leave the military early may have had risk factors for suicide such as mood disorders or substance abuse problems that contributed to their separation, particularly if they had a dishonorable discharge, said Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. It isn't realistic to expect former service members to instantly reintegrate into their former civilian lives, but they may be experiencing serious mental health problems if they're not eating or sleeping or if they're extremely agitated or irritable, Moutier said. ‘The lack of an association between deployment and suicide risk isn't surprising,’ she said. ‘At a very high level, these findings highlight the need for us to pay closer attention to what happens when people leave the military.’","Researchers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord concluded military suicides may be more likely after members leave service than during deployment .

"The father of American Sniper Chris Kyle has spoken  for the first time since his son's killer was sentenced to life in prison, in an emotionally-charged interview with NBC News. Wayne Kyle said he and wife Deby were 'surviving' now that they finally had time to process their son's death, following the end of his killer's trial. Chris Kyle and friend Chad Littlefield were shot dead at a Texas gun range in 2013 by Eddie Routh, after taking the troubled vet to the range to help him cope with his PTSD. In February, Routh was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Scroll down for video . Still grieving: Wayne Kyle, the father of American Sniper Chris Kyle, gave his first interview on Thursday since the end of the trial of his son's killer . Torturing: Watne Kyle told Lester Holt that it was difficult to attend the trial and sit in the same room as his son's murderer . Shooter: Eddie Routh shot dead Kyle and friend Chad Littlefield at a gun range in 2013, after the pair took him shooting to help him with his PTSD. Routh, pictured center in court in February, was sentenced to life in prison without parole . American legend: Chris Kyle (pictured) served as a Navy SEAL for 10 years and during that time became the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. He wrote a book about his military career titled 'American Sniper' which was made into a movie . Wayne Kyle attended the trial, but said it was difficult to be in the same room with his son's killer. 'It was horrible. I mean, gut wrenching,' Mr Kyle said. 'It's just one of those deals, you just wanna jump over that railing and kill him with your bare hands.' Dealing with his son's death has been all the more painful for Mr Kyle, who had a bad feeling about his work helping other vets after he retired from the military in 2009. 'I told him one time, I said ""I worry more about you as a civilian that when you were with the teams,' Mr Kyle said. He explained that his son was fully trained and highly skilled when he worked in the military, but 'there's no training to be a civilian'. Childhood: Wayne Kyle was the first to teach his son how to shoot a gun, and gifted him his first weapon at the age of 8. Above, some family pictures of young Chris Kyle . Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . Mr Kyle also spoke about a Texas legislator's push to award Kyle with the medal of honor, posthumously. 'If you knew Chris you would know that he would never ever want that. He never saw himself as a hero,' Mr Kyle said. He added that he didn't like Routh's trial being called the 'American Sniper trial' in the media since it distracted from Chad Littlefield's equally tragic death. Chris Kyle served as a Navy Seal  for ten years, during which he became the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history with at least 160 kills. His father Wayne was the first to teach him how to shoot a gun, buying him his first firearm at the age of 8. A film about his life, starring Bradley Cooper, titled American Sniper, was released this past January. In part of the interview, aired on the Today show on Friday, Wayne Kyle described the blockbuster as an 'absolute disgrace' for the way in which it had portrayed his other son, Jeff, who also served in Iraq. Wayne Kyle described the movie, American Sniper, as an absolute disgrace for the way in which it portrayed his other son, Iraq veteran Jeff Kyle (pictured), as 'cowardly' Mr Kyle said that the movie portrayed Jeff 'as a weak, almost cowardly Marine just wanting to get out of the country in anyway possible and that couldn't be further from the truth in the way Jeff is'. However the Today show later said that although Mr Kyle was disappointed with the movie, he did say he was grateful for the attention it brought to veterans. The father also spoke about how he copes with criticism leveled at his son's record as the American military's most deadly sniper. 'I basically ignore it, I know it's not true,' Wayne Kyle said. 'To me, those people have no self-worth... their only claim to fame is to try to destroy somebody who has the values like what Chris possessed.' His father choked back tears as he recalled the thousands of people who lined the route on the day of Chris's funeral. He said: 'If anybody ever wondered if Texas stood behind and supported their veterans, they just had to see that.'

"An Italian priest has been sacked amid claims that he took part in gay orgies with a Swiss Guard. The prelate was sacked from a religious order in Taranto after one of his online lovers contacted the church authorities with a dossier containing alleged evidence of sex with prostitutes, role play and explicit gay web chats. The priest allegedly favoured sexual role-play scenarios in which his lover played the disciple Judas Escariot, and had to atone for his betrayal of Jesus by becoming his slave. Controversy: News of prelate being sacked after an online lover contacted Taranto church authorities with a dossier containing alleged evidence of sex with prostitutes is just the latest sex scandal to engulf the Vatican . The diocese confirmed that the priest had been dismissed but claimed there were no other prelates involved. Turn-on: The priest allegedly favoured sexual role-play in which his lover played Judas Iscariot, and had to atone for his betrayal of Jesus (pictured) A 32-year-old man, from Rovigo in northeast Italy, claimed he was contacted by the unnamed priest around six months ago on Facebook. The man, an unemployed labourer, said he was having problems at the time and thought that 'it could have been a sign from heaven.' 'I needed spiritual help,' he told Corriere della Sera. The priest revealed that he was gay during online chats and attempted to seduce the labourer. 'He told me my pictures made him excited and asked me to send him an intimate photo,' the man claimed. The pair also had a video conversation via Skype, during which the priest was allegedly naked. The priest allegedly said that he had organised orgies with priests and a Swiss Guard, although church authorities have not said anyone else was involved. The labourer said that he was not gay but did not want to risk losing the spiritual support of the priest, who he claimed even convinced him to leave his girlfriend. 'He told me that he liked guys, especially young ones, and that he could do everything for them, also help them to buy clothes, mobile phones and recharge costs,' he claimed.

"A man, 21, allegedly forced a tearful 15-year-old girl into his car on Saturday and screamed, 'you will never see your parents again!' in attempt to force her to be his teen bride. Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment. The Star Tribune reports that the girl's family reported the kidnapping on Sunday and that they opposed to their daughter marrying Xiong, whom she was dating, because of their age differences. Alleged kidnapper: Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St.Paul, Minnesota has been arrested after he allegedly tried to force his 15-year-old girlfriend to be his traditional Hmong bride . Xiong and his parents say they wanted the girl and Xiong to marry in the Hmong tradition. The girl, who has not been identified because she is a minor, told police that Xiong was her 'boyfriend' and that they got into a physical argument over the prospect of marriage on Saturday night. Xiong allegedly threw the girl's iPad against a wall at her family's home and then ripped her sweatpants as he dragged her into his car. Her parents were not home at the time. The girl told police that she managed to escape but that Xiong took hold of her a second time, forced her into his car, and took her to his family's home. When the girl's parents returned home from work at around noon on Sunday, they learned of the kidnapping from their oldest son. The girl's parents called Xiong's parents and demanded that they give them their daughter back. The girl's older brother later drove to the Xiong's home where they willingly let the girl go home. The girl told police that she and Xiong had been 'dating' in January and first had sex when she was just 14-years-old. The victim's father told police that Xiong asked him to marry his daughter on multiple occasions but that he said no because of their large age difference. Xiong admitted to kidnapping the girl and said that she tried to escape from him on Highway 26. This is not Xiong's first brush with the law. In 2009 Xiong was tried in juvenile court or sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl when he was 15. He pleaded guilty. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said about the case, 'This is a very disturbing case involving the victimization of a 15-year-old girl that cannot be tolerated in our community. 'Women and girls are not property, they are human beings who have every right to be free from violence and to live according to how they choose for themselves. 'We allege that the defendant has sexually exploited a minor who cannot legally consent to sex, and has taken violent actions to kidnap and hold the victim against her will.' According to Hmongculture.net, the Hmong are an ethnic group that come from Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. In the late 1980s many Hmong people came to the United States after being sponsored by the Lutheran church. The majority relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota and Fresno, California. In traditional Hmong marriages the man generally asks permission from the girl's family to wed her. If that method fails, there is a tradition of 'bride-napping' in Hmong culture in which the man may literally drag his bride to his house when her parents are not home. If the girl does not accept a gift from her sometimes forceful suitor then she may go back to her family, says Ahmongwoman.com .","Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment .

"The grandmother of a Virginia teen missing since March 2 came out swinging Sunday at authorities who she says have been 'doing nothing' to bring the girl home. Katherine Hadsell says she's eager for police in Norfolk to give 'more insight into what they're actually doing' to find 18-year-old college student Anjelica Hadsell. The Longwood University student was home for spring break when she vanished. Police just this past week focused their search on a pond near Carrsville after getting a new tip that her cell phone may be below its surface. Scroll down for video . Concerned? Katherine Hadsell says police aren't doing enough to find 18-year-old AJ, who's been missing for a month. Further, she says her son - AJ's stepfather Wesley Hadsell - was arrested unjustly as he took it upon himself to investigate the crime by breaking into a Norfolk area home . Police are searching a pond near Carrsville, Virginia, in an attempt to find the cell phone of Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, a Longwood University freshman who was last seen on March 2. Meanwhile, the family says they've been left in the dark about how, exactly, police were led to the pond in the first place. And Hadsell's stepfather has found himself the focus of area police after he was caught allegedly breaking into a home two weeks after Anjelica's disappearance, an act his mother Katherine says was out of fatherly concern. Katherine Hadsell told ABC News her son Wesley had heard his stepdaughter could be inside the home. 'As any father would, if you hear that your daughter may or may not be in a house or being held or some of her belongings or at a location, any father is going to try and find out,' Katherine Hadsell said. Hadsell had not been named a suspect as he awaited a hearing on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering. Local resident Steve Hines over the weekend said that divers were searching the outer edges of the pond for the Longwood University freshman's phone, which sent strange text messages to her mother shortly after her disappearance. AJ Hadsell (left) was last seen driving near her parents' home in Norfolk and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell (right) was taken into custody late last month after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours . The teenager was last seen when she was home for spring break driving near her home in Norfolk, roughly 40 miles from the pond searched Friday, according to 13 News Now. Hines said that police showed him a picture and asked him if he had seen a white van for Quality Plumbing. He said that he had seen the vehicle, which belongs to a company where Hadsell's stepfather Wesley works, driving along the rural road. He had been working in nearby Franklin, Virginia, around the time of the disappearance. The stepfather of the teenager, 36, was taken into police custody late last month amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter. He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. He said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will. Wesley Hadsell, left, has admitted breaking into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter AJ, right, against her will. The stepfather has a criminal record including dropped rape and kidnapping charges . Residents of Carrsville reported a white plumbing van for the company Wesley Hadsell works for driving suspiciously around the pond . 'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com. Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. He said he even punched the family dog out of anger. While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket. 'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said. 'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' Officially police have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects. During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition. He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states. Charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. Police have not ruled out foul play in the disappearance of the Longwood University freshman, which has lasted for more than a month . Police spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road late last month . He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR. Now he says that he is a changed man. Wesley and his wife were estranged when he was arrested, but it is not clear what their relationship was at the time of the disappearance. Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received text messages from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not sure that the person sending them was actually the missing girl. Wesley Hadsell was denied bond and the judge said the he was trying to impede the investigation into his stepdaughter's disappearance, according to the Virginian-Pilot. He admitted to increasing cocaine use, but said that he just wants to see his daughter home. A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her. They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time. AJ's family and friends discovered items of her clothing two weeks ago near the side of the road in a remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake. Four items were found that belonged to her. AJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.","Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2, when she was home in Norfolk while on spring break from Longwood University .

"The bodies of four people, including two young boys under the age of ten, were discovered in a Oklahoma home on Wednesday afternoon in what police suspect was a murder-suicide. The unidentified family - a 38-year-old mother, 42-year-old father and their two sons - apparently died from gunshot wounds. Tulsa police said 'based on the physical evidence inside the house', they believe the father killed his wife and children before using the gun on himself and are not seeking a suspect.

Officers found a handgun near the man's body, according to Tulsa World. Captain Matt McCord said the bodies may have been in the house 'as many as two days', based on when the four were last seen and a preliminary examination of phone records. Police found the bodies after the mother's employer requested a welfare check because she had not shown up to work for two days. They do not have a motive for the slaying, but McCord said the scene was difficult to process. He said: 'It's a tough deal for anybody to go through.' Neighbors said they were surprised by what happened and said the area is safe. Tulsa police officers found a handgun near the dead body of the father and are not seeking other suspects .

"Australia’s very own nocturnal, rabbit-eared Easter mascot is under threat with bilby numbers becoming dangerously low. The native Australian marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the Australian mainland while now it’s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area with small populations remaining in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Kevin Bradley, CEO of Save the Bilby Fund told Daily Mail Australia that it’s very difficult to pin point the exact number of bilbies left in Australia because of their ‘cryptic’ nocturnal habits. Scroll down for video . The native Australian marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the Australian mainland while now it’s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area . ‘We know they are extinct in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with very few bilbies left in Queensland and scattered populations in the Northern Territory and Western Australia’ 'Things aren’t looking great and their future in the wild is very tenuous.’ In recent years the bilby has become an important part of the Australian Easter tradition however, its ties with our Indigenous community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories. Mr Bradley said the critters were of 'high significance to traditional land owners' with record of bilby populations dating back '15 million years'. Until recently, Australia had two species of Bilbies- the Greater Bilby and the Lesser Bilby. The Lesser Bilby is already believed to be extinct while the Greater Bilby is classed as ‘endangered’ in Queensland and ‘vulnerable’ nationally. In recent years the bilby has become an important part of the Australian Easter tradition however, its ties with our Indigenous community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories. Predators like feral cats and foxes are the biggest threat to the bilby populations while other contributing factors include farm animals destroying bilby habitat and introduced species like rabbits competing with them for food and burrows. Mr Bradley said foxes and feral cats are ‘desimating the population.’ The Australian Wildlife Conservancy said feral cats are the driving force behind the dramatic decline of wildlife across the country with the feral felines killing an estimated 75 million native animals every night. 'I think people are starting to recognise that these animals are having such a devastating effect on many native animal populations.' Mr Bradley said the Federal Government has committed to a National Feral Animal Summit this year that will  focus on creating a plan to address the feral cat issue. In the mean time, the Save the Bilby Fund have developed a captive breeding program and believe that continuing breeding efforts in controlled environments could be they key to saving the endangered marsupial. The Greater Bilby is a nocturnal marsupial with a silky grey and white coat and a long black and white tail. Bilbies have large ears, a long snouts and a great sense of smell that helps them locate food. The bilby is omnivorous and eats bulbs, fruit, seeds, fungi, insects, worms, termintes and even small lizards or spiders. They don’t need regular water because, like koalas, they get most of their water from their food. The Royal Visit: Even the Royal family, pictured, wanted to drop by to get some face time with the native marsupial .","Bilby numbers are dropping with only around 600 left in Queensland .

"Never-before-seen pictures of Winston Churchill show the moment the former prime minister appeared to fall asleep at a Second World War reunion party alongside Dwight Eisenhower. Churchill, then 84, was President Eisenhower's guest of honour at the gathering, held at the home of the US ambassador in London, in 1959. The party, held on the 20th anniversary of Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland, brought together the great and good of the Allied WWII campaign. Scroll down for video . Nodding off: Winston Churchill (sitting, left) appears to be falling asleep as President Dwight Eisenhower (sitting, centre) and Harold Macmillan (sitting, right) chat at a meeting of wartime leaders. Also seen are Viscount Charles Portal (above Churchill), 1st Baron Arthur Tedder (above Eisenhower) and Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks (third from right) Snooze: The former prime minister, then 84, sits back as seems to fall asleep at the fathering of Allied leaders in London in 1959. Other guests include Viscount Montgomery (standing, second from left) and 1st Earl Harold Alexander (sitting next to Eisenhower) Lord Alan Brooke wakes up Churchill, who appears slightly sheepish, but no one else seems to have noticed his quick nap . The wartime comrades met at Winfield House, a mansion in Regent's Park which was the residence of US ambassador John Hay Whitney. But the former prime minister, famously partial to a daytime drink, appeared to be struggling to keep his eyes open as the leaders posed for official photographs. The amusing photographs seem to show Churchill nodding off while sat next to Eisenhower, and among the likes of then prime minister Harold Macmillan and British wartime commander Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. After a short nap, Churchill looks slightly sheepish as he is awoken from his slumber by fellow guest Lord Alan Brooke, but fortunately no one else seems to have noticed his quick snooze. The dinner party also saw the reunion of Eisenhower, who became President after the end of the war, and Montgomery. The pair had clashed over military strategy during the latter stages of the war when Eisenhower was Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe.

Churchill, famously partial to a daytime drink, appeared to be enjoying the reunion despite seeming to nod off . Their feud had been reignited a year prior to the anniversary dinner when Montgomery published his memoirs in which he slated Eisenhower's command. But the pair were able to put their grudge on hold for the gathering, which also featured Field Marshal Harold Alexander, who oversaw the Dunkirk evacuation, and Field Marshal Alan Brooke, the most senior military advisor to Churchill during the war. Other esteemed guests included Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, former Chief of Air Staff, 1st Baron Arthur Tedder - Eisenhower's deputy commander for the invasion of Normandy, and Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, former head of Bomber Command. Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks and General Lord Ismay were also in attendance. President Eisenhower escorts Churchill into Winfield House, the US Ambassador's residence in Regent's Park, London . The photographs were taken by Paul Begley, a US Navy photographer who was the official presidential photographer not only for Eisenhower but also Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy. They are among a set of 22 prints taken by Mr Begley, which are being sold by RR Auction in Boston, Massachusetts, by his family. Experts have listed them for sale for $2,500 - around £1,700 - but say they could make much more. Bobby Livingston, from the auction house, said: 'These photos were taken at a reunion dinner hosted by President Eisenhower while he was on tour in Britain in 1959. 'It was the 20-year anniversary of the invasion of Poland which kickstarted the Second World War and so Eisenhower gathered all the military leaders for what used to be known as a 'stag party'. 'The group got together for official photos to be taken but it appears like Churchill might have partaken in some daytime drinking because he nodded off while sat right next to Eisenhower. 'Churchill was fond of a drink while he was in office, and his habit was probably much worse once he retired. 'The photos show one of the other guests dutifully prodding Churchill to wake him up, and the former prime minister looking a little bemused. 'The other interesting thing about this set is that all the big British players from the Allied high command were at this dinner, including Field Marshal Montgomery. 'Monty had been very critical of Eisenhower in the years following the war, and it was no secret that they didn't like each other, but he was duly invited to the dinner. 'Newspaper reports of the dinner noted that the pair sat close to one another and while no-one knows what was said they seemed to have buried the hatchet.' The auction will take place on April 15.","Churchill was meeting Allied WWII leaders for a reunion party in London .

"Gary Ross Dahl, the creator of the wildly popular and bizarre 1970s fad the Pet Rock, has died aged 78 in southern Oregon. Mr Dahl's wife, Marguerite Dahl, confirmed on Tuesday that her husband of 40 years died March 23 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His rocks, which formed a brief but remarkably successful craze for several months in 1975, came packed in a cardboard box containing a tongue-in-cheek instruction pamphlet for 'care and feeding' and made him a millionaire. Gary Dahl, the creator of the wildly popular 1970s fad the Pet Rock, has died at age 78 in southern Oregon . Mr Dahl later estimated he had sold 1.5million of them at roughly $4 each by the time the fad fizzled only a few months after it hit the market. In later years, given his success with the Pet Rock, he authored the self help book Advertising for Dummies. Although its popularity was short-lived, the Pet Rock was no more than a standard rock packaged around an amusing marketing strategy. To this day his creation divides opinion among those who look back on it with contempt, and those who admire his ability to sell it. Born December 18, 1936, in Bottineau, North Dakota, Dahl was raised in Spokane, Washington. In 1975, he was a Los Gatos, California, advertising executive when he came up with the Pet Rock idea. The rock - which was simply a common everyday stone - came with a manual which, tongue in cheek, detailed how the owner should take care of it. It also stated how its owners should make it feel comfortable in its new home, how to train it and how it can be used to attack 'adversaries'. The New York Times reported he was later sued by investors after they claimed they received too small a share of the profits and he was forced to pay a six-figure sum. His later inventions included The Original Sand Breeding Kit and Red China Dirt. However, these failed to take off. Gary Dahl's Pet Rock came with a manual which, tongue in cheek, detailed how the owner should take care of it . In 2000, he was a grand prize winner in the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest for dreadful prose. His winning entry read: 'The heather-encrusted Headlands, veiled in fog as thick as smoke in a crowded pub, hunched precariously over the moors, their rocky elbows slipping off land's end, their bulbous, craggy noses thrust into the thick foam of the North Sea like bearded old men falling asleep in their pints.' He and his wife retired and moved to Jacksonville in 2006. The Pet Rock craze 'was great fun when it happened,' his wife recalled in a telephone interview. Over time, however, 'people would come to him with weird ideas, expecting him to do for them what he had done for himself. And a lot of times they were really, really stupid ideas.' By 1988, Dahl said he had avoided interviews for years because of what he called 'a bunch of wackos' appearing out of nowhere with threats and lawsuits. Of the little rock that became a household name, he said, 'Sometimes I look back and wonder if my life wouldn't have been simpler if I hadn't done it.' Mr Dahl designed and built the Carry Nations Saloon in Los Gatos, his wife said. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Candace Dahl of Spokane; daughters Chris Nunez and Samantha Leighton; son Eric Dahl; stepdaughter Vicki Pershing and grandchildren. Mr Dahl and his wife were avid sailors on San Francisco Bay, where she plans to sprinkle his ashes in May.","The Pet Rock creator has died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .

"Michael Olsen, 52, has been jailed for 12 years after shooting a police officer in the hand . A thug who shot a hero policeman in the hand as he was tackled to the ground after threatening to blow another officer's head off has been jailed for 12 years. Michael Olsen, 52, from Dartford, Kent, was challenged by PCs Mark Bird and Robert Wilson after abandoning his car in the middle of the road after ploughing into a traffic island and parked cars. He initially ignored the officers who were pursuing him by car but when they got out he turned round and pulled a gun to PC Wilson's head. When PC Bird lunged at Olsen in a bid to save his colleague he felt a sharp pain through his hand and realised he had been shot. They were able to restrain and arrest him, where they found a bag of bullets in his pocket. The 45-year-old officer, who is now back on duty, and his colleague had been called to a routine traffic accident in Welling on October 3, last year, when the incident unfolded. A Land Rover Freelander had been abandoned in the middle of the road after a crash and a member of the public had called to say the driver had walked off. The police officers went after Olsen in their car and spotted him walking along a nearby residential street where they confronted him. PC Bird, who has been in the force for nearly 23 years, said: 'I challenged him and he ignored us and carried on walking. We stopped the car almost straight away and jumped out. 'As I challenged him again he turned around, pulled out a revolver and pointed it about five or six feet away from Rob's head. He said: ""If you come any closer I will blow your effing head off"".' He added: 'I looked at his eyes, and I thought he means what he says he's going to do, so I went for him with my left arm to try and knock the gun away from him. PC Mark Bird (pictured) was attending a routine traffic accident with his colleague PC Robert Wilson in October last year when the incident happened . 'As I did this he turned towards me. I felt the gun in the palm of my hand and he fired one shot. I felt a really sharp pain, like someone pushing a knife through and then pulling it out again.' Police believe he was on his way to see his ex-girlfriend whom he was banned from seeing under bail conditions. PC Bird added: 'It was literally such a split second thing and we had to try to do something, because we were cornered really, and there was no way we were going to let him go. 'It's only afterwards that you realise the gravity of it. If the bullet had gone through the wrist, it could have gone up the arm and travelled towards the heart. 'Someone was watching over us that night. I'm still here, I'm still a police officer, I'm carrying on.' The officers challenged Olsen but he turned round and pulled a gun to PC Wilson's head. PC Bird stepped in to save him but as he did he was shot in the hand (pictured, his injuries) As Olsen pointed the revolver at the officer's head he threatened: 'If you come any closer I will blow your effing head off'. He denied knowing the gun was real but was found guilty at Inner London Crown Court . PC Wilson said: 'It happened so quickly. It's when you sit down afterwards and start to think about things, what ifs, what could have happened. 'You see the injury to Mark's hand and you think that gun was pointing at my head - so there's no way I'd be here now if Mark's hand hadn't got in the way.' In custody Olsen, denied knowing the gun was real, claiming he thought it was a toy. He was found guilty of GBH with intent, possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life and dangerous driving and jailed for 12 years at Inner London Crown Court.","Michael Olsen, 52, abandoned his car after ploughing into a traffic island .

"When father-of-three Sean McCabe got the devastating news that he had just two months to live he set about organising the funeral - choosing the music and even booking the church. But in an extraordinary twist his cancer went into remission and he has now changed his reservation for his wedding to his fiancee Lisa Williams. Mr McCabe, 30, of Tonyrefail, south Wales, even wrote a goodbye letter to his children for his partner to read to them once he had died after he was told he had stage four Hodgkin Lymphoma. Scroll down for video . Sean McCabe planned his own funeral after he was told he had just two months to live, but after making a recovery he was told he was in remission and has rebooked the church for his wedding to Lisa Williams (left) 'When the doctors said my chances of survival were slim, all I could think about was Lisa and the kids. I didn't know how they would cope without me,' said Mr McCabe, a security guard. 'Planning my funeral seemed like a way of easing the strain for them, as it would be one less ordeal for them to deal with.' The father-of-three was diagnosed with cancer in June 2013, then aged 28, and was started on an intensive chemotherapy course. He was given the all-clear in September but just two months later told the cancer had returned in an even more aggressive form. He was expected to live for eight weeks. Mr McCabe was told his cancer had returned aggressively and is pictured after chemotherapy in 2014 . Doing all he could to cope with his diagnosis, Mr McCabe booked St David's Church for his funeral, in late January 2014. He instructed Miss Williams to ensure his favourite song, 'Who You Are' by Jessie J was played, and ordered mourners not to wear black. As preparations got underway he picked the site for his family to scatter his ashes, and penned a heart-wrenching letter to be read to his children after his death, telling them: 'I don't want to leave you or mammy, but I haven't got an option.' But he managed to make a remarkable recovery and was told his cancer is now in remission. He said: 'A year ago I was planning my funeral at that church, and now I'm planning our wedding there.

"Former Redgum frontman John Schumann has slammed anti-Islam protesters for using his song, I Was Only 19, at one of Saturday's Reclaim Australia rallies. The songwriter, who penned the 1983 anthem, said the song - like many of his others - was about compassion, tolerance and inclusiveness. But it has emerged the hit was played at one of the rallies, which aimed to oppose 'sharia law, halal tax and Islamisation'. Scroll down for video . Former Redgum frontman John Schumann (pictured front centre) has slammed protesters for using his song, I Was Only 19 at a Reclaim Australia rally . A YouTube video shows I Was Only 19 being performed at Reclaim Australia's Gold Coast protest. Saturday's rallies across the nation erupted into violence when the group's supporters clashed with anti-racism groups. After footage of Schumann's song being played surfaced, the singer released a statement on Sunday to condemn its use. He said I Was Only 19 was written to help people understand the plight of Vietnam veterans. Saturday's Reclaim Australia rallies across the nation erupted into violence when the group's supporters clashed with anti-racism groups . Schumann said his songs were about promoting tolerance, compassion and inclusiveness . 'I am very, very disappointed to see my work co-opted by what I, at my most charitable, consider to be a very confused ""patriotic"" movement,' Schumann said. The song honours all Australians who have put themselves in harm's way for their country, he said. 'It is not to be used to advance ignorance and intolerance, especially as we approach the centenary of Anzac,' Schumann said. There were several arrests at the rallies, including three in Melbourne where more than 3,000 people clashed in Federation Square and blocked surrounding streets. Controversial politician Pauline Hanson was on hand at the Brisbane protest at King George Square (pictured) More than 3,000 people clashed in Melbourne's Federation Square (pictured) and blocked surrounding streets . Hundreds of police formed barricades to separate protesters but scuffles still broke out and some people were treated by paramedics for minor injuries. Earlier on Sunday, federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said there was no excuse for the violence. 'There's no place for violence in any protests or any expressions of freedom of speech,' Mr Shorten told the Nine Network. He also said any suggestion that Muslims were planning to bring Sharia law to Australia was exaggerated. 'It was 50-60 years ago people said that the Irish Catholics or the Catholics were trying to take over the joint - and that wasn't true either,' Mr Shorten said.","Footage has emerged of I Was Only 19 being played at an anti-Islam rally .

"Payback: Scammer Rilwan Oshodi has been told he must repay nearly £1million in fraudulent gains . A scammer who was the ringleader of a fraud gang has been ordered to repay nearly £1million which he stole from the life savings of an innocent victim. Rilwan Oshodi bought Karen Budow's bank account details for just £3,200 and spent her savings on cheeseburgers, bottles of champagne and top-of-the-range computers. He now claims he is so broke he can't even pay his lawyers - but a judge told him today that if he does not return his ill-gotten gains he will have to spend four more years in prison. Nigerian Oshodi, 31, bought Ms Budow's Santander details from an Egyptian hacker Tamer Abdulhamid, who had persuaded her to hand them over as part of a fishing scam. His girlfriend Annette Jabeth then posed as the victim and withdrew her £1million life savings, which the gang spent in a three-day shopping splurge in the New Year sales in January 2012. Detectives said that their purchases had ranged from cheeseburgers to high-end computers and gold', while Oshodi spent £1,134 on taxis and bought expensive gadgets including a MacBook and an iPhone. One picture of him even appears to show him holding a 'money sandwich', with Nigerian banknotes stashed between two slices of bread. He was jailed for eight years in 2013 after being convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to conceal criminal property. Appearing at Southwark Crown Court for a confiscation hearing today, Oshodi insisted he had not profited from the scam, and denied hiding money in overseas bank accounts. Money sandwich: This image appears to show Oshodi with Nigerian banknotes in between slices of bread . Champagne: But the scammer insists he does not have enough money to pay what he has been ordered to . He said: 'If I have hidden the goods, if I have got money how come I can't pay my solicitor, how come I can't rent a house, how come I was still broke, how come I am still broke, how come I am still poor? 'Wouldn't I get myself a new car, would I not buy myself some new clothes, Louis Vuitton or something?' But judge Stephen Robbins said: 'I reject what he said today... he was the main mover and architect of this fraud and he has hidden assets most likely outside this jurisdiction. 'He said he got nothing from it at all, no benefit directly.' Determining Oshodi to have made £940,820.34 in profit from the fraud, the judge ordered that he repay the total sum within six months or face a further four years in jail. Girlfriend: Annette Jabeth was also jailed in 2013 for her part in Oshodi's fraud . Abdulhamid was jailed for six years after admitting three counts of conspiracy to defraud, but this year he was ordered to repay just £686 out of the £74,000 profit he made from the scam. During a raid of Oshodi's home, detectives discovered computers with details of more than 11,000 credit cards, including those of almost 8,500 UK customers. In a victim impact statement, Ms Budow said she was 'physically shaking' when she was informed by the bank, adding: 'Since the theft I have been reimbursed the full amount by Santander. 'But the effect it has had on me personally has been one of complete violation of my privacy. People have gained access to my personal details and I fear what they will use the information for.' Jabeth and five others were also jailed for being involved in the scam.","Rilwan Oshodi, 31, bought Karen Budow's bank details and spent her £1million life savings on a luxury lifestyle .

"As he kept two young women locked up as sex slaves in his basement, Ariel Castro was looking for a wife, a new book about the Cleveland kidnapper has revealed. A 39-year-old woman named Lillian Roldan came forward to author John Glatt to say she dated Castro from 2000 to 2003, a three-year period during which Castro kidnapped and imprisoned Michelle Knight and Amanda Berry in his Ohio home. Roldan describes Castro in Glatt's book The Lost Girls as nothing short of a gentleman, who was 'completely normal' in the bedroom, and even romantic. Scroll down for video . Blinded by love: Lillian Roldan (left) says she dated Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro (right) from 2000 to 2003. She says she visited his house often and never knew about the young women he was keeping prisoner . However, she says he did keep his basement padlocked, which she found peculiar. When she asked about the need to lock the door, Castro allegedly told Roldan that he kept his money stored down there and 'didn't want his kids to steal it'. In the book set to be published later this month, Roldan recalls meeting 16-years-older Castro on a blind date set up by friends in May 2000. He allegedly invited her to watch him play music one night and it was 'love at first sight'. Under her nose: During the three years she was with Castro, he would kidnap 21-year-old Michelle Knight and 17-year-old Amanda Berry. A few months after breaking up, he kidnapped his third victim Gina DeJuses. Roldan pictured above with another man in a picture posted to Facebook . Seemingly normal: Roldan detailed her 'romantic' relationship with Castro in the new book The Lost Girls by John Glatt . Roldan visited Castro at his house often, and sometimes ran into his ex-wife Grimilda Figueroa. Castro abused Figuero during their marriage, but he acted so kind around Roldan that she thought the beatings were just a rumor. As for their sex life, Roldan says Castro was 'completely normal' and 'considerate'. She says at one point during their relationship, Castro popped the question but Roldan declined since she didn't believe in marriage. After the proposal, Castro remained dedicated to Roldan and even bought her a ruby ring. After buying the flashy piece of jewelry, Castro took Roldan along to one of his music gigs where he had yet another romantic gesture in store. Free women: Amanda Berry (left), Gina DeJesus (center) and Michelle Knight (right), were held captive in Castro's home for years.

Stolen youth: Castro kidnapped Michelle Knight (right) in 2002 when she was 21, eight months later he kidnapped then 17-year-old Amanda Berry (left). A year later, he captured 14-year-old Gina DeJesus (center) Mid-way through the performance, he took the microphone and told the audience: 'Today, I gave my girlfriend Lillian a ring.' 'So everyone clapped,' Lillian recalls. 'And he told the group that he wanted to sing ""La Bamba"" for me. It was so romantic and I was charmed. It was such a special [night] and he really did show me love.' While Castro remained the normal man she called her boyfriend, two years into their relationship he started harboring a secret at home. In August 2002, Castro kidnapped then 21-year-old Michelle Knight and locked her in his basement. Eight months later, he kidnapped another girl, 17-year-old Amanda Berry. Apparently distracted by the two young women that he was torturing at home, Castro abruptly cut ties with Roldan in October of that year, sending her a letter that said he 'didn't love her enough to stay.' Prison: Above, Catro's Cleveland home where he kept the three women locked up for years . Five months after Roldan received the unexpected break-up letter, Castro's third victim, Gina DeJesus, went missing. She was 14 years old at the time. For the next nine years the women were locked inside Castro's home and kept secret from the outside world. The three women found freedom in May 2013, when Berry's 6-year-old daughter by Castro helped the trio to escape the house and alert police. Castro was arrested and sentenced to life in prison plus $1,000 years. About a month after his sentencing, Castro committed suicide in prison.","Lillian Roldan says she dated Ariel Castro from 2000 to 2003 according to a new book about the Cleveland house of horrors by John Glatt .

"Bruce Jenner could be sued by the stepchildren of the woman who died in the Pacific Coast Highway car crash earlier this year - despite the fact they had 'virtually no relationship'. Kim Howe's two adult stepchildren are said to be considering suing the former Olympic athlete turned reality television star following her death. Mrs Howe was driving a white Lexus, which Jenner's Cadillac Escalade rear-ended on a segment of the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, on February 7. Scroll down for video . Wrongful death?: Celebrity website TMZ claims the stepchildren of Kim Howe (right) have hired lawyers to look into the possibility of a wrongful death suit against Bruce Jenner (left) Crash: Mrs Howe, 69, died after being involved in a four-way smash with realtiy TV star Bruce Jenner . Crash: Mr Jenner is said to have 'rear-ended' her white Lexus, which was pushed into oncoming traffic . The car was pushed into oncoming traffic, and collided with a black Hummer, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck. According to TMZ, the two step-children are said to have 'lawyered up', because they are the only people who could launch a wrongful death suit. Mrs Howe's husband Robert died in 2003, and it is understood she has no other close living blood relatives. Attorneys have previously warned 'the sky's the limit' if it came to a court case, with juries able to award huge amounts. However, sources close to the investigation have said Mr Jenner - who was not hurt in the incident  -  is only insured up to $250,000, meaning he may have to pay out from his personal finances. It is believed he shares an $125million fortune with his ex-wife, Kris Jenner. No charges?: Sources close to the investigation believe Mr Jenner won't be prosecuted for manslaughter . Court case: However, Mrs Howe's stepchildren could still sue for wrongful death . Proof: Sources told TMZ that one of the step-children had been asked to find pictures of the pair together . Police sources say he is unlikely to be prosecuted by the Sheriff because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. However, that still leaves the possibility of a wrongful death suit. Close friends of Mrs Howe have told the celebrity website she had 'virtually no relationship' with either of her late husband's children, neither of whom live in California. Sources went on to tell TMZ that one of the step-children had been asked to find pictures of the pair together, to prove their relationship - and therefore the amount its loss has cost them. Former couple: Bruce, shown in May 2011 with Kris Jenner,with whom he shares a $125million fortune . New York-born Mrs Howe, who was childless, was  'very socially active', according to one member of the exclusive community in Calabsas, where she lives alongside the likes of Jenner's Kardashian stepdaughters. Jim Pascucci, a realtor who lived in the neighborhood, and also sold the Howes their $2.5million house, told the New York Daily News she was 'sweet' and 'charitable'. According to the newspaper, she had put aside an amount of money to go towards animal charities -an sum which could be in the millions.","Kim Howe's stepchildren are said to have 'lawyered up' following her death .

"A drunken Alaskan man was arrested after he stole a forklift to retrieve his pickup truck which he'd crashed. Aleksandr Glushko, 21, of Delta Junction  drove for more than three miles while intoxicated to retrieve the truck he'd just crashed. But his bright idea turned sour when an Alaskan Railroad worker spotted him at the wheel of the forklift driving by the crash site, according to The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. Bad idea: The pickup truck driven by Aleksandr Glushko is pictured here after he crashed it in Fairbanks, Alaska, police said the 21-year-old  drove a stolen forklift more than three miles while intoxicated to retrieve it . The railroad worker informed police that he had just seen a man driving a forklift to Illinois Street and the driver had told him he was taking the forklift to get his dad’s truck, which had a flat tire. However, he was arrested by police who were at the scene when he looped back. He has been charged with a felony for driving under the influence of alcohol. According to police, the bizarre incident unfolded just before 6 a.m. Monday, when Glushko  drove off the road in a pickup and crashed into pipe stacked in a company yard. The pickup was left straddling the pipe. Police said Glushko then walked to George Horner Ice Park, where he stole a forklift and drove off with it. Lieutenant Matt Soden from Fairbanks Police Department told the newspaper: 'Police were on scene talking to the railroad worker when Mr. Glushko came driving back up on the forklift.' Glushko was cooperative and agreed to take a breath-alcohol test. It registered 0.230, almost three times the intoxication standard of 0.08, Soden said. He has two prior DUI convictions and was arrested on charges of felony DUI and vehicle theft. He remained in jail Tuesday.","Aleksandr Glushko, 21,  drove for more than three miles while intoxicated .

"Since hitting the big time singer-songwriter Sam Smith has undergone something of a transformation. Over the past year the London-born artist, 22, has dropped three stone by following a dairy-free, low-carb and low sugar diet, and is now barely recognisable. The chubby, suit-wearing soul singer has gone and been replaced with a new body confident Sam, complete with designer stubble and a trendy new wardrobe. Scroll down for video . Sam Smith is looking better than ever after losing three stone over the last year, he regularly posts pictures of himself to his Instagram account . And his new fashionista status has been crowned with  Sam being named Vogue's April 'Today I'm Wearing' star. It's a coveted month-long role which sees the popstar share his outfits with the fashion magazine's readers each day. So far he's modelled looks including Topman skinny jeans, a custom Burberry shirt and a well-cut Emporio Armani cashmere jacket. The pictures reveal a newfound confidence in his slimline look, the result of a dietary regime by nutritionist Amelia Freer that has 'transformed' his relationship with food. Posting a picture of himself holding Freer's book Eat Nourish Glow on Instagram, the Grammy award-winning singer said: 'Three weeks ago I met a woman who has completely changed my life.' His diet has been so successful that he revealed that he even lost over a stone in just two weeks. Performing at the Brit awards last year Sam had a fuller figure and face . He continued: 'Amelia Freer has helped me lose over a stone in two weeks and has completely transformed my relationship with food. 'It's not even about weight loss it's about feeling happy in yourself. Love you Amelia & thank you for making me feel so happy inside and out @ameliafreer #eatnourishglow' In a previous interview with the Guardian in which Sam was described has having an appearance like an, 'HGV driver,' he said he would always struggle with his weight - despite his recent triumphs over the scales. Freer is an advocate of cutting out gluten and sugar (apart from fruit), processed food is a big no-no and every meal should include protein, fat and vegetables. She is against cereal and even recommends tucking into broccoli for breakfast. Almond milk, avocados and coconut oil are staples of her kitchen cupboards. Sam Smith is the star of Vogue.co.uk's Today I'm Wearing, posting pictures of his outfits each day. He kicked the month off with a Fred Perry T-shirt, an Emporio Armani jacket and Topman jeans .

Sam shared his weight loss journey on Instragram revealing that his newly svelte figure was down to nutritionist Amelia Freer . As well as changing his diet, Sam is also reported to have taken up yoga and weight training to tone his frame. The singer, who claims he was very 'big' as a teenager, has said:  'I think I prefer food to singing.' He also admitted that he was self conscious about his body type, adding: 'I'm always going to have issues with my weight.' He also revealed in the interview that he felt that he had failed to become successful as a teenager because of his size. But the popstar seems to be making light work of his new regime and has been posting photos of his nutritious meals to Instagram. Sam posted this picture of himself to Instagram from when he was at school, making light of his bigger size . Sam has been seen out and about in recent months showing off his weight loss in some stylish outfits . Sam posted this picture of a delicious and healthy looking meal to Instagram after taking a nutritionists advice on his diet . Of course it is not unusual for a popstar to undergo a transformation after hitting the big time. Take, for example, DJ Calvin Harris who is practically unrecognisable from the straggly haired performer he once was. Over recent years the 31-year-old Scot, who is currently thought to be dating Taylor Swift, has got a smooth new haircut and a muscular physique. Sam's new look is certainly earning plaudits from fans. When he revealed his weight loss, one commented the picture: 'Hi Sam, you look really good! Keep up the good work.' And another said: 'You always look good and you are an awesome singer!' In his bigger days Sam would cover up in large over-sized jackets, however, he is now happier to wear more form-fitting clothes .","Musician Sam Smith, 22, has lost three stone over the last year .

"It is billed as the most important meal of the day and many people grade a restaurant on the quality of their bacon and eggs on offer. But after fierce competition and testing, experts have ruled the the best breakfast is available from your local Morrisons. The supermarket beat major hotel, restaurant and pub chains to achieve the title of Britain's Best Breakfast. Morrisons has been named the best place to get breakfast in the UK - beating restaurants, pubs and hotels to win the title - with its Big Breakfast (pictured) one of the most popular items on its extensive morning menu . It was picked out by judges of the Menu Innovation and Development Awards (MIDAS) for its value for money, food quality and customer satisfaction. Richard Jones, Morrisons Head Chef, said: 'The Great British breakfast is a national institution, so to be voted the nation's best is an honour. 'The secret of our success is offering shoppers a good selection of fresh breakfast items to please all tastes - granola and porridge have become very popular in recent times, and of course there's nothing like the breakfast of champions, the Full English.' The supermarket chain offers a variety of breakfasts from porridge with red berries to its infamous Big Breakfast for £4.50. Morrisons was named best in the breakfast category, beating Wetherspoons and Bella Italia which were shortlisted for the awards. Last year the award went to Intercontinental Hotels which charges £28 for its cooked breakfast at its 5-star London Park Lane hotel. And the year before Macdonald Hotels won the accolade. A full English at its 4-star Macdonald Manchester Hotel and Spa costs £19.50 . Mystery shoppers tried breakfasts at restaurants, pubs and hotels nationwide to name Morrisons the winner . The MIDAS awards were launched to recognise the efforts of food development managers in major restaurant and food service chains, and previous winners include the Marriott and InterContinental hotel groups. As part of the judging process organisers send a team of 'mystery shoppers' to try the breakfast menu at all competing venues - from croissants and bacon rolls to the Full English. They then score each menu in terms of value for money, food quality and customer expectation levels. Morrisons' 400 in-store cafes, which serve breakfast until 4pm. Nationwide they sell 100,000 Big Breakfasts a week, and also stock vegetarian options. Morrison's nationwide sell around 10,000 of their signature 'Big Breakfast' a week. This has: . 3 x rashers of British Market St. Bacon . 1 x British Market St. Sausage . 1 x Egg (choice of Fried, Scrambled or Poached) 2 x Hash Browns . Heinz Baked Beanz . Mushrooms . Fried Tomato . Fried Bread . Served with red or brown sauce . Simon Peat, of award organisers Inside Foodservice, said: 'Our judges were dispatched to three Morrisons across the country, to try the full range of items on the menu, and they scored top marks each time. Morrisons is the best place for breakfast. 'As the saying goes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day - and there's lot of prestige within the industry to be named as the home of the best breakfast in the UK.' British breakfast staples have enjoyed a boost in popularity recently - with sales of British back bacon and eggs increasing. In 2013 British bacon producers exported over £33million worth of the meat to nearly 70 countries, with another £1.3million worth of black pudding sold to foreign countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway. Eggs were exported to 57 countries.","Morrisons was awarded the title of serving the best breakfast in Britain .

"Many of us enjoy a chilled glass of wine or a cold beer after a hard day at work. But while the majority of people believe their drinking habits are under control, one in five young professionals now considers themselves to have a problem with alcohol, a survey found. A new poll laying bare the public's attitudes to drinking found nearly half of young workers think it is acceptable to regularly get drunk on a night out, compared to a fifth of the general population. It also revealed the risky effects of drinking, as young people admitted to forgetting how they got home, driving themselves home drunk or getting in a car with someone they knew was intoxicated. One in five young professionals now considers themselves to have a dirnking problem, a survey found . The news comes after a shocking report published this week found binge drinking costs the British economy £4.9bn every year in terms of treating drunks in A&E, road crashes, police arrests and court cases. The damning report said current policies on alcohol taxation are failing to keep up with the financial consequences of people drinking to excess, and calls for minimum unit prices to offset these costs. The new poll of 4,000 British adults found 7 per cent reported they have a drinking problem. Among young professionals, this figure rose to 21 per cent, with 28 per cent of men in this saying they believe they have a problem. More than a third (35 per cent) of 18 to 24-year-olds said they had got so drunk they could not remember most of their night out, with one in five (18 per cent) admitting they have not been able to recall how they got home. One in 20 admitted to driving themselves home drunk and one in ten said they have got in a car with someone who they knew was intoxicated. A survey of 4,000 British adults revealed: . 7 per cent reported they have a drinking problem . 21 per cent of young professionals said they had a drinking professionals, with the figure rising to 28 per cent for men alone . 35 per cent of 18-24-year-olds said they had got so drunk they could not remember most of their night out, . 18 per cent admitted they have not been able to recall how they got home . 5 per cent admitted to driving themselves home drunk . 10 per cent got in a car with someone intoxicated . Among 25 to 34-year-olds 16 per cent said they have woken up in a stranger's house . 23 per cent of 35-54-year-olds said they drink at home alone . Another 23 per cent considered alcohol to be more harmful to their health than smoking . 53 per cent said the NHS should refrain from treating alcoholics . 54 per cent said it is not acceptable to drink when pregnant . Among 25 to 34-year-olds 16 per cent said they have woken up in a stranger's house. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of those aged 35 to 54 said they drink alone at home, with many saying they do it to relieve stress or relax. When asked about the dangers of drinking, three quarters of those polled said they believed Britain has a heavy drinking culture. Just over a fifth (23 per cent) considered alcohol to be more harmful to their health than smoking. While a sizeable proportion of people admitted to problematic drinking, the survey revealed tough attitudes to alcohol abuse. More than half of those questioned believe the NHS should refrain from treating people who continue to abuse alcohol after warnings about their health. A similar number (54 per cent) said it is not acceptable to drink while pregnant. Alistair Bohm, head of communications at drug and alcohol treatment charity Addaction, said: 'Problems with alcohol use can affect people of any age, from any background. 'As these statistics show, it's not just people who are addicted to alcohol who are damaging their health or risking their safety as a result of drinking. 'If a person is worried about their drinking, the best thing to do is speak to their doctor, or find their nearest addiction services.' The World Health Organisation estimates there are 3.3 million deaths each year as a result of harmful use of alcohol. Doctors warn long term alcohol misuse is a major risk factor for conditions including heart disease, stroke, liver disease, and certain cancers. The survey was carried out by Opinium Research. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) considered alcohol to be more harmful to their health than smoking .","Fifth of young people don't remember how they got home after drinking .

"President Barack Obama has ordered the release of 22 drug dealers - including eight who were serving life sentences. Nearly all of the offenders who Obama granted clemency to were convicted of dealing addictive, hard drugs like crack cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin. Eight of those whose sentences were commuted - an act the White House said continues Obama's push to make the justice system fairer - were serving terms of life in prison. The effort is aimed at reducing harsh sentences for those who faced outdated guidelines at their time of sentencing and would be serving shorter punishments had they been convicted today. Barack Obama has granted clemency to 22 drug offenders who were sentenced under outdated guidelines . In December, Mr Obama issued his first round of commutations under new guidelines that were put in place to cut costs by reducing the growing prison population and grant leniency to nonviolent drug offenders sentenced to years long terms of confinement away from society. A commutation leaves the conviction in place and ends the punishment. Neil Eggleston, the White House counsel, said many of the 22 people whose federal sentences will be cut short by Mr Obama's action would already have served their time and paid the debt they owed society had they been sentenced under current laws and policies. 'Because many were convicted under an outdated sentencing regime, they served years - in some cases more than a decade - longer than individuals convicted today of the same crime,' Mr Eggleston said in a post on the White House blog. The 22 individuals, whose punishments will expire on July 28, were sentenced between 1992 and 2006. Mr Eggleston said Tuesday's commutations underscore Obama's 'commitment to using all the tools at his disposal to bring greater fairness and equity to our justice system.' Mr Obama has now approved a total of 43 commutations during more than six years in office. Mr Eggleston noted that Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, had commuted 11 sentences during his two terms. Dwight Anthony Goddard (left) from Georgia, was imprisoned for 235 months for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base . In a letter, the president urged each individual to take advantage of the second chance he is giving them. The White House said it was the first time Obama had sent such letters. 'I am granting your application because you have demonstrated the potential to turn your life around. Now it is up to you to make the most of this opportunity,' he wrote. 'It will not be easy, and you will confront many who doubt people with criminal records can change. Perhaps even you are unsure of how you will adjust to your new circumstances. 'But remember that you have the capacity to make good choices,' Obama said. The nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for less stringent drug sentences, praised the commutations. 'The president's actions today are welcome,' said Michael Collins, policy manager at DPA's office of national affairs. He called on Congress to 'act quickly on substantive sentencing reform,' adding, 'It's time to rectify the U.S.'s embarrassing record on mass incarceration.' -Terry Andre Barnes, East Moline, Illinois.

"A British man bled to death on holiday in Thailand after cutting himself on a mirror in a shop. Iain Mackay, 40, is believed to have argued with his Thai girlfriend moments before his death. He is also understood to have clashed with a man who was seen talking to his girlfriend at a bar. The incidents happened in Hua Hin, a coastal town and beach resort 120 miles south-west of Bangkok. Tragic: Iain Mackay, 40, (pictured) is understood to have got into a fight at the Hua Hin resort, 125 miles south of Bangkok, after discovering the woman chatting with another man at a bar in the coastal city . Thai police said Mr Mackay, from Stornoway, Scotland, was in a rage when he cut himself with a piece of glass at a shop near to the bar where he had spotted his girlfriend. Onlookers called paramedics after he was found bleeding profusely at the shop but they were unable to save him. He later died in hospital. Officials said that no crime had been committed. However, friends of Mr Mackay claim that he had clashed with another man who had been talking to his girlfriend moments before his death, the Press and Journal newspaper reported. Others said that Mr Mackay had posted links to his girlfriend’s Facebook page before his death in which she was pictured with another man. One friend said: ‘Iain was obviously upset and referred to the woman who seemed to be his own girlfriend and a mystery man as lovers.’ Those close to Mr Mackay said he had been in a relationship with his girlfriend for several years. Mr Mackay, an underwater research specialist, is believed to have been employed by seismic research company Polarcus, which is based in Dubai. Location: The resort where Mr Mackay died is in Hua Hin (pictured) - a coastal city 125 miles south of Bangkok . Sources at the company confirmed that Mr Mackay was on leave from his vessel and had told colleagues that he planned to spend his time off in Thailand. Thai officials said that Mr Mackay had died at 3pm on Saturday but relatives claim that they were told of his death on Friday. The Foreign Office also confirmed that Mr Mackay had died on Friday. A spokesman said: ‘We can confirm the death of a British national in Hua Hin, Thailand, on April 3. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this sad time.’ Mr Mackay’s death comes nine years after a British former public schoolboy was murdered after splitting with his Thai wife at the Hua Hin resort. Toby Charnaud, 41, was beaten to death with an iron bar and wooden staves by relatives of his ex-wife, Pannada Laoruang, in August 2006. Laoruang then helped them burn his body before chopping it up and scattering the remains. A Thai court at the time heard how Mr Charnaud, who was educated at Marlborough College, sold £2.5million Latimer Manor estate near Chippenham, Wiltshire, after falling in love with 35-year-old Laoruang, whom he met in a Bangkok bar while on holiday. Last year British students Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were murdered on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao. Two Burmese men have been charged with their murder.

"The majority of Americans identify as 'middle class'. But what does it actually mean? Crunching the numbers, a new study by Pew Charitable Trusts has revealed the exact salary you need to qualify in each state. Maryland's middle class is the highest paid in the country, with an average income of $72,483. Alaska is second with $72,237, followed by New Jersey with $70,165. The top five is completed by Hawaii and the District of Columbia, where middle class citizens are paid an average higher than $67,500. With an average income of $37,963, Mississippi's middle class is the lowest paid in the country. It is followed by Arkansas with $40,511, West Virginia with $41,253, Alabama with $42,849, and Kentucky with $43,399. New York - home to the financial capital of the United States, New York City - falls 17th in the table. The lowest paid middle class citizen in New York earns $38,246 and the highest paid takes an annual salary of $114,738. The average is $57,369. In California, 11th on the table, the average middle class income is $60,190, with a lower limit of $40,127 and an upper limit of $120,380. According to the study, published on March 19, America's middle class has shrunk significantly in the wake of the financial crisis. This colored map of the country displays the shrinking middle class across the U.S. However, whether you earn $20,000 or $250,000, you are still more likely to classify yourself as 'middle class'. Technically, Pew's researchers explain, middle class households earn between 67 and 200 per cent of the state's average income. The national average income is $52,250.","Most Americans identify as 'middle class' whether they earn $20k or $250k .

"A finishing school for transgender women has opened up - offering participants guidance in how to move, dress and even speak like a lady. Le Femme, in New Jersey, offers training to those have undergone - or are undergoing - sex change operations or cross-dressers to help them make the transition from masculine to feminine. The school was created by Ellen Weirich, who dedicates her life to helping 'trans' women feel confident and comfortable in their skin. Scroll down for video . Ellen Weirich (centre) created 'Le Femme' finishing school where she helps transgender females become more feminine. Pictured: (L-R) Allison Hannigan, Ally Maguire, Ellen, Antoinette Dickinson and Denise Smith . The finishing school aims to help both cross-dressers and those transitioning to adopt the airs and graces of a woman, here Ellen gives advice on improving posture . The curriculum, led by 'Lady Ellen' includes lessons on how to walk gracefully in heels, how to speak like a lady, how to dress according to body shape and how to create a convincing cleavage. Other services include a complete male-to-female makeover - and the ladies often go out and about as a group to put their new look and skills to the test. Mother-of-three Ellen, who charges from $44 (£30) to $400 (£270) per session, has been helping the transgender community for decades. She helped her first transgender woman in high school after a male friend confided that he was having gender identity issues. The finishing school is held in Ellen's home which houses a vast collection of wigs, make-up and clothes which her clients have access to. Pictured: Antoinette, who identifies as dual gender, before and after transforming . Allison Hannigan (pictured) has a wife who is extremely supportive of her and has been visiting Ellen for a year . Ellen first began helping transgender women in high school when a friend confided in her with gender identity issues. Here she helps Antoinette to apply makeup . Ellen went on to get married and have three children, then in 2005 she received another cry for help from a transgender family friend. Ellen says that she took it upon herself to help transitioning females become more feminine after realising that very few others were willing to. 'I noticed there was very little help available for transgender women who wanted to be more feminine. 'I had a good knowledge of transgender issues and felt like I could make a difference.' Ellen says that it is an honour to have helped so many through such a momentous part of their lives. 'To help women who have suffered in silence for so long feels amazing and I'm blessed to be part of their journey. Ellen off takes her clients on outings in order for them to practice their new-found skills . Ellen's collection of heels goes up to a size 15 in order to accommodate her larger footed client . 'I've dedicated my life to helping transgender people and I can't imagine anything quite as rewarding.' The school - which is run from Ellen's home - houses a huge wardrobe made up of a variety of outfits. To accommodate some of her larger clients, the dresses go up to a size 28 and a stack of heels range in sizes nine to 15. In the make-up studio, ladies-in-training are taught how to apply, including tips on how to disguise stubble. Ellen says that it is an honour to be a part of such a momentous aspect of someone's life . Here Allison practices her walk which Ellen says is the most difficult part of her sessions . A photography studio helps captures the results of the transformation and gives clients a souvenir of their journey. Ellen says that for the majority of her clients walking in heels proves the most challenging part of their lessons. 'One of the biggest challenges for transgender and cross-dressing women is learning to walk in a feminine way - so many classes focus on graceful footwork. 'It's difficult because they learn to walk a certain way for the whole of their lives and suddenly they're trying to change it - its takes a lot of practice and determination.' One lady who has benefited from Ellen's tutelage is 48-year-old Allison Hannigan, who has been visiting the finishing school for over a year. The eye application is said to be one of the more challenging areas for the women to conquer . The grateful client lives her day-to-day life as a man with a wife and two children - but visits to Ellen as Allison to learn techniques for putting on makeup and moving like a woman. Allison says that visiting Ellen has really helped her to perfect her feminine traits such as applying makeup. 'I have been married for 21 years and have been with my wife for 25. She has known about Allison ever since we were dating and she is very supportive. She is everything to me, so are my children. 'The idea of attending Lady Ellen's charm school was very exciting to me. She has done a lot to help me develop over the year I have been associated with her. 'I'm having the eye make up application lessons and the female feminine movement lessons, which are great because eye makeup is the most difficult area for me to conquer - I think it is for most girls. 'I am a rather tall, large person so the feminine movements would be very helpful for me to try to perfect my look.' Another of Ellen's regular customers for the finishing-school makeover is cross-dresser Antoinette Dickinson who has been visiting Ellen for four-and-a-half years. Ellen's extensive wardrobe of clothes goes up to a size 28 to cater for all shapes and sizes . Ellen helps Antoinette choose her clothes, create realistic fake breasts using 'breast forms' and put on feminine makeup. Antoinette, who identifies herself as dual gender, says that dressing as a woman gives him a sense of freedom. 'The first time I dressed in women's clothing I think was way back when I was a teenager I just loved the idea of hosiery on women and I thought to myself ""hey what would I look like in that""? 'One day I said I just want to get a fully fledged makeover and see what I look like as a woman and that's basically how it happened. 'When I am in women's clothes it feels great, its just such a release. It's like I'm escaping reality and just like you can turn into a whole different person . 'I would identify myself as dual gender. I am happy being both boy and a girl as opposed to different terms like transgender. 'When it comes to my friends and family I am what you call closeted so nobody really knows except for me and the girls that I associate with.'","Ellen Weirich opened her US school after successfully helping a friend .

"It is one of the most infuriating issues travellers face - disembarking form their flight, only to find their luggage hasn't made it. But, if you want to guarantee your luggage will never be lost, you will need to fly in to Kansai International Airport, in Osaka, Japan. Since it opened its doors in 1994, the airport has never lost a piece of luggage, giving it an impeccable 21-year record. Scroll down for video . Kansai International Airport in Japan has never lost a piece of luggage since opening its doors in 1994 . And if returning luggage to travellers isn't enough, the airport also does so in an incredibly efficient way. According to the company, the staff places suitcases on carousels with their handles facing outwards, making it easier for travellers to collect their luggage, which has been singled out as a small but very important strategic detail. No wonder a recent ranking of the top 10 airports for baggage handling saw the Japanese airport taking top honours thanks to its track record.

"A judge has given a New York City woman permission to become the first person to legally file for divorce from her elusive husband via a Facebook message. The woman's lawyer says the ruling was made by Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Matthew Cooper. The Daily News says Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku will be served with the divorce summons via a private Facebook message. It will be repeated once a week for three consecutive weeks or until 'acknowledged' by Ellanora Baidoo's hard-to-find husband. Attorney Andrew Spinnell says the couple married in 2009 in a civil ceremony. First time: Ellanora Baidoo hopes to finally begin divorce proceedings with her husband by sending him Facebook messages containing her petition to end their marriage . He says the relationship began to unravel when the defendant reneged on his promise to a traditional Ghanaian wedding ceremony as well. Because of this, the wedding was not consummated and the pair have never lived together. The ruling says Blood-Dzraku has only been in touch with his wife via phone and Facebook. Baidoo, 26, has been 'granted permission to serve the defendant with the divorce summons using a private message through Facebook,' wrote Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Matthew Cooper according to the New York Daily News. 'This transmittal shall be repeated by plaintiff's attorney to defendant once a week for three consecutive weeks or until acknowledged.' According to Cooper, the 'last address plaintiff has for defendant is an apartment that he vacated in 2011'. Indeed, Cooper said that Baidoo 'has spoken with defendant by telephone on occasion and he has told her that he has no fixed address and no place of employment. He has also refused to make himself available to be served with divorce papers.' The 'post office has no forwarding address for him, there is no billing address linked to his prepaid cell phone, and the Department of Motor Vehicles has no record of him,' The first Facebook message has been sent and Blood-Dzraku has not responded.","Elanora Baidoo married Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku in 2009 .

"A cancer-stricken grandmother was charged nearly £200 by easyJet to change her flights after she postponed her pre-booked holiday because it clashed with an 18-week course of chemotherapy. Jane Bacon, 51, from East Grinstead, West Sussex, booked the 'final trip' to Sharm El Sheikh with her husband Peter, 52, after being told she could die within months from breast cancer. However, she bought the £1,000-trip before doctors told her she needed an 18-week course of chemotherapy and contacted the budget airline to delay her trip after discovering she needed the potentially life-saving treatment. Jane Bacon, 51, from East Grinstead, West Sussex, was told she would have to pay £176 to change her flights to Sharm El Sheikh after she tried to delay her 'final holiday' when doctors said she needed chemotherapy . She has now hit out at easyJet after she received an email asking her to pay £176 to switch her flights, before signing it off with: 'I wish you a pleasant day'.

She said she received an email from the airline which said: 'EasyJet are unable to refund the fees that you paid for your flight changes. 'I understand that this may not have been the answer you were expecting. 'I wish you a pleasant day'. Mrs Bacon told The Sun's Andy Crick and Lauren Probert: 'I just wanted to take on final trip with my husband. I was so upset I cried, I felt hurt. 'If it's not bad enough that I'm dying, I now have to find the money to pay to move the holiday. 'I thought they would show some compassion.'

"Google has developed a system to allow robots to download new personalities online. The system would allow machines to download them in a similar way to an app - and even have a different personality for each user. The patent says that the personality could replicate the robot's owner, 'a deceased loved one,' or 'a celebrity,' Scroll down for video . The California giant's patent says that the robot personality could replicate the robot's owner, 'a deceased loved one,' or 'a celebrity.' Above it Atlas, which according to Google-owned Boston Dynamics, is a 'high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain. According to Google owned Boston Dynamics, Atlas is a 'high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain. 'Atlas can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift, carry, and manipulate the environment. 'In extremely challenging terrain, Atlas is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet, to pick its way through congested spaces.' Google's patent details a cloud-based system where a personality could be downloaded to a robot, in the same way one might download an app. 'The robot personality may also be modifiable within a base personality construct (i.e., a default-persona) to provide states or moods representing transitory conditions of happiness, fear, surprise, perplexion (e.g., the Woody Allen robot), thoughtfulness, derision (e.g., the Rodney Dangerfield robot), and so forth,' states the patent. Friends will even be able to clone their robots and swap aspects of its personality. 'The personality and state may be shared with other robots so as to clone this robot within another device or devices. 'In this manner, a user may travel to another city, and download within a robot in that city (another 'skin') the personality and state matching the user's 'home location' robot. 'The robot personality thereby becomes transportable or transferable.' The firm also explains 'This disclosure relates to a robot imbued with a personality, or personalities. 'In particular, but without limitation, the disclosure provides for a robot that operates with personality attributes and related capabilities drawn from cloud computing capacities. 'Personality may be thought of as personification in the sense of human characteristics or qualities attributed to a non-human thing. 'A robot can be programmed to provide a desired look as well as interactability for the robot, which may be subject to change by the user or by the robot itself, such that the robot interface is customized to provide a desired personality for the robot.' Google already owns several firms developing robotic technology, including Atlas, 6.2 feet of metal with a plastic body that can walk, run, jump and even open doors. This is latest version of the Atlas robot created by Boston Dynamics, a Google-owned robot firm. Later this year, seven of the robots will compete in a 'robo oylmpics' - designed to recreate natural disasters the robots could one day be sent into. A total of $3.5 million in prizes will now be awarded to the top three finishers in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC), the final event of which will be held June 5-6, 2015, at Fairplex in California. Aside from the previously announced $2 million grand prize, DARPA plans to award $1 million to the runner-up and $500,000 to the third-place team. Google's patent drawings reveal the system can share personalities and download them . DARPA expects at least twenty teams to compete in the DRC Finals. 'The goal of the DRC is to generate groundbreaking research and development in hardware and software that will enable future robots, in tandem with human counterparts, to perform the most hazardous activities in disaster zones, thus reducing casualties and saving lives,' it said. The teams using the DARPA-developed Atlas robot will use an entirely new version, which is battery powered for the first time. The Atlas robot created by Google-owned firm Boston Dynamics is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in tall and weighing in at 330lb. The robot boasts 28 hydraulically actuated joints and stereo vision, and is one of the most advanced robots ever created. Atlas will also now carry an onboard 3.7-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, with the potential for one hour of 'mixed mission' operation that includes walking, standing, use of tools, and other movements. The upgraded Atlas is 75 percent new—only the lower legs and feet were carried over from the original design . Gill Pratt, of DARPA said: 'Atlas unplugged is the upgrade to allow it to run entirely on batteries. 'We have to cut the cord.' 'The new Atlas is 75% new, it has much more dexterity and is quieter, and stronger. 'The introduction of a battery and variable-pressure pump into Atlas poses a strategic challenge for teams,' said Pratt. 'The operator will be able to run the robot on a mid-pressure setting for most operations to save power, and then apply bursts of maximum pressure when additional force is needed.' During the finals, a series of events will be held to replicate disasters. 'The finals will be very hard. We want them to be more like real disasters, the robots will have to do all these tasks in sequence with no human help. Given their identical hardware, the Atlas teams will have to differentiate themselves through software, control interfaces, and competition strategy. Other firms are already developing robots with 'friendly' personalities . Teams will have a few options on the selection of tasks they choose to attempt and the order they do them—and must manage time and battery life during their runs—but DARPA expects that the top-placing teams will complete all of the tasks. Teams are likely to keep their robots connected to fall arrestors during much of the remaining months of training as a safeguard against premature damage to the robot. DARPA demonstrated the new Atlas with a fall arrestor in place. 'Risk mitigation is part of the game,' Pratt said. 'It's up to the teams to decide what chances they're willing to take during training and risk falls and damage, but come the DRC Finals, the cords are cut.' The researchers even taught the robot to stand on one leg - recreating a key scene from the film in the process. The Atlas robot has already shown it can walk, jump and even drive a car . However, it's not just karate - Ian has another trick up his sleeve - software written by the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Interaction which allows him to drive a car. 'To achieve this level of maneuverability in robots, researchers at IHMC look toward nature,' the team say. 'Inspired by the speed of cheetahs, the endurance of horses, the maneuverability of monkeys, and the versatility of humans, IHMC researchers are on a quest to develop legged robots that are fast, efficient, and graceful, with the mobility required to access many of the same places that humans can.' At the US Government's Robo-Olympics, Ian came second, despite competing as a virtual software simulation. Despite his lack of limbs, the world's most innocuously named 'bot was able to walk, carry a fire hose and, most impressively, get in a car and drive it. The 'crane' stance, being held by Karate Kid Daniel LaRusso (played by Ralph Maccio left) in the 1984 film inspired the latest movements of the Atlas robot. It demonstrates strong balancing skills and composure and showcases the agility of the Google-owned machine, said the firm . Atlas is a high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain, Boston Dynamics said. 'Atlas can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift, carry, and manipulate the environment. In extremely challenging terrain, Atlas is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet, to pick its way through congested spaces. The Atlas robot has an articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder so it can 'see' where it is going. 'Articulated, sensate hands will enable Atlas to use tools designed for human use. Atlas includes 28 hydraulically-actuated degrees of freedom, two hands, arms, legs, feet and a torso. 'An articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder.' Atlas is powered from an off-board, electric power supply via a flexible tether - although a new version promises to remove this.","Google says robot could replicate a deceased loved one or a celebrity .

"It is one of the most dangerous sports in the world and one in every 15 bull rides ends in an injury of some sort. But that isn't enough to stop hundreds of child riders, some as young as seven, from taking the hot seat each year. Among them is Lance Lara, 10, from Fort Worth in Texas, who has proved so successful that he was crowned world champion in his age group last year. Bouncing around: A young bull rider takes on a bullock (steer) at a rodeo in Fort Worth, Texas . But each time he gets on a bullock, a castrated male, he risks life and limb, and has already been trampled on several times. That, however, is not enough to stop his father TJ, himself a former bull rider, from entering Lance, his older brother Joe, 15, and his sister Jayden, seven, into competitions all over the US. 'It’s about taking chances and these kids, that’s what they’re doing,' he explains in an interview with Channel 4's Unreported World. 'They’re taking chances and as parents we’re taking a chance. This is a very dangerous sport and you can’t take it kiddish and [be] playing around because that’s when you can get hurt.' Bull riding is a multi-billion dollar industry in the US and events staged by the PBR, the professional bull riders' association, are watched by up to half a billion people around the world each year. Ouch! Most bull riders are speedily thrown off - a good result is eight seconds . Hitting the deck: An estimated one in 15 bull rides across all age groups ends in injury of some sort . Starting small: The youngest children hone their skills on sheep before graduating to calves . But as the stakes get higher, pressure to breed bulls that are more athletic, more vicious and bigger than ever before has increased - including in the junior division. For Cody Custer, a former bull riding world champion, it is becoming too dangerous. 'You take a young teenage boy and put him on a bull that’s got a massive pedigree,' he explains. 'It would be kind of like putting a young 13, 14 year old footballer against an NFL player. It’s just not even.' Another young bull-rider, 16-year-old Trey, who has been knocked out several times by oversized bulls, agrees. 'The breeding system nowadays is getting so intense and so hard-core, it’s not even realistic. 'The more stuff they breed and the more stuff they do, it’s making bucking harder and harder. It’s crazy.' That, however, isn't enough to quell the Lara family's enthusiasm. All three children started when they were barely more than toddlers, honing their skills on sheep in a sport known colloquially as 'mutton throwing'. Not happy: Even the calves, such as the one pictured, can pack a hefty punch if enraged . Moving on: The next step is to ride bullocks (castrated young males) before culminating in big bulls . Tough task: Bullocks, who are often approaching the size of a full-grown female, are no easy ride . Now seven, Jayden, the youngest, has graduated onto calves while Lance takes on bullocks and Joe wrangles bulls. But of all the Lara children, it is Lance who takes the sport most seriously, training for two hours a day, every day, in a bid to achieve his ambition of becoming a PBR rider. He has also suffered several injuries. 'I was hanging upside down and next thing you know I was on the ground,' he recalls. 'Stepped on.' Determined not to show his family up, the 10-year-old says he managed to hold back his tears until he left the arena. 'Most of all the things that daddy says is: don’t cry in the arena,' he explains. 'I cried in the back pen.' Despite the hard work and the injuries, Lance's fledgling career has proved lucrative, with the boy earning an impressive $5,000 last year. Big guns: Teenagers begin with small bulls but, should they make professional, graduate onto big ones . Aggressive: Bulls bred for rodeo are becoming increasingly large and athletic . This money is being put towards paying for college and TJ couldn't be more proud. 'I think he feels the pressure he puts on himself,' he says. 'You know the pressure of wanting to win, wanting to be number one. I always tell him I’m going to throw you to the wolves, you either come back leading the pack or you get eaten. 'He’s always been one of the smaller guys. It’s something to kind of motivate him, pump him up.' He does, however, worry about the increasingly large bulls involved. 'Lance has eight more years before he can even think about riding here [in the main arena],' he says. 'Just think if these bulls are bucking this hard and are this rank right now, what are they going to be like in eight years when he’s there? 'If it continues the way it is, the sport of rodeo the way it is, it’ll no longer be a bull riding, it will be just a bull bucking competition. It’s all about money.'","Children as young as seven can take part in bull riding competitions .

"Comedian Sarah Silverman is encouraging women to understand their worth and ask for equal pay in a new campaign in which she recounts a time she was discriminated against because of her gender. The 44-year-old, who is known for her wicked sense of humor, gets serious for Levo League's Ask4More campaign, which calls for women to request the salaries that they deserve in honor of Equal Pay Day on April 14. 'I think the best person for the job should get jobs,' she says in the campaign video. 'I'm all for women having to work harder to prove themselves at this juncture if that's the way it is in the world. But if you work a job, and a man is working the same job, you should be getting paid the same.' Scroll down for video . Be confident: Sarah Silverman wants women to understand their worth as a part of Levo League's new Ask4More campaign, which encourages women to request the salaries that they deserve . On average, women only earn 78 cents for every dollar made by men, and in the clip, the actress recalls a time when she was faced with an even worse pay margin because of her gender. Sarah explains that she and fellow comedian Todd Barry were doing back-to-back stand up sets on a Saturday night at the New York Comedy Club. Even though she says she was 'pretty well known at the time', she 'didn't think anything of it' when she was given $10 for her work. But when she was chatting with Todd outside, it soon came up that he was offered $60 for the same amount of work - at the same show. When she went back inside and asked Al Martin, the owner at the time, about the pay discrepancy, he thought that she was asking him to lend her money, saying: 'Oh, did you want a $60 spot?' Not right: In the video, Sarah recalls a time when she was paid $10 to do a stand-up routine, when a man who performed the same amount of time earned $60 . 'It was symbolic. I didn't need $60,' she says of that moment. 'You know, it’s pretty sh****.' Sarah, who came under fire last month after she tweeted 'ten rape prevention tips' aimed at male attackers, says whenever she shares anything 'women's rights related' on social media, including equal pay and health care, she gets 'the most violent hate tweets back'. 'It's so odd. It's just bizarre,' she says. Sarah explains that knowing your self-worth is a big factor when it comes to women feeling confident to ask for more. 'My therapist says - and I think about it all the time - we don't get what we want. We get what we think we deserve,' she added. Double standard: The 44-year-old comedian, who is pictured at the 2015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, says she gets 'the most violent hate tweets' when she discusses women's issues on Twitter . Sports fan: Sarah, who often plays basketball with men, was pictured with Anthony Anderson as they watched Sprite NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in New York City in February . She notes that the concept of asking for more and understanding your worth reminds of her of how she feels when she plays basketball with men. 'Every basket you miss is like missing 100 baskets and that comes from inside.' Sarah says she reminds herself that she isn't letting her team down, nor or the guys angry at her for missing a shot. The pressure she feels is being brought upon by herself. She explains that she finally realized that 'the guys shoot and miss all the time - most of the time - and they get better. 'We deserve quality lives with equality, and maybe control over our own human bodies without the government getting involved, to do whatever we get great at and do, and it has to come from inside and understanding that you deserve it and working to deserve it,' she says, before adding: ‘Go ahead. Ask for more.' Sarah is a part of the nine-day campaign, which aims to empower women throughout their careers and includes other female celebrity supporters such as Amy Poehler, Chelsea Clinton and Constance Zimmer.","The 44-year-old came under fire last month after she tweeted 'ten rape prevention tips' aimed at male attackers .

"On Saturday, Rosetta swooped to within just 8.6 miles (14 km) of comet 67P's surface. During this close flyby, the probe was able to capture a stunning four image montage showing the two lobes of the icy comet in incredible detail. The top right frame offers a stunning view onto Hapi, the comet’s ‘neck’ region that is littered with boulders. As part of the recent moves around comet 67P, Rosetta swooped to within about 8.6 miles (14 km) of the comet’s surface on Saturday. Its camera was able to capture a four image montage scale at this distance is 1.7 m/pixel showing the large lobe of the icy comet to the left and the small lobe to the right . The view also gives a detailed look at the numerous, curved markings visible on the smooth surface. In the same frame, details in the cliffs of Hathor can be seen, leading up to the ‘head’ of the comet’s small lobe. The region towards the right of this frame shows the transition between this smooth, presumably dust-covered portion, and the layered, exposed cliffs below. The European Space Agency also recently released a trove ofimages captured by the Rosetta probe during its long journey to Comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko. This stunning scene was created from two Rosetta frames acquired at 12 miles (19.9 km) from the comet centre on 28 March. The scale is about 1.7 m/pixel and the image measures 3.1 x 1.7 km . The top right frame offers a stunning view onto Hapi, the comet’s ‘neck’ region littered with boulders. The scale at this distance is 1.4 m/pixel . They include images of Earth and Mars which were taken when the probe was attempting ‘gravity assist manoeuvres’ in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet. As Rosetta makes an adventurous passes through the geysers of comet in the coming months, scientists hope to discover more information about the comet’s interior from the jets. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 3.3ft (one metre) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Philae managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power. Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing to orbit and study the comet. From data collected by the two proves, Esa said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. And with the comet becoming more active as it approaches the sun, these next few months are providing the best opportunity yet to study the comet - but it is not without risk. ‘The comet is getting super exciting,’ said Esa’s Rosetta project scientist Dr Matt Taylor in The Times. ‘Hundreds of kilos per second of material is flinging off it. We want to a do a fly-by through one of these active regions.’ The probe will be brought within nine miles (15km) of the comet, with its path taking it right through 67P’s geysers. These jets are formed when ice on the surface sublimates - or vapourises - and they become more active as the comet approaches the sun. It is getting closer and closer over the next few months, with its point of closest approach taking place in August. As it becomes more active, Rosetta has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data. In so doing, though, the probe can become disorientated. It relies on seeing stars to know where it is, but the jets can obscure its view. This means that, occasionally, the spacecraft has to take evasive actions when it passes through a jet, to get itself into empty space and re-orientate itself relative to the stars. But studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface, and it could also reveal the connection between the comet’s atmosphere - its coma - and the surface. As the comet gets closer to the sun, scientists will also be hoping to hear from the Philae lander on the surface. The washing machine-sized Philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67P on 12 November 2014. But after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface, the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power. The European Space Agency also recently released a trove of images captured by the Rosetta probe during its long journey to Comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Seen here is Rosetta's view of Earth on March 5th, 2005 . The latest images include ones of Earth and Mars which were taken when the probe was attempting ‘gravity assist manoeuvres’ in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet. Pictured is Mars as seen by Rosetta in 2007 . Now, as the comet approaches the sun, it is hoped that solar rays will recharge Philae’s batteries and bring it back to life. Earlier in March scientists sent commands to the lander in the hope it would respond, but with no luck. On 14 April they will make another attempt to get in contact - and, if it stirs from its slumber, Philae will have a fantastic opportunity to study the comet as it reaches peak activity. Speaking about the most recent attempt to find the probe, Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin told MailOnline: ‘We were trying to see if the lander would wake up and, at the same time, we sent some commands for the lander to better divide its weight and power situation. ‘We don’t yet know if the commands have gone through - we might have to wait a bit longer - but basically after one week we did not receive a signal from the lander.’ The main issue at the moment is that, for the lander simply to wake up, it needs enough sunlight to produce 5.5 watts of power - a temperature of around -45°C (-49°F). But to start communicating with Rosetta again the temperature needs to raise a few more degrees so it can generate 19 watts of power. It may have already reached the former level, which might mean it is already operational and able to receive signals - but we won’t hear anything until it boosts its power to the latter. The next few months are certain to be an exciting time, though - not just for Philae, but for the orbiting Rosetta spacecraft as well.","On Saturday, Rosetta was just 8.6 miles (14 km) of the comet’s surface .

"ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. Round up: The broadcast, hosted by a man with an American accent, boasted of ISIS victories during the day. Pictured: Fighting in Yarmouk was high on the agenda of the radio broadcast . It provided an overview of the militants activities in Iraq, Syria and Libya, discussing a range of topics  - including the alleged death of an ISIS commander in the Yarmouk refugee camp in the Syrian capital, Damascus, a suicide bombing in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk and mortar attacks on militias in Sirte, Libya. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. But the radio station is not the only option ISIS commanders are using to reach out to English-speakers: they already have a monthly propaganda magazine, Dabiq. The magazine - named after the Syrian town where a 'malahim', the equivalent to an Armageddon, in which the Muslims ultimately prevail - has so far issued eight editions, covering events like those in Paris and Sydney. It also boasts about some of its worst atrocities in the pages of the glossy booklet - which has even outlined a religious justification for slavery. Dominance?: Is the latest English medium to be used by ISIS - they already have an English magazine . Exactly why ISIS commanders have decided to branch out from print to radio now is not known, but it comes within days of it being revealed a new school of nursing in the militants' de facto capital Raqqa would only accept English-speaking applicants. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after they finish training. However, English's dominance around the globe is likely to mean it is the most convenient language to use when communicating with the estimated 20,000 fighters from 90 countries around the globe who have joined ISIS.","First broadcast hosted by a man with an American-sounding accent .

"Jon Bon Jovi can't go home. After almost two years on the market and an initial listing of $42million, the singer has sold his 7,500-square-foot New York City penthouse for $37.5million. The New Jersey native bought the SoHo pad in 2007 for $24million, so even with the price cut is making an impressive profit. A bargain... for a billionaire: Jon Bon Jovi has sold his New York City apartment for $37.5million . On the road again: The Misunderstood singer seen here performing in Detroit, Michigan . The sale, by Douglas Elliman, was reported by Street Easy, though the buyer is not known. The duplex has two levels and comes with five bedrooms, five-and-a-half bathrooms and two  kitchens. Floor to ceiling windows offer panoramic views of the city, and 11-ft high ceilings make the interior open and filled with light. A wood-fire burning fireplaces add a homey feel to the spread which is decorated primarily in soft brown, beige and cream colors.

The . property, which is located between Prince and Houston streets, sits on . the top floor of the New Museum’s 158 Mercer Street building. This isn't the first time the Bon Jovi singer has listed the apartment. In 2010 he reportedly placed it on the market for $45m but then pulled the listing. It's my life...and my investment: The 51-year-old bought this downtown property for $24m in 2007 and his initial sales price was almost double that . This isn't the only property owned by the singer, born John Francis Bongiovi Jr. He and his wife Dorothea have a multi-acre river-front spread in the sleepy but swanky town of Red Bank, New Jersey, and a large . house on one of the most notable and costly streets in East Hampton, New York, . that they plucked up in August 2004 for $7.6million. In 2013 the band was estimated by Forbes to be worth approximately $79million. Their Because We Can Tour earned $3million per city, a massive number in the touring circuit. Jon gives back with Soul Kitchen, a pay as you want restaurant in New Jersey. On a clear day you can see forever: The person lucky enough to buy this penthouse won't gain only stunning views, they'll also inherit all of the furniture the rocker picked out himself . Now that's a family couch: The father of four could certainly fit his kids Stephanie, Jesse James, Jacob and Romeo on this semi-circle sofa that sits in front of a wood burning fireplace .

"The £135,000 was spent trapping and moving water voles from the Somerset Levels ahead of dredging . Taxpayers have footed a £135,000 bill to move 50 protected water voles - at a cost of £2,500 per animal - to allow dredging of the Somerset Levels. The bill for moving the creatures is nearly six times the original estimate, it was revealed today. In January and February 2014 residents on the Levels were forced to abandon their homes after record rainfall saw rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging. More than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated with quickly rising waters and entire villages were cut off in the wettest January since records began in 1766. But the Environment Agency says it has a legal duty under EU-backed regulations to protect the water voles as an endangered species. The £135,000 was spent trapping and moving 55 of the six-inch-long furry creatures from their bankside burrows on the Somerset Levels ahead of dredging work. In February, when the scheme was first revealed it was estimated it would cost £24,000 to put the tiny voles into 'winter storage'. But now the Environment Agency has admitted that another £86,000 had to be spent on a 'wildlife survey'. Previously the agency had claimed the wildlife survey was not part of the cost of relocating the voles. And when other costs are factored in, the total bill came to £135,000. Scroll down for video . The survey involved setting up traps along the river banks and checking them over a period of several months - the cost of which was not previously disclosed. Now some Somerset Levels residents - while anxious to have rivers dredged to avoid the devastating floods from two winters ago - think the scheme is an unnecessary waste of public money. They say the people who approved the plan are living in Kenneth Grahame's book for children, The Wind in the Willows, featuring Ratty - a water vole - Mole, Badger and Mister Toad. Farmer James Winslade believes the voles would have moved themselves elsewhere when the dredgers began work and argues they did not need to be captured and moved 100 miles to a new home. Residents  abandoned their homes after  rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging . More than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland (pictured) were inundated with quickly rising waters in late 2013 and early 2014 and entire villages were cut off in the wettest January since records began in 1766 . He said dredging often took place across the Levels before the Environment Agency took over, and that in the past it had never appeared to affect the vole population. 'They're not stupid, they'll feel the vibration of the dredgers and move - it's not like they haven't any other habitat to move on to,' he said. 'The river bank adjoins fields so they can move from the river banks to the fields, and move back once the dredgers have gone.' Money spent on relocating the voles was a small percentage of the £6 millionspent on dredging five miles (8 km) of the rivers Tone and Parrett, the agency said previously. The 'rescued' voles spent the winter in an 'over-wintering facility' before being moved to new riverside homes in Hampshire and Cornwall. Ecology expert Graeme Skinner said the work required professional, academically-trained people 'who hold relevant licences'. The Environment Agency says it has a legal duty  to protect water voles (pictured) as an endangered species . The levels today, after the flooding - the voles have now been moved to a new home 100 miles away . Some Somerset Levels residents - while anxious to have rivers dredged to avoid the devastating floods (pictured) - think the scheme to remove the voles is an unnecessary waste of public money . He said: 'They are undertaking sometimes long, arduous hours in the field to make sure it's up to the standard that is required nowadays.' About 130,000 cubic metres of silt was removed from the Parrett and Tone rivers at Burrowbridge after the floods devastated hundreds of homes. An Environment Agency spokesman said 'We had a legal duty to move the voles, which are critically endangered and protected. 'The over-wintering is necessary to ensure their survival. 'Relocating them was an essential piece of work - if we hadn't moved this population of voles then it would not have been possible to complete the dredging. 'It is unusual for the agency to undertake a substantial relocation project like this.' The dredging forms the first phase of the 20-year Somerset Flood Action Plan. Following the devastation, which took place between December 2013 and March 2014, 8,000 metres of river was dredged at a cost of £6 million. About 130,000 cubic metres of silt was removed from the Parrett and Tone rivers at Burrowbridge .","It has cost the taxpayer £135,000 to move 55 protected water voles .
They have been removed from Somerset Levels for dredging to take place .
In  2014 over 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were flooded with water after rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging .

"A father and his two sons who accosted pensioners with dementia in the street asking for payment for roof repairs they hadn't done have been jailed for a total of eight years. Albert Webb, 51, and sons Jimmy Chuter, 26, and Jesse Webb, 19, followed people aged up to 97 home from the Post Office after they had collected their pensions before demanding the cash. If the victim had no money on them, they would be driven to a nearby cash point to withdraw it, or the trio would con their way into their homes before stealing from them. Albert Webb, 51, from Surrey, was jailed for three and a half years and son Jimmy Chuter, 26, was jailed for four years after they harassed pensioners with dementia in the street, demanding money . In total the family gang carried out 35 thefts, starting in February 2012 - when pensioners were still able to withdraw cash from their local Post Office. Most of the victims were women aged in their 70s or 80s, while the eldest was a 97-year-old man. The trio would drive alongside their victims in a silver Mercedes C200 until they got close to their house, before jumping out and telling them they had come to collect payment for roofing work. Jesse Webb, 19, was due to be sentenced with his father and brother, but went on the run. He was given a 12 month term this week after being caught . In fact, no work had been carried out, but because many of the elderly victims were suffering from dementia, they simply accepted what they were being told. The offending continued until October 2015 across Hertfordshire, Avon and Somerset, Hampshire, Oxford and Surrey. By the time officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary managed to catch up with the gang, it is believed they had taken around £15,000 from their vulnerable victims. Appearing at St Albans Crown Court in January, Chuter, from  Somerset, was jailed for four years for conspiracy to defraud and Albert Webb, from Surrey, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years for burglary and fraud offences. Jesse Webb was due to be sentenced on the same day, but went on the run. He was tracked down and appeared in the dock on Thursday this week, where he was given 12 months behind bars. Detective constable Kieran Doyle said: 'We were able to arrest his father and brother and bring them before the courts but Jesse evaded police so upon their sentencing, we issued a wanted appeal to trace Jesse. 'We received information which led us to him and I'm pleased that he has had his day in court. 'These really were shameful crimes and it's beyond belief that they could stoop so low to pick out their victims and follow them home, and then make them believe they had carried out repairs to their house and harass them for money.' Officers have started proceedings to confiscate their criminal gains under the Proceeds of Crime Act.The vehicle used during the crimes has already been confiscated by police. St Albans Crown Court heard that the trio would follow their elderly victims, often stalking them home from the Post Office, before jumping out of a car and demanding cash for repairs they hadn't done .","Albert Webb, 51, ran con with sons Jimmy Chuter, 26, and Jesse Webb, 19 .

"The family of an Illinois man slain during a botched robbery say they fear for their lives after the killer escaped from jail earlier week after beating a guard unconscious and stealing his uniform and SUV. As the manhunt continues, Nelson Williams Sr. of Kankakee, says he is worried that 23-year-old Kamron Taylor, the man convicted of his son Nelson Jr's murder, might attack him. 'As I go home every night, I figure he might ambush me like he did my son,' he told WLS-TV on Thursday. In a courthouse outburst in February, Taylor threatened the family minutes after hearing the guilty verdict. Williams, 48, says Taylor shouted, 'I'm going to get you mother*******.' Scroll down for video . In fear for his life: Nelson Williams Sr (left), the father of a murder victim, says he is scared his son's convicted killer, Kamron T. Taylor (right) will go after him after his daring prison break . Not going quietly: In this photo taken in February, Taylor was removed from a Kankakee County courtroom after struggling with the deputies and yelling at the Nelson family in the crowd, ' I'm going to get you, mother*******' Taylor, who has a history of escape attempts, fled from the Jerome Combs Detention Center in Kankakee at about 3am Wednesday. He somehow escaped from his cell, hid inside the facility, then beat and choked the guard who was making rounds, said Kankakee County Sheriff Timothy Bukowski. Taylor, a 23-year-old from Kankakee, is considered armed and dangerous, the sheriff said. He was convicted of first-degree murder in February in the June 2013 death of Nelson Williams Jr, 21, and faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison. Sheriff's officials believe someone may be helping Taylor hide. They warned the public that harboring a fugitive is a criminal offense that will be prosecuted. A $7,500 reward is now being offered for information leading to Taylor's arrest. Twenty-eight officers have fanned out across the county, searching dozens of residences with the help of dogs and surveillance helicopters above. Analysts from the Illinois State Police have been mapping out lists of Taylor's relatives and associates, examining his past phone conversations and jail visitation records to help lead investigators to probable locations where the fugitive might be hiding out. As of Friday morning, officers armed with rifles have searched about 50 home in eastern Illinois . Bukowski said investigators were also considering the possibility that Taylor could have fled elsewhere. Besides hunting him down, investigators were eager to determine how Taylor got free in what was the first successful escape from the decade-old lockup housing about 450 detainees. Escaped: The 23-year-old Taylor was awaiting sentencing for the June 2013 murder of Nelson Williams Jr, 21 (right), when authorities say he beat a guard into unconsciousness, took his keys and uniform and sped off in his SUV . Disguised: Taylor was captured on a surveillance camera fleeing the Kankakee jail dressed in a guard's uniform . 'The speculation on my part is somebody didn't do their job properly,' Bukowski said. After getting free of his two-man cell in a lockdown unit, where he has been awaiting sentencing, Taylor hid out and attacked the guard, a military veteran with 10 years of correctional experience, Bukowski said. By wearing the guard's uniform, Taylor was able to fool other guards in a master control room who opened three sets of doors for him after visual verification by surveillance video, Bukowski said. Once outside, the suspect repeatedly pressed the guard's key fob to locate his Chevrolet Equinox in a parking lot and drive away. Authorities didn't learn of the escape until about 30 minutes later, when jail staff found the wounded officer, who is hospitalized in intensive care with head wounds. 'He was in and out of consciousness, unable to understand the questions that were given to him,' Bukowski said of the guard at a news conference. A few hours after sunrise, officers found the abandoned SUV in a residential area of Kankakee and approached the vehicle with their guns drawn. But Taylor was nowhere to be found and it wasn't clear whether he fled on foot or someone picked him up in another vehicle, the sheriff said. At one point Wednesday, authorities issued an alert for a 15-year-old girl, Savannah Bell, who they believed was with Taylor. Illinois State Police later announced the girl had been found, but did not say where or how officials found her or whether she had been with Taylor. Wanted: A $1,000 reward is being offered by police for any information that leads to Taylor's capture . Dangerous: A woman rushes to her car in Kankakee, Ill., Wednesday, April 1, 2015, after being told by police that officers were searching in the area for prison escapee Kamron T. Taylor . Following the trail: Police approach a vehicle with guns drawn that convicted murderer Kamron T. Taylor stole during his escape . Jail staffing levels and procedures will be re-examined, but Bukowski said Taylor's history of violence and previous escape attempts didn't necessarily single him out for stricter security measures. 'It raises an alert, I guess,' he said. 'But you figure the people that are locked up in our facility aren't altar boys and you take certain precautions for all of them. And you can't become complacent with anybody ... especially a murderer.' Safe and well: Authorities say they’ve found a 15-year-old girl, Savannah Bell, who they had thought to be in the company of convicted murderer who escaped from jail. Bukowski told reporters that the detention center has lost between 15 and 20 per cent of its staff, forcing guards to work extra hours in a change that he said did not go unnoticed by the 450 inmates. Asked whether he thought staffing at the jail was adequate, Bukowski told reporters he would like to see the levels that pre-dated the budget cuts, acknowledging that guards working overtime 'get tired and they start to make mistakes.' 'The inmates could see them working a double shift and see that they were tired,' he said. 'So all those factors contribute to what's going on.' He said budget cuts also got in the way of planned security enhancements, but he refused to go into specifics on that or precise staffing numbers, saying 'the inmates already know too much.' During his trial in February, Taylor tried to escape from the courthouse minutes after hearing the guilty verdict. Several sheriff's deputies and bailiffs wrestled him to the ground, and Taylor shouted expletives at the gallery as they led him away, according to a report in The (Kankakee) Daily Journal. He also escaped briefly after his arrest in 2013 but was detained several blocks away, the newspaper reported at the time. Taylor was found guilty of the June 2013 shooting death of 21-year-old Nelson Williams Jr. during a botched robbery at Williams' home in Kankakee. Online court records show his sentencing is scheduled for May 11.","Kamron T. Taylor was recently convicted of murdering Nelson Williams Jr, 21, in June 2013 .

"A South Australian law professor has said that police acted ‘outrageously’ by subjecting a woman to an oral swab test after she was reported for flashing her breasts. Karen Davis, from Port Pirie in South Australia, notoriously flashed her K-cup breasts on Google Street View and was reported by police with disorderly behaviour. She handed herself into police voluntarily. However, ABC News reports that South Australian law professor Rick Sarre believed it should not result in charges or a court appearance and that the swab was unnecessary. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . ‘I think it's outrageous, but I know young juvenile offenders who have been questioned over certain things who have had the same thing happen to them,’ he said. 'That behaviour's being defended by the police commissioner, who says ''that's what happens these days''. ‘That doesn't surprise me because unfortunately that's the kind of law and order climate in which this Government has pushed us in the last dozen years.’ The 38-year-old was captured streaking by a camera car for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. Police released a statement alleging the 38-year-old mother 'pursued' the Google car to make sure she was captured exposing herself, and that it was an illegal act. 'The woman’s actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the public expectation is that we take action,' said Superintendent Scott Denny of Port Pirie police. 'Recently in Port Pirie we arrested a man for exposing himself in public - this incident is no different. 'It is not appropriate for anyone to expose themselves in public places. Our community should be able to expect a bit of decency.' In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Ms Davis, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at the controversy caused by her actions, claiming that 'flat-tittie chicks' are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Ms Davis had issues with her size-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I  always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.","Karen Davis was photographed on Google Street View flashing her breasts .

"It tells the story of coal miners in a tough working-class community in Wales. And it seems the film Pride was a little overwhelming for soft-hearted Hampstead socialist Ed Miliband. The Labour leader has confessed he cried when he and his wife Justine watched a DVD of the 2014 movie starring Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband , picture today on a David Brown Gear Systems factory in Huddersfield, has finally confessed that he is a geek who spent his childhood obsessing over computer games . Weepy: A scene from the 2014 British film Pride featuring Bill Nighy (in tie) He said: ‘Pride is about the lesbian and gay community in London who go and help the miners in Wales and Justine and I watched it recently. I blubbed.’ In a radio interview, Mr Miliband was asked about Jeremy Paxman’s description of him as a ‘north London geek’ during his television grilling last week. He said: ‘I plead guilty to being a geek. I’m proud.’ The Labour leader claimed never to have been a trainspotter or a member of a chess club, but said that as a 12-year-old he had a ‘big passion’ for the 1983 video game Manic Miner, which he played using his ZX Spectrum computer linked to a TV. The Labour leader said he struggles with hand-eye coordination but when he was 12-years-old drove his parents ‘slightly mad’ playing Manic Miner . Mr Miliband said as Labour leader he used to use an iPhone, but gave it up for a BlackBerry because he spent too much time reading tweets and political commentary . Talking to Absolute Radio’s Geoff Lloyd, he said: ‘I was brilliant. As I remember, there were 20 levels. I’m not sure I’m very good at hand-eye coordination but I was good at Manic Miner. ‘I used to drive my parents slightly mad because you used to play it on the telly, obviously, so they wouldn’t be able to watch.’ Mr Miliband said he used to use an iPhone, but gave it up for a BlackBerry because he had been spending too much time reading tweets and political commentary. He added: ‘The good thing about a BlackBerry... I’m going to insult the BlackBerry makers now, is it’s harder to do those things so it’s got a more limited functionality, I think they call it.’ Despite downgrading his phone, perhaps to avoid having to read negative remarks about himself, Mr Miliband insisted he was thick-skinned. Despite downgrading phone to avoid negative remarks about himself, Mr Miliband insisted he is ‘thick-skinned’ ‘I think it comes with the territory of the job,’ he said. ‘You know what’s kept me going throughout all this, is a sort of inner belief. ‘If I was just running for this job because I wanted my face on the wall inside Downing Street, then that wouldn’t be enough for the motivation. My motivation is to change the country.’ Mr Miliband said that his mother calls him Edward when she is unhappy with him, but claimed she had not done this when he chose to stand against his brother David for the Labour leadership. Mr Miliband said that he was a fan of the singer Ellie Goulding (left) and the band Bastille (right), but claimed he did not spend his time learning about popular culture to try and appear like a normal person . He said: ‘So, I was quite a lot of things. I was an Edward, and partly when I lived in America I was an Eddie. I was a Ted at university. I sort of became a Ted briefly but I’m happy with Ed.’ He joked: ‘My mum calls me Edward if I’m in trouble or if she doesn’t like one of our policies.’ Mr Miliband said that he was a fan of the singer Ellie Goulding and the band Bastille, but claimed he did not spend his time learning about popular culture to try to appear normal.

"On her son's first birthday, Taniya Astbury expects to shed a tear of joy - as it's a day she thought she'd never see. Her little boy defied the odds - as well as doctors' warnings - that he had no chance of survival. Benjamin was born 12 weeks early, weighing 1lb 3oz, little more than a bag of sugar. He suffered five cardiac arrests and was born with a bowel problem requiring two emergency operations. Benjamin Astbury, who doctors said would not survive after he was born, has defied the odds and is about to celebrate his first birthday. He is pictured here with mother Tanyia, 36 . When he was born 12 weeks early, Benjamin weighed just 1lb 30z, little more than a bag of sugar . At one point he had such severe breathing problems he was put into a paralysed state for six days while doctors tried to save his life. He was given just a 10 per cent chance of surviving, and his parents were told on many occasions he was too weak to live. But Benjamin battled on and has defied medics to approach his first birthday, and although he is still underweight at 13lbs, is thriving at home with his family. His mother Mrs Astbury, 36, from Buckley,  North Wales, said his survival shows 'miracles do happen'. 'There are times when my husband Steven and I have been absolutely distraught,' she said. 'But miracles do happen and we are absolutely over the moon. 'Benjamin is doing really well at the moment and we are coming up to his first birthday despite having been told a number of times he wouldn't make it. Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious illness in which tissues in the intestine (gut) become inflamed and start to die. This can lead to a hole developing which allows the contents of the intestine to leak into the abdomen (tummy). This can cause a very dangerous infection. NEC is the most common surgical emergency in newborn babies and tends to affect more babies born prematurely than those born full-term. In many cases, NEC can be treated without surgery, by resting the bowel by using intravenous feeding and treating any infection with antibiotics. During this period, the child will have a nasogastric (NG) tube passed through their nose to drain off the contents of their stomach. They will also have a drip of fluids and medicines. However, the child will need an operation if they develop a hole in their bowel or do not respond to the treatment above. The operation is carried out under a general anaesthetic and can last between 30 minutes and four hours, depending on the severity of the NEC. Source: Great Ormond Street Hospital . 'He was so tiny when he was born and one of the nurses said he was the smallest she had ever seen in her 16 years at the hospital. 'But he is definitely a fighter - he has already been through so much.' Benjamin spent his first days in the Wrexham Maelor's Special Care Baby Unit before being transferred to Liverpool Women's Hospital. He was diagnosed with necrotising enterocolitis, a condition where tissue in some portions of the bowel die. It means a hole can develop in the bowel, allowing the contents of the intestine to leak into the stomach, causing a very dangerous infection. The illness is one of the most common causes of death in premature infants. Benjamin was put on a ventilator to help him breathe and doctors warned he was extremely ill. A C-reactive protein infection marker test - which checks for levels of inflammation and infection in the body - showed a score of 324. Less than four is considered a good score on the test. Benjamin underwent emergency surgery at Liverpool's Alder Hey Hospital, which left him with two stomas - openings on the abdomen which allow waste to leave the body. In a matter of days his condition deteriorated and he was put into a paralysed state. He was hooked up to an oscillator, a machine used to help someone breathe when a ventilator is no longer working. The machine shook his body for six days, in order to relieve pressure from his lungs. Mrs Astbury said it was heartbreaking to see her son suffer. Benjamin had five cardiac arrests, two emergency bowel operations and was even put into a paralysed state on a ventilator for six days . He is now thriving at home with his family. His mother said: 'We are so proud of him and in awe of him we hope he can be an inspiration to others' She said: 'It was really horrible to see. 'He was given steroids and he pulled through again but in September, after a reversal of the stomas, he began having breathing problems.' Benjamin began to have laryngospasms, a brief spasm of the vocal cords that temporarily makes it difficult to speak or breathe. They are caused a partial blocking of the airwaves when breathing in. 'Just touching him or changing his nappy could turn him blue,' Mrs Astbury said. 'Benjamin underwent another emergency operation on his bowel but he also had five cardiac arrests in this period up until Christmas which was very frightening but again, he has come through them.' Now at home since the turn of the year, Benjamin will still have to endure further operations. But his mother is still delighted he is at home with his family. She said: 'To see him get close to his first birthday after everything that has happened is amazing. 'We are so proud of him and in awe of him we hope he can be an inspiration to others.'","Benjamin Astbury was born 12 weeks early, weighing just 1lb 3oz .

"Criticism: Lord Prescott suggested the signatories were 'tax dodgers, Tory donors and non doms' Labour was at war with business again last night as the party lashed out at 120 bosses who warned the economic recovery could be wrecked if it regained power. Shadow Cabinet ministers branded the industry leaders who signed an open letter backing the Conservative economic plan as members of the ‘1 per cent’. Lord Prescott, an adviser to Ed Miliband, went further, suggesting the signatories were ‘tax dodgers, Tory donors and non doms’ – even though several were former Labour supporters. Business spokesman Chuka Umunna raised the stakes, suggesting that one, former Diageo boss Paul Walsh, should no longer take over as the head of the CBI. Mr Umunna said it would be ‘untenable’ for Mr Walsh to ‘claim to be independent in the light of this’. In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the election, 103 corporate leaders yesterday declared that the Government ‘has been good for business and has pursued policies which have supported investment and job creation’. Throughout the day, 17 more added their names, including the bosses of AstraZeneca, Citi Private Bank and Pirelli. ‘We believe a change in course will threaten jobs and deter investment. This would send a negative message about Britain and put the recovery at risk,’ they said. Attack: Labour's business spokesman Chuka Umunna (left) suggested that former Diageo boss Paul Walsh (right) should no longer take over as the head of the CBI . Involved: Some 103 corporate leaders yesterday declared that the Government ‘has been good for business’. Throughout the day, 17 more added their names, including the bosses of AstraZeneca (above) and Pirelli . Together, the businesses the executives run employ more than 600,000 people, and include brands such as Primark, Iceland, Pizza Express, Mothercare, Ocado, Moonpig, Ted Baker, Costa Coffee and LK Bennett. Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride also put their names to the list. Chancellor: George Osborne said  Labour’s pledge to raise the main rate of corporation tax to 21p represented 'a huge risk to the British economy' Labour MPs’ attempts to brand them all fat cats were undermined by the fact that the signatories included 29 heads of firms with fewer than 250 employees. Some had supported Labour at previous elections. George Osborne said Tories were offering ‘business stability’, while Labour’s pledge to raise the main rate of corporation tax to 21p represented ‘a huge risk to the British economy and to British jobs’. The Chancellor said: ‘Corporation tax is the main tax on business. Increase it and you increase the tax on investment, on growth and on jobs. It is as simple as that.’ And he said there were ‘just 36 days left to save Britain’s economic recovery’. An Ipsos Mori poll of FTSE 100 leaders suggests 86 per cent will back the Conservatives. Under Tony Blair, 55 per cent backed Labour. Veteran Labour MP Barry Sheerman claimed the letter indicated a ‘clear decline in British political life’, accusing the businesspeople of endorsing ‘right-wing policies that benefit them’. Last night Labour released its own list of names, backing a ‘Labour Government to put working people first’. It included dozens of workers who are on zero-hours contracts as well as advertising chief Trevor Beattie, fashion designer Wayne Hemingway and former Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business leaders features several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. They include Sir Charles Dunstone, chairman of Dixons Carphone and Talk Talk, who signed a letter backing Labour in 2005. Yo! Sushi founder Simon Woodroffe appeared in a 2004 Labour broadcast. He said: ‘To change now, half way through a recovery from the worst recession we have had in my lifetime seems to be a madness. You need to get behind the people doing the job.’ Other former Labour supporters who signed the letter included: Surinder Arora, described as a ‘big fan’ of Tony Blair in 2007; Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne, who unveiled a ‘seaside manifesto’ with Gordon Brown before the 2010 election; Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who made a donation to Labour in 1998’; and Moni Varma, who signed a letter to the Financial Times before the 2005 election backing Labour.

Getting cosy: Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne (right) unveiled a ‘seaside manifesto’ with Gordon Brown (left) before the 2010 election . Early in his leadership, Ed Miliband alienated business chiefs with class war rhetoric and quasi-Marxist policies his opponents said would drag Britain back to the 1970s. Here, JAMES SLACK examines how Red Ed drove a wedge between Labour and the wealth creators. The attack on ‘predatory’ big business . The energy price freeze threat . The Seizure of private land . Reinstating the 50p tax rate . Corporation tax reverse . The vicious row with Boots .","Shadow Cabinet ministers brand industry leaders as members of the '1%'
Lord Prescott suggests they are 'tax dodgers, Tory donors and non doms'
One of them, Diageo boss Paul Walsh, 'should no longer take over at CBI'
103 corporate leaders declared Government 'has been good for business'
In September 2011, Miliband marks his first year as Labour leader by threatening a more punitive system of tax and regulation for businesses that he considers to be ‘predators’ who are ‘just interested in the fast buck’.
The Institute of Directors says: ‘We would like to know how he plans to identify and reward “good” companies over “bad” ones. He should have more faith in customers and investors to decide’.
In his 2013 conference speech he pledges an incoming Labour government would freeze gas and electricity bills for 20 months.
Power firms say it will deter investment in much needed infrastructure. Energy UK says the policy risks making ‘energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone’.
Also that month Miliband announces councils should be allowed to fine developers if they acquire land with planning permission but do not build on it immediately. Town halls would also be able to buy and grant planning permission on land held by developers.
The IoD says the ‘use it or lose it’ declaration is a ‘Stalinist attack on property rights’. The Home Builders Federation says it ‘completely rejects’ the idea land is being hoarded.
In January 2014, Labour vows it will reverse George Osborne’s cut in the 50p rate of tax for anyone earning more than £150,000 – which, with disingenuous class war rhetoric, it dubs a ‘tax cut for millionaires’.
In a letter, the heads of 24 of Britain’s most successful companies say this would put the economic recovery at risk.
In September 2014 Labour pledges to reverse a 1p cut in corporation tax.
The IoD hits back: ‘It’s a dangerous move for Labour to risk our business-friendly environment in this way.’
In February Miliband and his supporters turn on Boots chief executive Stefano Pessina when he dares to say he fears Labour’s business policies will be a catastrophe. Pessina is labelled a tax avoider from Monaco.
Appalled business chiefs accuse the Labour leader of ‘playing the man not the ball’."

Jerry Brown has demanded a 25 percent cut in urban water usage and everyone from golf courses and other industrial and recreational facilities, as well as personal, home usage are impacted .

State reservoirs have a year's worth of water, and with record low snowfall over the winter there won't be much to replenish them. Wells in some parts of the state are going dry as groundwater levels fall . On Thursday, retired secretary Brenda Johnson stood in the doorway of her Sacramento home contemplating her lovingly tended lawn and azalea bushes. Johnson did not love the idea of brown as the new green. 'With the money I put into it, I don't want it to go dry,' said Johnson, who got a warning letter from the city last year for watering her front yard on the wrong day. 'I don't want a dead lawn,' she said. 'But change is hard, and you do adjust.' In Southern California's sunbathed city of Long Beach, homeowner Katherine Rusconi stood among the bright red, pink and yellow succulents and desert plants that make up her front yard, basking in the knowledge of being ahead of the game. The city of Long Beach gave her $3,000 in rebates for ripping out her own lawn less than two years ago. Some of her neighbors have since followed her lead, making the block a showpiece of water-saving, wildlife-friendly yards. With so much of Southern California a desert climate, 'this should have been in place for some time,' Rusconi said of the restrictions. Aerial view overlooking landscaping  in San Diego, California. Everyone from Campuses, golf courses and other industrial and recreational facilities, as well as personal, home usage are specifically targeted by Gov. Brown's cut in water usage .

Brown's move to get tough on water use came after his push for voluntary conservation yielded mixed results. Asked by Brown in January 2014 to cut their water consumption by 20 percent, Californians achieved only about half that. Affluent Southern California communities with lots of landscaping on automatic timers were some of the worst offenders, topping 300 gallons of water per person a day compared with 70 gallons for some San Francisco Bay Area communities. State water officials will now draw up the emergency regulations to carry out the governor's order and hope to have them ready for enactment in May, said George Kostyrko, spokesman for the state Water Resources Control Board. The governor's order requires the roughly 400 water agencies around the state to cut water use by one-quarter from the 2013 level. The state government is also ramping up a water conservation campaign that will include billboards and radio messages through the end of June. Homeowners will get rebates for replacing lawns with greenery more suited to the semi-arid state and for installing more water-thrifty appliances and plumbing fixtures. The state also will press water agencies to impose higher, graduated rates to discourage water guzzling.

State water officials stress it's the lush, green blades of grass they are after. 'When it is all said and done, what we are asking is that they cut back dramatically on their outdoor watering,' Kostyrko said. Californians should water enough to save their trees, water board head Felicia Marcus said, but should let their lawns go the way of all mortal things. In Sacramento, Goud Chetan has already scalped his front lawn, leaving it bare dirt on Thursday. Chetan said he will lay down gravel and shrubs instead, though not necessarily to be a good citizen during the drought. 'Really it's about the water bill and saving money,' Chetan said.

Californians will embrace saving water if they feel everyone is doing the same, water experts said. Brown's cutback order, however, exempts agriculture, which consumes 80 percent of all the water that Californians use. 'In times of scarcity, human nature is to do one's share if you think others are making similar sacrifices,' said Jonas Minton, a former senior state water official, now an adviser to the California-based Planning and Conservation League policy group. 'When it appears others are taking more than their share, it can be reduced to every person for themselves.' But farmers have already done their part, fallowing land and paying more for water, said Shawn Stevenson, a farmer in California's agricultural heartland, the Central Valley. Stevenson said he had to rip out nearly half his almond, pistachio and citrus trees. 'It's nice to know that some of our fellow state residents are going to share in the pain,' he said.

"Two thousand miles might seem like a long way to go just for fried chicken. But two long-time friends from Canada, who took their two sets of sons on a journey to the original home of Kentucky Fried Chicken in Corbin, Kentucky, said it's a trip they'll never forget. The group of six completed the drive in three days crossing two Canadian provinces including Quebec and Ontario, as well as five U.S. states - New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, according to The Times Tribune. For three of the sons, it was the first time they had tasted KFC. Two long-time friends and their four sons traveled from Montreal, Quebec to Corbin, Kentucky to eat at the original home of Kentucky Fried Chicken (above left to right: Jason Lutfy, Sebastien Lutfy, Neil Janna, Jesse Janna, Josh Janna and Brian Lutfy) Brian Lutfy, center, his son, Jason, left, and stepson Sebastien enjoy original Kentucky Fried Chicken at the Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum in Corbin on Saturday . Brian Lufty, 52, one of the fathers who packed the four sons into a van, made the 34-hour round trip mission for his third time to visit the Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum in Corbin. His tales of earlier visits to the KFC inspired the most recent trip. The group left from Montreal on Thursday and arrived at the restaurant on Saturday afternoon. 'Neil and I have been friends for 35 years, and doing ongoing, crazy things have been special for us. But to bring our sons here with us makes it even more fun,' Lufty told the Times Tribune. 'We do practical jokes with our kids. We've done skits that we taped along the way. It's been a crazy road trip. It's been at the top of our bucket list.' He continued: 'I did that first trip 30 years ago, and the second one 20 years ago. Now it's come full circle. We did fun things with our kids. The important thing about this trip is this — don't be afraid to have fun.' While there are KFC restaurants in the Montreal metropolitan area, known as Poulet Frit Kentucky, Lufty's son Jason suggested going on a father-son trip to Corbin to visit the KFC. This was after hearing his father's stories about his previous road trips there. On Saturday morning, Lufty, his sons Jason and Sebastien,  his friend Neil Janna, 51, and his two sons Jesse and Josh, made a stop to visit Colonel Sanders birth place in Henryville, Indiana. Traveling 2,090 miles, crossing over five U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, the group of six spent five days away from home while on the special trip. In total it took three days to drive from Montreal to Kentucky (a map of their journey above) They then traveled to his burial place and Yum! Brand's headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky. That afternoon, they arrived at Sanders Cafe in their blue van featuring a bucket of Colonel's chicken on the roof while wearing their special-made shirts to commemorate the trip. The Canadians were met by the cafe's general manager Dennis Overbey who told them he couldn't recall during his 40 years working there of anyone traveling as far as 2,090 miles to eat at the restaurant. After they ordered their meal of two platters of KFC's original recipe and extra crispy, they sat down at a table pulling out the items they brought to make the meal a feast: plates, silverware, candles, artificial flowers and glasses. Janna's son, Jesse, who enjoyed the fried chicken for the first time said it was 'delicious.' 'It was a great trip. It was funny most of the time, and we anticipated coming here to eat,' Sebastien told the Times Tribune. 'We stopped at several places, and people participated in our shenanigans, like small skits we did our Facebook page for all our friends and family to see.' Jason said: 'I think it's crazy to do this trip, going all the way down from Canada to Corbin. And what a trip it was. It's my first time to have Kentucky Fried Chicken. I'd like to start this with my kids. It's going to be a tradition.'

"Mother charged: Tyecka Evans, 28, has been charged with manslaughter in the death of her 3-month-old baby, which occurred while she was out clubbing with her sister . A 28-year-old Florida woman has been charged in the death of her 3-month-old daughter who was left home alone while the mother was out dancing last week. Tyecka Shanta Evans, a mother of two from Ocala, was taken into custody Tuesday after her youngest child, 3-month-old Taliya Richardson, was discovered unresponsive at home last Thursday. Evans initially told police she had dozed off and woke up in the living room to find that her daughter had crawled over a pillow on the floor and had a plastic shopping bag over her head. But Evans later changed her story and admitted that she had left her two children, ages 9 and three months, and her 1-year-old nephew home alone at 1am to go to a club with her sister and the woman's boyfriend. When she returned home to the Parkside Garden Apartments on Northwest Second Street from her outing at around 2.40am, Taliya was found unresponsive. Surveillance video from the housing complex shows Tyecka Evans arriving home by car at 2.36am and running into her apartment, reported Fox 35. Moments later, she reemerges and waves at her sister downstairs, signalling for to come up. Evans' young daughter was rushed to Munroe Regional Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead less than 30 minutes later. Home alone: After initially telling police that she was sleeping at home when her child stopped breathing, Evans later admitted that she went out for nearly two hours and found her daughter unresponsive upon her return to Parkside Garden Apartments in Ocala, Florida . Toyana Evans (left), Tyecka's sister, could face charges for lying to police. Both women have criminal records and have been arrested multiple times . Hospital staff said the 28-year-old mom was crying and appeared distraught, reported the Ocala Star Banner. During questioning, she told detectives she did not want to go to the club Thursday night, but her sister kept insisting and eventually she decided to join her. Evans now faces manslaughter charges. She was released from jail Tuesday night after posting $30,000 bail. Toyana Evans, Tyecka's sister, also could face charges for allegedly lying to police, according to the station WESH. Online records indicate that Tyecka Evans has a lengthy criminal record, which includes at least 10 arrests since 2009 on various charges ranging from traffic violations to grant theft and uttering forged bills.","Tyecka Evans, 28, charged with manslaughter in death of 3-month-old Taliya Richardson .

"There are up to one million free-roaming dogs on Romania's streets who are being hunted down by 'dog catchers' and stuck in squalid state-run pounds where 'they are waiting to die'. The 'euthanasia' of strays was legalised by the Romanian parliament in September 2013 to help reduce a massive overpopulation. But a group of former models called the K-9 Angels have rescued hundreds of  dogs from the streets where they would be savagely killed - and re-homed at least 700 in the UK. The Angels claim government funds for programmes aimed at neutering the animals were never implemented and the animals were dealt with in the 'most cruel way'. Pola Pospieszalska, Anneka Svenska and former Playboy model Victoria Eisermann are devoted to saving the mistreated dogs - and finding them loving homes. Scroll down for videos . The K-9 Angels charity fronted by singer Pola Pospieszalska (left), TV wildlife presenter Anneka Svenska (right) and former Playboy model Victoria Eisermann (centre) is devoted to saving the mistreated dogs . Rescue: The K-9 Angels (Pola pictured) have rescued hundreds of stray dogs from being killed in Romania and re-homed them in the UK . Second chance: Pola, Anneka and Victoria (pictured) have re-homed at least 700 dogs in the UK and spayed over 2,500 dogs . Overpopulation: Charities estimate there are between 500,000 and one million free-roaming dogs on Romania's streets . Cruelty: Pola described to MailOnline how 'tens of thousands of animals have been caught by dogcatchers (pictured) and killed in most horrific ways' Inhumane: The dogs are supposed to be euthanised humanely with a legal injection but in reality they can be clubbed to death, set on fire and left for dead . Abandoned: Charities have told MailOnline that state-appointed 'dog catchers' are rounding up dogs and taking them to holding pens where they are 'waiting to die' Attack: Pola from K-9 Angels (pictured) she says the 'killing law' was passed following an 'isolated incident' in 2013, when a four-year-old boy was mauled to death by a pack of 'vicious stray dogs' Brutal: The Angels claim government funds for programmes which were designed to neuter dogs were never implemented and the animals were dealt with in the 'most cruel way' They say the state-appointed catchers round up dogs and take them to holding pens where they can be 'clubbed to death' and set on fire. Pola told MailOnline: 'Romania's stray dog situation is probably one of the worst in Europe and sad, neglected, hungry animals are a part of Romanian landscape. She says the 'killing law' was passed following an 'isolated incident' in 2013, when a four-year-old boy was mauled to death by a pack of 'vicious stray dogs'. Adding: 'Tens of thousands of animals have been caught by dogcatchers and killed in most horrific ways. 'It is common in Romania for them not to use a euthanasia injection, but instead dispose of dogs in cheaper ways such as injecting paint thinner into the heart, strangling, clubbing to death.' The founders of K-9 Angels describe the pounds as 'filthy, dirty, short on food'  and in truth - just a place to dump these dogs so they die away from the public'. Here, the dogs suffer from mange - a skin disease caused by parasitic mites - and fights between them erupt regularly. Despite the harsh conditions they are subjected to, the animals who are lucky enough to be alive still vie for the Angels' affection when they are eventually rescued. Animal charity Four Paws - which has helped neuter around 150,000 stray dogs - says the situation for dogs became much worse when the killing law was introduced. Its spokesperson Adam Rahman told MailOnline: 'Dogs are brutally rounded up by dog catchers and taken to pounds where they are subjected to poor conditions and cruel treatment, and are essentially waiting to be killed. 'The organisation responsible for catching the dogs estimated that they had captured around 25,000 stray dogs in Bucharest alone since the legislation was passed, and overseen the killing of around 16,000.' The organisation successfully convinced the Bucharest Court of Appeal to suspend the legislation last summer, but they say the brutal situation on the streets remains the same. Killing: The Romanian government implemented the culling programme to stem the overpopulation of stray dogs but a WHO report says killing the animals will not solve the problem . Humane: Victoria (pictured) and the K-9 Angels have so far re-home at least 700 dogs in the UK and spayed thousands more . Change: Their Kent-based charity's website is full of pictures of once-doomed dogs who have found happy homes in the UK . Inspiration: The Angels were formed when Anneka (left) saw of a picture of a desperate Romanian stray on Facebook and decided to do help with her friends Pola and Victoria (right) Found: Like the Angels, charity League of Rescue has also rescued hundreds of stray dogs like Tommy (pictured) from Romania's streets . Happy home: Tommy - who was found malnourished in the back of a rundown car - is now living comfortably in the UK . Desperate: They also found Mabel (pictured) at a train station in an appalling condition and a severe wound on her left paw . Happy ending: Mabel - whose leg was crushed - is one of the lucky ones to be rescued but 16,000 dogs have been culled since it was legalised at the end of 2013 . Inspired: The K-9 Angels were forged when TV wildlife presenter Anneka saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of Romania on Facebook . Earlier this month, the charity found evidence of a massive and illegal cull of stray dogs in the small southern town of Clinceni. They discovered dozens of dead dogs with visible wounds on their heads and bodies left to rot in black bags in the forest. 'This is another serious violation of the law on stray animals and proof that, although the killing law has been repealed since June 20, 2014,' Four Paws said. The cull is supposed to reduce the overpopulation of stray dogs in the country but a World Health Organisation report claimed: 'In none of the study areas did the elimination of dogs by any method (catching, shooting or other) have any significant long-term effect on dog population size.' The K-9 Angels were forged when TV wildlife presenter Anneka saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of Romania on Facebook. It was the plight of that dog - named Angel - that inspired the trio to officially form the organisation in November 2011. Their petition to calling on the European Union to investigate the 'disappearance' of the public funds designated for a neutering programme has gained over 28,000 signatures. Gruesome: Charity Four Paws discovered dozens of dogs with severe wounds to their head and bodies in the a southern Romanian town . Grotesque: While another charity Dog Rescue Romani claim to see piles of dead dogs left on village roads . A rescue worker with Dog Rescue Romani said they regularly see piles of dead dogs left in the middle of village roads when they patrol the south-west of Romania. Its spokesperson Marius Costache told MailOnline: 'The scenes are such that alive dogs and some puppies were eating from the other dead dogs within the pile. 'We asked someone who said they saw a large truck passing by at 3.30am that night who dumped the pile and left. 'We called our local police right at that moment and the answer was 'so what do you want us to do?' 'With the euthanasia law or without, it the slaughter in Romania public shelters or streets will continue.' Between March and May 2014, a team of investigators from Four Paws investigated 43 public shelters in Romania – from around 81 currently registered with the Romanian vet authorities. The results of the investigation were shocking  as they found that not one of these public shelters in Romania conformed to the law regulating the national programme on stray dogs.","Euthanasia programme legalised in 2013 to quell overpopulation of strays .

"Scientists claim the computer keyboard could be a powerful new tool in their battle against Parkinson's disease. Researchers in Massachusetts believe a person's keystrokes may reveal a huge amount of information about their motor skills. Now they're working on creating a keyboard that can tell doctors if someone has the neuron impairment, simply by analysing the way they type. Scroll down for video . Scientists claim the common computer keyboard could be a powerful new tool in their battle against Parkinson's disease. Researchers in Massachusetts say a person's keystrokes may reveal a huge amount of information about their motor skills . For the body to begin moving, the brain's primary motor cortex sends signals through several other brain regions, including the supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. These brain areas activate spinal neurons that stimulate muscles to execute the movement. But many factors can interfere with motor ability, including sleep deprivation, which reduces dexterity. In people with Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra are killed off, leading to tremors, slowness of movement, and difficulty walking . Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have now created an algorithm that can tell how effectively someone is striking a keypad. For instance, it can distinguish between typing done in the middle of the night, when sleep deprivation impairs motor skills, and typing performed when fully rested. It does this by analysing something known as 'key hold time' - a measure of how long a key is pressed before being released. The study is based on the premise that 'there might be hidden information in the way that we type,' says Ian Butterworth, one of researchers. 'At the moment, pretty much all of the other information in typing is thrown out. We just pay attention to what keys are being pressed, not when or for how long.' Scientists have developed a six-minute test which could give an early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Currently Parkinson's patients only discover they have the debilitating neurological problem when the symptoms have already taken hold. But last year Oxford University academics have come up with a new way of spotting the disease at an early stage. The researchers were able to detect early Parkinson's disease with a remarkable 85 per cent accuracy. The technique uses an MRI scanner to monitor the neural connections in a concentrated area at the very centre of the brain. Even at a very early stage, Parkinson's patients had much weaker connections in the basal ganglia region of the brain, which is associated with motor control. The study, which has been published in the journal Neurology, found that by taking 180 pictures in six minutes they could spot the poor connections. They also found that the test had a very low chance of incorrectly diagnosing healthy people with the disease. This study focused on the effects of fatigue, but the researchers say they could diagnose conditions that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's disease, much earlier than is now possible. Preliminary results from a study of about two dozen Parkinson's patients suggest that the researchers' algorithm for analysing keystrokes can also distinguish people who have the disease from those who don't. The team is now planning a larger study of Parkinson's patients. They are also working on smartphone apps that could be used to gather the same kind of data from mobile devices. 'We thought this was a unique opportunity to have a window into the brain using your normal interactions with an electronic device,' says MIT researcher Alvaro Sanchez-Ferro. 'You already have the hardware. You just have to let someone evaluate the information you collect every day when you use the device, and try to pull it out for health-related purposes.' People are usually diagnosed with Parkinson's disease five to 10 years after the beginning of the disease, and lot of the damage has already been done, the researchers say. John Growdon, director of the Memory and Movement Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, says it will be important for the researchers to demonstrate in future studies that the typing deficiencies correlate with the severity of Parkinson's disease. 'Overall, it strikes me that this has great potential to detect subtle motor impairments even in advance of a clinician's ability to find them,' adds Growdon, who was not involved in the study. The researchers believe this strategy could also be used to evaluate patients with other diseases that affect motor skills, such as rheumatoid arthritis. 'This might have applications in any disease producing a motor impairment, whether it's in your hands and muscles or the brain,' Sanchez-Ferro says.

"An outraged food blogger who alleges Instagram fitness star Ashy Bines used her recipes in an e-book without crediting her or asking if she could publish them in a book said she was 'devastated' to find her work had been taken. Sydney personal trainer Allie Dodds, 24, regularly published recipes for her friends and family on her Mealspiration blog before she started her business, Sweets and Sweat, in September 2013. Her gourmet recipes caught the eye of Ms Bines, a Gold Coast businesswoman and successful personal trainer, in 2012. Ms Dodds said Ms Bines contacted her asking if she could share her recipes online with her Facebook fan base and she agreed. 'I thought, that was OK she's going to share a couple of my recipes, give me some credit and that was it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. But she said she was stunned when a colleague noticed her Salmon and Cauliflower Sushi recipe in a 2012 edition of Ms Bines' Clean Eating Recipe Book. Ashy Bines (pictured with a green smoothie) was the subject of appalling abuse after posting a video admitting recipes in her clean eating e-package had been plagiarised. She did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's questions after a blogger came forward suggesting she had also been plagiarised from on Tuesday . Ms Bines is a successful health coach and entrepreneur is best known for her 12 week Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge. Programs such as hers and Bikini Body Guide author Kayla Itsines have become increasingly popular . Personal trainer Allie Dodds (pictured) alleges her sushi and cauliflower recipe and others were placed in Ms Bines' book without permission. She runs the Instagram account The.Sweet.Sweat . 'I said ""can you show me?"" and it was my pictures and my recipe. 'I just couldn't believe it... That's really nasty. 'It was just Ashy's Guidelines and zero mention of my name or my blog and I was just like ""you're kidding me"". 'At first I was a little bit excited and then I was pretty devastated (not to be credited).' Ms Dodds said recipes inside the guide included her Kanga Rolls, Chicken Mince Quiche and others. She contacted Ms Bines in July 2013 to question her use of recipes and photos but never heard back. Ms Bines admitted in a video statement reported overnight that 10 recipes contained within her Clean Eating Diet Plan had been stolen. She said it happened because she 'outsourced' the recipe component to an unnamed nutritionist.' Ms Bines did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's questions over whether she was referring to Ms Dodd's recipes. A spokeswoman said she was 'in meetings all day'. In her video message earlier this week, Ms Bines said: 'By outsourcing this to a nutritionist I was trying to give you all something of value and to come up with delicious recipes from the food I suggested. 'Unfortunately I may have been too naïve to think that I wouldn't have check the origins of each recipe instead trusting that the work would be completed in an honest and professional manner. The 26-year-old (left) has earned an enormous social media, with almost one million followers on social media . Allie's blog: This recipe appeared on Ms Dodds' blog, Mealspiration, in 2012 . Ashy's book: This recipe appeared in an edition of Ashy Bines' Clean Eating Recipe Book . Access to the latest edition of Ms Bines' Clean Eating Diet Plan currently costs $USD75.90 (or around $100AUD) 'It's recently come to my attention that some of these recipes were not originals at all and have been copied from other sources. 'This was never my intention and it really sucks that these things can happen.' Ms Dodds said: 'Ashy's business is meant to be built around encouraging and empowering women however I am disappointed that I never received recognition from her. In text messages to the Gold Coast Bulletin on Monday, Ms Bines - who is pregnant - said she had received sickening online abuse producing the plagiarism video. Examples of the comments included 'I hope (your baby) gets down syndrome, you dirty liar' and 'you are a bitch, I pray a truck runs you over'. Ms Bines expressed disbelief at the comment involving her unborn child. 'To wish a baby gets Down syndrome gosh I actually didn't think you could sink any lower [sic],' she wrote on her social media account in response to the woman's comment. A supporter jumped in to also defend Ms Bines. 'Hate someone so much that you go out of your way to stalk them and wish an intentional disability on someone's baby?' the supporter said. 'When you grow up and mature and someone wishes that your baby is still born because they would hate to see such a tragic soul bring a poor bub into your world, let us know how it feels. 'Given that you think downs [sic] is so bad, it is people like you that the world does not need.' 'This was never my intention and it really sucks that these things can happen' Ms Bines said in a video message about plagiarism in her book.

"Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has announced that he will undergo 'very serious' surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in his abdomen. In an emotional press conference on Thursday, the 45-year-old politician said he met with doctors who told him chemotherapy and radiation have shrunk the tumor to a size where they can operate. Four surgeons will carry out the eight- to ten-hour operation on May 11, and he will remain in hospital for 10 to 14 days, he said. He hopes to return to work in September. 'I'm just lucky to be alive today and I'm just lucky that I'm getting another chance at life,' he said. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Rob Ford announced on Thursday that he will undergo a lengthy operation to remove a cancerous tumor from his abdomen in May. He hopes to return to work as a councilor in September, he said . Ford was diagnosed with malignant liposarcoma - a rare type of soft tissue cancer that begins in fat cells or fatty tissue - last year, forcing him to quit his bid for re-election for mayor. Instead, he ran for his old seat in city council and won. The success came after he acknowledged in 2013 that he had smoked crack cocaine in one of his 'drunken stupors' - but despite the emergence of embarrassing footage of him allegedly taking the drug, he refused to resign and instead completed a stint at rehab. The City Council stripped Ford of most of his powers but lacked the authority to force him out of office because he wasn't convicted of a crime. Ford's antics made him the target of late-night television comedians in the US. Battle: Ford, pictured talking to deputy Mayor Denzil Minnan-Wong last December, has undergone five rounds of chemotherapy and nearly a month of radiation, which has shrunk his tumor significantly . Having a laugh: Toronto's Chief Budget Officer Councillor Frank Di Giorgio is pictured with  Ford during a budget meeting in January 2014 - before the embattled mayor headed to rehab . Last March, he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! after months of wooing by the talk-show host, who introduced his guest by saying he 'has tripped, bumped, danced, argued and smoked his way into our national consciousness.' After his cancer diagnosis, his brother Doug took his place in the mayoral race but he lost out to Mayor John Tory. He underwent 27 days of radiation and five rounds of chemotherapy and the 14cm tumor found in his lower abdomen has now shrunk to a manageable size, 5.6 by 4.3 by 4.6 cm, he said. He said doctors are optimistic but there’s a chance the cancer could come back after surgery. Ford thanked his wife Renata - who was at the press conference - his family and the people of Toronto, as well as his medical staff, for their support.","Ford announced at a press conference on Thursday that he will undergo a 8-10 hour surgery to remove a tumor on May 11 .

"Reality star Joey Essex has claimed to be all at sea when it comes to knowing about politics. So he joined Nigel Farage on a boat trip in Grimsby this morning to try and understand his general election plans. Before boarding the boat, Essex told reporters that the only thing he knew about the party leader was he is a 'really, really reem guy'. Mr Farage quipped: 'I think that's good... I'm not sure.' As the stunt took a bizarre twist, the Ukip leader hailed the TV star as an 'icon of youth'. Scroll down for video . TOWIE star Joey Essex today met Ukip leader Nigel Farage in Grimsby as part of his project to find out about the election . Essex told reporters the Ukip leader is a 'really, really reem guy' before boarding a boat and heading out to sea . Essex is speaking to the leaders of the four major political parties for the first episode of his ITV2 mini-series Educating Joey Essex, to be aired later this month. The TV star told Mr Farage: '‎Basically I don't really understand much about political life and I'm trying to show the youth it's good to vote.' Mr Farage said‎: 'What I'm going to try do is give you my opinions, which you'll either love or hate.' He later told BBC News: 'Over half the young people in Britain don't vote at all. 'If some of the icons of youth like Joey here can actually look at this, spend a bit of time, understand this, and inform an opinion, perhaps you'll get more young people voting.' The Ukip leader chose the nautical setting for his one-on-one with the 24-year-old star of The Only Way Is Essex as they both have fishing connections. Mr Farage is a keen angler and has a monthly column in a sea fishing magazine. Essex, who famously admitted on TV that he cannot tell the time, used to work at Billingsgate fish market. Essex asked:‎ 'Why are we in Grimsby?‎' The Ukip leader said: ‎'It's symbolic of what's gone wrong, if we came here forty years ago there were thousands of men working here and a massive trawler fleet, it was the biggest fishing port in the country. 'We joined the European Union and now have to share all our fish with all the other countries.‎ And what we're saying is let's take our country and our territorial waters back, let's get our fishing industry back.' In response, Essex said: 'Sick.' When Mr Farage added that he wanted a bigger British fishing industry, Essex added: 'Wicked.' Mr Farage said he was visiting Grimsby because he wanted to 'get our fishing industry back' Asked if he was going to explain what a vajazzle is to Mr Farage said: 'It's not my thing. You'd better ask a girl out of Towie for that' Asked if he was going to explain what a vajazzle is to Mr Farage said: 'It's not my thing. You'd better ask a girl out of Towie for that.' Essex talked to Mr Farage about working at Billingsgate fish marker. Asked what I thought of Mr Farage, Essex said: 'He's a really, really reem guy.' Mr Farage said: 'I think that's good, I'm not sure. Reem? Interesting. What does that mean?' Essex explained: 'It means cool, wicked, sick.' Mr Farage recently revealed he has a secret nocturnal passion for fishing alone on the Kent coast. He said: 'One thing I can fit in to my working life is shore fishing because I can do it at night. 'I might have had a busy day in London, but I might nip down to the coast and have three or four hours through to the early hours of the morning fishing.' Mr Farage added that it's his way of staying sane amid the relentless pressures of modern politics and that sleep is a waste of time. Mr Farage is a keen angler and has a monthly column in a sea fishing magazine. He recently revealed he has a secret nocturnal passion for fishing alone on the Kent coast. Essex, who famously admitted on TV that he cannot tell the time, used to work at Billingsgate fish market. Essex found fame on the ITV show The Only Way Is Essex, which was responsible for popularising the 'vajazzle'. The beauty treatment involves women having plastic gem stones being stuck onto the skin near very personal parts of the body. The programme's stars are also well-known for their love of fake tans. Mr Farage said he was looking forward to meeting Essex, but asked if he had ever watched The Only Way Is Essex, he said: 'I have to confess no.' He added that he watched no television programmes. The Ukip leader said he did not know what a vajazzle is, adding: 'No I haven't a clue.' When asked if he had ever had a fake tan, he said: 'Do you know something, it's one of the things I've not got round to.‎' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg posed for a selfie with Essex after explaining to the reality star that his party is not called the 'Liberal Demo-cats' At the weekend Essex attended a Labour party rally at Parr Hall in Warrington, where he met party leader Ed Miliband . Essex asked David Cameron a question via Heat magazine last week and also held a meeting with Ed Miliband. When he joined Nick Clegg on the campaign trail he mistakenly thought he was leader of the 'Liberal Demo-cats'. Mr Clegg also had to explain that he was not called 'Mr Leg'. When Mr Clegg explained that he had been Deputy PM for five years, Essex told him he was 'sick' - slang for good. After being told the Liberal Democrats was 'a long word, innit?', Mr Clegg - who has never watched TOWIE - simply nodded politely. The interview ended with the pair having a selfie together.","Reality TV star is meeting party leaders to try to understand the election .

"A Connecticut teenager with cancer who took her fight to stop her chemotherapy treatments to the state's Supreme Court must remain in custody of the state even though her disease has gone into remission, a judge ruled on Wednesday. Superior Court Judge Carl Taylor in Middletown, Connecticut, denied requests made last month by attorneys for both Cassandra and her mother, Jackie Fortin, that the 17-year-old be released from the temporary custody of the state Department of Children and Families, or that her mother be permitted to visit her in the hospital. The judge ruled on Wednesday she must remain in DCF custody until completing court-ordered chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. Scroll down for video... Going nowhere: Cassandra Fortin was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to undergo cancer treatment . Picture of health: Cassandra has been at Children's Medical Center in Hartford since December receiving chemo to which she was originally opposed . In state care: The Department of Children and Families took temporary custody after Cassandra refused her chemotherapy treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma . The state agency last fall won temporary custody of Cassandra after she and her mother argued she did not want chemo treatments despite the risk of dying without them. The state Supreme Court then ruled against Cassandra's claim that she was mature enough to make her own medical decisions. Treatments were ordered for at least six months after doctors said the teen had an 85 percent chance of survival with chemotherapy, but faced a near certainty of death within two years without it. But after she was declared by doctors to be in remission in March, her lawyer Joshua Michtom and attorneys for her mother appealed at a closed-door court hearing seeking permission to allow her to go home to complete treatments, or at least to permit her mother to visit her in the hospital. Staying put: Ms Fortin, left, said the hospital tried to prevent her mother, Jackie, right, from visiting her room . Support: Mrs Fortin, pictured, said she was behind her daughter's decision to not undergo cancer treatment. Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells . Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever). It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. 'She hasn't been able to see her mother for months, and now that she's in remission we don't think that's in her best interests,' said Attorney James Sexton, representing Fortin. DCF Commissioner Joette Katz said in a statement Wednesday her agency is 'looking forward to the day later this month when Cassandra can happily return home after her treatment is completed and the doctors are confident that she has beaten the cancer.' The case drew national attention when the teen rejected chemotherapy treatments after being diagnosed in September. Both the teen and her mother said she didn't want to poison her body, and she ran away after two chemo treatments. Michael Taylor, an attorney for the teen's mother, Jackie Fortin, said if the judge will not lift the temporary custody order, they would like for the teen at least to be able to visit with her mother at the hospital. Ms Fortinh said DCF has prohibited her from having contact with her mother. 'We'd like to end the whole thing,' Taylor said, according to The Hartford Courant, during a break in the hearing, 'but if we can't, we want to do as much as we can for her. She wants to be with her mother.' After Ms Fortin was diagnosed with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma in September, she and her mother missed several appointments, prompting doctors to notify the DCF, court documents say. A trial court in November granted DCF temporary custody of Ms Fortin. Lawyers for Cassandra and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but failed. The case went to the state Supreme Court, which ruled in January that the state wasn't violating Ms Fortin's rights by forcing her to undergo chemotherapy. The case centered on the mature minor doctrine recognised by several other states — whether 16- and 17-year-olds are mature enough to make their own medical decisions. Ms Fortin told People.com that she did not want to undergo chemotherapy and that when she was taken into care the state tried to prevent her mother from paying a visit. She said the hospital even posted a guard outside her door because they feared that she would try to escape. On the day before her chemotherapy, hospital staff were forced to restrain her before they could administer an anaesthetic. A judge has ruled against the 17-year-old girl who originally refused chemotherapy, and she will have to finish her treatments at the hospital instead of going home . She said: 'When a nurse came in and I told myself just to fight. When she started to put an IV in me, I wouldn't let her.' Ms Fortin spent two hours arguing with a doctor trying to convince them to suspend her treatment. 'Security had to pick me up, pin me to the bed and strap me down by my wrists and ankles, When I woke up, I looked down and there was a port in my chest. I thought, 'I cannot believe they did this to me.' 'I felt violated. I felt like I was being treated like an animal. I thought, 'How can you force a person, regardless of how old they are, to do something they haven't given consent to?''' In a statement Connecticut's DCF said:  'When experts -- such as the several physicians involved in this case -- tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent, then the Department has a responsibility to take action. Even if the decision might result in criticism, we have an obligation to protect the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts that action is required. 'Much of the improvements in Connecticut's child welfare system have come from working with families voluntarily to realise solutions to family challenges. 'Unfortunately that can't happen in every situation, especially when the life of a child is at stake.'

"Incredible pictures have shown the moment ferocious red sandstorms currently engulfing China devoured a city in the country's north west. China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance after the fourth massive sandstorm struck the north-west of the country this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to The People's Daily Online. The raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) has now issued a blue alert for the latest sandstorms to hit the northern regions. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi, in what was the fourth sandstorm to hit the area this year. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. Police spokesman Hui Chuang said: 'The storm forced most people to stay indoors because it was difficult to drive anyway given the low visibility and also hard to breathe without inhaling sand. 'It also forced the closure of the nearby Mogao Grottoes.' The site is a UNESCO world heritage tourist site renowned for its massive sculptures and frescoes carved in caves along a cliff.

She writes that she hopes the letter can create 'a ripple effect and spread some compassion and understanding,' among those who have such responsibilities. She signs off by saying: 'You're making a massive difference and you're the reason I can smile tonight. 'Take care and spread love.' The photo currently has over 3,700 shares and has been favourited almost 3,000 times. Mr Dillon did take to Twitter to say that he was not able to reveal the airline or flight number due to security reasons. The role of the pilot was praised by many on Twitter following the letter being posted . Cheshire-based Mr Dillon said he happy to share the 'positive message,' according to the Evening Standard. Investigations are continuing in the events of that fateful day last week over the French Alps. German prosecutors said Andreas Lubitz, 27, who they believe deliberately caused the crash, had therapy for suicidal tendencies some time before getting his pilot's licence. The sharing of the letter led to thousands of shares and 'favourites' on Twitter . And he was being treated by a psychotherapist, Dusseldorf prosecutor's office spokesman Christoph Kumpa said. Cockpit voice recorder evidence has indicated that Lubitz deliberately put the Airbus A320 into a descent after locking out the captain. All 150 people on board, including three Britons, were killed in the crash last Tuesday.","'Bethanie's' heartfelt message to airline and pilots shared on Twitter .

"A run-down car park has been bought for £3million by the National Trust - because it offers one of Britain's most spectacular views. The tatty tarmac site overlooks the golden sands at Rhossili in South Wales, voted the UK's number one beach, the third best in Europe, and 9th best in the world by TripAdvisor. Visitors to the tip of the Gower peninsula can see the coastline stretch on for miles, surrounded by the rolling Welsh hills in the picture-perfect vista.

"A jet-setting owl has posted photos from its travels on Facebook after it was 'kidnapped' from a Nottinghamshire pub. Landlord Richard Stevenson, 32, had mascot Ollie the Owl snatched from the lounge area of the Admiral Rodney, in Nottingham, last month. He thought the £7.99 ornament had been lost forever until he received a letter in the post on March 6 demanding a donation to charity for its safe return. Those responsible for the theft even created a Facebook page to keep fans updated about Ollie's adventures since being snatched. The owl has been pictured sunning itself on a beach after it was 'kidnapped' from a Nottingham pub . The wooden ornament even took a trip on the back of a camel on its travels . Incredibly, the wooden statue has already jetted off to Belfast, Benidorm and even Tunisia despite only going missing a month ago. Pictures posted on the 'Oliver Howel' Facebook page show Ollie sunbathing on a beach towel with an iPod and even taking a ride on the back of a camel. He can also be seen perched on a wall overlooking a beach in Benidorm and is seen sitting on a bar next to pint of Guinness in Belfast. After boarding a plane from the Spanish holiday resort, Ollie teased his owners with a status update saying: 'Hi I'm off again another plane journey.. This one is going to be hot, keep checking in to see where I am.' Today, landlord Richard, who runs the pub with partner Christy Jamieson, 28, said: 'We are missing Ollie but it's been amazing where he's been. The £7.99 model perches on a stone rail high above a beach in Benidorm . The journey began in Nottingham, pictured here at the National Ice Centre in the city . 'He's had three holidays already and he's only been gone for a month. 'I did have a few clues to who had taken him but they found out and apparently passed Ollie on to someone else. 'We also received a card from a child though the post with a donation of £1 which has gone to the air ambulance.' Pub regular John Wiles, 45, added: 'I can't believe he has got as far as Tunisia. He will need his wings clipping.' The wooden statue is enjoying some sunnier climes than the usual shelf in Nottingham . The owl has had three holidays in less than a month since he was stolen from a pub shelf . Ollie's kidnappers have also taken the owl to more local locations with pictures of him joining a stag party in a city centre bar and visiting Nottingham Castle. He also posted a picture to his 138 Facebook friends perched on the city's famous Robin Hood statue as well as another image showing him at an ice hockey game. The bird has also popped in to Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem - reputed to be the oldest pub in England. Landlord Richard Stevenson and landlady Christy Jamieson of the Admiral Rodney in Nottingham with ransom letters sent to the pub  following the 'kidnapping' of their owl ornament . It's thirsty work for the owl as it continues to travel around the world; pictured here at a Belfast bar . The owl has managed to take in some sights of Belfast, visiting the historic places in the Northern Irish capital . Landlord Richard bought Ollie from homeware store The Range 18 months ago when the couple took over the pub. The three-inch ornament is part of a set of three that had sat on a shelf in the pub lounge. In the ransom letter posted to the pub shortly after Ollie went missing, the kidnappers said the bird will be back in time for a charity festival on the August Bank Holiday weekend. The jovial note, which arrived in a brown envelope with a Nottingham postal stamp, stated: 'I have been taken against my will...kidnapped. The visit to Belfast also brings the opportunity for the owl to read up some history of the city . The owl took the opportunity of freedom to pose for a photo with Nottingham's most famous resident - Robin Hood . 'I was frightened at first but I really like the people who have taken me from your top shelf. 'I am going to be away for a while, and I am going to travel to lots of different places in England and abroad. 'I've been sitting on your shelf for too long... so I am going to find a girlfriend.' The owl could escape the queues for the Belfast boat tours by flying in, surely... Richard, who lives above the pub, added: 'It's a little bit crazy and just a bit weird how it all came about. 'I absolutely wet myself laughing, especially when I got a friend request on Facebook. 'We've seen a picture of a pink owl, which must be his new girlfriend. I suppose I'm a bit jealous of his travelling, and the regulars think it's hilarious.' Hopefully nobody will mistake the now-famous ornament for recyclable goods...","Ollie the Owl was stolen from lounge area of the Admiral Rodney pub .

"Ethel Rider, who has severe dementia, fell from her bed at the Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe, when she was being turned to prevent bed sores . Two care home workers who left a mute dementia patient in agony after she fell on the floor, then lied about what had happened, have been jailed. Ethel Rider, 87, suffered a broken pelvis and was left ‘cowering’ in pain after falling from her bed. But even though the grandmother was in agony, her carers failed to seek medical help and simply lifted her back into bed. Because she is mute, Mrs Rider was unable to tell anyone what had happened. It was only 24 hours later that a nurse realised she was in agonising pain and called an ambulance. The injury occurred because one of her carers, Susan Logan, had tried to turn her by herself – against the proper procedure at the private home. But when asked what had happened, Logan and her supervisor, Lauren Gillies, lied, saying Mrs Rider had fallen out of bed. Yesterday both were beginning six-month prison sentences after a judge branded them ‘idle’, saying they had cut corners to give themselves longer breaks. Afterwards the pensioner’s family slammed the carers’ ‘disgusting’ betrayal and said they were pleased both had been jailed. The Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign has repeatedly highlighted examples of poor care in residential homes and on NHS wards. Mrs Rider, a retired factory worker, moved into the Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe, near Manchester, where staff working in pairs were meant to turn her in bed every two hours. But on May 19 last year, Logan, 59, was trying to turn Mrs Rider by herself when the pensioner fell out of bed. Bolton Crown Court heard how it may have been some time before the emergency alarm was called and Gillies, 25, arrived to find the grandmother in pain and on the floor. ‘She was left on the floor for 40 minutes,’ said Jonathan Turner, prosecuting. ‘She was then hoisted back into the bed. No ambulance was called and the story was devised between the two of them.’ The court heard how Mrs Rider, who now has the mental capacity of a baby, is mute and would have been unable to convey the pain of being hoisted back into bed with a broken pelvis. Care workers Lauren Gillies, 25 (left) and Susan Logan, 59, (right) have been jailed for six months each . Logan, of Radcliffe, and Gillies, of Ramsbottom, admitted wilful neglect. Judge Timothy Stead told them: ‘What you did between the two of you was outrageous. Your decisions have been described as stupid, but I would use a stronger word. They were criminally wrong.’ Mrs Rider’s daughter Julie Murphy, 52, from Radcliffe, said: ‘I am satisfied they have been jailed. What they did is disgusting.’ Four Seasons Health Care, which runs the home, said: ‘We are very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family as a result of the actions of the carers.’ A spokesman for the care home said they were 'very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family'","Ethel Rider, 87, dropped from her bed at Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe .

"A five-year-old girl had to have her skull removed, smashed into pieces and put back together like a jigsaw puzzle after doctors discovered it was too small for her growing brain. Her mother Stacey Ciach, from Geelong in Victoria, had always wondered about the slightly narrow shape of daughter Ava's head. But it wasn't until she took Ava to a new doctor for a check-up that it was discovered two plates at the front of her skull had fused together prematurely - a rare condition known as Sagittal Synostosis - restricting the growth of her brain. Scroll down for video . Five-year-old Ava Ciach, from Geelong in Victoria, suffered from Sagittal Synostosis - meaning the two plates at the front of her skull had fused together prematurely restricting the growth of her brain . Ava, now six, had to undergo complex surgery in which she had her skull removed, smashed into pieces and put back together like a jigsaw puzzle . 'It was just a miracle that this particular doctor thought ""I've got a few concerns about her head circumference"",' Ms Ciach told Daily Mail Australia. 'She wasn't abnormal, you wouldn't look at her on street and think there's something wrong with her. 'But he was really thorough and said he was going to do a full once over.' A CT scan proved Ava had the condition – usually discovered when a child is between 10 months and two years old – meaning she had to undergo a raft of medical examinations. 'From the moment it was confirmed it was just test upon test upon test,' Ms Ciach said. 'The waiting was just the worst – is this result going to be good or bad? Most were not positive but that's just what we had to deal with.' Ava's skull post surgery after it was 'smashed' and put back together again . In September last year Ava underwent the operation, which involved making an incision from ear to ear and removing her whole skull . Ava was then taken to a combined clinic at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne with reconstructive plastic surgeon Jonathan Burge and 14 other neurosurgeons and other specialists to decide the course of action. They booked her in for surgery four days later. 'They just said ""She needs this surgery now"",' Ms Ciach said. In September last year Ava underwent the operation, which involved making an incision from ear to ear and removing her whole skull. 'It pretty much shattered, it was like a big puzzle,' Ms Ciach said. 'They removed her whole skull and just rebuilt it from a mixture of screws, plates and fragments of her own bone.' The complex operation took nine hours, and Ava was in a lot of pain in the days that followed. 'She had tubes coming out her neck and had a huge amount of morphine, she was just out of it for days,' Ms Ciach said. Ava is pictured, six months after surgery, with her reconstructive plastic surgeon Dr Jonathan Bruge . 'It was horrible - you never want anyone else to go through it and see their child like that. 'It was difficult to watch but we knew she was in the best care. 'Jonathan Burge does great work at the Royal Children's Hospital; it's just an amazing, incredible place.' Ava was released from hospital and Ms Ciach said she was amazed by her daughter's resilience. 'The recovery was pretty bad pain wise, her skull and skin were healing and it was pretty bad but she just dealt with it,' she said. 'She's such a strong, tough girl and she took it in her stride.' Seven months after her surgery Ava, now six, is 'a completely different child'. Seven months after her surgery Ava, now six, has started school and is 'a completely different child' 'Now she's just got more energy, she's full of life and full of spark and so chatty,' Ms Ciach said. 'She would get quite tired but all my kids have been good sleepers, we just thought that must be her. 'She's not the fatigued child she once was.' Ava, who loves dancing and is obsessed with cooking shows on TV, has also started her first year at school. 'She loves academic stuff and creative things so it's good,' Ms Ciach said.

"An archive of images showing the evolution of the Easter Egg over the past 40 years has been released in time for this year's celebrations. Archivists at confectionery giant Nestle have assembled the compendium of photographs dating back as far as the 1970s to highlight how the traditional chocolate treats have changed over the years. And the images are bound to jog a few childhood memories of the vast array of Easter eggs that the famed sweet makers have produced in the past. Scroll down for video . Who knew? Chewy sweets, Tooty Frooties, used to release Easter Eggs. This advert dates back to 1972 . A dose of nostalgia: From the Smarties Easter Egg (pictured left), to a selection of funky Easter Eggs (pictured right), both 1970 . The collection includes eggs by much-loved brands like Caramac, Yorkie, Rolo, Toffee Crisp, Aero and even Polo. The tradition of Easter eggs can be traced back to the years following the First World War when the egg was adopted as a symbol of new life and hope. Prior to that chocolatiers had made chocolate fish, chickens and shoes at Easter because these were accepted symbols of the celebrations. Matchmakers look very different today! Now mostly associated with mint, back in 1991, a Matchmakers Easter Egg is retailed with 'Orange Chocolate Sticks' Very different from it's distinctive bold style today, a poster advertises Yorkie Easter in 1980.The Easter Egg can be traced back to WWI when eggs symbolised new life and hope . The new egg-shaped treats soared in popularity throughout the 1920s and 1930s but production stopped in the 1940s due to World War Two rationing. Shortages of key ingredients like sugar carried on until the early 1950s until British firm Rowntrees, now owned by Nestle, released their Dairy Egg in 1954. Since then chocolate Easter eggs have been a staple in households across the country. Alex Hutchinson, historian and archivist at Nestle, said: 'Prior to First World War people would celebrate Easter with chocolate fish and chickens which were symbols of the Christian story of Easter. Egg-cellent! Smarties Eggheads (pictured left) and Rowntree's Minty Eggs (pictured right) in 1991 show very different flavours to what is widely-known now. Rowntree's are characterised by their chewy Fruit Pastels . A Kit-Kat Easter egg poster from 1991 shows that the packaging hasn't changed dramatically to today, and has also maintained it's famous 'Have a Break!' tagline . Yorkie's Easter Egg poster from 1991, also shows that the chocolate has maintained its bold yellow and blue branding . 'We also made chocolate shoes, which were pagan symbols of a tradition in the north of England whereby people would buy new shoes and bonnets to wear to church at Easter. 'After the First World War we reintroduced the Easter egg in 1922. The eggs symbolised the spring, new life and hope. 'Easter eggs became hugely popular and the rest is history. 'We put together this archive of photos as a little Easter treat for fans of Easter eggs. 'Our archives go all the way back to the very beginning of the chocolate Easter egg but this selection of images focuses on the 70s, 80s and 90s because the designs and packaging are much cooler. 'A little bit of nostalgia is great fun, and there's bound to be a few eggs in there that people remember from their childhoods.' Retro egg!

"The son of the Canadian Consul General in Miami is behind bars after a gunfight erupted on Monday, and her other son is dead. Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, has been arrested for felony murder and his brother Jean, 17, was shot dead after an incident in which the two reportedly tried to rob a group of Miami drug dealers. Their mother is Roxanne Dubé, who was only recently appointed to the role of consul general in Miami. Scroll down for video . Jean Wabafiyebazu (left) was killed and his brother Marc (right) has been arrested after a gunfight erupted during a drug deal on Monday . Their mother is Roxanne Dubé (above), the recently appointed Canadian Consul General in Miami . According to the Miami Herald, police believe the two young men were armed with guns as they tried to rob a group of men during a drug deal at a home in the Coral Way area. The boys had reportedly agreed to purchase two pounds of marijuana at a cost of $5,000, and driven to the house under the guise of making said purchase in their mother's BMW with diplomatic plates. Police claim that their plan was to then rob the drug dealers. Gunfire broke out soon after they entered, and Jean and Joshua Wright were killed, while Anthony Rodriguez was wounded. Marc was in the car when this incident occurred. Both Marc and Rodriguez were arrested under a Florida law that says anyone who participates in a violent felony that results in death can be charged with murder. Rodriguez has also been charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell. A second man was reportedly with Jean when he went to rob the drug dealers, though his identity is not known at this time. Anthony Rodriguez (above) was arrested on charges of felony murder and drug possession . The boys had driven to a house (above) with a third friend to reportedly purchase two pounds of marijuana for $5,000 . Gunfire erupted soon after they entered, though Marc was in the car at the time . Dubé was appointed to her new position in November, but only arrived in Miami in February. The boys’ father, Germano Wabafiyebazu, told Global News that he does not think Marc had anything to do with this tragedy, and that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He also said the boys kept to themselves, and did not have much of a social life. 'My wife told me they didn’t go out,' he said. 'They went to school, went home, went to school.' Police are still trying to figure out how and where the young men got their weapons.","Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, has been arrested for felony murder and his brother Jean, 17, was shot dead on Monday .

"The sequel to the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series has been shrouded in such secrecy the novel is being written on computers with no internet connection to avoid any leaks. The Girl In The Spider's Web, published worldwide on August 27, will be the fourth installment in the best-selling Millennium crime trilogy by Swedish author Stieg Larsson. The book was completed in November by David Lagercrantz based on a plot outline left by Larsson before he died of a heart attack in 2004 aged 50. Mr Lagercrantz, known for co-authoring Swedish football star Zlatan Ibrahimovic's autobiography, said the publishers have gone to extreme lengths to keep the novel under wraps. However, Norstedts did yesterday reveal that it kicks off with an artificial intelligence intrigue involving a U.S. spy agency. Under wraps: The sequel to the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series by Steig Larsson (left) entitled The Girl In The Spider's Web (right) has been shrouded in such secrecy it is being written on computers with no internet . The 500-page sequel takes up the story of tattooed computer hacker Lisbeth Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist, whom she helps solve a murder mystery  in the first book in the series. Mr Lagercrantz said he, the editors and translators were subject to similar kinds of espionage-style secrecy, reportedly working on computers disconnected from the Internet to avoid leaks. He told the Dagens Nyheter daily: 'If you write about Lisbeth Salander its easy to get a little paranoid. 'You realise what opportunities there are to hack computers. 'It was a little awkward. 'Every time I needed to Google I had to do it on another computer. And we used code words - like our own little spy world.' Its British publisher, MacLehose Press, which has unveiled the front cover showing Salander with her dragon tattoo and wearing punk trousers, said they have given strict instructions to follow suit. Taking up the mantle: The book was completed in November by David Lagercrantz (above) based on a plot outline left by Larsson before he died of a heart attack in 2004 aged 50 . Christopher MacLehose told The Guardian: 'The Swedish original publishers Norstedts have put everyone on notice that no particle of this book can be shared with anybody. 'There'll be no review copies in any language before it's launched on 27 August... nobody will be in a position to beat the ring of steel around this book.' The novel is called Det som inte dödar oss in the original Swedish - or What Doesn’t Kill You - but given a different title for the English version. It is being translated into 38 languages. Setting the scene, Norstedts publishing house wrote on its website: 'One night professor Frans Balder, a leading authority within AI (artificial intelligence) research, calls up Blomkvist. 'Balder says he has world-shattering information on U.S. intelligence services... had contact with a female super hacker, who bears a certain resemblance to a person Blomkvist knows well.' Saddened: Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have been 'furious' about the release of The Girl In The Spider's Web, the fourth book in the Millennium series which began with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo . Until now the publishers had remained tight-lipped about the plot, only saying that it would continue the story of the trilogy's heroine, which has sold more than 75 million copies worldwide. The book has been given the blessing of Mr Larsson's estate, but not from his long-term partner. Eva Gabrielsson said last month that the journalist, who co-founded the anti-racism magazine Expo in Sweden, 'would be furious' if he knew someone else was writing his story. Gabrielsson, who lost a bitter battle with the late author's family to manage his work, added that Lagercrantz was 'a totally idiotic choice' as he lacked Larsson's left-wing activist background. Norstedts have compared the planned release on August 27 of the book in at least 35 countries to the global splash made by Dan Brown's sequels to the 2003 'Da Vinci Code'. At the time of his death, Larsson reportedly had plans to write at least another seven novels.","The Girl In The Spider's Web is fourth installment in Stieg Larsson's series .

"Curiosity Rover has discovered strange, multi-coloured veins on Mars that could give astronomers new insights into the red planet's watery past. The mineral veins were found at a site called 'Garden City' on the slopes of Mount Sharp and stick up from the rock by up to 6cm (2.5 inches). Scientists believe the bizarre network of ridges formed in Mars' wet past billions of years ago above the now eroded, much softer bedrock. This March 18,  view from the Mast Camera on the Curiosity rover shows a network of two-tone mineral veins. Scientists believe the bizarre formed in Mars' wet past billions of years ago above the now eroded bedrock . The ridges contain both bright and dark material. While Curiosity has found brightly coloured veins before, the darker ones remain have stumped scientists. 'Some of them look like ice-cream sandwiches: dark on both edges and white in the middle,' said Linda Kah, a Curiosity science-team member at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 'These materials tell us about secondary fluids that were transported through the region after the host rock formed.' Veins such as these form where fluids move through cracked rock and leave minerals in the fractures, often affecting the chemistry of the rock surrounding the fractures. This view from the Mars Hand Lens Imager on the arm of Curiosity rover is a close-up of a two-tone mineral vein at a site called 'Garden City' on lower Mount Sharp. It was taken during night, illuminated by LEDs . Kah said, 'At least two secondary fluids have left evidence here. 'We want to understand the chemistry of the different fluids that were here and the sequence of events. How have later fluids affected the host rock?' Some of the sequence is known: Mud that formed lake-bed mudstones must have dried and hardened before the fractures formed. The dark material that lines the fracture walls reflects an earlier episode of fluid flow than the white, calcium-sulphate-rich veins do - although both flows occurred after the cracks formed. In total, what is now the planet's arid northern plains would have contained at least 12.4 million cubic miles (20 million cubic km) of water . Thanks to missions like Nasa's Curiosity rover, we know Mars once had water - but until now we didn't know how much. Scientists have provided the best estimates yet, claiming it once had more water than the Arctic Ocean - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years. The findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on Mars to thrive, but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry. The study by scientists at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is the first to determine just how much water Mars had in its past. During its wet Noachian period - 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago - it is estimated that it had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet (137 metres) deep. However, it's likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of Mars, which would have been as deep as one mile (1.6km) in places - comparable to the Mediterranean Sea on Earth. The research estimates that, in total, what is now the planet's arid northern plains would have contained at least 12.4 million cubic miles (20 million cubic kilometres) of water. Curiosity has been studying rocky areas since landing on the Martian surface in 2012. Garden City is about 39 feet (12 meters) higher than the bottom edge of the 'Pahrump Hills' outcrop of the bedrock forming the basal layer of Mount Sharp, at the center of Mars' Gale Crater. 'We investigated Pahrump Hills the way a field geologist would, looking over the whole outcrop first to choose the best samples to collect, and it paid off,' said David Blake of Nasa's Ames Research Center. Analysis is still in its early stages, but the three drilled samples from Pahrump Hills have clear differences in mineral ingredients. It seems that the two-toned minerals were created from two distinctive wet periods on the planet. Curiosity is now exploring different layers of Mount Sharp in the hope of finding more clues to the red planet's history.","Mineral veins were found at a site called 'Garden City' on  Mount Sharp .

"A Spanish priest has stunned viewers and judges on a talent show with his remarkable rendition of Angels. Father Damian Maria Montes, 29, from Madrid, was appearing on the Spanish version of The Voice when he belted out the Robbie Williams 1997 ballad while donning his priest's collar.

Shock performance: Father Damian Maria Montes belts out the 1997 Robbie Williams classic, stunning viewers and judges on the Spanish version of The Voice . After finishing his stunning performance, the Redemptorist Missionary claimed he had been singing since he was 16 years old and had always wanted to be a musical artist. But he claimed he turned to the church first as he wanted to 'make sense of life'. He said: 'My goal is to convey through music all the love in the world.' Viewer Carlos Carrasco, 26, said: 'Angels is one of my favourite songs of all time and I never thought I'd hear a better version than Robbie's. But this priest blew me away.' Another, Maria Navarro, 22, said: 'When he started singing there was such beautiful innocence in his voice I felt myself moved to tears.'

"More than 20,000 foreign fighters have fled to Syria and Iraq, turning the region into an ‘international finishing school’ for jihadists, an alarming report found. Fighters from 100 nations – more than half the countries in the world – have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to research by the United Nations. Worryingly, the report warned if IS was defeated in the war-torn region then the barbarous foreign fighters could be scattered across the world. Scroll down for video . More than 20,000 foreign fighters from more than half the countries in the world have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to a report by the United Nations . The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with over 20,000 foreign fighters travelling to the region to fight for mainly IS but also the Al-Nusra Front. The panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who travelled to both countries are living and working in ‘a veritable “international finishing school” for extremists’ as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Afghan security forces estimated in March – three months after British troops withdrew - that about 6,500 foreign fighters were active in the country. And it said hundreds of foreigners are fighting in Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, around 100 in Somalia, and others in the Sahel countries in northern Africa, and in the Philippines. The panel of experts monitoring UN sanctions against Al-Qaeda said in the report that the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters ‘is higher than it has ever been historically’. The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory . The overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has ‘risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today,’ the panel said in the report to the UN Security Council. A military defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could have the unintended consequence of scattering foreign terrorist fighters across the world, the panel said. It noted that the ‘watch list’ in Turkey - a key crossing point to Syria and Iraq - now includes 12,500 individuals. And while governments are focusing on countering the threat from fighters returning home, the panel said it’s possible that some may be traumatised by what they saw and need psychological help. Others may be recruited by criminal networks. The number of countries the fighters come from has also risen dramatically from a small group in the 1990s to over 100 today, including some that have never had previous links with Al-Qaeda associated groups, the panel said. It cited the ‘high number’of foreign fighters from Tunisia, Morocco, France and Russia, the increase in fighters from the Maldives, Finland and Trinidad and Tobago, and the first fighters from some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with fighters mainly travelling to the region to fight for  IS but also the Al-Nusra Front (pictured, a fighter from the Al-Qaeda linked militant group) The panel said the fighters and their networks ‘pose an immediate and long-term threat’ and ‘an urgent global security problem’ that needs to be tackled on many fronts and has no easy solution. With globalised travel, it said, the chance of a person from any country becoming a victim of a foreign terrorist attack ‘is growing, particularly with attacks targeting hotels, public spaces and venues’. But the panel noted that a longstanding terrorist goal is ‘generating public panic’ and stressed that the response needs to ‘be measured, effective and proportionate.’ It said the most effective policy is to prevent the radicalization, recruitment and travel of would-be fighters. The panel noted that less than 10 per cent of basic information to identify foreign fighters has been put in global systems and called for greater intelligence sharing.","Number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by 71% from mid-2014 to now .

"It's amazing what a bit of make-up can do. In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video . In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name . This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent . Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base . To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale. One commenter wrote: 'Your [sic] amazing at what you do. Promise has been posting YouTube make-up tutorials for six years now having started her channel in 2009 and now has 2.8 million subscribers. On her YouTube profile she writes:  'I use make-up to transform myself into famous celebrities and characters. 'It started out as a hobby 4 years ago and now I am here using this awesome platform to teach and entertain millions around the world.' Promise colours her lips in before adding a Mac lipstick on top - the make-up brand created a collection inspired by the film . Promise uses a pair of tweezers to place false eyelashes onto her eyelid . Her Facebook page states: 'I am not a professional make-up artist nor did take any lessons in it. I am purely self taught!' Along with Disney princesses, she's also transformed herself into the likes of Drake, Johnny Depp and Michael Jackson. In the four minute video Promise talks her viewers through the steps that she took to get her Maleficent look.

"Forget fancy sheets and down-filled duvets, the perfect pillow is the key to a good night’s sleep. On average, we rest our weary heads on our pillows for more than 2,500 hours — or the equivalent of more than 100 days and nights — per year, so it’s certainly worth getting the right one. And while once our choice was limited to feather or fibre, the shops are now stuffed with everything from water pillows to scented pillows, and even one which is wired for sound. But which is a pain in the neck and which is a dream come true? SUPER COOL . Buckwheat Hull Pillow, £22.99, livingiseasy.co.uk . In Tudor times, buckwheat pillows were so prized that grandmothers handed them down to their grandchildren. My children aren’t quite as easily pleased. When I showed them this thick, heavy pillow with an industrial-looking cotton cover, they weren’t impressed. This feels like a giant, heavy beanbag and looks like a prop from Wolf Hall. Billed as the ultimate eco-pillow, it’s filled with the tiny husks which protect the kernel of the buckwheat grain. In summer, you can chill it in the fridge for a few hours to keep you cool throughout the night. It also soothes stiff muscles — as the chill will reduce inflammation and help numb any pain. It doesn’t look impressive, but it shapes beautifully around my shoulders and neck. It makes a slight rustling as the tiny hulls shift, but I had a great night’s sleep. All I needed was Mark Rylance beside me, and my dream would have been complete. 4/5 . MARRIAGE SAVERS . Reversible Foam Pillow, £35, marksandspencer.com . I’ve had some spectacular rows over pillows. My husband, Ray, likes a firmer pillow, while I like a lovely soft one, but I hate buying different types as we inevitably get them mixed up and we both have a bad night. Can M&S solve the dilemma with this unique two-sided pillow? One side — made from a very firm memory foam — suits Ray perfectly, but is far too rigid for me. The other side, made from synthetic microfibre filling, is perfectly soft and squishy. At 6in thick, it’s a little higher than some we tried, but this clever pillow still gave me a good night’s sleep. We both woke up happy, and that’s good enough for me! 4/5 . A SMELLY SNOOZE . Silent Night Febreze Pillow, £9.99, argos.co.uk . I was hoping for the soft scent of lavender gently lulling me to sleep, but instead I got a rather sickly synthetic pong wafting up from the filling. Definitely more lavatory than lavender. The lightweight pillow made of polyester didn’t improve my sleep any more than any other ones I tried. Synthetic fillings are the most popular type of pillows in the UK, because they are cheap. But let’s face it, if I wanted the scent of Febreze at bedtime, I’d be better off spraying Ray as he lay beside me snoring. At 3.5in thick, it is soft but offers little support, and I woke feeling uncomfortable and grumpy. 1/5 . SO SOFT. . . AND CHEAP! Lidl Microfibre Pillows, £3.49, Lidl . Budget pillows tend to be thin, bounce-free and crackling with static electricity. So I was delighted to find these bargain-basement microfibre-filled pillows are generously stuffed and incredibly silky to touch. Because they are filled with bundles of ultra-fine synthetic fibre, the pillows are wonderfully soft. My 16-year-old daughter, Ruby, the fussiest sleeper since the princess and the pea, declared it the best pillow she had ever tried. A similar synthetic pillow from John Lewis would set me back £35, which makes this — at under a fiver — a total winner. Synthetic pillows have the shortest lifespan of all — from six months to two years before they flatten or fall out of shape — but at this price, who cares. This pillow is just under 4in thick, but flattens due to the synthetic filling, so if you prefer height you’ll need two. 5/5 . WHEEZE-FREE SLEEP . Sleepangel Memory Foam Filter Pillow, £59, sleepangelworld.com . More dust mites live in the bedroom than anywhere else in the house — and they make a beeline for warm bedding. This anti-allergy pillow contains a four-layer filter designed to block germs, bacteria, mould and allergens. The waterproof, wipe-clean cover is heat-sealed, with no seams or needle marks to let in germs. It sounds impressive, but to test the effectiveness I used a pillow for three months before sending it to an independent laboratory. Scientists took samples of the foam filling and confirmed it was completely free of any nasties. With a 13-year-old son who suffers from asthma — a condition often triggered by mould and dust mites — this was reassuring. It is 3.5in thick, with little give thanks to the memory foam filling. The price tag is hefty, but totally worth it for a wheeze-free son. I’ve passed this on to Charlie for an unbroken night of sleep. 4/5 . MUSIC TO MY EARS . Sound Asleep Pillow, £17.99 firebox.com . Since my three children became teenagers, the task of persuading them to go to bed at night has become my worst nightmare. Could this high-tech pillow — wired for sound as they plug in their iPods to the external lead which connects to a speaker hidden inside — work miracles? Certainly, it’s the only time I’ve ever seen them excited about going to bed, and I was stunned to see my son Archie jump in before I’d issued a single threat. But the sort of music I hear thumping out of his pillow minutes later isn’t exactly restful! Luckily, the pillow muffles the sound for the rest of us. The pillow is not very thick (at 3in deep) or supportive. A winner for anyone aged 13-19 and for parents who are desperate for peace and quiet! 3/5 . THE GOLDEN GOOSE . Hungarian Goose Down Pillow, £88 For Two, soakandsleep.com . Down pillows are the softest and most luxurious type available and often come with a price tag to match. These ones are made by a small family firm in Hungary. The filling is washed in thermal spring water — so there are no nasty chemicals involved. Each pillow is double-stitched for strength and edged with gold piping for luxury you’ve never seen outside a five-star hotel. No wonder these pillows have amassed their own online following — as well as demand from top hotels around the world. Feels like sleeping on a giant marshmallow — it really is a luxury treat. Just one sumptuous pillow, measuring 5in thick — was enough for a perfect night’s sleep. 5/5 . LIKE SLEEPING ON A SPACE HOPPER . Mediflow Waterbase Pillow, £39.99, amazon.co.uk . Water pillows are fast becoming a trend — to keep cool or help sore necks and shoulders. They contain a pouch that you fill with water by opening the rubber seal, and pouring your water in. This means you can actually choose the height of your own pillow, depending on how you sleep best. My first attempt at filling it goes wrong. I pour so much water inside that it feels like I’m sleeping on a Space Hopper. A thermal insulator keeps the water cool, while an anti-allergy cushion of polyester fibres surround the inner water chamber, making it look and feel like any other pillow. The first night didn’t go well, as my neck felt too high. But I simply let water out the next day, taking the pillow from 5in thick to 3in, and I slept like a baby. 3/5 . WOOLLY WONDER . Fogarty Wool Pillow, £24.99, dunelm-mill.com . Wool is nature’s best temperature regulator — staying cool in summer and warm in winter. But can a pillow stuffed with wiry wool instead of lovely bouncy feathers offer as much comfort? The answer is yes. As I sink into the warm pillow I feel instantly comforted. Wool naturally absorbs moisture and scientists say the average sleeper gives off nearly a pint of water vapour. If you suffer from menopausal night sweats, this can rise to well over that. Once absorbed, the moisture quickly evaporates from the porous wool cells, so what looks like a normal pillow is actually a natural air conditioning unit. at 3in thick, this pillow is thinner and has less give, but it supported my sore neck — strained as I walked the dog — well. I slept well and woke feeling cool and refreshed. 3/5 .","Does finding the perfect pillow really need to break the bank?
