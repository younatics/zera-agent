"John Howard, 66, bled the Overseas Press and Media Association dry over two years - leaving the company facing bankruptcy . The treasurer of a voluntary organisation drained £90,000 from the group's account - spending thousands on restaurant meals and trips to France. John Howard, 66, from Canterbury, Kent, had been a member of the Overseas Press and Media Association for 30 years but began stealing funds two years ago, leaving the company facing bankruptcy. The father-of-three had sole access to the non-profit organisation's account and enjoyed dining alone on several £300 meals a month and also spent money on flowers, a court heard. His fraud was only uncovered after the association had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls. He was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed 'I'm sorry' to a former colleague as he left the dock at Canterbury Crown Court. Prosecutor Tony Prosser said Howard secretly sacked auditors and then presented the association with fake accounts each month. Between 2011 to 2013 he freely dipped into the money and lavished cash on himself and his family. When his crime came to light just £180 was left in the association's savings account when it should have been nearly £80,000. Howard rang a fellow member from a pay phone admitting the fraud and offering to repay £20,000. Mr Prosser said police found he had blown thousands on meals, groceries, flowers, expenditure in France, hotels and even sending money to his wife. Howard, who admitted fraud by breach of trust, claimed he only took £67,000 and had now put his home up for sale in a bid to repay some of the money. Dominic Webber, defending, said Howard got into debt and used the money to pay bills and was 'extremely sorry for what he has done.' Matt Findel-Hawkins, a former OPMA president, said: 'It wasn't like he was paying off debts to some evil Shylock figure. This was blatant, categorical deceit over time. His fraud was only uncovered after OPMA had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls. The non-profit trade association services the international advertising community . 'At the same time he would sit there in meetings, smiling at us.' Mr Findel-Hawkins, sales director for Nikkei Europe, said Howard had been a member of the non-profit organisation for 30 years. He said: 'We'd have meetings and all go to lunch. He was a steady guy with a nice sense of humour. 'That's why he was our treasurer. We've been trying to work out what went wrong. If I ever spoke to him again, I'd just want to know why he did it.' Sentencing, Judge Simon James told Howard his victim was a not-for-profit organisation which had been operating for more than 80 years. 'Under your three-year tenure as treasurer - in which you seemed to treat its bank account as your own - they were left close to bankruptcy and perilously close to folding,' he said. 'Your good name has now been well and truly lost. This was a systematic, prolonged and flagrant piece of dishonesty. Howard was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed 'I'm sorry' to a former colleague as he left the dock at Canterbury Crown Court today . 'It seems to me the money was used to fund a comfortable living for you and your family rather than out of real desperation.' Detective Constable Barry Carr described it as a 'serious abuse of position' and said Howard had shown a 'flagrant disregard for the trust and responsibility placed in him'. He added that his deceit had nearly brought the long-established organisation to its knees financially. The OPMA is a non-profit trade association servicing the international advertising community, run voluntarily by its members.","John Howard, 66, took cash from Overseas Press and Media Association .

"Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Ed Miliband - and 'risky if you are young, dodgy if you are older' in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Both men were asked their opinion on the practice of sending sexy text messages in a quiz for fashion magazine Cosmopolitan's website. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that it is 'OK for other adults but not for me'. And Education Secretary Nicky Morgan answered: 'A bit too risky, thank you very much!' The verdict: Politicians should not sext, says Ed Miliband (right) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) says it is 'risky' for youngsters and 'dodgy' if you are older . Their responses are hardly surprisingly considering the downfalls of fellow politicians when salacious messages are revealed in the press - including those sent by former MP Brooks Newmark and Tory official Iain Corby. The quiz, which was answered by hand, included a question on the worst thing about politics, which Mr Miliband said was Prime Minister's Questions - 'a bad advert for all of us'. Ms Bennett ticked 'not being able to make the changes you want to', while Ms Morgan opted for people thinking she is boring. Mr Clegg wrote: 'Sitting through 30 minutes of Cameron and Miliband yelling persistently at each other every Wednesday!' The four were also asked about what they would be if not politicians. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that sexting is 'OK for other adults but not for me' Mr Clegg said a wildlife film-maker, while the Labour leader wrote: 'Trying to change the world somehow.' Ms Bennett said she would be an author and Ms Morgan a solicitor. Asked to describe their favourite hangover cure, Mr Miliband said: 'Drinking lots of water but it's been a long time since I had one...' Mr Clegg said: 'Three young boys running around usually does the trick.' Ms Morgan chose a bacon sandwich, while Ms Bennett responded: 'Home-baked gluten-free bread with butter and honey.' In another question, the politicians had to reveal the most hurtful thing they had read about themselves. The Labour leader offered: 'Where do I start?!' and Ms Bennett said a claim that she was trying to be cool, something she says she gave up at the age of 16. The Deputy Prime Minister replied: 'Not hurtful, just absurd - that I have a personal chef! Of course I don't.' Ms Morgan said it was generally people making assumptions about her motives when they have never met her. Another question asked what would be worse than joining the opposition. Mr Clegg said joining Ukip, while Ms Morgan said she would rather join the opposition than do a bungee jump. Ms Bennett and Mr Miliband responded 'none of the above' and 'no way' respectively. It's not difficult to see why the leaders believe politicians should steer clear of sexting as they have plenty of cautionary tales to learn from. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down in May's election after becoming embroiled in a humiliating sexting scandal last year. It was revealed the Conservative member  bombarded a single mother with up to 40 naked pictures and told her 'I am desperate for sex with you'. The father-of-five was forced to issue a grovelling apology after being caught texting explicit photographs of himself for a second time. He had already left his post as minister for civil society after he was exposed as having exchanged photographs with a male journalist posing as a glamorous young Tory PR woman. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down this year after becoming embroiled in two sexting scandals . In April last year, details of salacious messages sent by top Tory official Iain Corby on a gay dating service were revealed. These referred to a sex party for Tory researchers at the party’s annual conference in Manchester, funded by Conservative MPs’ expenses. The Mail on Sunday revealed that the exchanges involved Mr Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses. Disgraced Co-op boss Paul Flowers was suspended from his position after he was filmed buying hard drugs including crystal meth and crack cocaine. The Mail on Sunday revealed exchanges involving Tory official Iain Corby on gay dating service Grindr . The former Labour councillor was further shamed when a teenage rent boy revealed sexually explicit text messages exchanged between them - and revealed he had been asked to accompany Flowers to the summer party of Labour peer Baroness Thornton. And sexting has also caused problems for politicians across the pond. American politician Anthony Weiner, a former representative of the United States House of Representatives, is better known for his two sexting scandals. The first, in 2011, led to his resignation as a Congressman after he sent an intimate picture to a woman over Twitter. And then as he attempted to make a return to politics by running for mayor of New York in 2013, he was forced to admit to sexting three women after pictures were published.","Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Labour leader Ed Miliband .

"If you think you have seen a ghost, you may have been suffering the effects of exposure to mould, according to a group of scientists. Researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings are usually reported, often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould, which can affect our brains. Exposure to the mould can cause mood swings, irrational anger and cognitive impairment. All an illusion? Researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings (illustrated by a stock image) are usually reported, often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould, which can affect our brains . ‘Experiences reported in many hauntings are similar to mental or neurological symptoms reported by individuals exposed to toxic moulds,’ said Professor Shane Rogers of Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. ‘Psychoactive effects of some fungi are well-known, whereas the effects of others such as indoor moulds are less researched. ‘Although allergy and asthma symptoms and other physiological effects are well established, there has long been controversy over the effects of indoor mould exposure on cognitive and other functioning of the brain. ‘Reports of psychiatric symptoms including mood swings, hyperactivity, and irrational anger, as well as cognitive impairment are prevalent among those exposed to moulds. Brain drain: Exposure to the mould can cause mood swings, irrational anger and cognitive impairment, among other problems. A stock image of toxic mould in the firm of Stachybotrys chartarum spores, is shown . 'Ghosts' tend to be sighted in old buildings, which are often more likely to have damp and mould problems. No-one is exactly sure of the psychoactive effects of indoor moulds on the brain. But spores have been linked with mood swings, hyperactivity, and irrational anger, as well as cognitive impairment. Recent reports indicate that exposure to toxic mould spores may cause brain inflammation and memory loss. A team of researchers are exploring whether the mould may cause people to think they have seen ghosts, by comparing conditions in 'haunted' and non-haunted old buildings. ‘Other reports include depression and loss of memory function. ‘More recent work is emerging that supports brain inflammation and memory loss in mice exposed to Stachybotrys charatarum, a common indoor air mould, as well as increased anxiety and fear.’ Professor Rogers is currently leading a team of researchers measuring air quality in several reportedly haunted places around New York State. The group will compare samples taken from several buildings where ghost sightings have been reported with samples taken from properties with no paranormal activity, to see if there is a difference in the types of fungi. Professor Rogers said: ‘I have long been a fan of ghost stories and shows related to investigation of haunted places and have to admit to some strange occurrences in my own past. ‘Many of the places under investigation and from my own experiences may be prime environments for mould and other indoor air quality issues. ‘We would like to see if we can parse out some commonality between the mould microbiome in places that are haunted relative to those that are not.’ The real ghost busters: Here, undergraduate environmental engineering students (from left to right) Thomas O'Rourke and Daniel C. Schwab work with Professor Shane Rogers to sample air quality in buildings associated with alleged ghost activity . The team have only just begun their investigations, but have been to a handful of ‘haunted’ buildings to collect samples, as well as properties with mould, but no connection to ghosts. ‘In one historic house turned into an office building there have been reports of noises, moving ceiling tiles, moving items on shelves and desks, apparitions, and a general feeling of unease among building occupants,’ he said. ‘There have been long-standing stories of some of the original family members still occupying the place. ‘In another location, the Remington Art Museum in Ogdensburg New York, there is a long history of ghost stories involving the former occupants and others. ‘A week prior to our visit, they had a visit from a psychic who took a reading in several rooms in the museum that we then used to target our air quality studies. ‘She reported a few “folks” came to speak with her, children running in and out of some of the rooms in the house, and a woman that claimed she was ""not won in a poker game”, which was related to a long-time story related to the Remington family. ‘So far, we haven’t been spooked out of a location, but time will tell.’ The team have only just begun their investigations, but have been to a handful of ‘haunted’ buildings to collect samples, as well as properties with mould, but no connection to ghosts. For example, they have visited the Remington Art Museum in Ogdensburg New York (pictured), where there is a long history of ghost stories .","Clarkson University experts are probing the link between mould and ghosts .

"A pregnant meteorologist has called out the bullies who viciously attacked her appearance by reading their hateful messages on air - before admitting that their cruel words had taken their toll on her. Kristi Gordon, of British Columbia's news channel Global BC, was joined by her fellow anchors Robin Stickley and Squire Barnes as they reflected upon the degrading comments the mom has received about her second pregnancy on an episode of the online-only news segment News Hour Plus - with her reading some of the message aloud. 'Nowhere on North America TV have we seen a weather reader so gross as you (sic),' Kristi read from one of the messages. 'Your front end looks like the Hindenburg and rear end a brick - fill in the blank - house.' Scroll down for video . Taking a stand: Pregnant TV meteorologist Kristi Gordon called out the online bullies who attacked her appearance during the online only segment News Hour Plus . The online bullies, who left no name or return address, added: 'We now turn off Global. Cover up or take time off. The Group.' Kristi, who is due to give birth in three months, explained that she received the harsh message the day before she taped the March 26 segment and admitted that it 'kicked off a bit of a conversation'. She and her co-anchors laughed the comments off, particularly the group's misspelling of the word Global. 'First of all, if you are going to diss us, please learn how to spell,' Squire noted, before he explained that Global is spelled with an 'a' - not an 'e' like the group had written. And while they joked about the bizarre jibe, it wasn't the only scathing message Kristi had received regarding her pregnancy and her wardrobe. 'Buy some decent clothes and have more respect for your unborn child. You're not the first pregnant woman OMG,' another critic had written. Someone else advised her: 'Looser tops would look much more professional.' Harsh words: Kristi, who can be seen giving a weather report, was also criticized for wearing form-fitting clothing because 'looser tops would look more professional' After Kristi finished reading the messages, Squire joked: 'Haters gonna hate as some rapper may have said,' before Robin interjected: 'Taylor Swift, I think actually said that.' Kristi revealed that she was actually expecting these types of messages because she had received a similar level of hateful jibes during her first pregnancy. Refusing to cover up and hide her pregnant body however, she stood up to show her growing baby bump and said: 'You can't really hide something like this.' 'I feel like I am pretty confident person,' she added. 'I wouldn't be in this industry if I wasn't. I don't feel that this is really affecting me or has affected me.' But Kristi went on to say that, subconsciously, her critics' hurtful words had gotten to her. That night she found herself checking her own reflection in the mirror to see how big her baby bump had grown. She asked her husband if she looked bigger than she had thought, and when went to bed that night, she realized it was her critics' harsh words that were driving her actions. Kristi noted: 'It's amazing when you say something mean about someone, it still affects them.' Baby bumps: Kristi posed for this funny photo in the green room at Global News . Family time: Kristi and her husband Paul Klawer can be seen sitting in the crowed with their son Jordan . 'Even if you are joking, it sinks in at some level,' she continued. 'I was not impressed with myself when I got into bed yesterday and thought about what I had done through the evening hours. It obviously had affected me. The day after the online segment aired, Kristi wrote about her account on the Global News website. She first thanked fans who reached out to her to share their outrage over the feedback she has received throughout her pregnancy. 'For those of you emailing to say I look great and to keep my head up — THANK YOU! Please also share a kind comment to the person next to you,' Kristi wrote. She went on to thank 'The Group' who wrote her such a vicious letter because it taught her an important lesson. 'No matter how rational or confident you are, the mean things people say can have an impact,' she explained. 'The negative thoughts seep in when you don’t even realize it. Even a little joking comment could do some damage. Hopefully this can help us all be more aware of our impact on others.'",Kristi Gordon of British Columbia's news channel Global BC called out her online bullies because she realized their words had affected her .
"A  psychologist has surrendered his registration after a woman suffering from depression claimed he told her she had 'nice t**s' and asked her to massage him during an appointment. Throughout a consultation in the woman's house on October 25, 2012, Sydney psychologist Darryl Dewar hugged his client, patted her head, directed her to sing and used offensive language. The woman, who was having suicidal thoughts at the time, also claimed he called her 'a horny little thing' and asked her if her mother was a 'f---ing bitch' with 'lots of kids, multiple fathers'. A Sydney psychologist has surrendered his registration after a woman claimed he told her she had 'nice t**s' during a consultation (stock image) The Civil and Administrative tribunal reprimanded Mr Dewar last week and have banned him from  re-registering as a psychologist unless he takes part in counselling or further education. The Sydney doctor initially denied any of the events took place during his consultation, telling investigators that he had 'brain confusion', however he admitted that he hugged the woman as he liked helping people. He also said he asked the woman for a massage as he had hurt his neck while reversing on the way to her house. Mr Dewar immediately surrendered his registration after the allegations were made, but after a tribunal found him guilty, they said he would have only been suspended for three months. The woman said Mr Dewar lay down at her feet, told her to sing for him, asked her for a massage and swore at her when she questioned his actions (stock image) The woman said Mr Dewar stroked her hair, pushed her head into his shoulder and invited her on a trip with him. He also lay down at her feet, told her to sing for him and swore at her when she questioned his actions.

"Three teenage girls were rescued after their car careened over a 100-foot cliff in Arizona and landed upside down on top of the 16-year-old driver who was thrown from the vehicle. The driver, who has not been identified, was trapped under the car for more than four hours during the incident that occurred on Wednesday, but miraculously suffered only minor injuries. The girl was in stable condition and largely kept her cool during the ordeal, said fire Capt. Paul Voakes of the Pine-Strawberry Fire District. The two passengers, aged 16 and 17, who have also not been identified were removed from the four-door sedan an hour after the accident. Details were not immediately available on their condition, however officials indicated the injuries did not appear to be life-threatening. The driver of the car, a 16-year-old girl, was thrown from the car and trapped underneath for more than four hours after it veered off the road and dropped 100ft from a cliff landing on top of her (above scenes from the wreckage) Depression visible: It took emergency services around five hours to pull the teen driver, who has not been identified, from the wreckage and she only suffered minor injuries (above the four-door sedan after it landed upside down) The driver of the car is believed to have only suffered minor injuries because of a depression in the roof of the car that created a space between the roof and the ground that enveloped her after the car flipped over and landed. This apparently stopped the full weight of the car from bearing down on her. 'It appeared her body occupied part of this space thus avoiding the full weight of the car,' Dwight D'Evelyn, spokesman for the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office, said in a statement. It took dozens of emergency responders from multiple agencies about five hours to extricate the girl in a remote high desert area west of Strawberry following the accident around 5.30pm. The two other passengers managed to climb up to the road when an ambulance crew responded to a 911 call from a passer-by, said Voakes. Rescuers used ropes to go down the cliff or hiked in via a creek bed to reach the upside-down car. The girls were returning from the popular Fossil Creek outdoor area when the accident occurred near the border of Gila and Yavapai counties. The driver apparently lost control after turning a curve too fast, according to Voakes and the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office. The two passengers, aged 16 and 17, who have also not been identified, managed to climb up to the road and were taken to hospital with what appears to be non-life threatening injuries . The driver was face-down and responders could see only one hand and a foot until using inflation bags and other gear to lift the car. 'When we first got there, she was pretty excited as I think anybody would be,' said Voakes. 'We calmed her down.' 'We all met our end goals in getting her out of there.' The driver and one of the passengers was flown to Flagstaff Medical Center, and the other was taken by ground ambulance to the Verde Valley Medical Center in Cottonwood. There was no sign of alcohol or drug use and authorities are not sure if the teens were wearing seat belts. The incident remains under investigation.","The driver, 16, of Arizona who has not been identified was saved from full weight of car landing on her due to depression in roof of car .

"Victoria's Secret caused huge a backlash when it unveiled campaign slogan 'The Perfect Body' splashed across an image of skinny models. More than 27,000 people signed a Change.com petition started by three students asking for an apology, and for the initiative to be scrapped. And a few days later, the US lingerie firm changed the wording of the advertisement - but that hasn't stopped similar brands poking fun at the ridiculous message of the original slogan. Scroll down for video . The final ten contenders for Star In ABra feature in the powerful new image recreating the notorious VS advert . A new campaign from Curvy Kate - a lingerie brand for women with bigger boobs - recreates that notorious image using models of all shapes and sizes. The D+ label says its image is 'empowering', especially with the widespread call for real models alongside campaigns like #droptheplus - sparked by a model who was labelled 'plus' because she was bigger than sample size - an Australian size 4. It coincides with the shortlist of their annual global Star in A Bra contest, where a 'real woman' wins the job of being its lingerie model. Hopefuls enter online and the winner becomes the face and body of Curvy Kate, and gets a year-long modelling contract with Bridge Models Limited, a trip to the Mediterranean and £1,000 spending money. Victoria's Secret caused huge consumer backlash when it unveiled its campaign last year . The final ten contenders feature in the powerful new image. Brunette Emma Webley, who is pictured centre-left in the group shot, says: 'Making the top 10 (and hopefully winning) is a brilliant opportunity for me to spread my belief that everyone should be confident about their body, no matter what shape or size they are. 'To feel body confident you just need to be happy with who you are and surround yourself with positive people. Confidence, a warm personality and a smile is the most beautiful thing a girl can have.' The next stage in the competition is to get support with public votes, which can be done through the Star in a Bra website. Curvy Kate has said: 'With the public outcry for the use of more realistic images in the media, Star in a Bra champions the use of relatable role models and promotes a positive approach to body image. 'We want to show you exactly how our lingerie will look and fit on a variety of body shapes, cementing that there isn't one type of perfect body.'","Victoria's Secret caused huge consumer backlash with 'The Perfect Body'

"A 21-year-old man has been charged with second-degree murder after allegedly shooting dead his fiancée at their Minnesota home on  Easter morning while holding their baby daughter in his arms. Dimitri Harrell reportedly pulled out his gun and pointed it at 19-year-old Samirria White after they started arguing over his 'infidelity' in the bedroom of their St Paul apartment at around 3.40am. Carrying the couple's three-month-old child, he then shot Miss White in the face at close range, according to police. When medics arrived at the scene, they pronounced the young mother dead. Now, Harrell, who later admitted to having stored his handgun under his daughter's mattress, has been charged with one count of second-degree murder at Ramsey County District Court. Shooting: Dimitri Harrell (right) has been arrested after allegedly shooting dead his fiancée, Samirria White (left), at their Minnesota home on Easter morning while holding their baby daughter (center) in his arms . The suspect, who had  'trust issues' with Miss White after having two children by another woman, remains in custody in lieu of $200,000 bail. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison. In the moments before Sunday's shooting, Harris had been arguing with Miss White after he had vanished from the apartment several times during the night, arousing her suspicions, relatives said. During an interview with police, the suspect apparently told officers he had then tried to pull his gun - which he had bought several days earlier - from his pocket while holding the couple's baby daughter. However, the weapon had accidentally discharged, he said, causing a bullet to strike Miss White in the face, according to the Star Tribune. It is unclear whether he explained why he took out the gun. Tragic: Harrell reportedly pulled out his gun and fired at 19-year-old Miss White (pictured with their daughter) after they started arguing over his 'infidelity' in the bedroom of their St Paul apartment at around 3.40am . Arrest: Now, Harrell has been charged with one count of second-degree murder at Ramsey County District Court. Above, the suspect is pictured in his mug shot (left) and posing with Miss White and their baby (right) Several people - including some of the victim's siblings - were also in the property at the time of the alleged murder. Many of them heard yelling come from the couple's bedroom, CBS reported. Miss White's 16-year-old brother, who woke up after apparently hearing his sister scream 'Don't point that gun at me!',  ran into the room when he heard the gunshot. There, he found his sister dead . The boy yelled at Harrell to get away from Miss White, according to a complaint obtained by the Tribune. In response, the suspect apparently told him it was an accident and fled the scene. After emergency crews arrived at the scene, Miss White was declared dead and the bedroom was cordoned off. Police later found the gun on Harrell's 'close friend', who was in the apartment. Scene: The shooting occurred in the 800 block of Pierce Butler Route (pictured) in Minnesota on Sunday . Family: In the moments before Sunday's shooting, Harris had been arguing with Miss White after he had vanished from the apartment several times during the night, arousing her suspicions, relatives said . The man, who has not been identified by officials, had reportedly received the weapon from Harrell just minutes after the shooting. The suspect had apparently told him: 'Do something with this'. Harrell, who is pictured with Miss White and their daughter in numerous Facebook photos,  told police that their relationship had been rocky since the births of his  two children by a different woman. On Tuesday, relatives described Miss White, a former Humboldt Senior High School student, as a 'spontaneous' and loving woman who had hoped to become a nurse and adored her daughter. On her Facebook page, Miss White lists the date she got engaged as March 23, 2012. She also reveals that she was born in Elgin, Illinois. Her three-month-old daughter's name is unknown..

"Students at a school in Memphis were suspended after sharing a mugshot of their teacher on Instagram. Children posted the police picture of eighth grade teacher Tiffany Jackson on social media on Friday, after she was arrested for driving with an invalid licence. When the authorities of Highland Oaks Middle School in Tennessee realised the image had been shared online, they suspended three of the students for three days. Eighth grade teacher Tiffany Jackson was arrested by police for driving while her licence was suspended. Students at the Memphis school where she teaches were suspended after sharing this mugshot online . Parent Shanna Richardson told WMC Action News said her son, who re-posted the picture, was one of the pupils taken out of school for sharing the mugshot. School officials justified suspended the students by saying they had demonstrated an 'inappropriate use of electronic media', but later overturned the decision. Ms Richardson said her son had apologised to the teacher and she thought it was unfair that he had been singled out. 'My son went to her and talked to her to make her feel better, and explained how he deleted it,"" she said. 'He still got punished and that's what makes me upset.' 'It's public information, put it that way. You can see it on social media or you can see it in a magazine,' she added. Officials at Highland Oaks Middle School in Memphis, Tennessee, said the children had demonstrated an 'inappropriate use of electronic media'. but later overturned the suspensions following a backlash . On the 'Cell Phone Policy' listed on the school's website and written by the Shelby County Board of Education, it says the increased use of mobile phones is a 'distraction' to the school environment. It adds: 'These devices are being used by students as a means of cheating on tests, taking inappropriate pictures and video of students and staff for sharing and posting across the internet, threatening and/or bullying other students, and engaging in an excessive amount of social interaction during instructional time.' The policy bans pupils from having a mobile phone on during the school day, and says children who flout the rules will have the devices confiscated. 'Additional consequence' - such as suspension - could follow. It is not known whether the pupils were using their mobile phones in school to post the images.

"The parents of a six-year-old girl who were traveling home from a screening of Fast and Furious 7 were killed when a drunk driver allegedly sped the wrong up a highway and crashed into their car. Tiffany Sical, 21, and her long-term boyfriend Bryan Rodriguez-Solis, 23, were driving along Route 6 in Providence, Rhode Island, on Sunday after watching the box office hit on its opening weekend. But they were killed when 24-year-old Joel Norman reportedly entered an exit ramp while under the influence and collided head-on with their car, leaving their daughter, Jaylene Rodriguez, an orphan. Now, Norman, of Massachusetts, has been arrested and charged with two counts of driving under the influence - death resulting, and two counts of driving to endanger - death resulting, police said. Scroll down for video . Victims: Tiffany Sical (left), 21, and her boyfriend, Bryan Rodriguez-Solis (right), 23, were killed in the early hours of Sunday when a drunk driver sped the wrong up a highway and crashed into their car, police said . Wreckage: The couple were driving along Route 6 in Providence, Rhode Island, when Joel Norman allegedly entered an exit ramp while under the influence and collided head-on with their car (pictured after the crash) Film: Sical and Rodriguez-Solis had been watching Furious 7, the latest installment in The Fast and The Furious franchise. Above, a scene from the film, starring Paul Walker (second right), who died in a car crash in 2013 . The horror car crash comes nearly a year and a half after The Fast and The Furious star Paul Walker was killed aged 40 when the Porshe he was traveling in crashed in California in 2013. The actor, who was a passenger in the car, plays a central role in the franchise's final installment, Furious 7. His work in the film was completed using digital technology and a series of stand-ins. In the seconds leading up to Sunday's incident, Norman drove his Nissan Maxima on to the East off-ramp near the Providence Place mall at around 1.35am, officials told the Providence Journal. He then traveled a staggering 1.2 miles west, before crashing head-on into Sical and Rodriguez-Solis's Honda, which was in the left lane, it is alleged. The impact completely wrecked the vehicle. Emergency crews rushed to the scene and Sical was pronounced dead. Rodriguez-Solis, who lived with Sical and Jaylene in Central Falls, was taken to hospital, where he was also declared dead. The couple, who were high school sweethearts, had been on a date night watching Furious 7 in Warwick. They were both wearing seat belts at the time of the crash, according to turnto10.com.

Above, the suspect's Nissan following the crash . After troopers noticed that Norman, whose car sustained serious damage, was acting intoxicated at the scene, they asked him to take a breathalyzer test, the news site reported. However, he refused. This prompted Rhode Island State Police to obtain a warrant to draw his blood, which was later sent off for evaluation. The test results are pending and Norman remains in custody on $100,000 bail. On Monday, Rodriguez-Solis' father, Arnulfo Rodriguez, speaking through a family member, told the Providence Journal that he nor his relatives knew how to tell little Jaylene that her parents are dead. Meanwhile, Sical's best friend, Maria Carrillo, described the couple as 'high school sweethearts' who had met at the Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical Center and were  generous and positive.

Rodriguez-Solis was taken to hospital, where he was also declared dead . Scene: The couple were both wearing seat belts at the time of the crash on Route 6 (pictured), Rhode Island . Sical, a sales associate at Bob's Discount Furniture in Attleboro, and her boyfriend, a manager at Spike's Junkyard Dogs in Cranston, had apparently spoken about getting married this summer. The couple's loved ones have now set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for Jaylene's future. At the weekend, Furious 7 raced to the top of the domestic box office, picking up a massive $143.6 million on its opening two days - and establishing a new high-water mark for the month of April . The film, which blew past the $95 million debut of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, now stands as the highest-grossing opening for any film in the Fast and Furious franchise. It also ranks ninth among the top ten openings in history. Norman, from Webster, is scheduled to appear at Providence District Court on June 12.

"My introduction to Ferme de Montagne did not take place at this boutique hotel’s enviable ski-in, ski-out location in the French resort of Les Gets – it happened at The Bar at The Dorchester in London. Ferme de Montagne proprietors Suzanne Dixon-Hudson and her architect husband Henry suggested we meet there for cocktails as they were in the capital, pre-winter season, ‘on business’. I was impressed to discover that what Suzanne and Henry were really in town for was to check up on their 15 hotel staff – who spend a mandatory week working and gaining experience at the Mayfair hotel before the start of each new season. A waiter mixes things up at the cocktail bar at Ferme de Montagne in France . Suzanne explained: ‘It exposes them to a five-star environment where exacting standards of service and composure are required at front of house while also learning to cope with the rigours of a slick and intensive behind-the-scenes regime.’ Suzanne, whose CV glitters with top posts in luxury hotels and catering, added: ‘At the same time as training my staff to a high level, I insist they all ski or snowboard in their free time.’ And, of course, a fit and happy team that spends a generous amount of time on the mountain will only benefit the clients of her boutique, chalet-style hotel where interaction with guests is integral to the Ferme de Montagne experience. I finally got to meet the team on site after an easy, 75-minute transfer by car to Les Gets from Geneva airport. And they did indeed make a polished unit – enthusiastic, energetic, genuinely cheerful, pleasingly informal and disarmingly friendly. Les Gets is well placed in the giant Portes du Soleil area, which has 400 miles of groomed pistes, linked by 14 ski stations across the French/Swiss border. Ferme de Montagne proprietors ensure their staff spend a mandatory week working and gaining experience at The Dorchester in Mayfair (pictured) before the start of each new season . It takes a long time to get to know your way around vast ski areas like this so I was delighted to join Ferme de Montagne’s ski host, Rory, who has no need of a piste map. Due to a long-running relationship with the local Ecole de Ski Francais, Ferme de Montagne guests always have high-quality, English-speaking ski instructors for their lessons. Hosts such as Rory are also trusted to ski with guests, make sure they don’t get lost, point out the rich variety of peaks – such as the magnificent Dents du Midi cluster from the top of Fornet above Avoriaz – and crucially, as far as this epicurean skier is concerned, recommend great on-mountain restaurants. Suzanne enjoys skiing with guests when time permits. On one occasion Rory treated us all to a great morning’s sport at the Avoriaz sector before lunch at Lindarets – known as ‘the goatvillage’ after the population that takes over in summer. After the guests’ day on the ski slopes, they usually convene at the Ferme de Montagne bar to swap ski stories and to try the cocktail of the day or complimentary flute of champagne. The hotel offers the best of all ski holidays. All of the bedrooms are spacious, luxurious and en suite. Suzanne’s choice of Frette bedding, sumptuous mattresses, heavy, warming fabrics for the drapes and bespoke furniture and design choices throughout makes this the type of exclusive property one normally has to hire whole, and very expensively, for a week. But here guests can book one room for three or four nights. Breakfast, tea and dinner are included in the price for each night booked. Food is central to a ski holiday at Ferme de Montagne as Andrew, a repeat guest, summed up at dinner. It came to ordering dessert and he said: ‘Well I like the sound of the apple crumble but I have to have the chocolate fondant with chocolate sauce and port ice cream again… it’s become one of my five a day!’ British Airways flies to Geneva from Gatwick and London City, with return fares from £84. Three nights at Ferme de Montagne, located in Les Gets, costs £995 per person, excluding flights, based on two sharing. Four nights costs from £1,295 per person.","Ferme de Montagne is a boutique, chalet-style hotel in France .

"A spring snowstorm and icy roads caught Colorado drivers by surprise Friday, causing a 39-vehicle pileup near Boulder and other bad wrecks that shut down highways during the morning commute. No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars. Lisa Lai told the Daily Camera newspaper she avoided hitting a crash in front of her and ended up propped against a highway barrier — and out of the way — as other peoples' vehicles piled up. A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36, Friday near Boulder, Colo. A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36 . Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains . 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado. We have four seasons in one day,' Schmidt said after the sun emerged. A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of cleanup on the pileup  on . Drivers of damaged cars wait at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup . No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars . And drought-weary Californians, who can't expect much encouragement from mountains elsewhere in the West: Snow that fills the Colorado River is lagging, too, officials said Friday. The snowpack in the Colorado and Wyoming valleys where the river originates now ranges from 51 to 79 per cent of normal, said Brian Domonkos, Colorado supervisor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey, which monitors snowfall and water availability. The Colorado River supplies water to about 40 million people and 6,300 square miles of farmland in seven states, including California. A driver stands amid vehicles involved in an accident on wrecked cars . The Rocky Mountain snow that melts into the river doesn't flow directly to California and other downstream users. Instead, it's held in a series of reservoirs that release enough water to fulfill the legal allotments to southwestern states under a series of agreements and court rulings. The reservoirs have sufficient water to provide California and other downstream states with their full shares this year and for the foreseeable future, said Matthew Allen, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the reservoir system. California also gets water from the Sierra Nevada range, where the snow cover was the lowest it has ever been in 65 years of record-keeping as of Wednesday. Warm temperatures and scarce snowfall in early March caused the snowpack in Colorado to shrink significantly. 'To see the decline that we saw at the beginning of March, that is abnormal,' Domonkos said. 'And to see it continue almost unabated, almost to now, that's quite abnormal.' Emergency personnel and tow truck drivers work to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup . A storm brought up to 11 inches of snow on Thursday and Friday to parts of the Colorado mountains and foothills, but much of it fell east of the Continental Divide and will eventually melt into the South Platte and Arkansas rivers. Preliminary readings showed the snowpack on Friday in the South Platte basin was 87 per cent of normal and 79 percent of normal in the Arkansas basin. The U.S. Drought Monitor says 40 per cent of California is in an exceptional drought, the most severe category, and another 25 per cent is in an extreme drought, the second-most severe. A pedestrian moves along a sidewalk while framed by branches covered with snow from a spring storm in Denver . A cows grazes as her calves lay next to her on a farm after a light snow, near Eldorado Springs, Colo., not far from a lagging Colorado River . Gov. Jerry Brown ordered mandatory, statewide water cutbacks by cities and towns, aiming for a 25 percent cut in water use. Extreme drought conditions also spread into Nevada and southern Oregon, along with smaller pockets in Utah and Arizona. Milder drought conditions extend across the rest of the West, except for most of Montana and Wyoming. Other states served by the Colorado River are Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Nevada.

"The jury is rapidly nearing a verdict in Aaron Hernandez's murder trial after the defense team presented their entire case in just one day. Prosecution took two months and more than 100 pieces of evidence to accuse the former New England Patriots player of killing Odin Lloyd, who was shot six times in the chest and back on June 17, 2013. Defending his not guilty plea, Hernandez's lawyers called five witnesses to testify on Monday before resting at 3pm. Following tomorrow's closing statements, the jury will deliberate on their verdict. Scroll down for video . Nearing the end: Aaron Hernandez's defense team took just one day to deliver their case against prosecutors who spent two months producing 100 pieces of evidence. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd . Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. At the time of the killing, in an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough home, the tight end had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. The defense's first witness was Dr. David Greenblatt, a professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, who testified  that the drug PCP can cause people to be suddenly violent, even days after smoking it. Hernandez's two co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, were seen smoking PCP a few days before the crime. Both men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried later. Prosecutor Patrick Bomberg went after Greenblatt's testimony, showing surveillance video of Ortiz, Wallace and Hernandez from Hernandez's home before and immediately after the killing. In the videos, the men do not appear to be acting strangely. The former New England Patriots smiles during his murder trial at the Bristol County Superior Court . The judge has said she expects closing arguments to be delivered on Tuesday or Wednesday . 'This is essentially three minutes after the murder — you'd expect to see something lingering of PCP psychosis or intoxication,' Bomberg said, asking if Greenblatt could detect such behavior. 'You just can't tell,' Greenblatt replied. Testimony by two other witnesses related to DNA on a shell casing found inside a silver Nissan Altima that Hernandez rented, which prosecutors say he used to drive Lloyd to his death. When police found the shell casing in a trash bin at a rental car agency, it was stuck to chewed blue bubble gum that also was found in the Nissan. In testing, Hernandez's DNA was found on the shell casing. The defense has argued it got there from the bubble gum. Hernandez lawyer James Sultan said he planned to call just three witnesses before resting later Monday. The judge has said she expects closing arguments to be delivered on Tuesday or Wednesday.

"Edmund Echukwu collapsed in a swimming pool and died at a 007-themed sex party last Friday . The man who died in a swimming pool at a swingers' party in an upmarket village has been named as a father-of-three. Edmund Echukwu, 35, was pulled from the water at a James Bond-themed sex party at a £3million mansion in Radlett, Hertfordshire last Friday night. Fellow revellers tried to revive him but he was pronounced dead at Watford General Hospital after emergency services were called. It is believed Mr Echukwu is a Nigerian from north London who was at his first swingers' party at the eight-bedroom house. Mr Echukwu's neighbour in Edgware, Margaret Brown, paid tribute to him today. Mrs Brown, 67, said: 'I'm devastated. He was such a sweet guy. I remember I used to talk to him a lot of the time. 'He kept himself to himself, but he used to talk to me and was very friendly. I think he was going through a difficult time. 'He was just such a gentle person. - I can't believe this has happened. Sometimes he would help me look after my disabled husband.' Mrs Brown said she believed Mr Echukwu was a care worker. She said she knew he had two sons from a previous relationship, but didn't see them very often. She added: 'He was a good-looking guy, and he always looked really slick.' Mr Echukwu had told others at the party he had three children, but there was no suggestion he was married, it was reported this morning. A 35-year-old man, named today as Edmund Echukwu, died during a sex party at this house in Hertfordshire . Witnesses said Mr Echukwu was in the water with a woman when he started getting into difficulties . He wrote about his love of football and described himself as an 'evil genius' on Twitter, according to The Sun newspaper. A post mortem examination is due to be held today, after which a coroner will open an inquest into his death. The party was one of the regular swingers' events put on by retired management consultant Richard Stanley, 66, and his partner Janet Harrison, 58. Mr Stanley said: 'I heard a shout and ran over. I dived in fully clothed, pausing only to take my iPhone out of my pocket. He was enormously heavy. 'Three of the guys pulled him out, with me pushing him from behind. They put him straight into the CPR position and tried to revive him. One of the guests was a qualified nurse.' The death happened at a swingers party run by Richard Stanley and Janet Harrison, pictured in a Channel 4 documentary. Mr Stanley said the death may have been caused by a heart attack . The mansion's owners say the pool complies with all health and safety rules and has been inspected . Mr Stanley added: 'I got straight on to 999. The call operator gave very clear instructions, which I shouted to the team performing CPR. We kept doing that until the ambulance arrived. 'Then the police turned up – there were about a dozen officers in total by the end of the night. After interviewing various people, the inspector said to me, 'this is a non-suspicious death'. It may well be that he had a heart attack.' He said guests brought their own alcohol to the parties and Mr Echukwu had 'severely dented a bottle of Jack Daniel's'. A woman who was in the pool with Mr Echukwu was left distraught by what happened, witnesses said. The event on Friday night featured 007 references including a roulette wheel, a woman covered in gold paint inspired by Goldfinger and chocolate replicas of the weapon from The Man With The Golden Gun. The property features a converted attic which Mr Stanley calls the 'dungeon in the sky'","Edmund Echukwu died in pool at swingers' party in Hertfordshire on Friday .

"Labour will today accuse the Tories of making it harder to see a GP as they attempt to put the NHS back at the centre of the election campaign. The party will launch a billboard advert using the image from the famous 1979 ‘Labour Isn’t Working’ poster, but instead it will warn: ‘The doctor can’t see you now’. The poster features the same long line of people used to illustrate dole queues under Jim Callaghan’s ailing government, but this time places them outside a waiting room. Scroll down for video . The Labour party will launch a billboard advert using an image from the famous 1979 ‘Labour Isn’t Working’ poster, but instead it will warn: ‘The doctor can’t see you now’ Labour will warn that new official figures show 600 fewer GP surgeries across England are now open in the evening and weekends compared to the last election. It will also claim nearly two million more patients are unhappy with doctors opening hours compared to three years ago as they lose access to appointments outside of office hours. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will say the figures are a timely reminder of the ‘NHS crisis’ as patients turn to stretched A&E departments as they struggle to get an appointment with their GP on the first working day after the Easter break. But the Tories last night claimed many of the problems stemmed from Labour’s 2004 changes to GP contracts that allowed them to opt out of providing care outside office hours. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said that the government had already begun tackling the issue by making extra funding available, which will mean the number of GP surgeries opening longer will have increased when the next set of figures are published. As it unveils its new poster, Labour will release a new document that it claims shows how David Cameron has failed to implement seven-day opening for GP surgeries as he promised before the last election. The original poster depicts a queue to an Unemployment Office . Mr Cameron repeated the pledge at last week’s televised leaders debate, claiming he wanted GPs to open ‘all the way through the week’. But official figures show the proportion of GP practices offering extended hours has fallen from 77 per cent in 2009 to 72 per cent in the latest figures for 2013/14. Labour said this means 590 fewer GP surgeries are now open at evenings and weekends compared to its last year in office. NHS England’s annual GP-Patient survey of 900,000 patients also shows growing unhappiness with GP surgery opening hours between 2012 and the latest figures for 2015, according to the party. It says there has been an increase of 1.9 million in the number of people saying their surgery is not open at convenient times from 8,393,162 to 10,261,435. Mr Burnham will say: ‘Today, across the country, people will face the frustration of joining a queue to see their GP – in some places the lines will go out of the surgery door. ‘After five years of David Cameron, patients at hundreds of surgeries can no longer get a GP appointment when they need one. ‘At the last Election, he promised to open GP surgeries seven days a week but the reality is that millions more patients are unhappy with opening hours. ‘It is now harder to get an appointment from Monday to Friday too. ‘One of Cameron’s first acts as Prime Minister was to cut Labour’s extended opening hours scheme and scrap our guarantee of an appointment within 48 hours. If David Cameron gets back in, his extreme spending cuts mean he can’t protect the NHS and the queues outside GP surgeries will get even worse.’ Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher acknowledges a crowd on October 13, 1989, at the end of the Conservative Party conference in Blackpool . Mr Hunt last night said that when the 2014/15 figures for GPs opening at evening and weekends are published they will show that the number has actually increased since 2010 because of new initiatives. He said: ‘Labour’s figures are wrong. The Prime Minister’s Challenge Fund already covers 1,100 practices and helps 7.5 million patients see a GP in the evenings and at weekends. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will say the figures are a timely reminder of the ‘NHS crisis’ ‘We are extending this scheme to cover over 1,400 additional practices, helping 10 million extra people by this time next year. ‘The next Conservative Government will deliver a truly seven-day NHS, putting right a problem which began with Labour’s disastrous 2004 GP contract.’ A survey by the Mail last year found that nationwide, only one in three patients can secure a same-day GP appointment. More than one in five have to wait longer than a week, while 4 per cent have to wait two to three weeks. A number of surgeries were found to have long lines of patients waiting outside at 7am in a bid to try and get same-day appointments. The Labour poster is based on the famous 1979 poster that turned Saatchi and Saatchi from unknowns into household names. The agency masterminded all three of Margaret Thatcher’s election victories for the Conservatives. In 1999 ‘Labour Isn’t Working’ was voted poster of the century by a jury of ad people assembled by the advertising industry magazine Campaign. Saatchi and Saatchi, which is no longer run by brothers Maurice and Charles Saatchi, was hired by Gordon Brown to handle Labour’s advertising at the last election, but it is not working for the party this time. Labour said its latest poster had been designed in-house.","600 fewer GPs  open in the evenings and at weekends, Labour has claimed .

"Two Germanwings flights have been forced to make emergency landings in two days - one over a suspected oil leak and another after a passenger and a cabin crew member fell ill. Today, Germanwings flight 4U814 to Venice was diverted to Stuttgart as the Airbus A319 aircraft appeared to be losing oil, the airline said in a statement. The flight, which had 123 passengers and five crew members on board, took off from Cologne at 9.55am local time. Germanwings, a budget unit of German airline Lufthansa , has been in the spotlight after one of its planes crashed into a mountain in the French Alps last week, killing everyone on board. Scroll down for video . Germanwings said a passenger and a flight attendant suffered 'an acute feeling of sickness' The carrier said the pilots shut off one of the aircraft's engines and headed for Stuttgart when the problem was detected. 'This is a standard safety procedure. It was not an emergency landing,' it said, adding the aircraft was being examined by technicians. Yesterday, another Germanwings plane was forced to make an unscheduled landing in Venice after a passenger and a flight attendant fell ill during the flight, the budget carrier says. A statement issued by the Cologne-based airline said the pair required medical treatment for 'an acute feeling of sickness', disputing reports that the twin-engine plane landed after a nervous passenger suffered a panic attack. The unscheduled stop occurred less than two weeks after a Germanwings plane crashed into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. In yesterday's incident, an Airbus A319 was carrying 145 passengers and five crew members from Hanover, Germany to Rome when it diverted to Venice. Flight 4U3882 was nearing the conclusion of its one hour and 40 minute journey when it turned around north-east of Bologna and landed at Venice Marco Polo Airport. The Airbus A319 turned around north-east of Bologna and landed at Venice Marco Polo Airport . Passenger Eugenio Bartolini, a schoolteacher from Rome, told Italian newspaper Il Messaggero that a woman seated in the row behind him was assessed by medics because she had 'a fear of flying' and was 'apprehensive'. He said the plane departed 10 minutes behind schedule, but nothing was out of the ordinary until it flew over the Alps, turned around and began to descend. Passengers didn't know what was happening until they landed in Venice and the captain made an announcement over the tannoy. Mr Bartolini, as quoted by The Local, told Il Messaggero: 'The captain, speaking in English, told us that two people, a member of the crew and a passenger, had been taken ill and that was why he had decided to stop at Venice.' Passengers disembarked and waited inside the terminal while the ill passenger and flight attendant were checked over. Germanwings told MailOnline Travel that the flight attendant was unable to reboard, so a replacement aircraft with an additional crew member had to be flown to Venice to pick up the passengers. Once the plane arrived they continued their journey to Rome, where the flight landed about five hours late at Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport. After landing at Venice's seaside airport passengers had to wait for a replacement aircraft to arrive (file photo) In a statement, Germanwings told MailOnline Travel: 'The reason [for the unscheduled landing] was that one passenger and one flight attendant had to go into medical treatment due to acute feeling of sickness. 'A replacing plane coming from Hamburg [transported] the passengers to Rome. Due to one crew member less a continuation of flight 4U3882 is not possible since according to legal regularities an Airbus A319 always needs three crew members.' Germanwings was a little-known subsidiary of Lufthansa until flight 4U9525 crashed into the French Alps while flying from Barcelona to Dusseldorf on 24 March. Investigators believe 27-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the Airbus A320 after locking the captain out of the cockpit. Data from the second black box recorder found that Lubitz used the automatic pilot to put the plane into a descent and accelerated the doomed airliner into the mountain.","Germanwings flight 4U3882 was flying from Hanover, Germany to Rome .

"Humans may have been lighting fires since we lived in caves and dined on woolly mammoth, but now there’s 21st century way to create a flame. A new lighter uses electricity to ignite, and it’s claimed to be the first flameless gadget of its kind. The device, called the Illume ArcLighter, creates a ‘super high-intensity’ electrical arc and contains a rechargeable lithium-ion battery so users will never run out of fuel at a tricky moment again. A bright idea: A new lighter (pictured) uses electricity to ignite candles and paper for example, and it’s claimed to be the first flameless gadget of its kind . Its inventors, based in Edmonton, Canada, are raising money to put the lighter into production on Kickstarter and have almost doubled their goal. Instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters, the Illume ArcLighter creates a ‘super high-intensity’ electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes. Flameless: Instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters, the Illume ArcLighter creates a ‘super high-intensity’ electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes. Its inventors say it lights in any direction and is rechargeable, among other qualities shown above . Safer? Instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters, the Illume ArcLighter creates a ‘super high-intensity’ electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes. This means there is no flare ups (pictured) like with matches or conventional lighters that can easily burn fingers . Illume ArcLighter replaces a traditional flame with a high intensity electric arc that focuses its energy at the tip. It doesn’t need to be refilled with fuel but is instead powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery. 'Simply place the Illume ArcLighter on its dedicated USB powered charging dock and it will be ready for the next moment you need it,’ the company says. ‘When electricity jumps between the two conducting electrodes at the tip of the lighter, it produces what is known as an electric arc. ‘The air between these electrodes becomes ionised, creating the brilliant visual arc which produces the high heat.' ‘When electricity jumps between the two conducting electrodes at the tip of the lighter, it produces what is known as an electric arc,' the company explains. ‘The air between these electrodes becomes ionised, creating the brilliant visual arc which produces the high heat.’ While the arc may be smaller than an open flame, it is much hotter, so it lights wicks more quickly and can be used from any angle. The company says: ‘Unlike a regular lighter, there is no flame that can flare-up when positioned upside down. ‘You can freely use the Illume ArcLighter in any direction. Even completely vertically.' The lighter has flame-proof ceramic tips with a zinc alloy cover and a plastic body. It focuses its heat at the tip so it won’t leave sooty marks behind. Convenient: The device (pictured) has a built-in lithium ion battery and comes with a USB-powered dock (also shown) so it can be easily recharged. The lighter has flame-proof ceramic tips with a zinc alloy cover and a plastic body .

"The UK is to open its first three proton beam therapy centres after cancer-stricken five-year-old Ashya King made a miracle recovery after receiving the treatment. Cardiff-based Proton Partners International Ltd, is to open the treatment centres, which will be available to NHS cancer patients, in Cardiff, London and Northumberland by 2017, with the first in the Welsh capital being operational by next year. The announcement comes just weeks after the parents of brain cancer sufferer Ashya told of how he was given the 'all-clear' after receiving proton bean therapy at a centre in Prague. Scroll down for video . Five-year-old Ashya King, pictured in October, who suffered from brain cancer but has recently been given the all-clear after receiving proton beam therapy . Three centres in the UK in Cardiff, London and Northumberland, are set to open offering proton beam therapy, which Ashya, pictured, received . Both Brett and Naghmeh King sparked an international manhunt last year after taking their son out of hospital in Southampton, without doctors' consent. Mr and Mrs King had wanted their son to have the cutting-edge therapy instead of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fearing that Ashya would be taken away from them and given the treatment, the family fled to Spain before travelling to the Czech Republic to the Proton Therapy Centre. Now, a group called Proton Partners International has now been formed in the UK following discussions between Professor Sir Chris Evans, the life sciences entrepreneur and UK life sciences and healthcare investors. They have committed almost £100million equity finance into the company. Professor Gordon McVie, senior consultant at the European Institute of Oncology, has been appointed chairman of the group, and Professor Karol Sikora has agreed to become chief medical adviser to the company, alongside a range of renowned cancer and healthcare experts. Ashya, with his parents Brett and Naghmeh. The Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment . Professor McVie said: 'This is an exciting and important development of the provision of cancer treatment in the UK. As things stand, patients who benefit from this treatment have to go abroad for treatment, often at great expense to the NHS. 'The creation of these centres will go a long way to ensuring the very best of treatment is available in the UK.' While Sir Chris added: 'We are delighted that the UK's first centre will be based in Cardiff and Wales Life Sciences Investment Fund is proud to support this breakthrough. While conventional radiotherapy uses high energy beams of radiation to destroy cancerous cells, often damaging surrounding tissue, proton beam therapy aims radiation directly at the tumour. Because it is so highly targeted it means it can avoid healthy tissue, particularly tissues and organs behind the tumour. While radiotherapy can lead to side effects such as nausea and can sometimes disrupt how some organs function, proton beam therapy has a lower risk of side effects. This means it is effective for treating cancer that affects critical areas, such as brain cancer. However, Cancer Research UK estimates that only one in 100 people would be suitable for proton beam therapy and there are also concerns that the long-term impact of the nascent procedure is not yet known. The only proton beam facility currently in operation is at the Clatterbridge Centre for Cancer NHS Foundation Trust in the Wirral, Merseyside, which delivers 'low energy' therapy for rare cancers around the eye. The NHS currently pays for those deemed appropriate for proton beam therapy to go to the United States for treatment. They must be assessed by a panel who may decide patients are not suitable if there is unlikely to be a clinical benefit from the treatment. More than 400 patients have been sent abroad since 2008 - most of these children - at an average cost of £100,000 per patient. 'There are more than 150,000 people treated for cancer each year in the UK and the demand for treatment is growing. 'It is anticipated that NHS demand for proton beam therapy abroad will reach 1,500 patients by 2017. Proton Partners will be able to play a leading part in helping meet demand in the UK as of next year.' In addition to state of the art Proton Partners' treatment services, the Cardiff centre will provide conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy and supportive care. Proton beam therapy is a highly-targeted type of radiotherapy that can treat hard-to-reach cancers, such as spinal tumours, with a lower risk of damaging the surrounding tissue and causing side effects. The Government has announced that it is to create two NHS proton beam therapy units which will open in 2018. The Kings faced every parent's worst nightmare when their young son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms. But the family's own research into his condition led them to question the need for normal NHS radiotherapy - which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue and lead to lifelong disabilities. And despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy, the Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. They were arrested by European authorities and banned from seeing their sick son, with a High Court judge only approving the move to Prague after they had been released. When he finally arrived at the centre in September last year, Ashya was so sick he was unable to move and had to be fed by tubes. But in October, he was pictured smiling and waving to cameras, thrilled at the prospect of returning to the family holiday home in Malaga, Spain, and finishing his treatment there with his parents and older brother Naveed. Since then, he has continued to make encouraging progress and is enjoying a more normal life. However, despite the treatment and his recovery, Ashya's parents say they fear their children will be taken into care if they return to the UK, his grandmother said last month.","The three centres are planned for Cardiff, London and Northumberland .

"They used to be given away as a method companies used to let potential new customers sample their products and - hopefully - come back for more. Now showbags cost anywhere from $10 to $30 and are among the mounting prices parents are paying for their annual trip to the Easter Show - along with $40 entrance fees and $15 rides. But are the contents of the bags worth the prices being paid? The official website of the Sydney Royal Easter Show lists the retail value of show bag contents, and reveals that at least one of the bags cost more than it would to buy the items outright. The 2015 Sydney Royal Easter show, which opened to the public last Thursday 26 March . The Cowboy Bag includes a toy sheriff's hat, a vest and a red bandana, as well as a toy pump action shotgun and a pack of plastic pistols and handcuffs. The price is $26. But the site lists the retail value of the items as $23.85 - and that's without the added burden of entrance fees, rides and long queues at the show. Other bags offer some rather trivial savings. At the lower end of the price scale, buyers of the Fruit Tingles bag will get three 34 gram packets of the disc-shaped lollies, one 34 gram packet of fruit pastilles, two Redskins, two lollipops and two Milko sticks for $5. That's a saving of $0.10 on the listed total retail value is $5.10. The Aussie Bogan bag - if that's your thing - offers better value. For $15 buyers will get a drinking cap with Aussie flag, a mullet wig, fake bogan teeth, Aussie pride stubby holder, and an infatable Aussie flag bat and bar poster, altogether worth $50.90. Capping it off is a 'discount amusement ride voucher' with a listed value of $0.00. One bag on the site seems to offer unbelievable value, literally. The Rockstar bag includes an inflatable guitar, toy trilby and some items including a tinsel hair clip the site lists as worth $395, giving the bag a total retail value of $413.70 for the bargain price of $10. A quick online scan reveals the hair clip price is almost certainly a typo. The official website displays the retail value of the showbags contents, reveal that some of the bags cost more than it would to buy the items outright-such as the Cowboy Bag (L)-while others are a mere 10 cents less than their retail value-like the Fruit Tingles Bag .

"Expectant mom AmberMarie Irving-Elkins felt a few contractions on Thursday morning but thought she had enough time to run a few last errands before the arrival of her baby. But the little boy, Malachi, had other ideas. She was in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in Los Angeles to pay a fine on Thursday when she suddenly knew he was coming - and there was no way she'd make it to hospital in time. 'I had that contraction that hit me and brought me to knees,' the mom-of-three told KTLA. Scroll down for video . Surprise: Baby Malachi Elkins was born in the hallways in a Los Angeles courthouse on Thursday morning as his mother, AmberMarie Irving-Elkins, was there to pay a fine. The baby boy was healthy . Clerks rushed to her side and alerted officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department who were inside the courthouse. Deputy Marquette Oliver ran over to assist her. 'She was like, 'I'm having the baby right now',' Oliver recalled. 'I was like, ""Hold on! Hold on!""' But there was no stopping baby Malachi. 'I had to push,' Irving-Elkins said, describing how she laid on the floor. 'That's when Sheriff Oliver said, ""Don't push, don't push!"" and I said, ""Oh, I've got to push"".' Relief: AmberMarie Irving-Elkins laughs about the birth while in hospital with her healthy newborn son . Helping hand: Deputy Marquette Oliver was in the courthouse and told her to stop pushing - but she could not . At the ready: He shows how he bent down to catch the baby boy as he slipped onto the floor . She pulled down her trousers and the baby's head was visible, Deputy Oliver said. So he bent down and caught the baby as he was born. 'It was all over in about five minutes,' said Associated Press reporter Anthony McCartney, who happened to be there. 'She gave birth in the hallway, pretty much unassisted.' It was the officers who told Irving-Elkins that she had given birth to a boy. Officers had surrounded the mother and blocked her off with cardboard boxes in a bid to give her some privacy in the busy hallways. McCartney said people started cheering when they realized a baby had been born. 'I don't think they even realized what was going on until they saw this woman had a baby, obviously a newborn, on her chest,' the reporter said. 'They cheered and clapped and everything.' Doing well: Malachi's mother said she thinks his birthplace means he might be a judge or a lawyer . Family: The mother and son were rushed to hospital, where they were met by his dad and older siblings . Scene: She was feeling contractions before she went into the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, pictured, but thought she had time to run some errands before heading to the hospital - but Malachi had other ideas . 'Mom & baby fine!' the Special Enforcement Bureau of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department tweeted Thursday, along with a photo of the healthy baby boy inside the courthouse. They were then taken to hospital, where Malachi met his dad, Nom, and two older siblings, who were grateful for the officers' actions. 'I do want to thank them for stepping in and stealing my shine,' Nom joked with KABC. 'No. Thank you. I'm glad he's here. He's healthy. We're happy. Everything's good.'

"US President Barack Obama said on Saturday that diplomacy was the best option to deal with Iran's contested nuclear program, two days after the conclusion of a framework agreement with Tehran. Iran and six world powers determined the outlines of a landmark agreement which would curb Iran's nuclear program and potentially lift economic sanctions. As Obama gears up to sell US skeptics on the deal, he said he is convinced talks are the best way forward. Scroll down for video . US President Barack Obama says diplomacy is the best way to deal with Iran . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and staff watch a tablet in Lausanne as U.S. President Barack Obama makes a state address on the status of the Iran nuclear program . 'As President and Commander in Chief, I firmly believe that the diplomatic option - a comprehensive, long-term deal like this - is by far the best option,' Obama said in his weekly address. Explaining that he expects a 'robust debate' on the deal in the United States, Obama said he will keep Congress apprised of the ""substance of the deal."" Many of Obama's Republican opponents in Congress have been skeptical of a deal with Iran and suggested the US may be giving too much away in its negotiations. Echoing comments he made hours after the announcement of the agreement, Obama highlighted the rigorous inspections to which Tehran will be subject. 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it. If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it,' he said. 'So this deal is not based on trust, it’s based on unprecedented verification.' According to outline text agreed to between Tehran and the P5+1 group -- the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany -- Iran must significantly reduce its number of centrifuges in exchange for a suspension of sanctions. The outline was a major breakthrough in a 12-year international crisis over Iran's nuclear program, but the final deal has yet to be reached. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday this new agreement would 'threaten the very survival of the state of Israel' Iran's arch-foe Israel, widely assumed to have nuclear weapons of its own, reacted strongly against the deal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying if the text becomes finalized it would threaten the survival of the state of Israel. ‘This deal would legitimize Iran’s nuclear program, bolster Iran’s economy and increase Iran’s aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond,’ the prime minister said. ‘It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war.’ Other critics including Saudi Arabia and Republicans in the US say the deal leaves scope for Iran to cheat. Barack Obama, however, has hailed the agreement struck after tortuous negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland, as a ‘historic understanding’. There are still many details to be thrashed out before the deal is due to be signed on June 30, including the pace at which sanctions will be lifted and what happens if Iran is found to have breached the terms.","US President Barack Obama said on Saturday that diplomacy was the best option to deal with Iran's contested nuclear program .

"Big Brother star Pete Bennett, who won the TV programme in 2006, has revealed he is now homeless. The 33 year old from Brighton's life went rapidly downhill after he finished first in the seventh series of the Channel 4 show nine years ago. Despite being given £100,000 of prize money and releasing a successful autobiography, Pete is now broke and living off the charity of friends. Scroll down for video . Pete Bennett appeared on Jeremy Kyle today to reveal that he is now homeless . Speaking on the Jeremy Kyle show today, the star revealed that he doesn't have a roof over his head and spends each night sofa surfing. He believes that finding fame on Big Brother kick started a range of problems that led to a dependency on the Class B drug ketamine. He said:'I had all of that money and I didn't know what to do with it – I put it on the wrong things. 'The fame pushed me in a way that I didn't want to go.' Pete's entry picture for Big Brother . Pete continued: 'I first got into drugs 15 years ago, I've always been the last man standing at a party but then I became addicted to ketamine. 'I couldn’t go out without doing it. It became a habit and I did it every day. 'I couldn't go anywhere without getting given stuff. I don’t want to know how much I spent on it.' It is an issue that has also affected many of his friends - in the last nine years since becoming famous, seven of his friends have died from drug-related incidents. Pete's drug addiction wasn't his only problem though - he believes that his appearance on the reality show meant that he found it impossible to get a job or being taken seriously for his music after he left the house. He said: 'The work dried up pretty fast. No one would touch me with a barge pole because I was on Big Brother. 'When I left the house I was led down the garden path with a lot of things. 'I felt like I was not being allowed to do what I wanted - I was a puppet.' Pete Bennett leaves the Big Brother House as the winner during the final of Big Brother Seven on August 18, 2006 . Although Pete has had a tumultuous time since leaving the house, one area where he has made great strides is overcoming his Tourette's Syndrome. The star claims that when he was younger, he had one of the worst cases of the condition in Europe. On the show, he would involuntarily hit his throat, twitch and shout out swear words, particularly the word 'w*****s'. But during his appearance on Jeremy Kyle, Pete's behaviour was far more controlled. Although he had the occasional twitch and still appeared quite hyperactive, he held back from shouting out any unplanned words. Unfortunately, as well as he battle with drugs, Pete's personal life and career prospects have also been marred with difficulty over the last nine years. A week before he left the Big Brother house in August 2006, Pete started an ill-fate relationship with fellow contestant Nikki Grahame but it quickly fizzled out. A month later Nikki revealed that Pete had called time on the romance. Nikki Grahame and Pete arrive for the National Television Awards in 2006. The couple started a relationship after leaving the Big Brother  house . Pete at a signing of his book in November 2006 . Pete then started dating one of his good friends, Gemma Costin, better known as Cherry, who he'd had a secret crush on for three years. The pair continued to date for eight years before marrying in a fake ceremony at Glastonbury festival in 2011, before sealing the deal with an official ceremony on the reality show Four Weddings in early 2014. But last  September he revealed in a Facebook post that they were getting divorced after just six months of marriage. After years of running from his problems by getting high on drugs, Pete finally decided to seek proper help by getting in contact with a drugs counselor a few years ago. He said: 'You don't know you're out of control until it suddenly hits you. 'When I went to get proper help for my addiction, this drug worker started to ask me about loss and I talked to him about all of the friends I’d had who died. 'I hadn’t been dealing with it. I was dealing with it by taking Ketamine and not dealing with it. 'I had to deal with my friends deaths and that's what got me off the Ketamine.' Pete at the opening night of Glastonbury last year . Since getting clean, Pete admits that he has relapsed but states that he is now back on track. He said: ' I took Ketamine again and I relapsed but I hated it, I didn’t like being disassociated. 'I like being here now and being able to chat to people. I'm living my life now the best I can. 'I'm not Perfect Pete anymore, I’m just Pete.' The star is now trying to get his life back together and is attempting to make his name as an actor. He said: 'I do wish I'd done things differently but I've got a plan. 'I’ve got into acting, I'm doing loads of films and working my way up the ladder. 'My Tourette’s has calmed down so I thought, why not give it a chance. We have to start somewhere.

"David Cameron has brushed off criticism that he is too posh, insisting he will not change the way he acts or speaks to win voters. The Prime Minister is apparently so proud to be posh he was happy to be pictured eating a hotdog with a knife and fork. The bizarre dining etiquette during a campaign visit to Dorset was almost certainly designed to avoid a repeat of Ed Miliband's disastrous attempt at eating a bacon sandwich. Scroll down for video . David Cameron ate his hotdog with cutlery as he enjoyed lunch with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota in the sunshine during a visit to Poole in Dorset . It seems likely that Mr Cameron was trying to avoid the fate of Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was much mocked for his attempt to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year . Few people can appear attractive while eating in public, but on the campaign trail a combination of hunger and not wishing to cause offence to hosts means it can be tricky to avoid. Mr Cameron's pitstop at a garden in Poole, Dorset yesterday include a spot of a lunch. The Tory leader loaded his plate with potato salad, cucumber, tomato and a hotdog before settling down next to Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota. But he surprised onlookers with his eating style, picking up a knife and fork to chop the hotdog. The PM has a chequered history with hotdogs. In 2010 he caused offence on a visit to New York when he asked for a plain sausage, without even onions. And in March 2012 he was said to have tried eating one sideways while at a basketball game with President Obama. He also sparked a mini-storm after opting for ketchup of mustard, the condiment of choice for many Americans. The Prime Minister obviously enjoyed his lunch, and was pictured leaning back in his chair in the sunshine . In a new interview the Old Etonian insists he has never tried to hide his privileged upbringing, and refuses to change the way he speaks or behaves . While aides may worry about the impression Mr Cameron gave by eating his BBQ food with cutlery, the man himself is unconcerned. In an interview to be broadcast tonight, he makes clear he is not going to change the way he behaves to hide his 'poshness'. The Old Etonian insists he has never tried to hide his privileged upbringing. He tells ITV's Tonight programme: 'I went to a very posh school, I had a very privileged upbringing with parents who were incredibly loving and brilliant.

"Nigel Farage attacked the high cost of health service treatment for foreigners with HIV in Thursday's General Election debate. The latest official figures show that more than half of those newly diagnosed with HIV in Britain – where their country of origin is known – were born overseas . When Nigel Farage attacked the high cost of health service treatment for foreigners with HIV it was guaranteed to provoke controversy. Instantly the Ukip leader was accused of ‘dangerous scaremongering’. But, while some of his claims were overstated, the latest official figures show that more than half of those newly diagnosed with HIV in Britain – where their country of origin is known – were born overseas. Mr Farage said on Thursday night’s televised debate: ‘Here’s a fact and I’m sure that other people will be mortified that I dare to talk about it. ‘There are 7,000 diagnoses in this country every year for people who are HIV positive. It’s not a good place for any of them to be, I know, but 60 per cent of them are not British nationals. ‘You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 a year per patient. ‘I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband branded the comments ‘disgusting’ and former England captain Gary Lineker wrote on Twitter: ‘Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!’ Yesterday Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also took to Twitter to condemn the remarks, saying: ‘Farage’s comments about foreign people with HIV were simply vile and desperate. Politics of the lowest form.’ Mr Miliband also tweeted: ‘He should be ashamed. The fact he isn’t says so much.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) branded the comments ‘disgusting’ and former England captain Gary Lineker (right) wrote on Twitter: ‘Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!’ But last night Mr Farage stood by his claims, telling ITV news they were ‘cold, hard facts’. The figures on HIV and foreigners are notoriously hard to calculate because they could include British nationals who were born abroad. According to Public Health England, there were 6,000 diagnoses of HIV in the UK in 2013. Where the country of origin is known, 54 per cent of new diagnoses were foreign-born patients. However, the same body estimated that 76 per cent of all newly diagnosed HIV infections among gay or bisexual men and 57 per cent among heterosexual men and women in 2013 probably happened in the UK. The cost of antiretroviral drugs for HIV patients per year has been put between £10,000 and £16,000 by the National Aids Trust. Aids charity Avert has estimated that the cost of treating someone with HIV in the UK is around £18,000 per year, although this varies depending on the type and number of drugs taken and the stage of HIV infection. Each HIV patient from overseas – even if here illegally, a failed asylum seeker or a student on a temporary visa – is entitled to free treatment on the health service. This ‘free to all’ policy was introduced in 2012 to try to stop the spread of the virus in the UK. Officials raised concerns about the risk of health tourism by HIV patients in a Department of Health report on their treatment, which was published in 2012 to explain the change in policy. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also took to Twitter to condemn the remarks, saying: ‘Farage’s comments about foreign people with HIV were simply vile and desperate. Politics of the lowest form’ It said: ‘Given the high cost of ARVs [antiretroviral drugs], for all overseas visitors we recommend that advance prescribing of ARVs is for a maximum of one month in the first instance. ‘Whilst it is unlikely that people with HIV, or at risk of HIV, will visit the UK solely for the purpose of receiving free HIV treatment, this guidance … makes clear the arrangements that will enable monitoring to ensure this is not the case.’ Mr Farage’s comments on HIV treatment were believed to be aimed at reviving Ukip’s core vote, as part of a strategy nicknamed ‘shock and awful’. He had originally intended to warn about the relatively high proportion of migrants with tuberculosis before realising that HIV drugs are more expensive, sources alleged. During the party leaders’ debate, Leanne Wood, leader of Welsh Nationalists Plaid Cymru, won the first significant applause of the night when she attacked Mr Farage’s comments on HIV treatment. The Conservatives would not go into coalition with Ukip after the election, Michael Gove said yesterday. A day after George Osborne refused to rule out a deal with Nigel Farage, the Tory chief whip told the BBC: ‘A coalition with Ukip? Nein, danke! Nein, danke is German for No, thank you.’ But Labour said the answer was still not definite enough for them. Andy Burnham has written to David Cameron asking for a cast-iron guarantee there would be no Tory-Ukip coalition. Mr Farage has said he is not interested in a formal coalition. But last night he described the Prime Minister as ‘somebody we can sit down and talk to’ in the event of a hung parliament. One Ukip condition would be an in/out EU referendum by the end of 2015. She said: ‘This kind of scaremongering is dangerous, it divides communities and it creates stigma to people who are ill, and I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself.’ George Osborne, the Chancellor, asked about it afterwards, said that he would ‘not dignify that with an answer’ and Mr Miliband tweeted yesterday that the comment was ‘disgusting’. It comes after Ukip’s share of the vote in recent polls has eroded significantly from highs of 19 per cent late last year, to just 10 per cent in several polls over the past month. Mr Farage has claimed he would stand down if he does not win the seat he is contesting in Thanet South. Ukip’s first MP, Douglas Carswell, refused to specifically endorse Mr Farage’s remarks yesterday. The former Conservative, standing in Clacton, Essex, added: ‘It is sensible and reasonable to say we want a national health service, not an international health service, and that’s all I’m going to say.’ He insisted the party was not split and added: ‘I thought Nigel was superb in the debates. His answers were credible.’ A half-time poll from ComRes/ITV News showed 24 per cent of voters giving Mr Farage the lead in the debate, but almost as many (22 per cent) thought he was also the worst of the seven leaders. Mr Carswell’s father, Wilson, was a respected physician and fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons who diagnosed the first confirmed cases of HIV in Uganda in the 1970s. He was the inspiration for the character of Dr Nicholas Garrigan in the Oscar-winning movie The Last King of Scotland. Mr Farage appeared to embarrass Mr Carswell when he won his seat in a by-election in October by calling for a ban on people with HIV entering the UK. Mr Carswell said at the time: ‘No-one is seriously suggesting we should screen people for HIV coming in.’ Dr Rosemary Gillespie, chief executive of HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘It was great to see so many people express outrage after Farage’s comments last night about the numbers of people in the UK with HIV who were not born here. ‘HIV is a public health issue in the UK and globally. If we do not take an inclusive approach and provide treatment for people who need it, we will never prevent onward transmission. ‘HIV doesn’t discriminate and politicians shouldn’t either. Such ill-informed and discriminatory comments generate stigma, and make it harder to encourage people to take a test and stay safe.’ Ed Miliband spoke of himself as a future prime minister ten times during the leaders’ debate on television. In his opening statement, the Labour leader said: ‘If I’m prime minister, I’ll raise the minimum wage to £8 an hour and ban exploitative zero-hours contracts so we’ll reward hard work again. ‘If I’m prime minister, I’ll rescue our NHS, hiring more doctors and nurses. ‘If I’m prime minister, I’ll build a future for all of our young people.’ On migration, he said: ‘If I’m elected as prime minister, we’ll put in place new rules which say that if you come to this country, you won’t get benefits for at least the first two years.’ On the failure of some employers to pay the minimum wage, he said: ‘We’ve got to deal with it, and if I’m prime minister, I will.’ Mr Miliband used the words ‘prime minister’ five more times, including in his summing-up.","More than half of those newly diagnosed are born overseas, figures show .

"A car salesman who was high on cocaine murdered a prostitute by stabbing her 44 times before raping two more women at his home while his partner enjoyed a Christmas night out. Steven Mathieson, 38, stabbed prostitute Luciana Maurer dozens of times in a frenzied and unprovoked attack at his home Falkirk, Stirlingshire last December. As she lay dead on the floor, the father-of-two called two more vice girls over to his family home and raped them before they managed to flee while still naked. His young son was asleep in the bedroom next door while he carried out the horrific crimes. Mathieson, who has previously been described as of 'impeccable character', pleaded guilty to murder and rape at the High Court in Glasgow today and now faces life in prison. Steven Mathieson, 38 (left), stabbed prostitute Luciana Maurer, 23, (right) dozens of times in a frenzied and unprovoked attack at his home Falkirk, Stirlingshire last December, while his partner was on a night out . The court heard how the crimes occurred while he was left babysitting his young children while their mother - his partner of 10 years - enjoyed a night out. The family had spent the day Christmas shopping on December 4 last year and enjoyed a meal before returning home. Mathieson - described as being his 'normal self' - then dropped one of his children at his grandmother's home before returning to his house – in a quiet residential neighbourhood - with his younger son. His partner left the property for a work night out and he sent her a text which said: 'Have a good night. Love you'. However, soon after he had put their young son to bed, Mathieson used his phone to arrange for sex while his partner was out. The court heard he regularly used sex phone lines but hid it from his long-term partner. Ms Maurer, a Romanian-born mother, was one of the escorts who arranged to meet him. The 23-year-old, who had arrived in Scotland just a few days earlier having moved up from London, arrived at his property at about 11pm. However, within minutes, Mathieson – who was high on cocaine - stabbed her 44 times and cut her throat. Mathieson then sent a text to his partner which said: 'Sorry xx'. His young child was asleep in the room next door while he carried out the harrowing crimes. The court heard how Ms Maurer had defensive-type injuries suggesting she had tried to fend off her killer. Two other escorts, who Mathieson had summoned, then arrived at his home, completely oblivious to the murder which had taken place. Ms Maurer, a Romanian-born mother, was stabbed 44 times by Mathieson and had her throat cut . When they arrived, they found Mathieson casually sitting on his sofa in the living room before he led them upstairs. Describing the horror that then met them, prosecutor Jane Farquharson said: 'Mathieson went into the bedroom first. 'He put on the light and hung back at the door whilst the women walked in. 'As soon as they entered the bedroom, they saw the deceased, lying on her back and on top of the double bed.' Mathieson then grabbed two knives from a set of drawers before blocking the door. One of the women begged Mathieson to let them go but he grabbed their mobile phones and flung them away, the court heard. He initially tormented them by stroking them with the knives before threatening to kill them if they did not follow his demands. Miss Farquharson: 'He told both to remove their clothing and to dance for him. 'In fear of what he might do and, with the body of the deceased lying on the bed in front of them, each did as they were told.' Mathieson went on to rape the pair, aged 26 and 22 - including attacking one after ordering her to lie beside Ms Maurer's dead body. The pair were trapped in the bedroom for 10 minutes before he ordered them downstairs. Once there, Mathieson continued to humiliate them before raping them again. Miss Farquharson said: 'Over the course of the assault in the living room, he told them that his son was asleep in the bedroom upstairs. 'He appeared to have an awareness of what he had done advising both: 'I'm going to be many years in prison because I killed that girl. 'I've done this to show my wife something.' Mathieson then went to a window thinking his partner had returned and, sensing an opportunity to escape, the women ran for the door. Mathieson tried to chase them, striking one on the leg with a knife, but they managed to escape and ran to a nearby flat where a woman came to their aid. Miss Farquharson: 'Both repeatedly stated their thanks and asked for help. They were crying and appeared to be terrified.' After the women escaped, Mathieson dialled 999 himself and told the operator: 'I've been high on drugs and I've killed a prostitute. 'Tell the officers I am not aggressive. I'm sitting on the couch. I had two other girls, but I've let them go.' Mathieson was still sitting in his living room when police turned up. He got down on his knees and held out his hands when officers arrested him. Mathieson, a car sales manager, carried out the horrific crimes at his home in Falkirk, Stirlingshire (above), while his partner went on a work night out. He is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to murder and rape . His partner, clueless as to what had happened in her absence, arrived back at the family property at about 2am. She was described as being 'hysterical' upon learning what had happened. Mathieson, a sales manager, was remanded in custody at the hearing today and will return to the dock next month. His court appearance was briefly interrupted today after he began crying hysterically and loudly retching as if he was going to be sick. In what is rarely seen in court, his QC Donald Findlay left his own seat to sit beside Mathieson in the dock and speak to him briefly before the case continued. The court was given no reason for what caused him to carry out the horrific murder and rapes, but it is believed his drug problem may have been a factor. In the spring of last year, he had started attending Cocaine Anonymous having built up a large debt. His girlfriend was not aware of the drug habit until finding out about the cash he owed, the court heard. Mr Findlay, defending, said that before his crimes Mathieson had been of 'impeccable character', but said he now accepted 'full responsibility' for his actions. Judge Lord Bannatyne deferred sentencing until May 7. Speaking after the hearing, detective inspector Dave Pinkney, from Police Scotland, said: 'The incidents that took place within the property in Springfield Drive led to the death of one woman and left two other females traumatised and extremely distressed having been the victims of serious sexual assaults. 'Police responded quickly to the area and detained Mathieson almost immediately. 'Following extensive forensic enquiries he was ultimately charged in connection with all of the reported offences. 'I would like to thank the victims and the family of Luciana Maurer for their courage and assistance during the course of this investigation. 'While nothing can undo the pain Steven Mathieson's actions have caused, they can take some solace in his conviction as we await his sentence.'","Steven Mathieson, 38, stabbed 23-year-old escort Luciana Maurer 44 times .

"A Briton jailed in Burma for using an image of the Buddha to promote his bar has been ‘abandoned’ by the Foreign Office, according to human rights campaigners. Phil Blackwood was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour by a Burmese court last month after posting the mocked-up image of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook. The tongue-in-cheek advert for a cheap-drinks night at the VGastro bar in Rangoon provoked outrage among devout Buddhists. Scroll down for video . Phil Blackwood (left) was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour by a Burmese court last month after posting a mocked-up image of Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook. Human rights campaigners claim he has been 'abandoned' by the Foreign Office . The 32-year-old bar manager, who has dual New Zealand and British nationality, was found guilty of insulting religion along with the bar’s Burmese owner and another manager, despite apologising profusely for posting the picture. All three were given the same sentence. MPs and human rights campaigners said Mr Blackwood, who is married with a young daughter, is enduring appalling conditions in the notorious Insein prison. They also claimed the British Government had ‘turned its back’ on Mr Blackwood, who lived in Middlesbrough until his family moved to New Zealand when he was four. The 32-year-old bar manager, who has dual New Zealand and British nationality, was found guilty of insulting religion because of this picture . In a Commons answer, a Foreign Office Minister admitted he was not aware Mr Blackwood was a British citizen. Last night, his father Brian insisted that the family had informed the British authorities of his son’s dual nationality after his arrest. Although New Zealand diplomats were taking the lead, he said that the family expected the Foreign Office to exert pressure on Burma. Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald said: 'Philip Blackwood has been unjustly imprisoned for an honest mistake for which he has already issued a heartfelt apology. 'As a British citizen, rather than turning their back on Mr Blackwood, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office should be pulling every available leaver to secure his immediate and unconditional release so that he can return to his family.' There is international concern over a surge of religious nationalism in Burma, ruled until recently by a military junta. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ‘Our ambassador in Burma made clear that we were following the case closely when he raised it with the Burmese Minister of the Presidency. ‘Our embassy in Rangoon has provided advice and support to the New Zealanders on Mr Blackwood’s case.’","Phil Blackwood was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour .

"An orphan who survived a horrific plane crash that claimed the lives of nearly 80 babies and children 40 years ago  has made an emotional return to the scene of one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the Vietnam War. Landon Carnie and his twin sister Lorie were initially thought to have died with scores of other youngsters when the first flight of Operation Babylift – an evacuation of vulnerable Vietnamese orphans and children before the Fall of Saigon – crashed minutes after take-off. Incredibly, with wreckage and bodies strewn over miles of countryside, the terrified 17-month-old twins were found huddled together in a rice paddy more than a day after the crash and later taken to their adoptive parents in the U.S. who had earlier been told they were dead. Now 41, Landon has visited the crash scene and is thought to be the first child survivor to return to the countryside on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City where the C-5 military cargo plane crashed and broke up killing 78 children and 50 adults on April 4, 1975. Scroll down for video . Emotional return: Landon Carnie visits the very spot in the paddy field in Vietnam where it is believed he and his twin sister Lorie were found huddled together as 17-month-old babies after miraculously surviving a horrific plane crash that claimed the lives of nearly 80 babies and children 40 years ago on April 4, 1975 . Devastation: Landon and Lorie Carnie were thought to have died when the first flight of Operation Babylift – an evacuation of Vietnamese orphans and children before the Fall of Saigon – crashed minutes after take-off . Plucked from wreckage: The 17-month-old twins were found by a rice farmer in a paddy field a day after the disaster and later taken to their adoptive parents in the U.S. who had earlier been told they were dead . Incredible escape: Landon and Lorie had at first been placed on the lower cargo deck of the plane where they would almost certainly have died before a nurse moved them to the upper deck shortly after take-off . The tragic start to Operation Babylift – which eventually saw more than 3,000 vulnerable children evacuated to new lives overseas as Communist forces closed in on the southern capital – came as an explosion blew out the cargo doors as it climbed to 23,000 feet. The crew wrestled to bring the plane under control and were returning to Tan Song Nhut air base in Saigon when it crashed and broke into four blazing pieces short of the runway. There were 175 survivors. Landon and his sister had at first been placed on the lower cargo deck of the plane where they would almost certainly have died before a nurse caring for them moved them to the upper deck of the plane shortly after take-off. 'The two of us were put into one chair together,' said Landon, recalling stories he was told about the crash as a child. 'We were found over a day after the crash, right next to each other in a rice paddy. A rice farmer found us. 'My parents who had adopted us actually got a telegram saying we had died because we couldn't be found. And then, we were found.' Discovering his roots: The twins were brought up in Washington State until – engrossed by a documentary on TV about the 25th anniversary of Operation Babylift in 2000 – Landon decided to visit his birth country . Poignant pilgrimage: Landon is now a lecturer in communications at the RMIT University in former Saigon, renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the war, after permanently relocating to the country in 2002 . All the orphans' documents including details of the birth parents, dates and places of birth were destroyed on board the inaugural Operation Babylift, which had been due to be met when it landed in the U.S. by President Gerard Ford. The twins were brought up in Washington State until – engrossed by a document on American TV about the 25th anniversary of Operation Babylift in 2000 – Landon decided to visit the country of his birth. He visited with his adoptive mother and then, two years later, decided to return to Vietnam to live. Landon is now a lecturer in communications at the RMIT University in former Saigon, renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the war. 'My adoptive parents were worried about me coming back at first,' Landon recalled. 'They said ""don't forget it's a Communist country and if you do something wrong you might be put in jail and never allowed to leave Vietnam"". 'They scared me a little bit and I was very careful about what I did and where I went when I first came back. 'But now I've been here for 13 years and I know exactly what I can say and do here.' Landon's twin sister Lorie visited Vietnam in 2005 but it was only years later that Landon discovered the scene of the crash in which they were presumed to have died, visiting ahead of tomorrow's anniversary with a film crew fromasialifemagazine.com.

Landon's twin sister Lorie visited Vietnam in 2005 but it was only years later that Landon discovered the scene of the crash in which they were presumed to have died, visiting ahead of the 40th anniversary of crash . In emotional scenes, Landon found the likely spot where he and his sister lay undiscovered for more than 24 hours and met elderly villagers who recalled the crash and the spirits of the dead children they say haunted the area for years to come. They built a shrine over the top of one fragment of the plane that was embedded in the ground to appease the spirits which superstitious villagers believe still haunt the fields. 'The spirits are still here,' said one villager. Another villager, an elderly woman who witnessed the crash, said the bodies were left in the fields for a long time because everyone except gangs of looters was too frightened to go near the wreckage. 'They (the children) were dead and they were left there,' she said. 'That is why those spirits are still around.' South Vietnamese babies on a flight from Saigon to the United States during Operation Babylift, the mass evacuation of children from South Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam War from April 3 to April 26, 1975 . Catastrophic: U.S. military officials sift through the wreckage of the U.S. C5A cargo plane that crashed shortly after take off, killing 78 children and 50 adults in one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the Vietnam War . Operation Babylift continued despite the April 4 tragedy and before the Fall of Saigon on April 30, more than 3,000 babies, infants and young children – mostly orphans, disabled youngsters and the children of US servicemen – were evacuated by plane. Around 2,000 of the children went to the U.S. while others went to Australia, Canada and Europe. The last planeload left Vietnam on April 29, the day before Saigon surrendered to the North Vietnamese Communist forces. Landon has been told his mother died in childbirth and that his father gave him and his twin sister up for adoption as there were no other family members to care for them. He knows his birth town but has not managed to contact any members of his birth family. Asked how his extraordinary survival had affected him, Landon said he believed it had contributed to making him a free spirit. 'I take life and embrace it,' he said. 'You have to take life and enjoy yourself.'","Landon and Lorie Carnie were on first flight of Operation Babylift in 1975 .

"It looks like a doll’s house that’s been dropped from a great height. A bathtub dangles at a crazy angle. Bedclothes hang in the breeze. Bricks are scattered everywhere. This was Susan House’s beloved home after a huge explosion ripped off two of the walls and left the rest of the property on the brink of collapse. Susan House amazingly survived a huge gas explosion that ripped through her farmhouse - because she was out walking her dogs at the time . Fire crews were called after a tremendous blast was heard, blowing the back wall and windows out and causing substantial damage to the roof . Ms House went for a stroll shortly before the detached property exploded yesterday afternoon, leaving a scene of destruction . A bath tub can be seen teetering over the edge of what was once the upstairs bathroom after the explosion, which miraculously injured no one . The 55-year-old’s house may be in ruins but she can count herself extremely lucky to be alive – having left to take her dogs for a walk in the spring sunshine not long before the blast. She returned to find it looking like a bomb site, with rubble strewn across her garden and her belongings left exposed to the elements. The explosion originated in the kitchen, prompting the emergency services to believe that it was caused by a gas leak because the house is supplied by a propane tank. Although there was serious damage to the remaining walls and roof, some of the content of the rooms remained intact. Books were still lined up neatly on shelves in the downstairs office, a painting still hung on a remaining wall and the computer seemed unscathed. What remains of the detached home, called Bleak House, in Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire, will have to be ‘flattened’, according to Miss House’s father. George House, 86, who has owned the property for 53 years and lives on the same street with his wife Hilda, said: ‘My daughter was out walking the dogs at the time. She lives there alone and it was really lucky that she wasn’t there. ‘She is too upset to talk about it. Due to it being bank holiday there is nothing we can do with it at the moment.’ An upstairs bedroom , still with a bed and chest of drawers in tact, is visible from the garden as the wall of the room was completely blown off . Kevin Hinson was in his garden half a mile away when he heard what he described as a 'big bang', but mistook it for a bomb going off . The explosion is believed to have happened in the kitchen of the poultry farm - called Bleak House - which had a propane-fed gas supply . Wendy Matkin, who lives a couple of hundred yards away from the destroyed farmhouse, said: 'I felt the whole house shake' Fire service group manager Sean King said if the owners of the property were in at the time ‘it could have been a very different story’ A spokesman for Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service said the gas leak originated in the kitchen. Firefighters were able to put out a small fire without entering the home in case of any collapse . Wrecked: Pieces of brick, windows and plaster lie scattered across the garden, leaving the interior of the home completely visible . Residents in Theddlethorpe said the explosion was heard across the village. Kevin Hinson was in his garden half a mile away when he heard a ‘big bang’. He said he initially thought it was a bomb being tested at the nearby RAF Donna Nook airbase. He added: ‘It was a massive explosion.

"Battered, rusted and covered in overgrown weeds, this unremarkable looking bus and train were used to film one of the most memorable Hollywood action scenes of the past 25 years. Lying abandoned in the Great Smokey Mountains in North Carolina, fans of 1993 film The Fugitive will recognize them as those used by Harrison Ford's character Dr Richard Kimble when he escaped from a prison transport moments before it collided with the onrushing train. The scene, which was filmed using a real train hitting a real bus, cost an eye-watering $1.5million to shoot while the remains of the vehicles were left on location where they have since become a popular tourist attraction. Scroll down for video . The wreckage of the bus and train used in the dramatic scene from The Fugitive lie abandoned in the Great Smokey Mountains in North Carolina . The vehicles were used to film a scene in which Harrison Ford's character leaps from a prison transport moments before it is struck by the onrushing train . Signage identifying the bus as a prison transport for the purposes of the film remains on its front . Across its side, the lettering reads 'Illinois Dept. of Corrections' in accordance with the film's plot . The wreckage has since become a tourist attraction 23 years after the memorable action scene was shot . Harrison Ford's character Dr Richard Kimble is pictured leaping off the bus in the scene where he escapes while being transported to prison . The Fugitive was the must-see film of 1993, winning plaudits from critics and the audience alike. It grossed a staggering $370million. Fans of the film will recognise the inside of the bus where Kimble tried in vain to save prison officers and fellow inmates, before narrowly avoiding certain death by jumping from the vehicle seconds before the train hit. 'Illinois Dept. Of Corrections' can still be seen written on the trashed prison bus in accordance with the film's plot. The trains were bought specifically for the epic scene at $22,000 per carriage. The crew used pusher trains to make it go faster for a bigger impact. The 100 strong crew spent two months on location in the Great Smokey Mountains in North Carolina to carefully plan the impact, which lasted a heart-stopping 60 seconds. The short action sequence cost an eye-watering $1.5million to shoot as it used only minimal CGI . Director Andrew Davis used 13 cameras to film the scene and three were destroyed in the process . The inside of the bus will be familiar to fans of the film as the location where Harrison Ford's character attempts to free fellow prisoners before leaping out of the path of the oncoming train . The train is now covered in grass and weeds after sitting abandoned for more than two decades . Director Andrew Davis used 13 cameras to film the scene; three were destroyed in the process. Most camera were operated remotely so to avoid injury to cameramen. Speaking in 2013, Mr Davis said: 'I'm glad CGI wasn't available when we made the Fugitive, not only was the train crash very effective because you really felt it and saw it, but the next day when the marshals show up and there's aerials of it, that would've been a nightmare to try and put all that in digitally and have people reacting to nothingness.' According to Mr Davis, what you see in the sequence is 95 per cent real footage. The only part that was super-imposed was the moment Kimble leaps out of the way of the train. In the film, the bus is a prison transport which crashes when fellow prisoners attempt an escape . Harrison Ford's character Dr Richard Kimble escapes when the bus lands in a ravine in the path of an oncoming train .

"Multiple ghosts supposedly inhabit an expensive New York City apartment building, which recently added Academy Award-nominated actress Jessica Chastain to its list of occupants. Two residents from the Osborne Apartments on West 57th Street in Manhattan told the New York Post of their experiences with spirits in the building. Chastain and her boyfriend, Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, spent $5.1 million on an apartment that features four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms, Daily Mail Online reported early last month. Chastain most recently appeared on the big screen in the 2014 films Interstellar and A Most Violent Year. Purchase: Jessica Chastain recently purchased a $5.1 million apartment at The Osborne.

The Osborne is located close to Carnegie Hall and is a few blocks away from Columbus Circle, Central Park and Lincoln Center. One of The Osborne's longtime residents, Naomi Guffman, recently told the Post 'I have a poltergeist!' She thinks the ghost is actually one of the apartment's former tenants, Metropolitan Opera singer Johanna Gadski, according to the newspaper. The Post described Gadski as 'a red-haired practical joker' who was killed in a 1932 Berlin car accident. Guffman told the Post '[Me and my husband would] be standing in the hallway talking and the toilet would start to flush.' She also described doors randomly opening and water on the stove boiling of its own accord. Retreat: Chastain and her boyfriend Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo can hideaway in one of the apartment's four bedrooms . Classic: The apartment also features lots of wood paneling and design elements . Macabre: Ghosts supposedly inhabit The Osborne, according to some of its residents . In 1971, fellow resident Davida Deutsch and her husband heard a booming noise the first night they spent in their apartment and woke up, the newspaper reported. The couple earlier placed a broom close by and were already aware of ghost speculation, according to the Post. The newspaper reported that the Osborne Apartments are allegedly haunted by architect Alfredo Taylor's ghost as he takes the elevator and walks around hallways. Taylor came up with the plan for the building's 1906 addition. Taylor is also known for being the architect behind multiple buildings in Norfolk, Connecticut. The Osborne's resident manager John Coyne told the Post of Taylor 'I haven’t come across anything strange. I don’t know if that means if he's moved on or he's moved out.' MailOnline reported last month that in 1978, the bodies of actors Gig Young and Kim Schmidt were found in an apartment at The Osborne, supposedly the result of a murder-suicide carried out by Young. Nap time: Another bedroom in the apartment is seen with windows looking out toward other New York City buildings in the neighborhood .

"An undergraduate student at Duke University has admitted to hanging a noose in a tree and is no longer on campus, university officials said Thursday. At a news conference Thursday afternoon, school spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said the school would not release the name of the student who admitted to hanging the noose, found early Wednesday in a plaza area at the heart of the campus. The student was identified with information provided by other students and will be subject to Duke's student conduct process and that an investigation is continuing to find out if others were involved, Schoenfeld said. Identified: Officials at Duke University say they have caught the student culprit responsible for hanging a noose from a tree on campus this week . Taking a stand: The noose sparked a mass protest on campus on Wednesday. The noose is a particularly sensitive image in the state, where black residents were once terrorized by lynchings . Schoenfeld said the school believes federal education laws protecting information about students and their grades prevent the school from describing his or her gender, race or whether the student had been in trouble in the past. The school also is working with state and federal officials about potential criminal violations. Officials say the noose was found about 2am Wednesday in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. On Thursday, he praised the reaction of fellow students and administrators at the school. 'I appreciate that immediate action was taken both by the student community to identify a person and by the faculty to ensure that disciplinary action is taken,' he said. Unknown: The university is not identifying the student in question, citing federal education laws protecting student privacy. Above, a view of the Durham, North Carolina campus . Duke Student Affairs Vice President Larry Moneta said the student would face judgment under the school's code of conduct, which includes penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. He said it was 'too soon to make any comment' about whether the student had expressed remorse for the noose episode. 'This is all part of what the investigation will yield and the opportunity for the student to speak to the basis for the behavior,' Moneta said. At a gathering Wednesday in front of the university's Gothic chapel building, Duke President Richard Brodhead told a crowd of several thousand that their presence was a rejection of what the noose symbolizes in a region where lynchings were once used to terrorize black residents. And he said that while administrators and campus police investigate who displayed the noose and why, it is up to each individual to reject racism. 'One person put up that noose, but this is the multitude of people who got together to say that's not the Duke we want,' he told the crowd. 'That's not the Duke we're here for, and that's not the Duke we're here to create.'","The university said Thursday that they have identified an undergraduate student responsible for hanging a noose from a campus tree .

"They are a stunning visualisation of the art - and how it is orange. A programmer has created these stunning graphs to reveal the dominant colour of artworks through history . They show Orange has always been the most popular colour - although in recent years blue has begun to catch up. The software extracts the relevant colour information from images or artworks found online. The plot above is based on 94,526 images for the years 1800-2000. The graph shows a clear trend toward more blue paintings toward the end of the 20th Century, with all colours increasing except for orange. 'I made a visualization of the change in colors of paintings over time,' said Martin Bellander, a PhD student in psychology at the Karolinska Institute who created the graph. To do this, he wrote software first to scrape the images of the paintings from sites where they were available for free download - BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. Then, the software extract the relevant colour information from them, and plots it in a nice way. He found the paintings change over time - from orange to blue. 'The changes in color might be a results of a combination of factor,' he wrote. 'One of these could of course be trends in the use of colour. 'If we assume a smooth linear deterioration of certain colours in oil paintings, it would be possible to subtract that change and study the short term fluctuation in colour use. 'For example the marked increase of blue at the time of the First World War, might actually reflect a true trend in colour use.' Two versions of Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting on show at the National Gallery in in London, England: Yellow and orange are the most popular colours in artworks from 1800, it has been found. Bellander used freely available images for the project. 'There are a bunch of different sites where you can access (photos of) paintings,  for instance the BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. .'One of my favorites is the BBC's site where you can browse through over 200K of well organized paintings - an amazing resource. 'For many of these there is also information on the year they were painted, the artist, etc.' He believes that some experts who have claimed perhaps the change is due top the price of paint are wrong. 'I haven’t found any data on the prices of blue, so that explanation is hard to elaborate on. 'However, it is not only blue that increases but all colors except orange, which might speak against the pigment prices explanation. ' The same graph, but with only oil paintings .

"A woman armed with guns and hand grenades was shot dead as she tried to attack Istanbul's police headquarters on Wednesday just a day after a deadly hostage situation in the city. A picture of the red-haired woman lying on the ground with a rifle strapped to her body and a handgun by her side has emerged and television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood. The attack comes a day after Turkish prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz, 46, died in hospital after members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. It is not known who fired the fatal shots. Scroll down for video . Shot dead: A picture of the red-haired woman lying on the ground with a rifle strapped to her body and a handgun by her side has emerged . Police HQ: Television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood . Armed: The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol, it said. Local media said a man had also been detained . 'The Istanbul police headquarters on Vatan street was targeted by rifle fire and a female terrorist was killed in the clash,' the Istanbul governor's office said in a statement today. The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol, it said. Local media said a man had also been detained. Separately, police detained a gunman on Wednesday who entered an Istanbul branch of the ruling AK Party and hung from its window a Turkish flag with the emblem of a sword added. It was not immediately clear whether any of the attacks were linked, but Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu warned of the risk of 'provocations' and attempts to cause chaos ahead of June's national election. Today, the grieving family of Mr Kiraz who died after being shot in the head and chest during yesterday's courthouse siege wept over his coffin at his funeral. His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul. Turkish police secure the area in front of the Istanbul police headquarters where an armed woman was shot dead . People react to the shooting of an armed woman in Istanbul. She was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol . Plain-clothed police officers block a street leading to the police headquarters in Istanbul on Wednesday April 1 . Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shot . Two of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported. Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded. 'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz. Justice Minister Kenan Ipek said the two members of the DHKP-C who took him hostage had 'held a gun to the nation'. 'We don't see this as an attack on our deceased prosecutor, but on the whole justice system,' he said at a ceremony for Mr Kiraz. 'Our state is powerful enough to track down those behind these lowlifes... The fact these assassins are dead shouldn't put those nefarious and dark forces at ease.' Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Mourning: The coffin of the prosecutor was passed through the crowds of mourners gathered to pay their respects. He had been leading an investigation into the death of teenager Berkin Elvan, who died aged 15 . Respects: Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (L), the son of killed prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz (C) and Turkish National Assembly President Cemil Cicek (R) stand by Kiraz' coffin in Istanbul . Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . Defiant: Mourners at the funeral of Kiraz hold a picture of the prosecutor high in tribute to the lawyer . Mr Kiraz, a father of two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Police chief Selami Altınok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen. 'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Shattered: The broken window of the room where prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was held hostage and shot . The emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz. Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut. Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency. In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks. The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head. Standing guard: Members of security forces stand outside the main courthouse in Istanbul during the siege . Horror: The prosecutor was leading an investigation into the death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan . Protesters: Turkish police use water cannons to disperse protesters who expressed support for an alleged militant member of the banned leftist group DHKP-C group who took Turkish Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage . Emergency: An ambulance leaves the courthouse after police storm the building. Mr Kiraz was taken to hospital where he died from his injuries . Over: Istanbul Security Chief Selami Altinok, centre-right, and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Orhan Kapici speak to the media outside the main courthouse in Istanbul at the end of the siege . They had also plastered their flags and posters on the walls of his office. Turkish media said that the group had given a deadline of 3:36 pm (13.36 BST) for the prosecutor to identify the police officers who they say were behind the killing of Elvan or he would be shot. In a brief video message on a widely-followed Twitter account describing itself as that of Elvan's family, his father appeared to call on the group not to harm the prosecutor. 'We want justice. We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. Gunshots: According to the Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passed . Demands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-left . The DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan. He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police. Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death. The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013. In 2001, two policemen and an Australian tourist died in a DHKP-C attack in central Istanbul. Innocent: Berkin was on his way to buy bread during anti-government street protests when he was struck in the head by a high-velocity gas canister .

"From location tagging to unmonitored comments to blatant sexual harassment, a new video streaming app has all the ingredients to become a parent's latest nightmare. Periscope, Twitter's new iPhone app which allows users to broadcast live video and audio online, launched a week ago today and early adapters have already discovered potentially hair-raising issues with the much talked-about technology, which claims on its website that it is 'the closest thing to teleportation'. Despite the initial hype surrounding the launch of the app, which is being touted as a revolutionary new way to share news, there are already a concerning number of users, particularly women, reporting that they have been sexually harassed, or trolled, while using the technology. Streaming revolution: Periscope, an iPhone app that allows users to broadcast live video and audio to the internet, launched last Thursday . Warning: App developer Justin Esgar is warning parents about the app's various 'land mines' and insists that they need to monitor their child's use of it (stock image) Justin Esgar, App Developer of the app Goodnight, told Daily Mail Online that because Periscope 'allows users to share even more of their intimate lives with each other than ever before', there are 'apparent dangers' that users have to consider before accessing it. Emma Barker, sex and relationships editor at Cosmopolitan.com, noted that the app is already crawling with men who are using the anonymity afforded to them by the app's settings in order to sexually harass women - including one of her female friends. She explained that her friend recently tried out the app by sharing a conversation she was having with her female roommate. They were fully clothed, sitting on a couch and casually conversing, yet 'within the first 20 seconds the first comment popped up’, asking for the women to ‘show butt’. While neither of them were speaking in an even remotely sexual manor, the lude comments continued to pour in and included phrases such as: 'Show boobs', 'Age?' and 'I would soooo swipe right on both [sic]!' One particularly creepy user asked: 'Do you get out of the shower to pee?' According to Periscope's community guidelines, the app prohibits 'pornographic or overtly sexual content' as well as 'explicitly graphic content or media that is intended to incite violent, illegal or dangerous activities'. And while a spokesperson for the app told Emma that Periscope has a team dedicated to content review, there doesn't appear to be anything specific being done to prevent sexual commentary and online harassment. The app's policies are, unsurprisingly, similar to Twitter, which is currently testing out a 'quality filter' that monitors and removes threats and offensive language out of users notifications feeds. It's not clear as to whether or not Periscope will be given a similar screening system. But the recent reports of harassment and bullying have sparked concern among parents of many of the children and teenagers who currently have access to the app – raising questions about whether it is truly safe for young people to be using it, given that they could potentially be opening themselves up to all manner of abuse, be it of a violent, or sexual, nature. Another startling revelation about the app, was revealed by Fast Company editor Rose Pastore, who was testing out the app and learned that it had a major privacy flaw. According to Rose, if users neglected to turn off the location sharing feature, their video streams would be accompanied by a 'zoomable' map which allowed others to pinpoint their exact locations down to the intersection. Thankfully, Periscope disabled the zooming feature on the map as a part of its first system update, but the app still enables locations. Special features: The app, which is owned by Twitter, allows users to follow certain people (L) and scroll through a 'Watch' feed of live videos (R) Mr Esgar noted: 'Periscope requires not only your camera and microphone, but access to your location [if you want to broadcast video]. This means not only are you sharing your video, you are letting other users know where you are.' He added: 'That means your children potentially being found by, best case, a disgruntled ex-spouse. The worst case clearly presents even higher levels of danger. You can easily search for users of the app, even if their Tweet streams are privatized.' Periscope does enable users to hide their location once they begin broadcasting - but many users admit they didn't think to disable the feature before starting their video stream. While testing the app, Mr Esgar said he watched Kevin Jonas and his daughter ride bicycles, a German man drinking, comedian Jim Gaffigan getting his hair washed and an office learning about Periscope. 'I don’t know or follow any of these people on Twitter but there it was, all live for me to watch on my train ride home,' he said. And while Periscope has provided guidelines for content, Mr Esgar noted that there doesn't seem to be any 'curation on the app either' - essentially allowing users to show whatever they want. Users can report them, or even block, any people that they do not wish to be able to see their videos, and can also hide any or all chats any time by swiping right, scrolling to the bottom of the list of viewers and selecting 'hide chat'. But by then it may already too late. You can't unsee something you have already seen, especially if you are an impressionable child. 'We’ve all heard stories of people sending nude photos to one another either via text or other social media apps,' Mr Esgar explained. 'Now you can easily stream nude videos. Clearly, this opens a lot of potential land mines for parents to now have to try and control.' One user's labeled his Periscope live stream video: 'I'm brabroadcastingom my hotel room in LA. What could be more exciting than that? Stop by and say hello?' Another touted a live video of a 'Crazy party in London'. And then there is the issue of children and teens falling prey to online bullying. Mr Esgar said that he 'witnessed a tireless stream of anonymous people saying things that would be inappropriate for a younger audience. The dangers of online bullying are huge, and Periscope, while a great app when used responsibly, allows bullying to escalate exponentially.' He said the app should alter its features to include stronger privacy options, the ability to block location services, curation of commentary, as well as the addition of parental controls. 'Periscope’s concept is great - live streaming made easy,' he said, before adding: 'But maybe it’s just too easy?'","The video app launched last Thursday, but early adapters have already discovered potentially hair-raising issues with the technology .

She told 11 Alive: 'Our intention is not to harm anyone; we're here to train park rangers so they can track and detain poachers and ultimately prevent poaching. 'Most of the time anyone that is in a reserve with a weapon is considered a threat and can be shot if rangers feel threatened.

"A new Ebola jab is being given to people living in the West African countries most badly hit by the virus after human trials in unaffected countries proved successful. Scientists hope that immunisation is possible with just one injection after 'highly promising results' in the first 138 healthy adults who were vaccinated with various doses. The vaccine, developed in Canada, is based on an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that is combined with a portion of the protein covering of the Ebola virus. Scroll down for video . A new Ebola jab is being given to people living in the West African countries most badly hit by the virus. Pictured: a man washes his hands at a checkpoint in Sierra Leone's during the recent country-wide lockdown to combat the virus . When administered, it induces an immune response against the Ebola virus. The researchers, whose findings are published in the New England Journal of Medicine, said one jab protects against a disease which has killed more than more than 10,460 people in a year across six countries including Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the US and Mali. Dr Michael Ramharter, of the Medical Research Unit at Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Lambarene, Gabon, said the Ebola antigen is inserted into the vaccine as a Trojan horse to get the body to develop an immune response against the virus. He said: 'An Ebola glycoprotein from the Ebola strain in Zaire is being inserted into the VSV live vaccine. While VSV only causes mild symptoms in humans, the protein acts as an Ebola antigen and triggers the formation of antibodies against the disease in the immune system.' Dr Ramharter said these antibodies hide, almost like a 'Trojan horse', in the body in order to successfully fight the Ebola virus if the individual becomes infected. Scientists hope that immunisation is possible with just one injection after 'highly promising results' He added: 'Just one vaccine has conferred one hundred per cent protection against Ebola in the initial trials on primates.' Dr Ramharter said the first phase I clinical trial is now complete. He said: 'The vaccine response is very reliable, the vaccine itself is safe and its tolerability is acceptable.' The most significant side effect was found to be temporary joint pain and inflammation reported among a small group of test subjects, particularly in the European centres. In the phase II studies that are now beginning, the vaccine will be used in patients living in the areas currently most badly affected by Ebola, especially Guinea and Sierra Leone, but also in Liberia. The first case of Ebola was reported in West Africa around 15 months ago. According to estimates, around 25,000 people have been infected by the virus - and more than 10,000 of them having died since as a result. The race is on to find ways to prevent and cure the Ebola virus as there are no proven treatments or vaccines to prevent individuals becoming infected. But progress is now being made on an unprecedented scale with trials which would normally take years and decades being fast tracked on a timescale of weeks and months. The aim is to use the lowest dose of vaccine possible that provides protection. Vaccines train the immune systems of healthy people to fight off any future infection.

"Authorities in Virginia are searching for the cell phone of a missing young woman 40 miles from where she was last seen. Norfolk Police continued to look for Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, who has been missing since March 2, and focused on a pond near Carrsville after a new tip. Local resident Steve Hines said that divers were searching the outer edges of the pond for the Longwood University freshman's phone, which sent strange text messages to her mother shortly after her disappearance. Scroll down for video . Police are searching a pond near Carrsville, Virginia, in an attempt to find the cell phone of Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, a Longwood University freshman who was last seen on March 2. AJ Hadsell (left) was last seen driving near her parents' home in Norfolk and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell (right) was taken into custody late last month after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours . The teenager was last seen when she was home for spring break driving near her home in Norfolk, roughly 40 miles from the pond searched Friday, according to 13 News Now. Hines said that police showed him a picture and asked him if he had seen a white van for Quality Plumbing. He said that he had seen the vehicle, which belongs to a company where Hadsell's stepfather Wesley works, driving along the rural road. He had been working in nearby Franklin, Virginia, around the time of the disappearance. The stepfather of the teenager, 36, was taken into police custody late last month amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter. He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. Wesley was been locked up on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering. He said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will. Wesley Hadsell, left, has admitted breaking into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter AJ, right, against her will. The stepfather has a criminal record including dropped rape and kidnapping charges . Residents of Carrsville reported a white plumbing van for the company Wesley Hadsell works for driving suspiciously around the pond . 'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com. Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. He said he even punched the family dog out of anger. While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket. 'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said. 'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' Officially police have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects. During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition. He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states. Charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. Police have not ruled out foul play in the disappearance of the Longwood University freshman, which has lasted for more than a month . Police spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road late last month . He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR. Now he says that he is a changed man. Wesley and his wife were estranged when he was arrested, but it is not clear what their relationship was at the time of the disappearance. Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received text messages from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not sure that the person sending them was actually the missing girl. Wesley Hadsell was denied bond and the judge said the he was trying to impede the investigation into his stepdaughter's disappearance, according to the Virginian-Pilot. He admitted to increasing cocaine use, but said that he just wants to see his daughter home. A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her. They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time. AJ's family and friends discovered items of her clothing two weeks ago near the side of the road in a remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake. Four items were found that belonged to her. AJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.","Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2 .

"A bomb technician has used his expertise to create an Easter egg hunt for blind children - using beeping eggs. David Hyche, now a special agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), developed the technology nine years ago when his four-month-old daughter turned blind. A transmitter is placed inside plastic eggs that let off a high-pitched beeping sound. Now Hyche has passed on the idea to the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind in Birmingham. Festive invention: Blind children in Birmingham, Alabama, have celebrated Easter early by hunting for plastic eggs that let of a beeping sound. They trade the eggs in for candy . The device: Bomb expert David Hyche put a transmitter in a plastic egg so his daughter could join the fun . 'With my daughter, one of her first phrases was, 'I do it myself.' She wants to do it by herself and most of these kids want to do that too,' he told WBRC. 'It's logical for people who are explosives investigators. It's just a battery, beeper and a switch... pretty simple.' Giggling and running around the play area at Brimingham's regional center, the blind children filled baskets with the beeping eggs, before trading them in for candy. 'We love to give the opportunity for our children with disabilities and their families to come out and have the same opportunity as everybody else does,' said Tamara Harrison with the Alabama Institute.

"A 'rainbow coalition' made up of several different parties could cause chaos, Nick Clegg warned today. The Lib Dem leader, who hopes to hold the balance of power after May 7, said the idea of more than two parties forming a government is not 'going to work'. He said it would be a 'messy' way to run the country, and risked instability with the future of the government put in peril with every late night vote. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who hopes to hold the balance of power after May 7, said the idea of more than two parties forming a government is not 'going to work'. Mr Clegg told voters to go to the ballot box on May 7 expecting a hung parliament, with no one party able to secure an overall majority of MPs in the Commons. However, he sought to make the case for only the Lib Dems working with Labour or the Conservatives, without having to rely on MPs from other smaller parties. Recent polls have put the Tories and Labour almost neck and neck, with seat projections suggesting a two-party coalition might struggle to secure a majority. A forecast from pollster YouGov suggested the likely result on May 7 is a badly hung Parliament. It predicted the Conservatives would end up on 297 seats, only slightly down on 2010, Labour 262, the SNP 35, Liberal Democrats 30, losing almost half of their MPs, Ukip four and the Greens one. A second Conservative-Lib Dem coalition would only be able to command a Commons majority of four, making it difficult to form a stable government. Experts have warned a badly hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing. Sterling has already fallen nearly five per cent against the US dollar in the past five weeks amid jitters about the outcome of the general election. If neither major party is able to form a stable government, it could send the pound plummeting by a further ten per cent. After the 2010 election, Labour PM Gordon Brown tried to pull together a 'rainbow coalition' of several smaller parties but it failed and the Lib Dems entered a power-sharing deal with the Tories. Mr Clegg today joined Lib Dem MP Mark Hunter as they  met Dan and Joanne  Thompson with six week old  son Leo and Amy  McGagh (right)  with her six month old daughter Sophie, during their visit to the Millie's Trust charity in Cheadle . Today Mr Clegg said the idea would not have worked then and will not work this time as it would be made up of single issue parties 'puling this way and that'. But with opinion polls pointing overwhelmingly towards a hung parliament and significant losses for the Lib Dems, it may be the only way Mr Clegg can fulfil his goal of playing a role in the next government. The Liberal Democrat leader told his weekly radio phone-in on LBC Radio 97.3: 'He (Mr Brown) was sort of very adamant that he thought that one could create a sort of rainbow coalition of lots and lots of different, a sort of smorgasbord of, different parties. 'I do remember saying, I just don't think that's going to work. I still don't think that's going to work and that might be actually more of a relevant question after May 7. 'I think this idea that you have a government with a whole array of single issue parties all pulling this way and that, I think it's a recipe for insomnia as votes will be strung out night after night after night in the House of Commons. But it's also a recipe for a messy way of governing the country.' Pollster YouGov suggested the likely result on May 7 is a badly hung Parliament. It predicted the Conservatives would end up on 297 seats, only slightly down on 2010, Labour 262, the SNP 35, Liberal Democrats 30, losing almost half of their MPs, Ukip four and the Greens one . Mr Clegg said the presence of seven leaders in tonight's election TV debate was an indication of the likelihood that no party would win an outright majority in 2015. But he insisted that having the Lib Dems around the cabinet table with either Labour or the Tories would keep the next government anchored in the centre ground and prevent Ed Miliband or David Cameron 'lurching one way or another'. Mr Clegg said: 'A coalition was not on the ballot paper last time. I think what's different about this election - and it will loom large in tonight's leaders' debate - is, I think, increasingly people are acknowledging that no one is going to win outright this time either. 'So in a sense what you need to choose ... is what party you prefer, but also - which I accept is complex - is which politicians, which parties, would you prefer working together after May 7.' He added: 'Having Liberal Democrats around the table is a good thing, because we keep the government in the centre ground rather than allowing particularly the two larger parties to lurch one way or the other.' Pressed on whether he would prefer a deal with Labour or the Tories, Mr Clegg said his personal views were 'completely irrelevant'. He said: 'I don't think that my whims or wishes or my feelings or my likes or dislikes about this or that other party leader ... they are literally completely irrelevant. 'The only thing that is relevant is what are the cards that are dealt to us by millions of people doing this wonderful thing, putting a simple cross next to somebody's name in a ballot box on May 7. They will tell us what combination is possible.'","Lib Dem leader warns three or four-party coalition 'is not going to work'

"The Queen will lead the nation at a religious service commemorating the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day, when Second World War Allied forces finally defeated Hitler's Nazi troops on the continent. The Queen and senior members of the Royal Family will attend the Westminster Abbey service of thanksgiving - the culmination of three days of events marking the milestone. A chain of beacons will be lit across the country, Spitfire and Lancaster bomber planes will take to the skies and a star-studded concert will be held in London from May 8 to 10 as part of commemorations marking the 70th anniversary. The Queen will lead the nation at a religious service . On VE Day - May 8, 1945 - the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, famously joined the jubilant victory celebrations in London and danced the conga through the Ritz Hotel before joining crowds outside Buckingham Palace. Jean Woodroffe, one of the Queen's first ladies in waiting, when interviewed by the BBC to mark the monarch's 80th birthday in 2006 said: 'What was amusing is that we went into the Ritz hotel through one door and out of the other door, the other end, doing the conga.' She added: 'And then we stood outside Buckingham Palace with the crowd and we all shouted 'We want the King' with everybody else until the King and Queen came out onto the balcony.' On the first day of the festivities a national two-minute silence will be held at The Cenotaph at 3pm on Friday, May 8, marking the moment prime minister Winston Churchill broadcast his historic speech to formally announce the end of the war. It will be followed by the lighting of more than 100 beacons, stretching from Newcastle to Cornwall. The next day cathedrals across the country will ring bells at 11am in celebration. In 1995, the Queen, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to mark the 50th anniversary of VE Day . VE Day 50th Anniversary, 1995, showing enthusiastic crowds at Buckingham Palace . Many veterans were alive to celebrate for the anniversary in 1995, some will still be for the 70th this year . Stars will also perform at a 1940s-themed concert held on Horse Guards Parade in London in the evening, to be shown on the BBC. At the Sunday service the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will be joined by veterans and their families, politicians, members of the Armed Forces and representatives of Allied nations and Commonwealth countries that fought alongside Britain. A parade of bands, veterans and current servicemen and women will then make their way from the Abbey along Whitehall before a reception in St James's Park for 2,000 veterans hosted by the Royal British Legion. The parade will pass the balcony of the Treasury building, where Churchill made his historic speech before vast crowds on VE Day. That afternoon there will be a fly-past of current and historic aircraft from the RAF, including Hurricane, Spitfire and Lancaster bomber planes from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. Vehicles dating from the 1940s will also be on display in St James's Park. People are encouraged to enjoy their own celebrations by holding street parties. Announcing the three-day celebrations last month, William Hague, First Secretary of State, said they would pay 'fitting tribute' to those who did so much to defend the country and ensure victory in Europe. Winston Churchill waves at the crowd in Whitehall during VE Day celebrations on 8 May, 1945 . A Cheer Goes Up For George VI, his wife - later Queen Mother - and the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 70 years ago on 8 May, 1945 . He said: 'It is right that we take time to reflect on the sacrifices made, not just by those in the Armed Forces, but by civilians such as Land Girls and those in Reserved Occupations and make sure that the whole country has the chance to take part in commemorating this momentous anniversary and remembering those who gave so much for our freedom. 'The celebrations in London will be echoed by other events across the country to mark VE Day 70, with local authorities and communities encouraged to participate. 'They will celebrate with members of their communities who contributed to the war effort throughout the Second World War.' The announcement of the VE Day celebrations came after the Queen attended the traditional Royal Maundy Service in Sheffield yesterday. Joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, Her Majesty, dressed in a turquoise coat by Stewart Parvin and matching hat, was there to present 'alms' to 89 women and 89 men, among them D-Day veteran, Denis Gratton. 'It was just quick. I'm not very good at hearing,' said Mr Gratton, 91, after the ceremony. 'She did say something but I'm not sure what it were.' Handing out alms: The Queen presents a lady with the two Maundy Purses at Sheffield Cathedral . Custom: Monarchs have been presenting Maundy Money since 1210 and King John . The Queen, who had arrived on the Royal Train, was driven to the cathedral where she got a warm welcome from the flag-waving crowd and was presented with a nosegay of spring flowers. Met at the church door by Peter Bradley, the Dean of Sheffield, and the local Bishop, Steven Croft, Her Majesty spoke briefly to the clergymen before being whisked inside for the service. After the hour-long service, the Queen posed for pictures with the Yeoman of the Guard, who had lined the cathedral's aisles during the ceremony. The Royal party then left for a reception at Sheffield Town Hall as the recipients emerged into the sunshine, all pleased with their royal acknowledgement. Patricia Durkin, 72, said: 'It was brilliant, absolutely wonderful. When I got here the atmosphere was tremendous.' The Royal Maundy Service is one of the UK's oldest royal customs and sees the monarch distribute alms in the shape of two purses of specially minted coins. This year, the Red Purse contains a £5 coin, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Winston Churchill and a 50p coin commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Commemorative: The red and white bags contain commemorative coins, this year featuring Winston Churchill . Tradition: The Queen and Prince Philip were handed traditional nosegays made from spring flowers . Historically, this sum of £5.50 in the Red Purse is made up of £3 for clothing, £1.50 in lieu of provisions and £1 for the redemption of the Sovereign's gown. The White Purse contains uniquely minted Maundy Money, which, unlike coins in general circulation,   bear the portrait of the Queen produced by Mary Gillick at the start of her reign. Gillick, a sculptor, designed the portrait which appeared on the coins of the UK and some Commonwealth countries from 1953 until preparations for decimalisation began in 1968. The portrait of the Queen wearing a wreath on her head was considered to reflect the nation's optimism as it greeted a new monarch in the post-war years. The Royal Maundy is an ancient ceremony which has its origin in the commandment Christ gave after washing the feet of his disciples the day before Good Friday. Warm welcome: The Queen is greeted at Sheffield Cathedral ahead of the traditional Royal Maundy Service . Cheerful: The Duke of Edinburgh was on jolly form as he arrived for the service . In an echo of the Last Supper, mediaeval and Tudor monarchs also washed the feet of beggars during the service. Unlike the nosegay, which was originally introduced as a means of disguising the repellent smell, that custom failed to survive the 18th century. The first monarch to take part in a Maundy Thursday service was King John, of Magna Carta and Robin Hood fame, who distributed gifts of clothes and money to the poor in Knaresborough in 1210. John was also the first to present the poor with silver coins and is recorded as having done so in Rochester in 1213. John's grandson Edward I, the king known to posterity as 'the Hammer of the Scots', was the first to confine the tradition to Maundy Thursday alone, which, until his reign, could be conducted on any day of the year. Long wait: Many of the well-wishers outside the Cathedral had waited there for hours . Modernising: The 800-year-old tradition used to involve washing beggars' feet - hence the nosegay . All smiles: The Queen, who has only missed the ceremony four times, was all smiles as she arrived . Smell: The scented nosegays were originally used to disguise the stench of unwashed people .","Three days of celebration to  mark the  70th anniversary of VE Day on 8 May .

He agreed to perform 100 hours of community service and pay $1,333 to the estate of a neighbor for allegedly stealing from the $1million home . Police say Van Winkle stole items from this house in Lantana, Florida, while he was filming his reality show inside an adjacent home . Van Winkle also must acknowledge that he is guilty of the . crime, but the charge will be dismissed and he will have no . criminal record upon completing terms of the agreement, Cohen . said. The grand theft charge was a third-degree felony which . carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $5,000 . fine. The items that were taken from the house were returned to their owner. The 47-year-old musician-turned-reality-television-star, who . famously rapped that 'anything less than the best is a felony' in his 1990s hit song 'Ice Ice Baby,' said at the time of his . arrest in February that the situation had been 'overblown'. The rapper's home currently is under construction and also . is the site of his latest venture, a reality TV show for the DIY . Network called The Vanilla Ice Project. While there were items in the home (pictured above) at the time of the alleged theft, no one else was in the property . Authorities believe Van Winkle stole furniture, a pool heater (pictured above), bicycles and other items from the home . Cohen said Van Winkle is happy to have the charge resolved . before the kickoff of season five of his television series. Van Winkle, who is also a general contractor, regularly . performs community service, his lawyer said, including a project . two weeks ago to build a swimming pool for a quadriplegic . firefighter. His community service under the plea deal must take place at . a Habitat for Humanity project in Palm Beach County. At the time of his arrest, Van Winkle also was accused of . burglary although prosecutors never formally filed that charge. Van Winkle all along said the incident was a . misunderstanding. Cohen said most of the items he was accused of . stealing had been left outside the home by squatters who had . been vandalizing the unoccupied property. In his DIY Network show, The Vanilla Ice Project, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip homes . Van Winkle (center) was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond after his arrest in February . Van Winkle has been married to wife Laura since 1997 and they have two daughters together. This is not his first brush with the law; in 1991, he was arrested and pleaded no contest for threatening a homeless man with a gun. A decade later, he was arrested by Florida police and spent a night in jail for assaulting his wife as they argued while driving. He admitted that he had pulled her hair, but said it was to stop her from jumping out of their truck, and was sentenced to probation and attended family therapy sessions. In 2008, Van Winkle was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife again - but was released the following day after she said he had only pushed her. The case was dropped two weeks later.","He agreed to a plea deal on Thursday where he said he'd perform 100 hours of community service and pay $1,333 to the estate of a neighbor .

Ms Weeks said despite being advised by people that she needs to tell Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 2, what happened to him, she refuses to lie to their sons and will wait until the truth is discovered. Flight MH370 vanished on March 8, 2014 while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board - among the passengers was Mr Weeks. The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia’s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean.","Colin Barnett was at the launch for a new blueprint for marine science .

"A passenger flying from Newcastle Airport to Gatwick was pulled aside at security after staff thought his pease pudding was Semtex, a plastic explosive. The part-time actor was going through customs to board his EasyJet flight, when airport staff discovered he had six £1.80 tubs of the traditional pudding and North East delicacy in his hand luggage. The boiled-legume dish was removed from his bags, along with several Greggs pies. Pease pudding is a traditional dish made with split peas and a favourite in the North East of England . The 58-year-old, who previously appeared in the BBC TV series Blackadder, was surprised at the mix-up. 'I love my pease pudding,' he told The Mirror. 'I think the resemblance to Semtex was pushing it a bit far as it was in containers marked pease pudding.' Security staff told the traveller his pease pudding could 'technically' be classed as Semtex . However, the traveller did admit he was carrying six tubs of the pudding along with pies from the Greggs bakery - which became synonymous with the 'pasty tax' introduced and then scrapped by Chancellor George Osborne in 2012. After being told that the consistency of the pudding could see it 'technically' classed as Semtex, he reportedly offered to let security taste the delicacy to prove it wasn't. Luckily for the pease-lover, who lives in Sussex, he was allowed through with his snacks and was simply warned to pack them in hold luggage the next time he was travelling. The traveller has also placed several Greggs pies in his hand luggage for the journey . An customs spokeswoman said: 'There is no customs policy with regard to pease pudding so far as I am aware.' When MailOnline contacted a Newcastle Airport spokeswoman, she said they do not comment on security matters. It is not the first time unusual items have been picked up by airport security scanners. Stansted Airport has previously confiscated items including furry handcuffs, while two Italian women were stopped at Munich Airport, in Germany for trying to transport a human skeleton belonging to a dead relative. Last year, customs officers at Birmingham Airport seized a giant squash from a passenger who was trying to smuggle it into Britain from Asia. The 4ft-long vegetable, which weighed in more than at 4st, was found with 175lb (79kg) of fish and 94,000 cigarettes from Bangladesh. A spokesman for Solihull Council said: 'It is a bit of a rare find, as you can imagine we do get cigarettes a lot, but not a squash, especially not one of this size.' America's TSA (Transport Security Administration) even has an Instagram account where it documents the weird wonder, and sometimes downright dangerous, items confiscated at security.","The Geordie passenger was pulled aside at customs by security .

"Health officials say a drug-resistant mutant super-strain of a nasty stomach bug has made its way into the U.S. and is spreading - already causing more than 200 illnesses since last May. Shigella infections, otherwise known as 'Delhi Belly' or 'Montezuma's revenge' were traced to people who had recently traveled to the Dominican Republic, India or other countries. The symptoms include diarrhea, stomach cramps and nausea. Outbreaks of the Shigella bacteria are not unusual, but this strain is resistant to the antibiotic most commonly prescribed for adults. Cases of shigellosis (bacteria pictured), otherwise known as 'Delhi Belly' or 'Montezuma's revenge' were traced to people who had recently traveled to the Dominican Republic, India or other countries . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the report Thursday. The superbug sickened at least 243 people, in 32 states and Puerto Rico. Sometimes antibiotics are prescribed, especially for more serious cases. CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a statement: 'These outbreaks show a troubling trend in Shigella infections in the United States. 'Drug-resistant infections are harder to treat and because Shigella spreads so easily between people, the potential for more – and larger – outbreaks is a real concern. 'We’re moving quickly to implement a national strategy to curb antibiotic resistance because we can’t take for granted that we’ll always have the drugs we need to fight common infections. Scientists  unlocked the genetic code of bacteria grown from a soldier who died of dysentery in World War I. Their findings revealed a superbug already resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics decades before they were in common use. CDC Director Tom Frieden said the spike in outbreaks show a 'troubling trend' in Shigella infections across the United States . Kate Baker of Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute said last November that analysis of genetic differences between this 1915 sample of Shigella flexneri and three others isolated in 1954, 1984 and 2002 showed that while the bacterium has changed relatively little, the mutations it has acquired have made it more dangerous and persistent. It also went though what is known as a 'serotype conversion', she said, which made it able to re-infect and cause illness in people who had already been infected before and would previously have been immune to further attacks. Shigella causes an estimated 500,000 cases of diarrhea in the United States every year. CDC and public health partners investigated several recent clusters of shigellosis in Massachusetts, California and Pennsylvania and found that nearly 90 percent of the cases tested were resistant to ciprofloxacin (Cipro), the first choice to treat shigellosis among adults in the United States.","Cases have been traced to ill travelers from India and Dominican Republic .

"Beach-goers were faced with a different kind of sea creature when they entered the water at Victoria's picturesque Rye Beach last week - a swimming echidna! The prickly Australian mammal was filmed paddling out to sea in the turquoise waters off the Mornington Peninsula, 83 km south of Melbourne. Where it was heading, is anyone's guess. Scroll down for video . This echidna was spotted paddling out to sea off Rye Beach, a popular surfing and fishing spot on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula . The video of the swimming echidna, which looks to be happily using its ant-eating snout as a snorkel, was posted online by YouTube user Emma B. According to Australia Zoo, echidnas, like many native Australian animals, are actually 'proficient' swimmers. They like the water so much, that the Zoo built a special  swimming pool for its echidna residents to cool off on hot summer days. Echidnas, like many native Australian animals, are actually 'proficient' swimmers - though they usually prefer fresh water to the open ocean . The echidna - or spiny ant-eater - is  found all over Australia, in coastal forests, alpine meadows and desert habitats. They live on a diet of ants, termites, grubs and worms but biologists think the mammals evolved from aquatic ancestors like the platypus. Gary Sutton, a park ranger from Narawntapu National Park in Tasmania, said he has also seen  wallabies and wombats surfing. He previously told the ABC he thought the animals went in the water to get rid of parasites, like lice and ticks. With its webbed-feet and snout in the air as a snorkle, the little echidna paddled out to sea .","An echidna is filmed swimming in turquoise waters at Victoria's Rye Beach .

"Hundreds of fishermen race to be rescued from an isolated Indonesian island where many were enslaved to catch seafood for Western restaurants in these remarkable images. Indonesian officials probing labor abuses told the migrant workers today they were allowing them to leave for another island by boat out of concern for their safety. More than 300 fishermen emerged from nearby trawlers, villages and even the jungle to make the trip, having been kept like slaves at the Pusaka Benjina Resources fishing company compound. They were finally being rescued by the Indonesian Fisheries Ministry after officials issued a moratorium on fishing to crack down on poaching. Burmese fishermen raise their hands as they are asked who among them want to go home at the compound of Pusaka Benjina Resources fishing company in Benjina, Aru Islands, Indonesia . These fishermen run to collect their belongings after being informed they can leave the isolated island . Two fishermen most likely kept as slaves hug each other as they wait for their boat out of the compound . Burmese fishermen raise their hands as they are asked who among them wants to be allowed to go home . 'I will go see my parents,' said Win Win Ko, 42, smiling to reveal a mouth full of missing teeth. 'They haven't heard from me, and I haven't heard from them since I left.' He left impoverished Myanmar four years ago on the promise of getting a good job in neighboring Thailand, but like many others stranded in the island village of Benjina, he was instead duped into getting on a fishing boat that took him thousands of miles from home with no return. He said his four teeth were kicked out by a Thai boat captain's military boots because he was not moving fish fast enough from the deck to the hold below. The current and former slaves began getting news about the rescue as a downpour started, and some ran through the rain. They sprinted back to their boats, jumping over the rails and throwing themselves through windows. They stuffed their meagre belongings into plastic bags and rushed back to the dock, not wanting to be left behind. A small boat went from trawler to trawler picking up men who wanted to go and was soon loaded down with about 30 men. The Indonesian delegation began interviewing men on boats and assessing the situation on the island this week. They have been told of the existence of a company graveyard in Benjina and of eight fishermen being locked in a company cage. The fishermen described being beaten, kicked and whipped with stingray tails and given Taser-like electric shocks. These men cannot wait for the boat to take them off Benjina where many were beaten, kicked and abused . These men huddle in the rain.

Burmese fishermen arrive at the compound of Pusaka Benjina Resources to report themselves for departure to leave the fishing company . A fisherman plays with rain water as he waits to leave. More than 300 fishermen emerged from trawlers, villages and even the jungle to make the trip. Some said they fell ill and were not given medicine; others said had been promised jobs in Thailand but were instead issued fake seafarer documents and taken to Indonesia, where they were made to work 20 to 22-hour days with no time off for little or zero pay. Their catch is then shipped back to Thailand, where it enters global markets, the Associated Press reported last month. Initially, Indonesian officials told about 20 men from Myanmar, also known as Burma, that they could be moved from Benjina to neighboring Tual island for their safety following interviews with officials on Friday. However, as news spread that some were getting to leave the island, dozens of others started filing in from all over and sitting on the floor. An official was later asked if those hiding in the forest could come as well. 'They can all come,' said Asep Burhanuddin, director general of Indonesia's Marine Resources and Fisheries Surveillance. 'We don't want to leave a single person behind.' Foreign fishermen sit on the ground before being questioned by Indonesian officials at the compound . Many fishermen where were made to work 20 to 22-hour days with no time off for little or zero pay . Foreign fishermen gather on their boat during an inspection conducted by Indonesian officials in Benjina . Hundreds stuck in a cruel industry rushed at the chance to be rescued from the isolated island . The delegation said security in Benjina is limited, with only two Indonesian navy officials stationed there. The men crowded onto seven trawlers and will be moved to Tual over 24 hours. They will stay at a Fisheries Ministry compound until their identities can be verified. 'I expected to evacuate all of them, but I did not expect it this soon,' said Ida Kusuma, one of the leaders of the Fisheries Ministry delegation. 'But I think it's good.' Kusuma said the next step is to coordinate with immigration and their countries of origin. The International Organization for Migration said last week there could be as many as 4,000 foreign men, many trafficked or enslaved, who are stranded on islands surrounding Benjina following a fishing moratorium called by the Indonesian Fisheries Ministry to crack down on poaching. Indonesia has some of the world's richest fishing grounds, and the government estimates billions of dollars in seafood are stolen from its waters by foreign crews every year. Many of those leaving Benjina on Friday were Burmese, but about 50 refused to go, saying they had not received their salaries and did not want leave without money. Another 50 from Cambodia came forward in a group ready to leave. The Benjina compound allegedly had a company graveyard in Benjina and eight fishermen reported being locked in a cage . The International Organization for Migration said last week there could be as many as 4,000 foreign men, many trafficked or enslaved, who are stranded on islands surrounding Benjina . Burmese fishermen carry their meagre belongings with them as they prepare to finally leave the island . Officials from Myanmar will visit the islands next week to look for more men and start the process of sending them home. Thai fishermen will not be transported because they are not seen as a security risk since most of the boat captains in Benjina are from Thailand, Burhanuddin said. Officials from Thailand visited the island earlier this week, but their trip was focused on finding Thai nationals who had been trafficked. They denied mistreatment on the boats and said the crews were all Thai, which directly contradicted what the Indonesians and the AP found. 'We examined the boats and the crews, and the result is most of the crews are happy and a few of them are sick and willing to go home,' said Thai police Lt. Gen. Saritchai Anekwiang, who was leading the delegation. 'Generally, the boat conditions are good.' This is the sort of fishing operation in which the Benjina fishermen will have been involved. Seafood caught by slaves mixes in with other fish at a number of sites in Thailand, including processing plants . Some were kept locked up in cages on Benjina and forced to catch fish which ends up in US supply chains . Slaves use this warehouse in Benjina as a makeshift dormitory after finishing shifts that last up to 22 hours . The year-long AP investigation used satellites to track seafood caught by the slaves from a large refrigerated cargo ship in Benjina to Thailand. The investigation linked the seafood to supply chains of some of America's largest supermarkets and retailers. The report prompted the US government and major seafood industry leaders to urge Thailand to end slavery at sea and to punish those responsible. Thailand's biggest seafood company, Thai Union Frozen Products, announced it was cutting ties with a supplier after determining it might be involved with forced labor and other abuses. Police are investigating in Benjina and will decide whether to prosecute those involved, said Kedo Arya, head of Maluku province prosecutor's office. While excitement and relief flooded through many of the fishermen assembled on the dock, some carrying suitcases or small rucksacks, others looked scared and unsure of what to expect next. 'I'm really happy, but I'm confused,' said Nay Hla Win, 32. 'I don't know what my future is in Myanmar.'","Around 300 fishermen emerged from trawlers, villages and even the jungle .

"The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday. While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday . The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home. Yankee Stadium: The letters at the stadium, which was built in 1923, were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 . In addition to the letters, Sotheby's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s. Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $20,000 to $30,000, it raked in a winning bid of $112,500 at auction.","The Yankee Stadium signage was bought by Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson when the stadium was shuttered in 2008 for an undisclosed sum .

"Asylum seekers and refugees applying to be minicab drivers are exempt from criminal records checks, potentially allowing murderers and rapists to get behind the wheel. Rules laid down by Transport for London (TfL) mean refugees and those applying for asylum do not have to reveal whether they have a criminal history when trying to become a cab driver. The legal loophole in an official application document on 'private hire driver licensing' says people coming to Britain will not be required to have their criminal convictions checked. Asylum seekers and refugees applying to be minicab drivers are exempt from criminal records checks . The form, seen by the Daily Express, states: 'With regards to overseas criminal records checks, no such checks will be made in respect of those applicants who declare that they are in possession of or who have applied for refugee or asylum status.' Everyone else who applies for a cab licence must undergo criminal records checks. Those from outside the EU who have spent more than three months abroad over the last three years have to provide a 'letter of good conduct' from their home country. This usually requires their country of origin to give a reference to the Home Office, revealing whether the applicant has a criminal history. But asylum seekers and refugees are exempt from this too, according to a second document. A TfL guide on taxi and private hire applications states: 'Any applicant who has been granted or is awaiting a decision to be granted asylum/refugee status will not be required to produce a Certificate of Good Conduct from the country he is claiming asylum from.' Applicants from outside the EU must provide a letter of 'good conduct' from their home country - but asylum seekers do not have to . Campaigners called for a change in the guidelines, calling on all minicab drivers to undergo thorough criminal checks. Tory MP Nick de Bois said: 'They should not be offering licences to those they can't check on. They could be putting vulnerable members of the public in the hands of thieves, murderers and rapists. It beggars belief.' Helen Chapman, manager of London taxi and private hire at TfL, said: 'All applicants for a Taxi or Private Hire drivers licence are required to undertake an enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check which is carried out by the Home Office. 'Any applicant that has lived in a country other than the UK for more than three months within the last three years is also required to produce a Certificate of Good Conduct from the relevant country. 'We recognise this may not be possible if an applicant is granted asylum or refugee status and, where applicable, these applicants will be required to provide a Certificate of Good Conduct from any other country of residence within the last three years. They will also be required to provide evidence of their Certificate of Registration or a letter from the Border and Immigration Agency.'","Asylum seekers and refugees applying to be cab drivers are not checked .

"A married teacher was caught having sex with his model lover in a classroom at a top Catholic private school. Tutor Colin Turnbull, 69, was found in a 'compromised position' with Rozina Khanim by a governor at the £13,000-a-year independent Priory School in Edgbaston, Birmingham. The fee-paying school's facilities manager Kevin Bird walked in on the pair while they were engaged in a sex act during an entrance exam day. Colin Turnbull (left), 69, was caught having sex with 'model' Rozina Khanim (pictured left and right) in a classroom at a £13,000-a-year Catholic private school in Birmingham . Caught: Mr Turnbull, 69, was found in a 'compromised position' with Ms Khanim by a governor at the school . The school was said to be packed with pupils and parents when Mr Turnbull and 39-year-old Ms Khanim - who describes herself as a model - were walked in on. The teacher has worked at the school for nine years, hiring out a room to offer private tuition to pupils looking to pass the 11+, The Mirror reported. Mr Turnbull has not commented on the tryst, but the school confirmed senior staff had told him to 'never return'. A school spokeswoman said: 'Once Mr Turnbull's behaviour was discovered by the school's facilities manager, he promptly informed the assistant headteacher. 'Mr Turnbull was challenged; he fully admitted improper behaviour and was then instructed by the assistant headteacher to leave the school site immediately and to not return.' She added that the teacher was not directly employed by the school but he did hire out the classroom for tuition. 'As far as the school is concerned, while behaviour of the sort alleged is wholly unacceptable in any circumstances, we understand from the advice taken from social services that Mr Turnbull had not engaged in any illegal activity. The Priory School (pictured) was said to be packed with pupils and parents when Mr Turnbull and Ms Khanim - who describes herself as a model - were walked in on . Elite: The independent Catholic school charges up to £13,000 a year in fees for students to attend . 'There was no pupil involved, the incident was between Mr Turnbull and an adult female,' she added. School regulator Ofsted, Birmingham City Council and the Department for Education were all informed of the incident. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Independent schools must adhere to the Independent School Standards. Any suggestion that schools are not doing so will be investigated.' Sources close to the school, however, said Mr Turnbull had been allowed to 'leave by the back door' and were angered that he would be able to continue teaching. Ms Khanim declined to comment but told the Birmingham Mail: 'That's not how it all happened.' The Priory School is attended by around 400 pupils, from 'Nursery and Poppets' classes up until sixth form. It charges fees of up to £12,870 a year for its most senior students. On the school's website, its headmaster Jonathan Cramb says 'knowing what is right and wrong' allows teachers to get on with providing an education for pupils. More than 80 per cent of students got five GCSEs graded A* to C last year, well above the national average.","Colin Turnbull was caught having sex in a classroom at a Catholic school .

"Samantha Cameron has made her first solo appearance of the general election with a provocative visit to a Ukip stronghold. The Prime Minister's wife swooped into Rochester and Strood, the seat held by Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last summer. David Cameron has made no secret of his desire to kick Mr Reckless's 'fat arse' out of the Commons, and clearly hopes his wife can woo voters in the crucial Kent battleground. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron has made her first solo appearance of the general election with a provocative visit to a Ukip stronghold . Mrs Cameron joined Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst for a visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent . Mrs Cameron met Mitchell, aged four, at the Abbey Court School in Rainham, a special school  for three to 19-year-olds . She also spoke to five-year-old Jessica at the school, which aides said was 'very close to her heart' Mrs Cameron's first solo appearance three days into the campaign will be seen as a statement of intent from the Conservatives, who are desperate to wrest the seat back from Ukip following the by-election. Visiting a special school in the constituency, she joked that she was pleased that her campaigning duties did not stretch to a live TV debate. Mr Cameron is due to go head-to-head in a seven-way debate tomorrow night with the leaders of Labour, Lib Dems, Ukip, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru. Mrs Cameron told reporters: 'He doesn't seem too nervous but I'm very glad it's him doing it and not me.' When Mr Reckless defected from the Tories last year, the Prime Minister launched an extraordinary attack on his betrayal. Mr Cameron argued that committed volunteers have ‘knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them’. But after the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the by-election triggered by his decision to join Ukip, Mr Reckless held it with a majority of 2,920. Tory sources said it remains a 'key seat' and Mrs Cameron was keen to support Miss Tolhurst who is a 'great local candidate' Mrs Cameron is expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last month to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister . Tory sources said it remains a 'key seat' and Mrs Cameron was keen to support Tory Kelly Tolhurst who is a 'great local candidate'. Mrs Cameron is expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last month to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister. She said: 'He's definitely for my mind the best man for the job. 'I hope that me and the family help him to keep things in perspective - keep him grounded - help him to pace himself over the next eight weeks.' Miss Tolhurst who stood against Mr Reckless at the Rochester and Strood by-election in November. She greeted Mrs Cameron as she arrived for the visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent. Mrs Cameron wore a Cos raspberry coloured blouse and a blue skirt from Toast, teamed with navy shoes from Zara. She met head teacher Karen Joy as she toured the site for three to 19-year-olds with special educational needs, which aides said was 'very close to her heart'. Mark Reckless defected from the Tories to Ukip last summer. After the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the subsequent by-election, Mr Reckless held it with a majority of 2,920 . In September, Mr Reckless followed Douglas Carswell to become the second Conservative to defect to Ukip. The turncoat MP was unrepentant about his defection, insisting the Tories had broken promises on immigration and reducing the deficit. Senior Conservatives reacted with fury.  Party chairman Grant Shapps used the opening speech of the Tory conference to mount a sustained attack on Mr Reckless, declaring: ‘He lied and lied and lied again.’ Mr Cameron has admitted that the pressures of wooing voters means their regular date nights will have to be put on hold. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I think that will probably be a bit testing. I think there won't be much time for some of those things. 'Samantha's going to be on the campaign trail with me. She has also got other things she has to do, including making sure the children make it to school every day.' In November's by-election, Mr Reckless won 42 per cent of the vote, ahead of Kelly Tolhurst on 35 per cent . Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne today visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton . The Tory power couple were filmed together at the weekend during a visit to Salford's Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. Speaking to a patient, they discussed their many hospital visits with son Ivan, who died in 2009. The PM said: 'When our son was very ill, we often went into hospital and it is very difficult to get out at the weekend.' Mrs Cameron added: 'On a Friday, if we thought there was any chance that we could get home, I was like: 'We've got to get out this afternoon'.'","Tory leader's wife makes first solo trip of the general election campaign .

"Environmentalist group Sea Shepherd has  rescued 35 crew members from a sinking ship. The rescue mission comes after the Sea Shepherd vessel Bob Barker followed it's world record breaking pursuit of the accused poaching vessel Thunder for more than 100 days. Bob Barker Captain Peter Hammarstedt said 35 crew members, who abandoned the sinking ship, were safely rescued  off the coast of Africa after being held in life rafts. The toothfish poaching vessel Thunder issued a distressing signal, claiming that the ship was sinking at about 4.00pm on Monday. Environmentalist group Sea Shepherd ship 'Bob Barker' has rescued 35 crew members from a sinking ship . 'The Captain of Thunder radioed us and said their ship was sinking. We  launched our small boat and did everything we could to assist,' Mr Hammarstedt said. 'It appeared as though the ship and crew were in a serious situation.' Mr Hammarstedt told ABC News they have been following the 'internationally-wanted poaching vessel for the past 110 days' as part of its Operation Icefish. 'Our suspicion is that the captain of the Thunder, knowing he's run out of fuel, has deliberately sunk his own boat in order to destroy any physical evidence,' he said. 'I've sent a couple of my crew onboard the Thunder — my chief engineer examined the engine room, which is completely underwater. 'We also notice they've opened several hatches — those that the water, once it's filled one area of the ship, will quickly go into another and it's clear, in my opinion, that this ship was sunk.' The poaching vessel Thunder was trailed for more than 100 days before it started to submerged on Monday . Around 35 crew members from the Thunder ship were safely rescued after being held in life rafts . Operation Icefish has been very successful in exposing the operations of the alleged poachers and making connections between them and fishing companies in Spain. The Thunder  lost its nets, its catch and its profits for the entire season during the pursuit as they face prosecution in whichever port it is forced to go to once short of fuel and supplies. This was the longest pursuit of a poacher in maritime history, surpassing the 21-day pursuit of a Uruguayan poacher in 2003 by Australian Customs.","The Sea Shepherd vessel Bob Barker has safely rescued 35 crew members .

"When Zayn Malik announced he was leaving One Direction last week it was amid rumours that he was set to launch a solo career. And the speculation has not abated since a producer known as Naughty Boy - real name Shahid Khan - posted a clip (which has now been removed), of what was thought to have been the 22-year-old's first single. Indeed, the track, entitled I Won't Mind, sent both One Direction fans and one of Zayn's former band mates into turmoil. Scroll down for video . Naughty Boy has been working on Zayn Malik's solo music, he posted a clip of a track entitled I Won't Mind, but has since taken it down . Especially as the big reveal came after Naughty Boy, 30, from Watford, retweeted a fan video entitled, 'Naughty Boy Saved Zaughty' - an amalgamation of Zayn and Naughty Boy's names - which said 'Zaughty Will Rise'. While it sounds cryptic, the video is thought to reference the collaboration between the two and angered Directioners who are still disappointed at Zayn's departure from the group. It also enraged Zayn's former bandmate Louis Tomlinson. Louis tweeted at the producer: 'Wow @NaughtyBoyMusic you're so inconsiderate pal, seriously how f****** old are you ? Grow up! #masterofallwisdom' Naughty Boy believed that Louis was angered by an earlier tweet as he replied: ‘@Louis_Tomlinson calm down. Was talkin bout Louis Walsh cuz he didn't let someone through on X Factor. Look @ the date of the tweet. #2014.’ Naughty Boy was pictured with Simon Cowell, the boss of Zayn's record label Syco, earlier this year at the British Asian Trust dinner . He then wrote: ‘When ur gettin hate for some thing u didn't do, a bit of love can go a long way, that's why I retweeted, time will tell the real story guys.' Louis was quick to point out exactly why he was angered as he responded: ‘@NaughtyBoyMusic I was talking about the video you tweeted. Clearly trying to wind the fans up! Well you succeeded anyway. Fair play.' Onlookers can only speculate that Naughty Boy's reference to something he 'didn't do' is linked to the fact that he is being blamed for Zayn leaving the band. When he teased the  single off what is thought to be Zayn's forthcoming solo album due out in 2016 on Syco, he said: 'Let the music do the talking guys. thank us later,'  along with a SoundCloud link to I Won't Mind. Naughty Boy is well connected in the music industry, pictured here at an event in 2014 with Jools Holland (left) and Elton John (center) Naughty Boy attends the Ivor Novello awards in 2014 with Emeli Sande who he has previously worked with . 'There is nothing but love for what was left behind. that's why we don't mind #2016 #zaughty #zindabad,' he added. The flurry of outrage, accusations and upset all follow an upsetting week for One Direction's devoted fans after Zayn initially bowed out of the band's tour and then left the group. He confirmed his exit in a statement which read: 'My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. 'But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right.' Whether Zayn will be Naughty Boy's newest collaborator remains to be seen, but he certainly won't be the biggest name he's worked with. So far he's worked with Cheryl Cole, Rihanna, Tinie Tempah, Emeli Sande and Leona Lewis and he even helped to produce Labrinth's hit song Beneath Your Beautiful. Naughty Boy chats to Prince Charles, his career was started thanks to a grant from The Prince's Trust . He also wrote a song for One Direction in 2014 with the help of Emeli and Zayn himself. At the time Shahid explained the collaboration telling the Mirror: 'We [he and Zayn] met at the BRITs, we both have a Pakistani background and we just got on straight away. 'In this business it's hard to make new friends, but we spend a lot of time together just chilling out, making music.' In 2013 he achieved musical success in his own right with La La La - a collaboration with Sam Smith - which became the year's fastest selling single. The track won both Best Song and Best Video at the MOBO Awards that year. But the producer came from humble beginnings and he started Naughty Boy Records while working for Dominos Pizza. Prior to this he had studied business and marketing at London Guildhall University but left the course after only one term. Naughty Boy was able to buy his recording equipment after going on Deal Or No Deal and winning £44,000 . It was ten years ago in 2005 when Naughty Boy was 20 that he took part on the reality gameshow . Indeed, it wasn't until 2005 when he began to be able to build the business, thanks to a £5,000 grant from the The Prince's Trust. And Naughty Boy  proved to be a lucky boy when, in the same year, he took part on the hit Channel 4 show Deal Or No Deal and won £44,000 which allowed him to buy all of his studio equipment. However, despite having collaborated with big artists, it's his work with Zayn that may well turn out to be the most controversial. Especially given the circumstances in which the 22-year-old left One Direction. In a statement released last week Zayn revealed that he wanted out of the band so that he could live 'a normal life,' with many speculating that he couldn't handle the level of fame the boy had achieved. Whilst he may not be instantly recognisable Naughty Boy is very well connected, here his is pictured with Emeli Sande (left) and Jemima Khan (right) However, it was just a couple of days before the singer was pictured in a London studio with Naughty Boy, leading to speculation that the pair had already begun work on his solo album. The release of I Won't Mind may also put a spanner in the works for both Zayn and One Direction as far as their previous work commitments are concerned. It has been reported that in 2013 the boys signed a deal to make two more albums and a greatest hits compilation, however, by leaving the band Zayn may well have forfeited this deal. But it doesn't look as if Zayn's boss Syco head honcho Simon Cowell, is too unhappy about the situation. It's already been confirmed that when the Bradford born singer does release his own music it will be on the Syco label. And Naughty Boy has previously revealed his closeness to the music mogul, not only being pictured with him at events, but mentioning in a previous interview that the pair are in text contact.","Naughty Boy has come under fire after posting Zayn Malik's music .

Ed Balls was left briefly stumped by a basic maths question today after he gave a speech in Leeds . He was asked to work out the multiplication at the Q&A after he last month revealed that he still relies on his mother-in-law for help with maths. During an interview on Good Morning Britain, Labour's shadow chancellor confessed he was relieved he had not been asked any maths questions live on TV. He told host Susanna Reid: 'I was pleased you didn't ask me any maths questions this morning.' Asked how he was with fractions, Mr Balls replied: 'Luckily my mother-in-law is a maths teacher so she is the expert when it comes to maths.' A shocked Miss Reid interrupted: 'You cannot tell me that the shadow chancellor relies on his mother-in-law to do his maths.' Mr Balls said: 'The kids think the mother-in-law is very good at maths teaching. You always rely on your mother-in-law.’ Asked what seven times six equals, Labour’s shadow chancellor looked down at his feet and laughed nervously before eventually answering correctly following a ten second pause . Mr Balls has three children with his wife, Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. After working as an adviser to Gordon Brown at the Treasury, Mr Balls was elected as an MP in 2005 and became shadow chancellor in 2011.

"Like many women, I’ve long dreamed of a bigger bust. As a modest 34B I’ve experimented with every push-up, plunge and balcony bra there is, so I’m intrigued to learn of a new £150 bra that claims to take you from a B-cup to a DD in an instant. The Scandfit Try Size — dubbed ‘the boob-job bra’ — was developed to help women about to go under the knife decide what size implants to have. Not surprisingly, it has gained a following among women like me who would never have surgery but love the idea of trying out a dream decolletage for a day. Scroll down for video . At a size 34B, Annabel Cole (pictured without the bra)  has long dreamed of having a bigger bust but would never have surgery, so she decided to put 'the boob-job bra' through its paces . I decided to put the design through its paces in three variations — a C cup, D cup and whopping DD! Starting with the smallest first, this is what I found . . . FROM B-CUP TO C-CUP, BUT IT'S TOO SAGGY . Cleavage you can change like your clothes? Yes, please! I’m terribly excited by the idea of the Try Size — even more so when it arrives packaged in a white leather box. Soft, black and lace-trimmed, it comes with four pairs of inserts labelled one to four, according to their size. The inserts are measured in cubic centimetres, like surgical implants. The lightest, size one, weighs in at 50cc, followed by size two at 100cc, size three at 200cc and size four at 300cc. One added cup size is roughly equivalent to 200cc, and the idea is that the inserts can be layered in various combinations to create different sizes of cleavage. The Scandfit Try Size (pictured) has been dubbed ‘the boob-job bra’ and comes with four pairs of inserts which can be layered to create different sizes of cleavage . While the Try Size is pretty, it is also hefty. Out of curiosity I plonk it on my kitchen scales: the whole package weighs well over a kilo. I had assumed that the inserts would be silicone, but these are filled with rice and resemble silky bean bags. Apparently, rice is about the same weight by volume as surgical implants and can be moulded more realistically to your breast shape. Each bra cup has an internal pocket to hold the inserts. Annabel is seen here wearing the size three 200cc insert which takes her modest B cup to a C cup, she says she was sorely disappointed with the results of the rice filled insert on this occasion . I start cautiously with the size three 200cc insert, taking my modest B cup to a comelier C. The inserts prove easy to put in but the first hurdle comes with doing up the bra. Unlike those I usually wear, this has four rows of hooks — presumably to cope with the maximum potential weight — and it takes me a few extra minutes to get them fully done up. Once the bra is on, I feel let down. I’d been expecting some kind of ‘Hello Boys’ perky bosom but I’m sorely disappointed. What I get is more like a real-life middle-aged C cup — ever so slightly droopy and a little lopsided. But I persist and push around the rice, patting and smoothing until it creates a soft, rounded shape. I decide to try out my new look on my harshest critics — my children. I throw on a tight T-shirt and wander into the kitchen. As I load the dishwasher, 12-year-old Rosa peers at me and pipes up: ‘Your boobs look weird. What have you done?’ I come clean and explain. It doesn’t go well. Elsa, 15, snorts: ‘That’s pathetic!’ I try to explain that the bra simulates ‘real cleavage’ and that I am going to be trying out various looks. ‘Don’t bother,’ she snaps. ‘It makes you look fat.’ Ouch! CONFIDENT AND SEXY WITH  D-CUP . I decide to try my next look on a different audience. Reasoning that my closest friend Nancy is bound to be more supportive, I stuff my bra with the size three and size two inserts — 300cc in total — to give me a much-increased D cup. We’ve booked for lunch at a restaurant, but the problems start before I leave the house. What should I wear? I try on a succession of tunic tops and soft blouses. With a B-cup they look pretty and feminine, but now they are too short and the fabric hangs down from the shelf created by my new boobs. To my horror, I look decidedly fat. Annabel is seen here wearing the inserts that increase her bust size to 34D, although initially self-conscious of her significant cleavage, she was startled by how natural it made her boobs look . I resort to a clinging V-neck dress — a once-worn look-at-me frock bought for a wedding. It’s not what I’d normally wear, but I’m not dressing for myself now; I am dressing for my cleavage — and it’s certainly eye-catching. Nancy is terribly complimentary and I feel rather bouyed up, but as we sit down I feel the disapproving gaze of a couple of mums I recognise, who are lunching near by. Do I look desperate? At 43, am I too old to show off my cleavage? I feel self-conscious, but I press on. My husband and I have tickets to a West End show in the evening, so to ensure maximum impact I invest in an expensive low-cut dress on the basis that if I have ‘it’ (even temporarily) I might as well flaunt it. I am startled to see a new me in the mirror. The boobs look natural, not the typical half-moon shape that screams ‘boob job’, and I feel confident and sexier than usual. It works. My husband, not usually known for his ability to notice a new haircut, outfit or even one of his own children at a distance, cottons on instantly and compliments me in his own special way. ‘You have a figure at last! Does it go bigger?’ GETTING BACKACHE WITH DOUBLE Ds . Next, I try out the boob-job bra at the supermarket — and for this one, I decide to go all-in. With some trepidation I insert size four, size three and size two — 600cc in total. Instantly, I am three cup sizes bigger than I’ve ever been. My posture changes at once: I am pulled forward by the extra weight, leaving me hunched over and exposing a vast swathe of cleavage to my fellow shoppers. Pushing the trolley is even harder work than usual, and I now understand why women with large breasts complain of backache. My bust is enormous and looks wildly out of proportion with my 5ft 4in, size 8 frame. Even walking at a stately pace, my chest jiggles alarmingly. I bend down to pick a box of cereal off the bottom shelf and worry that I’m about to suffer a wardrobe malfunction. Finally, Annabel tested out the 600cc inserts that increased her bust size to a 34E cup. Annabel says she felt her bust became wildly out of proportion to her body as she is only 5ft 4in and a size 8 . I can’t ever imagine running for a bus with a bust like this. Things are no easier at home. I crouch down to sweep the floor and my chest hits my knees; I sit down for a snack and my bust slams on the table before the plate. And sleeping? As I lie down, my boobs separate and sag to the sides alarmingly. I toss and turn but can’t get comfortable. I usually sleep on my side, but then my chest feels squashed. It’s even worse on my front. I try to snuggle up to my husband but once again my DDs are in the way, though to judge by his reaction he doesn’t mind too much. Finally, I remove two of the inserts and drop off flat on my back. The next day, I slip back into my normal 34B bra with great relief. While I’ll be bringing out the D cup on a special occasion — my husband’s birthday, for example — the stop-the-traffic cleavage is far too much for me.","At a size 34B, Annabel Cole has long dreamed of having a bigger bust .

"We may not be able to hear it, but the Earth is constantly oscillating and creating a hum that has been likened to the ring of a bell. It's long been known that earthquakes and their seismic activity contribute to this ringing, but researchers have now proved ocean waves also play a role. As so-called short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves, which combine with long, more powerful waves dragging across the ocean's floor to create the constant hum. It's long been known that earthquakes contribute to making the Earth ring like a bell, but researchers have now proved ocean waves also play a role. As  short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves, which combine with long waves on the ocean's floor to create a constant hum . Earthquakes shake the planet in such a way that the Earth can oscillate for months after the seismic event. This oscillation is caused by vibrations and researchers in the mid-1980s found the hum can drop as low as an E flat, 20 octaves below middle C on the musical scale. In the late 1990s, however, seismologists found that the planet doesn't just oscillate following quakes, and instead is vibrating at extremely low frequencies all of the time. These vibrations aren't powerful enough to be detected by humans, but are strong enough to register on seismometers and similar. Earthquakes shake the planet in such a way that Earth can oscillate for months after the seismic event. This oscillation is caused by vibrations and researchers in the mid-1980s found that the hum can drop as low as an E flat, 20 octaves below middle C on the musical scale. In the late 1990s, seismologists found that the planet doesn't just oscillate following quakes, and instead is vibrating at extremely low frequencies all of the time. A team of Japanese and Californian seismologists first suggested ocean waves may cause this hum in 2004. Using data from 2008, a French team found that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity, but these waves only take 13 seconds or less to complete a single oscillation. They didn't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell-like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds. So the team studied the movement of ocean waves at the bottom of the seabed. As these long waves travel over the ocean floor they meet resistance, especially as they pass over the steep continental shelves, and this friction helps create long seismic waves, that oscillate much slower. A team of Japanese and Californian seismologists first suggested ocean waves may cause this constant hum in 2004. They proposed that as ocean waves move in opposite directions and collide they create microseismic activity. But Fabrice Ardhuin, a senior research scientist at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France, and his team wanted to put this theory to the test. They began by studying and measuring seismic activity across the globe, including earthquakes, storms and the movement of ocean waves, throughout 2008. During this time, two seismic events with magnitudes of 6.9 and 7.1, took place on 3 March and 20 March. But the largest hum coincided with the strongest seismic waves during the Johanna storm on 10 and 11 March. That storm generated waves with a peak period of 16 seconds that reached heights of up to 42ft (12.8 metres). During this storm, a spectrogram found energy levels reached 10 mHz, and lasted 36 hours. By looking at how much energy was generated by the storm, the researchers were able to conclude that the hum was caused by the storm, and wasn't the remnants of seismic activity from the events. They could then look at the reasons why. 'Ocean waves provide most of the energy that feeds the continuous vertical oscillations of the solid Earth,' said the researchers. During March 2008 two large seismic events took place. But the largest hum  coincided with a Johanna storm (right). The storm generated waves with a peak of 16 seconds and heights of 42ft (12.8 metres) (left). From this, the team could conclude the hum was caused by the storm, and not leftover from the seismic events . Using seismic readings from 2008, a French team spotted that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity, but these waves only take 13 seconds to complete a single oscillation. They didn't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell-like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds . 'The hum contains periods longer than 30 seconds, and the primary and secondary peaks are centered around 15 and five seconds respectively.' Motions in all three bands are recorded everywhere on the planet and the team said they can provide information on both the solid Earth structure, the ocean wave climate over the past century, and the properties of short period ocean waves. 'Yet, the use of seismic data is limited because where and how ocean waves rock the Earth is not known, in particular for the hum,' continued the team. 'The hum is the least understood part of Earth's oscillations.' Using the 2008 data, Mr Ardhuin and his team spotted that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity, but these waves only take 13 seconds or less to complete a single oscillation. The team then studied ocean waves at the bottom of the seabed. As these so-called long waves travel over the ocean floor (stock image) and continental shelves they create seismic waves that oscillate much slower. This means that earthquakes, colliding oceans and long waves all combine to create the Earth's hum . They didn't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell-like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds. So the team studied the movement of ocean waves at the bottom of the seabed. These waves are known as long because they travel from the floor to the coast and back again. As these long waves travel over the ocean floor they meet resistance, especially as they pass over the steep continental shelves, and this helps create long seismic waves that oscillate much slower. This means that all three theories - earthquakes, colliding oceans and long waves - combine to create the Earth's hum. Although the majority comes from the latter. The findings are published  in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). Mr Ardhuin said that by measuring and understanding long, microseismic waves, researchers can learn more about how the Earth is structured. 'Now we know where this ringing comes from and the next question is: what can we do with it,' he told the AGU.","It has long been known that Earth is constantly oscillating and 'humming'

"There will be more Muslims than Christians in the world in less than sixty years, new research revealed. The religion's share of the world’s population will equal the Christian share - at roughly 32 per cent each - in 2070, analysis by the Pew Research Center showed. The number of Muslims will increase at more than double the rate of the world's population, which is expected to rise by 35 per cent in the next four decades. Scroll down for video . There will be more Muslims than Christians in the world in less than sixty years, the Pew Research Center has claimed. Above, Kashmiri Muslims pray outside a mosque in Srinagar . By 2100 around one per cent more of the world’s population will be Muslim than Christian, with the largest proportion of followers in India. Several countries are also projected to have a different religious majority by 2050. The number of countries with a Christian majority is expected to decline from 159 to 151, the report claimed. Less than 50 per cent of the population will be Christian in the United Kingdom, Australia, Benin, Bosnia-Herzegovina, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the Republic of Macedonia. By 2050 Muslims will make up around ten per cent of Europe's population. It is thought the religion will thrive due to its young population and high fertility rates, with an average of 3.1 children per woman.

"Teenager Becky Watts had to be identified by her DNA after her dismembered body parts were found . The body of murdered teenager Becky Watts had to be identified by her DNA, an inquest into her death has heard. Becky, 16, went missing from her Bristol home in February and her dismembered body parts were found 11 days later. An inquest into her death has been opened and adjourned while criminal proceedings, involving her step-brother, take place. Nathan Matthews, 28, faces a single count of murdering his step-sister, while his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, is accused of perverting the court of justice. Jaydene Parsons, 23, James Ireland, 23, and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, are accused of assisting an offender. Miss Watts was living with her father Darren Galsworthy, and her step-mother, Anjie, before she went missing from their home in St George, Bristol, on February 19. Her disappearance sparked a huge search. The teenager's remains were found 11 days later on March 2, at a house in the Barton Hill area of the city three miles away. The inquest at Flax Bourton in Somerset did not give a cause of the teenager's death. None of Miss Watts' family were present. Coroner's officer Deborah Neil told the court: 'Her death was confirmed on March 3 by a pathologist. She was identified by DNA. 'The brief circumstances are that Rebecca was reported to the police as a missing person. 'She was found later at an address in the Barton Hill area. She underwent a post-mortem examination at Flax Bourton and people have since been charged in connection with her murder.' Avon Coroner Maria Voisin adjourned the inquest until the outcome of criminal proceedings. She said the case would be reviewed in August. Scroll down for video . A funeral service for the teenager will take place on April 17 at St Ambrose Church in the Whitehall area of the city. Members of the public have raised almost £5,000 towards the cost of the funeral. A notice published in the Bristol Post said the church was reserved for family and close friends but the service would be relayed to mourners outside. Afterwards there will be a private family burial. Mr Galsworthy and his wife Anjie said in a statement: 'Becky was approaching the threshold of her adult life; she had so much to look forward to and love to share with all that were close and dear to her. Miss Watts' remains were discovered 11 days after her disappearance at a house in Barton Hill . 'We will miss her so much. 'All of us as a family, including those that knew Becky would like to express our most sincere gratitude to everyone that donated towards this day.

"A florist in eastern Washington state fined $1,000 for refusing to sell a same-sex couple wedding flowers and also facing a consumer-protection lawsuit has netted more than $87,000 in a crowdfunding campaign. The Seattle Times reports that nearly half of the money on the gofundme.com page set up in February for 70-year-old Barronelle Stutzman came in the last several days. Supporters compare Stutzman's benefit page to an Indiana pizza shop that raised more than $800,000 after closing when the owner said the shop wouldn't cater a gay wedding. Supporters: An online campaign for Richland, Washington florist Barronelle Stutzman (pictured) has raised over $87,000 after the florist was fined for refusing to provide a gay couple with flowers for their 2013 wedding . Refused service: Couple Robert Ingersoll (left) and Curt Freed (right) were longtime customers at Stutzman's shop, and while she was fine providing them flowers before, she cited her religious beliefs when declining to service their wedding . Stutzman, owner of Arlene's Flowers and Gifts in Richland, Washington, received the fine in Benton County Superior Court in March after refusing to serve same-sex couple Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed in 2013. When longtime customer Ingersoll came to Arlene's Flowers and asked for the flowers, the devout Southern Baptist told him her 'relationship with Jesus Christ' wouldn't allow her to do the wedding. After they were refused flowers, Ingersoll and Freed went ahead with a smaller wedding than they had planned. They got married in their home with 11 guests and flowers from another florist. In a February ruling, Benton County Superior Judge Alexander Ekstrom found that Stutzman's refusal to provide flowers because of sexual orientation violated Washington's anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws. Along with the fine, the judge's ruling also requires that everything Arlene's Flowers sells to opposite-sex couples has to be available at the same price to same-sex couples. Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose office requested the fine, said in a statement Friday that the ruling is a reminder of the reach of Washington's anti-discrimination laws. 'My primary goal has always been to end illegal discrimination,' Ferguson said. 'I'm pleased that today's ruling clearly prohibits discrimination against same-sex couples.' Before Ferguson's office filed the consumer-protection lawsuit against Stutzman, it had sent her a letter asking for an agreement to no longer discriminate, which she refused. Ferguson's statement Friday said the office would not have sued if Stutzman had accepted the agreement .

"Ralph Vaughan Williams's Lark Ascending is the nation's favourite piece of classic music . The Lark Ascending has been voted the nation's favourite piece of classical music. Ralph Vaughan Williams's work topped the Classic FM Hall of Fame after listeners cast more than 200,000 votes. It topped the poll last year as well and four years ago was named the nation's favourite Desert Island Discs tune. British composer Vaughan Williams was inspired by a poem of the same name by George Meredith. He completed the more familiar orchestral version in 1920. It found a wide audience last year when it was played as Hayley, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, took a lethal cocktail to end her suffering on Coronation Street, following a battle with cancer. The top five was completed by Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 2, another Vaughan Williams work Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis, Elgar's Enigma Variations and Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5. The full poll - 300 pieces of music in total - also includes 12 pieces of music used to soundtrack video games, with two of them making the top 20. Music from the Final Fantasy series, by Japanese composer Nobuo Uematsu, is at number nine while The Elder Scrolls, composed by Bafta award-winner Jeremy Soule, is at number 11. John Suchet, who presents a weekday show on the station, said: 'Twenty years after the very first Classic FM Hall of Fame countdown, I'm delighted that we've attracted so many votes for our chart. 'What I find truly exciting is the continued increase in a younger audience for classical music - I didn't expect to be thanking the video game industry for introducing the genre to a new generation of people, but it's wonderful.'

"Marks and Spencer's first clothes sales rise for four years has today been credited to its fashion supremo Belinda Earl, the former Saturday shopgirl parachuted in to turn round the business. The married mother-of-two ran  Debenhams, Jaeger and Aquascutum before she won the make-or-break style director role at M&S in September 2012. Today it appears that her hard work has paid off, with general merchandise sales, which is mainly women's clothes, up 0.7 per cent - the first rise after 14 consecutive quarters of losses. Mrs Earl is also the woman behind the retailer's brown suede skirt - out this month - which is now being branded the item that could save the business. Sales have also been boosted by celebrity underwear ranges, like those promoted by M&S models Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and David Gandy. On trend: M&S fashion chief Belinda Earl, left, has been credited with helping bring in a number of sales hits, including the much lusted after suede skirt worn here by Alexa Chung, which is out this month . Increase: M&S stars Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and David Gandy have also helped increase sales with their own ranges - with Miss Huntington-Whiteley's bras proving particularly successful in the last quarter . Miss Huntington-Whiteley's £25 padded bra and Mr Gandy's luxury underwear ranges helped push up clothing sales 0.7 per cent in the post-Christmas period. The £199 brown suede skirt, based on a 1970’s M&S classic, has been worn by A-listers including Alexa Chung and Olivia Palermo and received worldwide coverage. Mrs Earl said: ‘When I first saw the skirt, I knew it would be a popular style for us though the support and excitement we have received has exceeded expectations'. Announcing the sales rise today, under pressure boss Marc Bolland said it proved 'we have been bang on trend'. Belinda Earl began her career aged 16 as a Saturday girl at Debenhams and after a brief stint as a Harrods trainee she moved back, and up the ranks, to become CEO before moving to Jaeger and then M&S . Belinda began her career aged 16 as a Saturday girl at Debenhams and after a brief stint as a Harrods trainee she moved back, and up the ranks, to become CEO. After running Aquascutum and Jaeger she was parachuted in as style director, in a bid to try to end the sales slump. Belinda spent her first two months talking to women shoppers, and they told her they want quality from M&S. She wrote for MailOnline last year: 'We believe that provenance and integrity are key. Best of British is made in 20 UK factories – we have got cloth from Yorkshire and Cheshire, outerwear from Manchester and footwear from Northamptonshire. We sell the range from our flagship .com site and in five UK stores. 'We are wholeheartedly committed to seeing these innovations through. Why? Because this is how the British fashion industry distinguishes itself. Because customers love it. Because it’s our heritage. And because it makes great business sense'. Today experts said the sales growth in the key womenswear sector, where M&S competes with Next and Primark, shows the retailer may have been turned round. The High Street giant's growth came as sales in its popular food halls also rose in the 13 weeks to March 28, mainly thanks to record Valentine's Day sales. It said customers had responded to changes in 'product quality and styling' and it sold more full-price items, especially from its luxury ranges. New York socialite and fashion blogger Olivia Palermo, who shot to fame on US reality show The City as an apprentice at fashion house Diane von Furstenberg, debuted the M&S suede skirt at New York Fashion Week . M&S also saw a 13 per cent rise in online sales - after a year of struggles for its new website, which cost millions to develop and will have helped increase clothing sales for the first time in 44 months. M&S clothes were put firmly in the headlines  by the arrival of a controversial  suede skirt, which has  divided opinion. Marks called it 'iconic' in its trading update. It doesn't go on sale until 10 April, but M&S said the huge amount of interest it has generated has driven extra traffic to its online store. It has been named item of the season and been worn by celebrities such as Alexa Chung and Olivia Palermo. It is not cheap with a £199 price tag. The M&S share price rose 20p as the London Stock Exchange opened this morning - taking them above £5.50. Chief executive Marc Bolland said: 'We have made strong progress over the quarter. In Food we delivered another excellent performance, with sales growth ahead of the market. 'We continued to deliver on General Merchandise gross margin, and are pleased that we have achieved this whilst also improving General Merchandise sales. M&S.com has returned to growth, as planned, with further improvement in customer metrics.' Turnaround: For the last 14 financial quarters M&S' general merchandise sales - which is mainly women's clothing - had fallen - but today M&S announced they had returned to growth . On the up: Food sales were also up after M&S enjoyed a record Valentine's Day period, especially on it dine-in deals and flowers . Chief executive Bolland has been trying to turn around its clothes division for some time and has spent heavily on adverts, which have included the likes of model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and celebrity Myleene Klass. M&S' use of stars such as Huntington-Whiteley and David Gandy appears to have paid off. Rosie for Autograph, the retailer's luxury range, sold nearly 400,000 items over the quarter, up 108 per cent on the year – and the bestseller was her £25 padded bra. Sales in boots, blouses and formal jackets were also big sellers, again in the Autograph ranges. In the food hall the M&S sold 830,000 £20 Valentine’s Day Dine-in deals, more of its healthy Count on Us ready meals and also had a record Mother's Day for flowers and plants. Experts had a mixed response to today's news. Bryan Roberts, retail analyst at Kantar, said: 'Womenswear needs to be consistently better across the whole range. The occasional screamer into the top corner doesn't negate smashing the ball over the bar for the last four years.' Previous poor sales were blamed on poor weather and problems with their new multi-million pound website and strong growth from rivals Primark and Next had caused them problems. It suffered a nightmare Black Friday and problems over the Christmas period after its new online distribution centre failed to cope with demand, resulting in no next day deliveries and longer waits for customers. Its progress in clothing was partly disrupted by more stock going into the Christmas sale as a result of the unseasonal conditions through the autumn and winter season. Analysts had expected the retailer's general merchandise unit to report a 1.2% fall in like-for-like sales. The firm also said that its online sales returned to growth of 13.8%, with its traffic numbers and customer satisfaction ratings continuing to improve since distribution problems impacted Christmas trading. The retailer said the specialist positioning of its food business continued to deliver results in a deflationary market, caused by ongoing supermarket price wars. The business said it introduced over 350 new products during the period.","Belinda Earl was parachuted in to turn round the retailer's sales slump .

"A terminally ill fundraiser who claimed to have close celebrity contacts to gain the trust of a charity for terminally ill children stole a laptop, sat nav and phone from the organisation. Simon Mitchell, 44, stole the expensive equipment from Donna's Dream House, a charity for terminally ill children based in Blackpool, Lancashire. Following a three year investigation the volunteer worker admitted stealing a laptop and TomTom satnav from the charity - despite the fact he was meant to be helping the charity by raising its profile following a devastating arson attack in 2011. Terminally ill fundraiser Simon Mitchell, 44, (pictured left with Richard Hammond and right with Katie Price) stole  from Donna's Dream House, a charity for terminally ill children based in Blackpool, Lancashire . The charity also say Mitchell repeatedly let them down and left them picking up the pieces when meetings with his supposed star-studded contacts failed to materialise. Mitchell had been given the laptop and a phone to use by the Dream House when he volunteered for them but did not return them after he left the charity. He pleaded guilty to two counts of theft at Preston Crown Court where he was due to stand trial after a three-year criminal investigation. Len Curtis, chairman of the charity which provides holidays for sick and needy children, said following the hearing: 'He came to us immediately after the fire, when we were very vulnerable and needed help. 'We were taking people on face value without running our usual CRB checks and we allowed him to get involved because he claimed to know all of these famous people. 'He was a volunteer and his role was meant to be fundraising and raising the charity's profile through all these great contacts he claimed to have. 'But it soon became apparent something wasn't right. Mitchell on his wedding day with wife Kerrie - he has now pleaded guilty to two counts of theft . 'It is soul destroying when the trust you place in someone is betrayed.' The theft from Donna's Dream House came just months after Mitchell made headlines claiming to be carrying out a 'bucket list' of good deeds to complete after revealing his own lung cancer diagnosis and desire to raise cash for poorly children. In 2012 Mitchell, with the help of different charities, arranged for two sick youngsters to meet celebrities such as the cast of Top Gear and Katie Price, saying his aim was to raise £100,000 in the two years he was told he had left. But Mr Curtis said Donna's Dream House was left red-faced and out of pocket after a 'Top Gear Day' Mitchell was supposed to organise never happened despite the trust auctioning it as a prize. The charity ended up having to reimburse the disappointed winner. The theft came just months after Mitchell made headlines claiming to be carrying out a 'bucket list' of good deeds (he is pictured with The Stig) 'He even left the people waiting at the train station for people who didn't turn up,' the chairman said, adding there had been a similar occasion with a Ferrari experience that never materialised. He said the two failed events had cost the charity around £6,500 to put right. Mr Curtis said Mitchell's thefts only came to light when satellite navigations firm TomTom contacted them to check the charity had received their donation of a sat nav - which Mitchell had kept for himself. Mr Curtis said: We didn't see this coming. He was only with us for a few months but this has had a detrimental effect on us. Mr Curtis said they pursued legal action to make people aware of Mitchell and what he was doing in case he tried to steal from another charity. He added: 'I would urge all charities to show due diligence when accepting offers of support particularly at vulnerable times.' Mitchell pleaded guilty to stealing a mobile phone and laptop computer, worth around £540, from the Dream House between New Year's Day and September 1, 2012. He also admitted stealing the sat nav. He is due to be sentenced at Preston Crown Court next month. Mr Curtis added: 'He would promise people things with these celebrities in exchange for goods and services. But when he failed to deliver they never finished the work. 'There were just the odd small things that he did deliver. 'I think he's a fantasist, he just fantasised that he had all these great contacts. 'I don't think he's an evil person, I just think he totally believes his own lies. 'He lied and he lied  to us and to himself.'","Terminally ill Simon Mitchell, 44, stole laptop and satnav from charity .

"One Missouri mom is making the best out of a less than ideal situation. Becky Schoenig of St. Louis, Missouri was shocked when she realized her brand new 2015 Ford Fusion had been stolen from her driveway on Monday night, just a little over a month after she took the car home. Then, on April 1, Schoenig was shocked to learn that police had found her car after receiving a tip from a man who recognized the vehicle as Schoenig's and would be returning it to her - but with a few minor changes. Scroll down for video . Bling: Becky Schoenig was shocked when her stolen car was located and returned to her with new red rims and detailing (above) Theft: The brand new 2015 Ford Fusion (above) had been stolen from her driveway Monday . Racer: She took to Facebook after getting the car back, writing; 'I want to thank the car thieves for pimping out my vehicle for me.... This b***h is pimpin now!!!' As the car pulled up, Schoenig noticed that the rims had been spray painted red, there was red detailing on the sides of the car, and her steering wheel now had some orange accents. Rather than get upset however, she simply took to Facebook and posted a photo of her and her new ride, writing; 'I want to thank the car thieves for pimping out my vehicle for me.... This b***h is pimpin now!!!' She also attached a photo of the car which, given the date, many thought was a joke. It was not all 'lollipops and rainbows' though Schoenig told KSDK, and she is now getting the vehicle professionally cleaned to deal with the strong smell of cigarettes and marijuana. She is also creating a smoothie at the restaurant she owns, The Hot Pot, to honor Mick Sexton, the man who located her car and notified police. The Sexton on Wheels will feature banana, pineapple, peach and coconut cream. 'She's a very special person,' said Marlene Trice, a friend of Schoenig. 'She is vibrant and happy and really loves making people laugh.'","Becky Schoenig of St. Louis, Missouri was shocked when she realized her brand new 2015 Ford Fusion had been stolen from her driveway Monday .

"The 20-year-old deranged pizza delivery driver on trial for stabbing and strangling his roommate to death before having sex with her corpse was found guilty of first-degree murder on Thursday and sentenced to two life terms in prison. The Florida court heard  how Bryan Santana was living out some kind of sick fantasy when he removed all the lightbulbs of the Orlando home he shared with Shelby Fazio, 23, before waiting for the young woman to return, killing her and then abusing her body in October last year. Jurors were told Santana first choked Fazio in a headlock before wrapping a belt around her neck and stabbing her with a hunting knife. He then killed and mutilated her dog, and wrote messages in blood on the wall, including: ''I'm not sorry for what I did.' The panel took just two hours to deliberate on Thursday, and Fazio's family cried in their seats as the verdict was handed down. Maniac: Bryan Santana, 20, of Orlando, Florida, was found guilty of the the cold-blooded murder of his roommate, Shelby Fazio, 23, on Thursday. He was sentenced to life terms in prison . In court: The trial in Orlando lasted just three days, with Santana previously admitted to murdering the victim and raping her corpse, with the jury deliberating for two hours . Overcome: Family members of the victim, Shelby Fazio, weep as her killer is found guilty on Thursday . 'This is endless': Afterwards the family said they will 'never escape' the death of the young woman, who was murdered by her roommate, Bryan Santana . 'You will not be remembered. Oh but Shelby will': Judge Renee Roche was scathing in her closing statements, saying Santana 'no glimmer of humanity' Judge Renee Roche said Santana has 'no glimmer of humanity', according to WFTV. 'You will not be remembered. Oh but Shelby will,' Judge Roche said. 'Even her beloved dog will be remembered longer than the defendant.' Cindy Fazio, the victim's mother, said they will never properly deal with her death. 'No more pleasures in life. Each day is just another we don't have with Shelby. No more good days, only days we get through,' said Fazio's mother, Cindy Fazio. She called Santana a 'violent coward.' The victim's father, Terry Fazio, added: 'This is endless. We'll never escape. Hope you get it as bad as you did to Shelby.' Roche gave Santana two life sentences for the murder of Fazio and attempted murder of his second roommate. He was also found guilty of cruelty to animals, abuse of a dead human body and two counts of grand theft. Bryan Santana (left) of Orlando, Florida murdered his roommate Shelby Fazio (right) in October and sexually abused her dead body. He then killed her dog, stole their other roommates car, and went to get a haircut . Santana was also charged with attempted murder for allegedly attacking their third roommate with a knife and killing Fazio's dog (above), and using its blood to write messages on the wall . Prosecutors said Santana 'delighted' in the pain he allegedly caused the young woman. 'He delights in every moment of telling explicitly what he had done to Shelby,' Assistant State Attorney Mark Interlicchio told jurors during opening statements on Wednesday. The Orlando Sentinel reported Santana even messaged a friend and forewarned what was to come, claiming he was going to 'gut' someone, and then saying; 'I have zero money to pay my $400 rent so I'm going to do what I want. I will fulfill my deepest desires.' Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Charlie Murphy took to the stand on Wednesday, describing the grizzly scene he discovered when he arrived at the residence Fazio and Santana shared. 'I noticed a body laying on the ground, the door hit the left leg of the body,' he said. 'She was naked. I remember she had a belt around her throat and some type of pen or pencil shoved into her neck.' This came just days after Santana's lawyer argued that he is not competent to stand trial following an incident where he smeared feces all over himself and tried to hit a corrections officer at the courthouse during opening statements in the case. 'He has now soiled himself and smeared himself in feces and smeared the wall,' said Judge Renee Roche after the incident, according to WKMG. 'I've ordered security to clean him up and bring him up here in full restraints.' And while she allowed two doctors to examine the young man, she has made it clear that she has no time for this behavior. 'He certainly knows how to behave himself in the courtroom. He behaved himself very well yesterday. Now that the train is coming down the tracks at full speed, we are seeing some other behavior,' she said. 'I will not tolerate disruption in this courtroom. If I have to gag him, I will. If I have to remove him I will.' In earlier court documents, Santana confessed to the strangling, stabbing and sexual intercourse. He also claimed he has multiple personalities, including one named 'Michael.' In court documents, Santana (right) admitted to strangling and stabbing Fazio (left), a Disney World employee, to death, and then having sex with her corpse . Fazio, 23, had moved in with the young man to begin a job at Disney World. The two had a third roommate who Santana also allegedly tried to kill. That roommate claims Santana pepper sprayed him and came at him with a knife. 'He came at me, pepper sprayed me, I tried to knock the knife out of his hand and was successful in doing that,' said John Heermance. 'And then we wrestled in the living room area.' Heermance then testified on Wednesday that at this point Santana told him to go into his room and everything would be fine. After the incident, Santana is believed to have taken Fazio's car and tried to go to a Walmart to buy a toy gun in hopes that he would be shot dead if he pointed it at police, a jury heard. He also went and got a haircut. Friends say the young man no longer wanted to live. Laura Ramirez, a friend of Santana, said on the stand: 'He just said he was going to fulfill his fantasies.' She then added: 'He said he was going to gut her.'","Bryan Santana, 20, of Orlando, Florida, was found guilty of murdering his former roommate, Shelby Fazio, 23, on Thursday .

"Steven Howie (pictured) left his girlfriend with 18 injuries after assaulting her over a period of an hour in the room at a lonely inn on New Year's Eve . A thug beat up his girlfriend so badly after a cancelled New Year's Eve party that their hotel room resembled a 'bloodbath', a court has heard. Steven Howie, 28, of Dunfermline, left his girlfriend Karen Murray, 31, with 18 separate injuries after assaulting her over  an hour. Howie, a joiner, punched, kicked and kneed her during a prolonged assault, smashed furnishings, and pulled the door of their en-suite bathroom off its hinges. Because the inn was so isolated Miss Murray was unable to get a signal to call police and officers only arrived after guests in another room dialled 999. Stirling Sheriff Court heard that Howie and Miss Murray had been dating for about four months when they checked into the Carronbridge Hotel, in the Campsie Fells. The court heard they then travelled into Stirling for Hogmanay celebrations at Stirling Castle, which were meant to have been headlined by The Waterboys. Lindsey Brooks, prosecuting, said that 'alcohol was consumed' and at one point there was an argument about Howie speaking to another female. Miss Brooks said the argument was quickly resolved, but the Stirling Castle event was cancelled due to bad weather and the pair took a taxi back to the hotel about 10.30pm. When they got back to their room Howie began to shout and swear at Miss Murray calling her a whore and a liar. The depute fiscal said: 'Miss Murray said it came out of the blue. The accused then punched her in the face, causing her nose to bleed, punched her in the stomach, and kneed her in the back numerous times. The couple were staying at the Carronbridge Hotel (pictured) when he beat her in a brutal and sustained attack . 'Miss Murray was unsure how long this went on for, but she was able eventually to get the accused out of the room and lock the door. 'She was unable to call the police because of poor phone reception. 'A couple staying in the room next door heard a disturbance ongoing on and off for about an hour. They heard male voice being abusive, and banging, and a female crying.' The court heard half an hour later the couple heard a male voice saying 'open the door, I'll kill you' and a woman shouting 'go away'. They phoned police who found Howie in the hotel car park, heavily intoxicated, with blood on his t-shirt. Miss Murray was still in the room, which had been wrecked. Mrs Brooks said: 'There was blood on the carpet, on the bedding and in the bathroom. 'The bathroom door had been pulled off its hinges and a shower door had been broken. The bed and bedding were in disarray, and there were smashed lampshades. 'Miss Murray was crying. There was also a hole in the bedroom wall.' Howie was arrested and initially gave a false name and date of birth and made no comment to police. Miss Murray was taken to hospital in Larbert, Stirlingshire, where a police surgeon found she had suffered 18 separate injuries. They included a bruising under the eyes and on the nose, damaged lips, scratches, and bruises to her jaw, both arms and both shoulders, her leg and thigh and her abdominal wall. According to the police surgeon, they were the result of 'moderate to severe force'. The pair were due to attend Hogmanay celebrations at Stirling Castle (pictured) on New Year's Eve last year . Howie has now admitted threatening violence, assaulting and injuring Miss Murray, causing damage to the room, and giving a false name to police. His defence agent James Moncrieff said today: 'Since this incident, Mr Howie has not consumed any alcohol. 'He is extremely remorseful and recognises that this is a very serious offence. 'The report makes clear that Mr Howie has had a troubled background.' Mr Moncrieff told the court that Howie and his girlfriend are planning on rekindling their relationship. He added: 'He accepts and she accepts that they are both going to have to address what happened on the night in question.' Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Howie: 'I have taken account of all that has been said on your behalf. 'I am told that your partner who is the complainer, appears to wish to continue a relationship with you, that is a factor that I have taken into account. 'These offences are examples of sustained violence.' Sheriff Robertson said that 'in relation to the circumstances of the offences' and despite the complainers desire to continue the relationship, there is 'no alternative to a custodial sentence.' He sentenced Howie to eight months in prison.","Steven Howie, 28, attacked his girlfriend Karen Murray in a hotel bedroom .

"Shaquille Omar Hallisey (pictured) hit a stranger over the head with a bottle leaving his victim with a fractured skull . A thug who hit a stranger over the head with a bottle leaving his victim with a fractured skull has been jailed for four years. Shaquille Omar Hallisey's attack in Cardiff was described by a judge as 'a savage demonstration of violence in a public place'. The 20-year-old's victim Matthew Leeke, 38, had been out with friends and was making his way home alone when the assault took place. Prosecuting counsel Jeffrey Jones said witnesses described seeing three males behind Mr Leeke in Queen Street. They said the trio were arguing with Mr Leeke. 'They heard one say ""Walk away or else you are going to get hurt"" and then saw the defendant smashing a bottle over his head. 'He collapsed, hitting his head hard on the pavings and the three ran off.' Mr Leeke told police he remembered someone speaking to him and then people surrounding him trying to help. Cardiff Crown Court heard paramedics treated cuts to the back of his head and his forehead which had to be glued and stapled in hospital. He was taken by ambulance to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, and a scan showed a fracture. In a statement, he said he was now anxious to leave his house and was suffering dizziness and headaches. He said his wife and parents had also suffered a great deal of upset over what happened to him in June last year. Judge Philip Richards acknowledged that Hallisey's guilty plea to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm had been 'brave' but said it had been a long time coming. Hallisey had been due to stand trial before he changed his plea. 'You used a bottle as a weapon to strike another man over the head and he has been profoundly affected by it,' the judge told him. A judge at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) jailed Hallisey for four years after he admitted to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm . He also said that Hallisey, of Cardiff, had been the victim of violence himself when younger and now had a good partner who was standing by him. The judge said: 'I hope you resolve never to come before these courts again.' Caroline Rees, for Hallisey, said her client had known prison was inevitable but that he had a supportive family. 'He is normally a kind and gentle young man doing his best to live a good life against what has been a tragic background', she told Cardiff Crown.","Shaquille Omar Hallisey attacked Matthew Leeke in Queen Street, Cardiff .

"These are the last known movements of a murdered university student whose body was found in the boot of a burning car. Firefighters made the grim discovery of Janet Muller's body in Ifield, near Crawley, West Sussex on March 13. Police have now released video stills and footage of the 21-year-old University of Brighton student in Portslade on the night before her death. Scroll down for video . Janet Muller was seen walking in a subway in Portslade, East Sussex, at 10.30pm on March 12 . The images were released shortly after the youngster's family spoke about her 'bubbly' personality in a heartfelt tribute. The bright student's family described her as an 'inspirational, passionate and caring person' and said her death had left a 'deep hole' in their hearts. The day before the grim discovery, on March 12, Miss Muller had been reported missing from Mill View Hospital in Nevill Avenue, Hove, a Sussex Police spokesman said. She was then captured on CCTV at 10.33pm that night in a subway in Portslade. The second clip sees her in Station Road at 12.28am and the final one walking towards Brighton and crossing Sackville Gardens near the BP garage at 12.55am.

"Jailed: Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk . A conman has been jailed for stealing a pensioner's entire £401,000 life savings and using it to finance his dream wedding and honeymoon. Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk, a court heard. The 58-year-old siphoned off the £400,001 fortune over an eight-year period but when he was finally arrested he told police: 'I played him.' He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Warwick Crown Court yesterday after admitting fraud and deception after the judge ignored his plea for leniency because he was 'terrified' of going to prison. Sentencing him judge Alan Parker said: 'You plainly saw him as a soft target and you used him, and used him and used him. 'You told lies, some of them beyond wicked, and always you knew he would pay up. 'You lived a lavish lifestyle at the cost of an elderly man's life savings. Society demands that you should be punished.' He told the 80-year-old a string of lies that led to the elderly chartered accountant losing his Birmingham office and was forced to put his 'beautiful' home up for sale, the court heard. Franklin stole his money after telling him his sister had died in Canada and he desperately needed to fly there. He then said his father had died and needed a loan  until he inherited £500,000 - but in fact Franklin's father had died 20 years earlier. Before his fraud was revealed he had said that bailiffs were at the door demanding money. The victim was introduced to Franklin in 2005 and agreed to lend £15,000 for refurbishments to a restaurant Franklin ran in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Shocking: Franklin was jailed at Warwick Crown Court, pictured, which heard that his victim's life was made 'a disaster' because he was left without any money to buy a pint of milk . From there, Franklin fabricated sob story after sob story in an attempt to wring ever more cash from the pensioner, including tens of thousands more in loans. But Franklin, a former car dealership manager, was living the high life and even used the money for his Italian Alps wedding and honeymoon. Meanwhile the pensioner had ran out of money and endured days filled with fear. In a statement, he said the pressure had become overwhelming as Franklin's demands took over his life. 'My financial situation is a disaster,' he added. 'At times we have been so short of money to pay for basic food that we have had to search our pockets to get enough for a litre of milk.' Defending, Lee Marklew said Franklin's personal life had been destroyed by the case, and his wife had left him. 'The thought of the inevitable custodial sentence has been utterly terrifying,' he said. 'Since his arrest it has been a palpable fear which has affected the quality of his life.' But the judge ignored his plea and jailed him.","Kevin Franklin left his 80-year-old victim without any money to buy milk .

"An New Jersey police lieutenant who pleaded guilty to a lewdness charge after allegedly masturbating in a Starbucks says his post-traumatic stress disorder is to blame. In May 2014, Benito Gonzalez Jr.,46, was suspended from duty after being arrested for allegedly exposing his genitals and touching himself inappropriately while seated at a table in a Cherry Hill Starbucks, police say. A surveillance photo posted to the Cherry Hill police Facebook page led to the 17-year Camden police veteran's arrest -- the photo has since been deleted and is now being used as evidence, the Courier-Post reports. Blame: Benito Gonzalez, 46 (photographed), who pleaded guilty to a lewdness charge after allegedly masturbating in a Starbucks says his post-traumatic stress disorder is to blame . The father-of-three was found guilty of the offense last month and is currently suspended without pay, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports . While county officials are working to fire the lieutenant's, the Post reports, Gonzalez claims the incident -- which he says he does not remember -- is the culmination of a three-year downward spiral following a traumatic experience more than three years ago, the  Inquirer  reports. It all began in June 2011 when Gonzalez, who ran the department's narcotics unit, had an encounter with a drug dealer, 32-year-old Adam Reed. In the altercation, Gonzalez dived to the ground, injuring his hamstrings, as Reed fired shots at him from a handgun. Reed then pointed the gun at Gonzalez's head and pulled the trigger. But the weapon malfunctioned, saving Gonzalez's life, and Reed was later sentenced to 66 years in prison, the Inquirer reports. 'I just saw my life completely over,' Gonzalez told the Inquirer, 'I thought I was dead.' Gonzalez's career seemed to flourish and the 46-year-old was even promoted to lieutenant in 2013. But Gonzalez said he used his job as a way to escape his crumbling mental health. Starbucks: Police Say Gonzalez walked into this Starbucks in Cherry Hill, while off-duty, pulled down his pants and masturbated at one of the coffee-shops tables . In evaluations after the incident, psychologists recognized that Gonzalez had issues linked to the trauma and reportedly gave him the task of deciding whether to stay with the department. He chose to stay and tried hiding his problems from his co-workers telling the Inquirer that he didn't want to seem 'weak' or incapable of dong his job. In the years following the incident, Gonzalez would be diagnosed with PTSD, suffer panic attacks, experience flashbacks of the traumatic incident, and even contemplate suicide. It was not long after considering suicide that Gonzalez, while off-duty, walked into the Starbucks on Route 70 and committed the lewd act. Gonzales claims he was intoxicated and in a blackout state as a result of the trauma and only remembers drinking before going to the Starbucks and returning home that night, the Inquirer reports. He said he did not know he had been at the Starbucks until police contacted him and told him he was being charged. Gonzalez is set to appear at an administrative hearing Wednesday where his attorney will ask the department to briefly reinstate the lieutenant so he could apply for his more than $60,000 accidental-disability pension -- which law enforcement officials can receive after suffering disabilities from an incident, the Inquirer reports. The pension represents a majority of Gonzalez's income, needed to provide for his wife and three children, aged 16, 15, and 8. His wife says she fears the family will have to move from its home due to the financial strain. While the fate of Gonzalez's pension is unknown, the Post reports that a judge last month approved Gonzalez's participation in a conditional dismissal program. The program would require Gonzalez to undergo a one-year probationary period where he would be monitored. If he does not violate the probation, the lewdness charge could be dismissed, and he could have the charge expunged from his records six months later.","Camden, New Jersey, police lieutenant Benito Gonzalez, 46, pleaded guilty to a lewdness charge after touching himself inappropriately in a Starbucks .

"The Queen is hiring a sous chef who can develop their technical expertise using ‘the most organic and unique sources’ from her Royal gardens. The successful applicant will have to travel to various Royal residences - including Balmoral in Scotland - for three months of the year. They must also order in 'the freshest seasonal ingredients' from the Queen's private Scottish retreat's kitchen garden and game from the Royal estates. It comes after the Queen was revealed to have surprisingly simple tastes in food – including Special K, jam sandwiches, chocolate cake, venison and scones. The former personal chef to the Queen has revealed some of her favourite foods. From Special K to venison, chocolate cake and jam sandwiches . Based mainly at Buckingham Palace, the job pays around £28,000-a-year - but there is accommodation available ‘for which there is a salary adjustment’. All meals are provided. The advert on the Royal website says: ‘Joining this unique environment, you will be part of a team responsible for delivering daily catering for up to 500 staff, as well as canapé receptions for hundreds of guests, State banquets and the preparation of small private lunches.’ The Queen enjoys afternoon tea each day which includes scones, cakes and sandwiches with no crust .

According to the Queen’s former personal chef, Her Majesty is a woman of simple tastes. Darren McGrady, who worked at the Buckingham Palace kitchens for 15 years, previously revealed that while the 88-year-old Monarch feasts on elaborate dishes at state banquets, when at home she enjoys uncomplicated cuisine. Mr McGrady said that she traditionally starts the day with a light breakfast followed by lunch, afternoon tea and dinner, topped off with a generous gin and Dubonnet before bedtime. A typical lunch, served at 1pm, would be fish, such as a grilled Dover sole, placed on a bed of wilted spinach. In the evening the Queen will have venison (example pictured) or salmon from her estates . Chocolate cake has been revealed to be a favourite of the Monarch who is currently looking for a sous chef . At the end of each day the Queen indulges in a gin and Dubonnet (left), it is also said she likes jam sandwiches . Then there would be afternoon tea of cakes, scones and sandwiches using de-crusted bread.

"Pope Francis urged the international community not to 'look the other way' and act over the killings of Christians around the globe, during his Easter Monday address. Speaking to tourists and Catholic pilgrims in St Peter's Square, the pontiff asked for 'tangible help' from communities all over the world for Christians persecuted because of their faith - but stopped short of suggesting what actions should be taken. The Pope, aged 78, has been increasingly vocal about the fate of Christians being targeted by Islamic extremists in parts of the Middle East, Africa and Asia. A gust of wind blows as Pope Francis gives his Easter Monday address. He urged the international community not to 'look the other way' as Christians across the world face violence and attacks because of their religion . Hundreds of Catholic pilgrims and tourists stood in St Peter's Square in Vatican City to listen to the Pope speak on Easter Monday. He urged for 'tangible help' to Christians being persecuted around the globe . The latest address follows his speech on Easter Sunday, where he said he was praying for the victims of armed conflict, including the students massacred by Somali gunmen at a university in Kenya. He was also building on his Good Friday denunciation of what he then called 'complicit silence' about the targeting of Christians. 'They are our martyrs of today, and they are many. We can say that they are more numerous than in the first centuries', Pope Francis said. During his address on Monday he praised those who were 'sensitizing public opinion about the persecution of Christians in the world' Pope Francis reaches out to bless the crowd gathered below. He said the international community must not stand 'mute' as Christians having their basic human rights taken away because of their faith . The reflection of the Vatican, where Pope Francis gave his speech, can bee seen in this woman's sunglasses as she films the event. Hundreds flocked to the Holy See of the Catholic church in Rome for the address . Speaking from the window of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, Pope Francis asked for 'concrete participation and tangible help in defense and protection of our brothers and our sisters, who are persecuted, exiled, slain, beheaded, solely for being Christian.' He added: 'I hope that the international community doesn't stand mute and inert before such unacceptable crimes, which constitute a worrisome erosion of the most elementary human rights. I truly hope that the international community doesn't look the other way.' On Thursday militant Islamist group al-Shabab attacked the Garissa University, killing 148 people. Survivors said the militants spared Muslim students but taunted Christian and Jewish students before killing them. Pope Francis has used his Easter addresses to urge greater protection for Christian communities, after Christian students were killed in an attack on a Kenyan university by militant Islamist group al-Shabab . In Iraq and Syria, the advance of Islamic State group fighters has forced members of ancient Christian communities to flee their homes. Statistics from the International Society for Human Rights show Christians are the victims of 80 per cent of all acts of religious discrimination in the world today. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby hailed the victims of the Kenyan university massacre during his Easter Sunday sermon, adding that Christians must resist without violence the persecution they suffer. This is Pope Francis' third Easter since he was elected in 2011 as the head of the Catholic Church, which has 1.2 billion members worldwide.","Pope Francis says Christians coming under increasing number of attacks .

"Graffiti artists are hoping to raise a smile with stressed-out Beijing residents – by painting neglected phone booths so that they look like the lovable robot Baymax from the Disney movie Big Hero 6. An eight-strong team have transformed more than 30 telephone booths in China’s capital city into a representation of Baymax, who has attracted a cult following in the country. Xiao Wang told The People’s Daily Online that he and his fellow graffiti artists – most of them design students – worked through the night to complete project ‘Beijing Warmth’. Phone booths in Beijing have been painted in the style of Disney character Baymax by graffiti artists . The team of artists painted 30 phonebooths in five hours overnight, calling the project 'Beijing Warmth' The loveable character Baymax appears in the movie Big Hero 6 about a young boy with a talent for robotics . Starting at midnight, they hit the streets in teams of four to spend five hours working on the phone boxes, using a total of 24 cans of paint. The 28-year-old said that living and working in Beijing is ‘very stressful’ — adding that he himself had witnessed three people take their own lives in just one month. ‘We chose this area due to the higher population of young people’, he said, adding he thinks the team’s work has improved the road. However their work may soon be removed, after a spokesman from the Haidan Municipal Committee said the phone booths - usually red - should not have been painted a different colour. Artist Xiao Wang said they wanted to raise a smile with burnt-out Beijing residents who live stressful lives . As the Baymax craze sweeps China, a flight school even has their teacher dressing up as the robot . An official from the Beijing Municipal Government said there were no set rules on how to deal with graffiti, and the response was different depending on the content. If the artwork was not offensive and colouring matched the surroundings then it could be allowed to stay, he added. 'Big Hero 6' won the Oscar for the best animated feature in February this year, and its popular character Baymax has a won big following in China after it was released in February. The film became the highest grossing Disney film in China, taking in more than $51 million. Trainee flight attendants at the Sichuan Southwest Vocational College have began dressing like the robot during their lessons, while another craze has seen parents making dumplings in the shape of Baymax to encourage their children to eat.

"The new Honda Civic which the Japanese car firm’s UK factory in Swindon will be exporting to the world – including Japan and the USA – was unveiled in America tonight. The wraps came off the prototype of the new 10th generation car at the New York International motor show. It came just a day after it was announced that Swindon in Wiltshire will become the global production hub for the next generation five door Civic, supported by a new £200million investment. The ultra-sporty Honda Civic Concept car is presented at the New York International Auto Show, Wednesday . Although the dramatic Kermit green prototype seen in New York is a three-door version, the Swindon factory will be exporting the five-door hatchback version around the globe. A Honda spokesman said: ‘With more focus on sporty, fun-to-drive dynamics the new U.S. Civic line-up will include Civic saloon, Coupé and Si models, along with the return of the Civic five-door hatchback to the U.S. market. ‘ . These will be followed by the launch of a next generation Civic Type R in the U.S. market, as the ‘performance flagship’ of the Civic line-up. Currently, just over half of the vehicles produced at Swindon are exported to the Continent. But when the factory moves to dedicated Civic production next year, about 50 per cent of production will be exported to key markets outside of Europe, including Japan and now the USA. The Swindon factory will be exporting the five-door hatchback version of the Honda Civic around the globe . John Mendel, senior vice president, automobile operations of American Honda Motor Co., introduce the ultra-sporty Civic Concept car . Currently, just over half of the vehicles produced at Swindon are exported to the Continent . Philip Crossman, managing director of Honda UK said: ’This is significant announcement demonstrates the opportunity available to the Swindon operation and reinforces the quality and reliability of the product coming from our UK facility.’ Honda designer Guy Melville-Brown, a who worked on the new Civic’s exterior styling said: ‘This is the first time the Civic has been born in America. He promised the new Civic will have sporty proportions, with the windshield moved toward the rear, a shorter front overhang and longer rear overhang than the current Civic. The car will get new engines and transmissions, including a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder motor in higher-end models, Honda says. The sedan version will be in showrooms this fall, with a coupe and a high-performance R-Type coming later. Honda last rolled out an all-new Civic in 2011, and it was widely panned for bland styling, cabin noise and pedestrian handling.

"Some find them unnerving and even slightly creepy while, to others, they are endearing, mysterious and charming. Whatever your view, one thing’s for certain: when it comes to twins, particularly identical ones, they are an endless source of fascination. Yet, despite all this interest, the rest of us remain baffled, emotionally and scientifically, by the uncanny bonds identical twins share. Having spent a year researching twins for my new novel, I have come to realise that we are only beginning to grasp how strange they truly are and quite why they have compelled us for thousands of years. Ashley (left) and Mary-Kate Olsen (right) are two of the most famous twins in the world and despite their very similar appearances they are not actually identical twins . Take pre-colonial Brazilians, who thought twins were a product of adultery, resulting in the poor innocent mother often being executed for her supposed infidelity. Some primitive African societies abhorred twins because of the way multiple births resemble an animal’s litter. It wasn’t uncommon for the unlucky children to be slaughtered and their mother exiled. In Greek mythology, however, twins were believed to be the product of human intercourse with the gods, meaning they were sacred, while ancient Slavs maintained that twins shared one special soul. Not all monozygotic twins (i.e. twins born from a single fertilised egg) are truly identical. Some are ‘mirror image’ twins. This means that in one twin the hair might swirl clockwise, in the other twin it will swirl anticlockwise — but it will swirl in exactly the same way. For one twin, the left side of the mouth might curve upwards; in the other twin, the right side of the mouth has precisely the same curve. This peculiar ‘looking-glass effect’ extends to the positioning of internal organs. But many identicals are truly identical in ways we are still uncovering. Obviously, identical twins share facial characteristics and body shape. But they also share virtually identical DNA, meaning they are more closely related to each other than to anyone else, including their parents or their own children. Joel (left) and Benji Madden (right) are identical twins, it's likely that they will have grown more alike over time as their identical DNA asserts itself . A daring £5 million jewel heist was carried out at a Berlin department store in 2009. Closed-circuit TV showed one of three masked man removing a glove at the scene, which the police later recovered. The glove provided DNA evidence traced to identical twin brothers. But with no way of pinning it on one brother, both were acquitted. Identicals also share the same blood group, the same hormones, the same serum proteins; they are alike in heart rate, blood pressure, brain waves, respiratory rate and digestive process. Hospitals in America in the past have advised parents to discreetly tattoo one twin — with a tiny dot, or mark on a heel — so that in future the children can be differentiated. Parents often refuse, believing they will be able to distinguish their twins as they age (not least, by dressing them differently). This, however, can be a mistake because twins can grow more identical over time (as their identical DNA asserts itself, following different levels of nourishment in the womb). And twins often end up being dressed in exactly the same clothes anyway, lest one become jealous of the other getting ‘better’ treatment. Here, we enter the peculiar world of twin psychology. Over recent decades, scientists such as Thomas Bouchard, of the Minnesota Centre For Twin And Family Research, have analysed the personalities of twins and discovered seriously uncanny facts. Take the classic example of twins separated at birth. The extent to which they can echo each other in later life is breathtaking. One of my favourite cases is the separated twins who discovered, when reunited, that they both entered the sea on beach holidays by wading backwards up to their knees. Probably the most famous case of eerie identicality is that of Jim Lewis and Jim Springer. These identical American twins were separated when four weeks old, and adopted by different families in Ohio. When reunited at the age of 39, in 1979, they discovered that both of them suffered from tension headaches, both had worked as sheriff’s deputies and both smoked Salem cigarettes. Hunter (left) and Scarlett Johansson (right) are fraternal twins and so do not share the same strong characteristics and traits as identical twins do . They also drove exactly the same kind of car and both enjoyed woodworking in the garage. Both had been named James by their respective adoptive parents, and both had married twice — first to women named Linda, then to women called Betty. Both had produced sons named James Allan. Both had at one time owned dogs named Toy. And they both took their holidays at the very same beach in Florida. Some parents of twins have reported their children having identical dreams. Others recount twins suffering pains, in the same part of the body, when only one of them is hurt. Doctors who observe twins in the womb have watched identicals do a strange kind of matching twin dance: the fetal twins come close to each other, face to face, then one of the twins makes a circle, and the other does the very same. It as if they are, in utero, telepathically aware of each other’s movements. Even in death, twins share an incredible bond. A prime, if rather dark, example is the 72‑year‑old brothers in Finland. In 2002, they were killed on their bicycles on the same road in Northern Finland in two accidents, two hours apart. When one twin survives the death of another, they likewise possess an oddness which startles. Author Joan Woodward, in her 2009 study of twin bereavement, reported several striking examples of twins’ reactions when one of them dies. Some young twins simply do not believe the death, and continue to act as if the lost twin is alive, talking to the dead sibling at breakfast, in a shared twin language, for instance. John and Edward Grimes, commonly known as 'Jedward', are identical twins. Some parents of identical twins have observed them having identical dreams or even suffering pain in the same parts of the body . Other infant twins seem painfully confused as to whether their twin is really gone, because they keep seeing the living image of their dead sibling in the mirror or in a reflecting window; when they see themselves, they see the sibling. By contrast, a few bereaved twin children deliberately seek out mirrors in order to reassure themselves their dead twin lives on. They want to see the living ghost. Other twins react differently still. Woodward records how some, following the death of a co-twin, take over their lost sibling’s characteristics and behaviour, as if trying to make up for the loss by actually becoming the dead sibling. One twin whose brother died at the age of 12 became so eerily like his dead sibling that his parents were convinced he had the ‘spirit of his brother within him’. Another female twin was so grief-stricken she took her dead sister’s name. These strange reactions surrounding the deaths of identicals can have effects beyond the twins themselves. During my research, I came across one wholly remarkable example of twin confusion, following a death. It happened in California in the Nineties (though the details and names have been protected by the authorities, for obvious reasons). One day, driving off on holiday, the Andersons — father, mother and their identical twin daughters Samantha and Katie — had a terrible crash. An ambulance was called and the victims were cut from the car. However, after reaching the hospital, Samantha soon died and Katie was left in a coma. It was a horrific loss, but life had to go on. The family concentrated on helping the hospitalised Samantha get over the death of her twin. A funeral for Katie was held. And yet, as her surviving daughter improved, mum Sally found it strange that Samantha behaved so much like her dead sister. Finally, Sally studied her child’s birthmark very closely (the twins had similar but not identical birthmarks) and realised a terrible mistake had been made — Katie had survived and Samantha had died. This realisation occurred two weeks after the accident. The Andersons had buried the ‘wrong’ daughter. It was reading that extraordinary true-life story — and all these other facts — that gave me the idea for a thriller. What would happen if the Andersons’ experience was repeated, but the family only discovered their error a year later? What ghostly consequences might ensue? Whatever the answer, one thing I know for sure is that twins will continue to fascinate us because they pose so many profound and unsettling questions. S. K.

"David Light, account director at The Data Partnership, revealed the underhand tactics used by his company to coax information from people . Data bosses have been caught boasting to the Mail of the underhand tactics they use to trick homeowners into giving away their secrets. In meetings with our undercover reporters, they admitted ignoring an official no-call list meant to protect the vulnerable. And they said they could never be honest with people about the consequences of passing on personal information because then no one would answer their calls. ‘We’re a business at the end of the day,’ one told the Mail. ‘If we was [sic] to then turn round and say, “You’re now going to get 30 calls from this company, that company”, most of the people will probably say, “I don’t want it”. Because they know it’s going to be a sales call.’ Various firms offered to sell personal information to the Mail’s undercover team using data from lifestyle surveys completed by people who had been cold-called from overseas. They claimed that calling offshore meant they could disregard the official Telephone Preference Service (TPS) – even though the Information Commissioner’s Office said this was not true. Once they get people on the phone, the call centre workers ask them to complete a lifestyle survey. They start with ‘soft’ questions that seem harmless before going into ones about personal finances. While a brief disclaimer is read, bosses admitted victims do not realise answering the questions will lead to dozens of calls from different companies. Scroll down for video . The questions are sponsored by firms looking to target people with specific interests, and answers are sold on. So even if a caller has signed up to the TPS, saying yes to a survey question is seen to override this, giving the companies the green light to cold call them again. An undercover reporter from the Mail met David Light, account director at The Data Partnership (TDP), which has a 60-seater call centre in the Philippines and calls hundreds of thousands in Britain every month. Mr Light's company has a 60-seater call centre in the Philippines and calls hundreds of thousands in Britain every month. He explained that their tactics include starting with warm questions before going more financial . Asked if he thought people doing surveys understood they would get sales calls as a result he said 'generally I don't think some people realise that they're going to get calls' For 8p a record, Mr Light offered to sell the Mail information on people with pensions who had completed a survey as long as four years ago . He said: ‘So at the top you have your typical questions which are nice and easy, warm questions to open up – what is the age of your TV. ‘When you start going more financial – how much you’re earning, would you like a [pension] review – [they say] “no I’m not interested. I don’t want any sales calls. No, I’m going, bye”.’ Mr Light said any answers given before the call ended were taken as confirmation that the caller was happy to be on marketing lists in future. ‘I mean, we’re a business at the end of the day,’ he said. ‘When you try and dig into people’s lifestyles or try to find out information – with all that goes on with credit card fraud and identity theft – people are a little bit reserved to give out certain information.’ So questions about finance were left to later in the call, he explained. Asked if he thought people doing the surveys understood they would get sales calls as a result, he said: ‘If I’m honest, and I’m always honest, generally I think some people don’t realise that they’re going to get calls.’ Mr Light said his firm try to get round the no-call list by ringing mobiles – which few realise can be on the TPS – and by calling from abroad. ‘The problem we’re having now, a lot of it might be on the TPS register. Hence why when we call out offshore,’ he said. ‘Certain companies will say to us, “Can you run it against the TPS file and tell us what you’ve got which is non-TPS?” OK, fine. But the volumes will drop drastically.’ Asked how the firm gets away with calling people registered with the TPS, he said: ‘Because it’s offshore.’ He claimed, wrongly, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) regulations govern only calls within the UK. For 8p a record, Mr Light offered to sell the Mail information on people with pensions who had completed a survey as long as four years ago. The Data Partnership is run by John Pooley, 38, and his wife Victoria, 35, who claim they are the ‘good guys’ in ‘an industry rife with cowboys’. They started more than a decade ago from a garage in Chelmsford before turning it into a firm with a turnover of more than £2million. A spokesman said: ‘We strongly refute any allegations which suggest TDP is in any way contravening the law or any recognised code of practice. Respondents to our telephone-based surveys are informed from the outset that our surveys are being carried out for marketing purposes. They are not for market research. If respondents “opt-in” they clearly expect to receive calls and be contacted again.’ Data firm Communication Avenue also admitted calling names on the TPS register from call centres in the Philippines, India and South Africa. Account manager Byron Highfield told us: ‘If you’re wanting to sponsor a question then no, we wouldn’t TPS it, because we have their name and they asked if they’re interested in receiving a call back.’ Communication Avenue is owned by Philip and Charlotte Lightfoot and is a rebranding of Phruit, which was suspended by the Direct Marketing Association in 2011 for calling people on the TPS and selling under the guise of research. The Data Partnership has strongly refuted allegations suggesting it is contravening the law or any recognised code of practice . The firm said it does not own offshore call centres but buys survey data from other firms, including The Data Partnership. Mr Lightfoot said: ‘Communication Avenue takes compliance very seriously.’ Steve Eckersley, the ICO’s head of enforcement, said: ‘Organisations cannot get around the law by pretending to conduct market or lifestyle research. Market research should be just that – market research without the intention of passing on people’s details. Using a foreign call centre does not get you out of your commitments to consumers.’ David Light said callers start with 'soft' questions like 'how old is your main TV in you property' Data Partnership’s David Light boasted to a Mail undercover reporter of the tactics used by his firm to coax information from people it cold calls. ‘When you try and dig into people’s lifestyles or try to find out information – with all that goes on with credit card fraud and identity theft – people are a little bit reserved to give out certain information. ‘Like if you was to call me and say, “What’s your household income?”, I don’t wish to answer that. I don’t want to tell you what I’m earning. Because, I don’t know, you could be some lucrative crime gang, know where I live, know I earn over £50k a year, and you think right, well if he’s earning more than £50k a year, he’s probably going to have a nice car, he’s probably going to have some nice valuables in there. ‘So we find that when you get to them sort of questions, we leave them to the bottom of the survey. So at the top you have your typical questions which are nice and easy, warm questions to open up – How old is your main TV in your property? Is it less than one year, one to five years or five years plus? Which newspaper do you read? Do you have Sky through a satellite dish? Yes? OK, when’s your household insurance up for renewal? What month only. So soft questions. ‘When you start going more financial – how much you’re earning, would you like a [pension] review? – [they say] “No I’m not interested. I don’t want any sales calls. No, I’m going, bye”. They put the phone down. So we’ve only got the opt in for them answers what they’ve opted in. ‘If I’m honest, and I’m always honest, generally I think some people don’t realise that they’re going to get calls. I mean, we’re a business at the end of the day. If you go, “You’re going to get 30 calls on the back of this”, you’re going to get a consumer going, “I don’t want to tell you any information”. It’s natural, it’s human nature. ‘If we was to then turn round and say at the end of the survey call, “Right you’re now going to get 30 calls from this company, that company”, most of the people will probably say, “I don’t want it”. ‘Nine times out of ten they’ll probably say, “No I don’t want to be contacted by that company” because they know it’s going to be a sales call.’","Data bosses were caught boasting their underhand tactics to reporters .

"The former police chief of two small towns where Warren Jeffs' church dominates has admitted putting the church's interests above the law out of fear his family would be taken away. In an interview with ABC News, Helaman Barlow, who was chief of the bordering towns of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, says he is revealing the secrets after leaving the church behind. His account comes amid reports that Jeffs continues to direct the Fundamentalist Church of Latter-Day Saints despite being in prison for marrying and raping two 12-year-old girls. Other accounts say that some of its former adherents - including Barlow - are turning their backs on the church and changing the towns by setting up public schools and auctioning off property. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Helaman Barlow, who was chief of the bordering towns of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, said he acted on the orders of the church's leader, Warren Jeffs, out of fear of losing his family . The changes are welcome for Barlow, who said he lived in fear that Jeffs and other leaders would take his wife and children away from him if he didn't act as they wanted. After joining the force 20 years ago, Barlow said he quickly learned that officers worked with the church's security unit, known as 'The God Squad'. 'This community has always been a theocracy,' he said. 'They have a huge network of cameras in this community. They can watch every street.' He told the U.S. Department of Justice that marshals knew of underage marriages that were taking place in the community and failed to do anything to stop it. He said he was also asked by a city official to alter police reports. Locked up: Fundamentalist Church of Latter-Day Saints leader Warren Jeffs, left in his mug shot and right in prison in 2008, is serving life behind bars for marrying and having sex with two underage girls . Former life: Barlow is pictured during his time as police chief but said he has now left the church . Barlow added that when Jeffs was on the run and being sought as one of the FBI's 'Most Wanted', he taped conversations with law enforcement officials and passed them onto Jeffs. 'I knew it was wrong, but it was a way for me to keep my value up,' he told ABC News. He said he acted in ways he now regrets because he feared that his family would be taken away. 'With one phone call, he could call me and say,""yeah, you're out"",' he said. 'Then he could call [my wife] and say, ""he had no priesthood, he has to go, you have to leave him"".' Barlow said after years of protecting the church, he eventually decided to leave. He has since grown out his hair and his beard to signal that he is turning his back on them. 'I stopped and realized that the religion that I was trying to go to, the church I was trying to attend, was nothing like the church that I was raised in, that I was born into, that I was married in,' he said. Community: The church determines much of the activity in Hildale, Utah, which is seen at the base of Red Rock Cliff mountains, and its sister city, Colorado City, Arizona, in the foreground . 'It was entirely different... then I stopped and went, ""why am I trying to go to a different church than I believe in? I'm done with that"".' Federal investigators are now suing the towns' governments, accusing them of being controlled by the church. In a statement, an attorney for the local governments denied that officials are controlled by the church. Of Barlow, he added: 'We question his credibility, since he repeatedly lied under oath' - an accusation Barlow has not denied.

"When retired hairdresser Theodosia Aresti, 71, moved into a new-build flat in London five years ago, the frail pensioner thought she had found her dream home. But after a blocked pipe unleashed a 'tsunami of sewage' from the nine-storey building's 239 other flats into her apartment, her hopes of a contented retirement were ruined - and she says she now hopes to move. Mrs Aresti's nightmare began when she noticed a foul smell coming from her bathroom and discovered an unidentifiable brown substance bubbling up through the plughole in her bath. Scroll down for video . Traumatic: Theodosia Aresti was left devastated when her flat became flooded with raw sewage . 'I always keep my bath clean and I looked down and all I could see was this brown stuff coming out,' she remembers. 'It was bad. It was very bad. Within half an hour, it [the bath] was over half full.' But worse was to come. '10, 20 minutes later, the bath stopped filling  but the toilet, it made a terrific noise and then, when I looked, it was half full. 'Then it started filling up and filling up and filling up. And then it was gushing out. It started flooding the flat everywhere.' With raw sewage pouring into her flat, Mrs Aresti phoned her daughter Kiki and grandson Nicos and begged them to come to her aid. She also got in touch with the company in charge of maintaining the nine-story block of flats to tell them that waste was pouring into her flat. 'I phoned the maintenance people and I said, it looks like sewage stuff coming out the bath. He said, sorry, no, no, no, you should get a plumber because I'm busy and it's Sunday. Disgusting: The flood started with her bath, which started filling up with 'brown lumps' Overflowing: Mrs Aresti's toilet began overflowing with sewage 'like a volcano' according to grandson Nicos . Revolting: The toilet and bath both began overflowing with sewage, flooding Mrs Aresti's flat in the process . 'When the man arrived, it was too late. He was too late. Everything was ruined.' Grandson Nicos Doukanaris was one of the first to come to his grandmother's aid and says the toilet resembled a 'volcano'. 'I came in through the front door and I could see the toilet,' he remembers. 'It was like a volcano, that's how bad it was. Just never ending. You could see she was visibly distraught.' But worse was to come. Despite the best efforts of the plumber, who spent four hours trying to stem the tide of sewage, the excrement was strewn all over the flat and had soaked into carpets. Worst of all was the mess in her bedroom which, according to daughter Kiki, both smelled 'foul' and 'was unhealthy' thanks to the sodden carpet. Maintenance workers, however, were unable to visit for four days - leaving a distressed Mrs Aresti to sleep in a room filled with sewage for three nights. Devastated: The disgusting episode has left Mrs Aresti desperate to find a new home . Furious: Mrs Aresti's daughter Kiki and grandson Nicos were took part in the clean-up operation . Damage: Mrs Aresti's bedroom carpet was soaked in sewage and had to be replaced afterwards . 'The bedroom it was soaked,' she says. 'The carpet was full of sewage but I was still sleeping in there. It was disgusting. I felt dirty, I couldn't eat. All I was doing was just crying.' Eventually, workmen came in to remove the carpet but when they lifted it up, the movement caused her wardrobe to collapse - soaking everything in it in sewage. It was, says Kiki, the final straw for her mother. 'It was one thing after another and it just destroyed her flat completely,' she says. 'It almost gave her a nervous breakdown.' Although Mrs Aresti's carpet has now been replaced and her flat fumigated, she says the experience has left her desperate to find a new home. 'If I could afford to move, I would move from here tomorrow because I just don't feel happy any more,' she says. 'But I don't know how I'm going to be able to do it. I'm just going to have to wait.'","Theodosia Aresti, 71, was horrified when sewage erupted from her bath .

"A cafe owner has laid down a challenge to diners with a gut-busting morning meal that contains a whopping 4,000 calories. Olly Taylor, 27, is offering his version the Easter Feast, which is stuffed with the equivalent of almost 100 teaspoons of sugar, at his Black Milk cafe in Manchester's Northern Quarter. The breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an Easter egg, with brownies, marshmallows and mini eggs, topped off with three different types of flavoured milk. The Easter Feast breakfast is available at The Black Milk Cereal Cafe in Manchester's Northern Quarter . Up for the challenge: Customer Glen Keogh attemps the 4,000-calorie meal which has 388g of sugar . The meal is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons. For £7, customers looking to get their day off to a jittery start will be treated to a 291g milk chocolate Easter egg, with one half used as a bowl, served on a bed of baked and caramelised white chocolate to support the structure. Two cereals of choice are added together with a Creme Egg, a handful of Mini Eggs, home-made chocolate brownie and a Flake chocolate bar. Marshmallows and M&M's are thrown into the mix, before the whole dish is generously drizzled in homemade dulce de leche - an Argentinian take on condensed milk - and salted caramel sauce. He starts off in high spirits, pouring the first of the three milks into his chocolate 'bowl' Mr Keogh takes on the Easter Feast (left)  but barely gets through before he regrets his decision (right) Finally, customers are treated to three milks of choice which can be taken from a range including black squid ink milk, chocolate, strawberry, vanilla and good old semi-skimmed. Mr Taylor, whose cafe specialises in world cereals, milkshakes and cheesecake, says he has carried his fine-dining and knowledge of being a wine sommelier into Black Milk. He created the Easter Feast Challenge to celebrate the gluttony of Easter. Cadbury's chocolate egg (291g): 150g sugar; 1,400 calories . Baked caremalised white chocolate: 9g sugar; 80 calories .

'Easter is less about what is used to mean, and now on Easter Sunday people try and go through as many chocolate eggs as they can, so this is another challenge for them. 'No one has managed to finish it yet but we'll be running it until the end of the Bank Holiday to see if anyone can.' He said the initial idea for the Easter Feast came to him after seeing soup served inside giant bread bowls in Paris and he wanted to transfer the concept to the cereal market. 'I want to push it further and come up with wacky concoctions and push the limits of cereal and milk and what you can do with it,' he said. Although his cafe may stake a claim to creating Britain's most tooth-rotting dish, Mr Taylor is keen to point out some of the shop's biggest sellers are muesli, Special K and protein granolas used as an after-gym snack. Sweet-toothed customer Glen Keogh bravely attempted the challenge, opting for Toffee Crisp and a kosher cereal from Israel as his two choices. He said: 'I absolutely love chocolate, so this seemed like it would be a doddle at first. 'After tucking straight into the Crème Egg, the Flake and the brownie, I realised even that was more chocolate than anybody needs to eat in one sitting. 'The cereal was delicious, but like the Easter Egg bowl once the milk was poured, I started to crumble. 'Ten minutes, an aching belly and fuzzy teeth later, I called it a day with just the bowl to spare. My nine-year-old self would have been disappointed, but he didn't have to pay to go to the dentist!'

"This is the terrifying moment a woman drives the wrong way down a highway and plows into oncoming traffic in an apparent suicide attempt. Jack Rivera, a New York trucker, captured the collision on his dashcam as he drove along the Interstate 35E in Texas last Wednesday. Footage shows the driver of a black SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, coming off at the 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane. She then steers head-on into a truck which rolls over on its side with debris flying everywhere. As the back end of the 18-wheeler swings out, it pushes a red pickup truck off course. Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air. Rivera told waxahachietx.com that once things came to a standstill he got out of his vehicle to see if he could offer any assistance to the parties involved before authorities arrived. The incident, which occurred just past 6pm, shut the highway for around two hours. Mayeaux, from Waco, Texas, was transported to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas because of the injuries she sustained during the wreck.

Nearly 3,400 miles were covered with 99 percent of the drive in fully automated mode. Scroll down for video . Nearly 3,400 miles were covered with 90 percent of the drive in fully automated mode. The nine-day trip crossed 15 states and the District of Columbia. Along the way, the vehicle encountered complex driving situations such as traffic circles, construction zones, bridges, tunnels, aggressive drivers and a variety of weather conditions. The team collected nearly three terabytes of data—about 30 percent of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress. The drive was used by Delphi engineers to research and collect information that will help further advance active safety technology – the most rapidly growing technology sector of the auto industry. The team collected nearly three terabytes of data—about 30 percent of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress. 'Our vehicle performed remarkably well during this drive, exceeding our expectations,' said Jeff Owens, Delphi chief technology officer. 'The knowledge obtained from this trip will help optimize our existing active safety products and accelerate our future product development, which will allow us to deliver unsurpassed automotive grade technologies to our customers.' The nine-day trip crossed 15 states and the District of Columbia. Along the way, the vehicle encountered complex driving situations such as traffic circles, construction zones, bridges, tunnels, aggressive drivers and a variety of weather conditions. Delphi, one of the largest suppliers of automotive electronics and safety systems, is using the long journey in the Audi crossover to acquire real-world data from a sophisticated array of cameras, radar and lidar - a laser mapping technology - as well as wireless connected-vehicle technology. The firm also wants to test and demonstrate its active safety systems, which are being developed with such suppliers as Mobileye NV, an Israeli maker of computer vision and collision avoidance systems, and software provider Ottomatika, a spinout from Carnegie Mellon University's self-driving car program. Delphi's demonstration underscores growing interest and investments by automakers and suppliers in self-driving cars, some of which could be production-ready by 2020. Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, sees the automated driver assistance systems in the Audi as building blocks on the road to fully self-driving cars in the next decade. The Delphi drivebegan  March 22 near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, with plans to wind up in New York City just before the annual auto show opens there on April 3. During the coast-to-coast journey in the Audi, at least two Delphi engineers will be aboard, including one behind the wheel. Delphi, a former General Motors Co unit domiciled in the UK, will test such functions as traffic jam assist, automated highway pilot with lane change and automated parking and valet. All of those systems are expected to be introduced in production cars over the next two to three years. Although automakers and suppliers will have such capability within the next five years, Owens said, 'our view is that the driver is going to be in the seat for a long time' in case of emergency situations that self-driving systems may not be equipped or programmed to handle.

Delphi is providing some of the components and technology, including vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, for GM's Super Cruise automated driving system, which will debut in 2016 on the new Cadillac CT6 sedan. During the cross-country trek, the vehicle will be challenged under a variety of driving conditions from changing weather and terrain to potential road hazards -- things that could never truly be tested in a lab. 'Delphi had great success testing its car in California and on the streets of Las Vegas,' said Owens. 'Now it's time to put our vehicle to the ultimate test by broadening the range of driving conditions. 'This drive will help us collect invaluable data in our quest to deliver the best automotive grade technologies on the market.'","Drive began on  March 22 near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge .

"Michael Bloomberg wants to be mayor again - but in London rather than New York City, according to reports. Bloomberg, who was elected to the top Big Apple job three times in a row, has reportedly turned his sights across the Atlantic, where he dreams of replacing incumbent Boris Johnson. According to Britain's Sunday Times, Bloomberg, 73, is 'considering' the move, and has the backing of senior officials in Britain's Conservative Party. Scroll down for video . Passing the torch? Michael Bloomberg, right, is pictured above with London mayor Boris Johnson. He is reportedly considering standing for Johnson's job in 2016 . Bloomberg has significant business interests in the city. His Bloomberg financial information company has offices there, while he personally owns a $30million mansion. In the past he has described London as his 'second home'. His ex-wife is a British citizen, as are his two daughters. Though Bloomberg holds U.S. citizenship, sources told the Sunday Times that officials could arrange for a switch to make him eligible for high office. London is due a new mayor in 2016. Boris Johnson, who was himself born in New York City, will then have held the position for eight years. 'Job swap': Johnson, right, who is seen as a future Prime Minister, once joked about swapping jobs with Bloomberg, left, who has said he thinks of London as a 'second home' If Michael Bloomberg does become Mayor of London, it would be the latest twist in a long career which has seen him rise to the top in both business and politics. He started his career as an investment banker with Salomon Brothers, and when he was laid off from the firm in 1981 he used his $10million payout to start his own financial information company, Bloomberg LP. The firm is best known for the 'Bloomberg terminals' which provide real-time updates on the financial markets and are now ubiquitous on banks' trading floors. Bloomberg has also spawned an network of news outlets including a cable TV station, financial news website and the magazine Businessweek. In 2001, Mr Bloomberg entered politics by running as the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, and spent $73million of his own money getting elected. He went on to serve 12 years as mayor, drawing praise for his businesslike management of city government, but he courted controversy with high-profile decisions such as banning smoking indoors and outlawing extra-large sodas. Despite his repeated electoral success, Mr Bloomberg has faced opposition from the Left over his close links to Wall Street, while the Right has reacted with anger against his campaign to impose new restrictions on gun ownership across the US. Johnson is also standing for a seat in Britain's parliament in the country's May elections. He has said if he wins he will stay in the mayor's job until 2016, while serving as MP for the London constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the same time. He has long been spoken of as a future Prime Minister, and was recently named by incumbent David Cameron as a potential successor. Johnson has spoken before of the advantages of a new mayor coming in, though he could technically run for a third term. Speaking in 2013 to London radio station LBC, he said: 'The reality is that after eight years you've been at it for a long time in a very big job. 'You see what happens to people who do things for too long. You've got to be fair to the electorate, you've got to be sure you are doing your best. 'There will come people who will have fantastic ideas and who will have fresh ways of thinking about things.' Bloomberg and Johnson have met before - and at one meeting in 2013, Johnson even joked about doing a 'job swap' with Bloomberg - though there is no suggestion Johnson has set his sights on New York City. A source close to Johnson told the Sunday Times: 'Mike is an enormous friend of London. He’s a great contributor to the city. He’s got many supporters and admirers of which Boris is definitely one.' If indeed Bloomberg decided on an unlkely run for mayor, he would have to jump through some hoops. As an American citizen he would have to apply for British residency. This process is lengthy but can be speeded up if the person invested $15 million into the country. This would present no difficulties for Bloomberg who is the 13th richest man in the world, worth $36 billion. Ineed, both of Bloomberg's daughter's are British and his ex-wife is Susan Brown, is from the north of England.","Three-time NYC mayor is rumored to be have his sights on London .

"A woman who thought she lost everything after her apartment was left uninhabitable after last Thursday's gas explosion in New York's East Village has been reunited with her two cats. Kathleen Blomberg, a resident at the heavily damaged 125 Second Ave., which is still under a full-vacate order, has been reunited with her two cats, Kitty Cordelia and Sebastian. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals found the the traumatized animals under Blomberg's bed and said it took about an hour to coax them out. Scroll down for video . Kathleen Blomberg, who lived in a building badly damaged by Thursday's explosion has been reunited with her two traumatized cats, Kitty Cordelia, pictured, and Sebastian . Two people died and 22 were injured in last week's explosion, which authorities now believe was caused by an illegally tapped gas line . Blomberg was asleep in her apartment when the explosion happened and she rushed out to see to had happened. 'I thought I would have an opportunity to go back upstairs to get the cats, but as soon as we came down, they started sealing off the building,' Blomberg told CBS2. She had been desperately searching for her two cats she left behind, putting up fliers and posting on social media and she was reunited with them on Wednesday. 'I have no words, because, I mean, they're my children,' she said. 'They're not just cats.' After 21 years in the same apartment Blomberg is currently looking for new accommodation for her and the cats. A number of pets were also displaced in the rush for people to evacute their homes following the explosion. Seven cats have been missing since Thursday, but today that number thankfully dropped to four. 'I have no words, because, I mean, they're my children,' said an emotional Blomberg following the reunion . Sebastian, left, and Kitty Cordelia, right, had spent the past six days covering under Blomberg's bed in her abandoned apartment which is still under a full-vacate order . Another cat, Laszlo, was found inside a closet on the fourth floor of the building and returned to its owner, Yvonne Collery. Collery is still missing her second cat, Lulu. The ASPCA, FDNY and NYPD are still working to locate other missing animals at the explosion site. Two people died and 22 were injured in last week's explosion, which authorities now believe was caused by an illegally tapped gas line. New York City's mayor says three of the four people critically injured in the fire and explosion have been released from the hospital. Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference Monday that the remaining patient was in Bellevue Hospital and 'doing well.' He said fire marshals, the NYPD and the district attorney's office were investigating the cause of Thursday's apparent gas explosion. It killed two people and leveled three buildings. De Blasio said he hasn't ruled out policy changes, or tougher penalties for those caught tampering with gas, but the investigation must conclude that first. The mayor says most residents in the surrounding area who were evacuated immediately after the blast have returned to their homes.

"A woman who suffers daily abuse because she has a beard is thrilled after learning she will be undergoing laser treatment to get rid of her facial hair for good. Mother-of-two Cheryl Howe, 32, from Morecambe, was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at the age of 12, and suffers from excessive hair growth on her face, breasts, stomach and legs. She has been fighting for six years for treatment on the NHS, spending £2,000 a year on razors, and shaving up to three times a day. Scroll down for video . Cheryl, pictured with her daughter Sharon who is now 14, was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 12 . She suffers from excessive hair growth on her face, breasts, stomach and legs . Along the way she's had support from celebrities such as Kym Marsh, Ted Robbins and Edwina Currie. She finally got approved for NHS funding for laser hair removal treatment, which costs a minimum of £10,000. Cheryl has had initial appointments and is booked in for September this year. She said: 'I'm going to be a real girl and I can't wait. 'I was in tears when I found out. I've suffered years and years of abuse and finally something is happening. 'My hair growth has cost me jobs, relationships - it even ruined my first few years with my daughter. I couldn't be a mum or a wife, because I just didn't feel like a woman.' Cheryl suddenly began growing hair on her chest and legs at the age of 12. She had heavy periods from the age of eight. The 32-year-old says her body hair, shown here growing on her arm, has cost her jobs and relationships . Cheryl fought for six years for treatment on the NHS before finally getting approved. She says she had to shave up to three times a day to keep her face, chin and neck stubble-free . The mother-of-two is booked in for the £10,000 treatment in September this year, to tackle unsightly hair on her stomach, face and chest . She says: 'I was bullied and beaten up at school. I used to get called Gorilla and Cheesy Cheryl.' She was diagnosed with PCOS and doctors prescribed the contraceptive pill, believing that her problems would improve. Cheryl says: 'The pill didn't help at all. I had periods for 28 days a month and the hair just kept on growing. I had thick hair on my face, breasts, stomach and legs. 'My older brother, John, taught me how to shave my face and I had to shave two or three times a day.' Cheryl was warned she would be unlikely to be able to have a baby, but at 17, she had a one-night stand and gave birth to her daughter Sharon, now 14. Cheryl says: 'He was the first boy to ever show me any attention and I had a one-night stand. But I can't regret it, because my daughter came along.' But with so many personal issues of her own, Sharon struggled with motherhood. She walked out on her daughter, leaving her own mother to care for her. Her doctors believed she had suffered a nervous breakdown. She gradually formed a bond with her daughter - but doctors then found two cancerous tumours on her ovary. They were removed, and she was told she would be unable to conceive again. But in January 2008, she fell pregnant for a second time with her son, Jack, now six. This time, the bond was instant and she adored him. Cheryl says: 'Jack made me see life through his eyes. He would cuddle me and say: ""Mummy, I don't mind your prickles.""

Cheryl now has a great relationship with her children Sharon, 12, and Jack, six, pictured . But her relationship with Jack's father broke down, because, Cheryl says, he was unable to cope with her excess hair. She says: 'When we got together, he insisted he didn't mind. But no man likes to see their partner shaving their chest, boobs and chin. It drove us apart.' She has also been targeted by trolls on the internet. Following last year's Eurovision song contest, featuring bearded drag queen act Conchita Wurst, she received Facebook messages saying: 'Did you see yourself on television last night?' and 'Can you see the resemblance?' Cheryl says: 'I had messages pushed through my door and I became too afraid even to go out. I lost my job and my self-esteem was very low. 'But I got lots of support too. People from all over the world apologised for what was said to me. Even Conchita Wurst sent me a message saying ""I really apologise, you shouldn't be penalised."" 'We are all unique. People should judge a person by who they are, not what they look like.'

She set up the Inspiration Foundation forum and support group, which currently has 7,000 girls and women with PCOS as members, and has had support from Edwina Currie, Kym Marsh and Ted Robbins. Cheryl also has a campaign page called Stand Up To PCOS. She has now finally received confirmation that she will receive the funding for the treatment. She says: 'My daughter, Sharon, gave me a hug for the first time in years. I hope this might bring us closer. 'Jack says he loves me and my prickles. He doesn't mind how I look. 'This isn't cosmetic.

"Banning dangerous criminals from open prisons is illegal even if they have a history of absconding, judges ruled today in a major blow to the Government. The High Court threw out rules introduced to stop violent prisoners being transferred out of high-security jails. The policy was brought in after fugitive armed robber Michael Wheatley - nicknamed the Skull Cracker – walked out of an open jail in May while on day release  despite a history of prison escapes. Michael Wheatley - nicknamed the Skull Cracker – walked out of an open jail in May while on day release and went on to commit an armed robbery which was caught on CCTV (left) Wheatley absconding from Standford Hill prison in Kent  and went on a robbing spree – pulling a handgun on staff at the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. After being caught he was told that he must serve at least eight years in jail before becoming eligible to apply for release on parole. The violent thug had previously been handed 13 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2002 and earned his nickname by pistol-whipping his victims. Following the scandal, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling publicly announced that the Government was 'tearing up the system as it exists at the moment' and introduced his absconder policy. But two senior judges at London's High Court have ruled that excluding transfers  for prisoners with a history of absconding was unlawful. Wheatley was eligible for release after eight years, had been on the run after leaving Standford Hill open prison in Kent on day release and failing to return. He was arrested alongside another man in Tower Hamlets, east London, after an armed robbery at a Chelsea Building Society branch in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. The Ministry of Justice today announced they would appeal against the ruling. New rules were introduced after  Wheatley walked out of an open jail in May while on day release last year despite a history of prison escapes . A spokesman said: 'The fundamental principles of the policy are not unlawful. The court found there was inconsistency with the implementation. 'Our position remains that temporary release can be an important part of rehabilitating offenders but not at the cost of public protection. We are appealing this decision.' But the Prisoners' Advice Service, a charity offering free legal advice and support to adult prisoners, described the absconder policy as a 'knee jerk reaction' by Mr Grayling. The charity said in a statement: 'The Secretary of State's contention that he is entitled to ignore and contradict his own policy guidance demonstrates either his ignorance or flagrant disregard for basic legal principles of consistency and transparency in public decision making. 'The so called 'absconder policy' was introduced as a knee jerk reaction to negative press reports without adequate consideration for either existing policies, or its impact on the prisoners whose progression to open conditions was abruptly prevented.'","High Court throws out rules introduced to stop violent prisoners escaping .

"You might know that H20 is the chemical formula for water, but what about the chemistry of you? Dr Joe Hanson, a science writer and biologist based in Austin, Texas, pondered this very question and now has calculated what the human body is in terms of chemical elements. He revealed that a 'human molecule' might contain 375 million atoms of hydrogen, 132 million atoms of oxygen and 85 million atoms of carbon. By comparison, this human molecule contains just one atom of cobalt and three molecules of the metal molybdenum. When written out in full, the human molecule would read: Co1 Mo3 Se4 Cr7 F13 Mn13 I14 Cu76 Zn2,110 Fe2,680 Si38,600 Mg40,000 Cl127,000 K177,000 Na183,000 S206,000 P1,020,000 Ca1,500,000 N6,430,000 C85,700,000 O132,000,000 H375,000,000. The full list of elements that Dr Hanson says would be found in a human molecule if such a thing existed - each set of letters represent a chemical element and the numbers are the proporation of atoms in each 'molecule' Dr Hanson claims his formula, however, only represents the chemical make up of the human body at birth. Life on Earth may have been kickstarted by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago. Chemists have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - DNA, proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light. Their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams, coming together to form the first cells. This suggests that life may well have first emerged here on Earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space. But the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence. They claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the Late Heavy Bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide. This poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions, along with hydrogen sulphide, driven by ultraviolet light. Over our lifetimes the proportions of these elements change as age and we pick up traces of other elements like heavy metals and gold. Dr Hanson said: 'Out of 98 naturally occurring elements, just over 30 are known to be essential to some form of life on Earth. 'In ancient times scholars believed everything in the universe was made from just four elements - earth, water, fire and air. 'Today we know it is a little more complicated than that. Living things are made up of cells, cells are made up of molecules and molecules are made up of atoms. 'But that old idea turns out to be sort of right. 'Altogether, 97% of the mass all living matter is made of just four chemical elements.' Dr Hanson, who created the video for the It's Okay to be Smart PBS channel on YouTube, also calculated that the average human body has the equivalent of 16kg (35lbs) of carbon in it and enough oxygen to fill a volume equivalent to 6 elephants. He said the human body also contained enough hydrogen to fill the volume of a blue whale and the same amount of nitrogen as is found in 400 litres of urine. But the human body may also be a source of revenue for those who think it is worth the effort. If the average person was to cut off all their tails and toenails, they could extract a nugget of gold worth around a tenth of a US cent (one sixteenth of a penny), according to Dr Hanson. He said: 'The average adult contains detectable amounts of 60 elements, mostly just traces of our diet and environment that have built up over time. If you isolated all of the elements in your body into their pure form, the ingredients for one life would fetch around one to two thousands dollars on the open market. 'Of course you can't really do that, but it gives us another way to look at life.'

This March 6, 2012 photo shows the scene of a crash in Bainbridge, Georgia, where four-year-old Remi Walden was burned and died when a Jeep Grand Cherokee was struck from the rear by a Dodge Dakota pickup truck . The fuel tank leaked, engulfing the Jeep in flames and killing the four-year-old. The verdict came nearly two years after Chrysler compromised with a federal safety agency and agreed to a scaled-down recall of some older-model Jeeps with the rear-mounted tanks. The tanks have little structure to protect them if struck from behind, making them susceptible to punctures and fires. Federal documents show that at least 75 people have died in post-crash fires because of the rear-mounted fuel tanks. The jury of 11 women and one man, ruled after a nine-day trial that Chrysler was 99 per cent at fault for the crash and the pickup driver was 1 per cent at fault. Jurors also determined that Chrysler failed to warn the family of the hazards of driving the Jeep. They ruled that the Waldens should get $30 million for Remi's pain and suffering and $120 million for the full value of his life, according to a verdict form. Mike Palese, spokesman for Chrysler parent company FCA US, said the company is disappointed with the verdict and would appeal. Chrysler, he said, was prevented from presenting data submitted to federal safety regulators showing that the vehicles did not pose an unreasonable safety risk. 'The vehicles are not defective,' Palese said. Although the verdict is large, it isn't the largest judgment ever against an automaker in a personal injury case. In 1999, for example, a California jury ordered General Motors Co. to pay $4.9 billion to Patricia Anderson and Jo Tigner after their Chevrolet Malibu was rear-ended and burst into flames. In that case, four children in the back seat were severely injured. The family of a four-year-old boy who was killed when a Jeep Grand Cherokee (pictured) exploded in 2012 has been awarded  $150 million by a jury in Georgia . The amount was reduced on appeal to $1.2 billion. And in 2004, a woman paralyzed when her Ford Explorer rolled over won a $369 million verdict from Ford Motor Co. That was later reduced to $83 million, which Ford eventually paid after exhausting its appeals all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond law school, said it will be difficult for Chrysler to overturn a jury verdict, but an appeals court might reduce the amount. He questioned Chrysler's decision to take the case to trial because of the horrific nature of the crash. Tobias said the Walden verdict is likely to lead others to sue the company or to speed along cases that are already in the system. Chrysler has long contended that the Jeeps were no more dangerous than comparable SUVs built at the time. It used that argument to convince the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2013 to allow it to recall 1.56 million Jeeps after the government agency initially recommended that 2.7 million be repaired. Under the recall, Chrysler agreed to install trailer hitches in the rear as an extra layer of protection. Safety advocates have called the size of the recall and the fix inadequate. On Thursday, Clarence Ditlow, the head of the Center for Auto Safety, called on the government to reopen its investigation against Chrysler. NHTSA spokesman Gordon Trowbridge said late Thursday that the agency monitors legal decisions and 'if new information emerges, we take it into account and act appropriately.' Atlanta attorney Jim Butler argued during the trial that Remi's death resulted from the fire because of the gas tank's poor position. The child was on his way to a tennis lesson when the SUV was struck from behind. 'Numerous witnesses saw Remi struggling to escape and heard him screaming for help,' the family's lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit alleged that Chrysler placed the gas tank in a 'crush zone' behind the rear axle and knew the location was dangerous, and that the company failed to protect the gas tank against rupturing. Trial testimony showed that the compromise with safety regulators over the recall was worked out in a Chicago airport meeting between Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and ex-NHTSA Administrator David Strickland. Ditlow noted that Strickland now works for Venable, a law firm that has represented Chrysler.","Remington 'Remi' Walden, four, was killed three years ago when his family's Jeep Grand Cherokee exploded when it was rear-ended .

"150 outgoing art fans have taken part in National Gallery of Australia's first ever naked art tour, stripping off their clothes for an adult-only after-hours viewing experience. The first hour-long tour through the NGA's current exhibition, 'James Turrell: A Retrospective', took place on Wednesday night, in a no-frills approach to art led by Melbourne-based artist Stuart Ringholt. 'Everyone's all in it together, so it's not weird or anything,' said one man who attended the tour. Scroll down for video . 150 art fans took part in a nude tour of an exhibition at the National Gallery of Australia on Wednesday evening . 'You don't have the clothing distracting you. And because of the light installations, everyone is very neutral,' one woman told The ABC. 'It just gives it a very different perspective.' Ringholt, the tour guide for the retrospective, which highlights the 70-year-old American artist's 50 years of work, said the experience creates an 'educational state' for viewing the art. 'While to some people this might be a joke, it's not to me. I take this very seriously,' Ringholt told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's all about education through experience. Witnessing everyone take their clothes off and leave them in a pile is really quite profound,' he said. 'You realise how complex and socially fabricated we are, connected through clothes'. 'Everyone's all in it together, so it's not weird or anything,' said one man who attended the tour . The tour ran for an hour after the NGA was closed for the evening . Mr Ringholt has already been the guide on nude gallery tours at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and MONA in Tasmania . Ringholt is no stranger to nude education, having guided similar tours at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and MONA in Tasmania. The tours, which will run again on Thursday night, is an adventure through Turrell's body of work, and include installations purpose-built for Canberra, as well as drawings, prints and photographs. The custom built light program will project different colours onto the viewers, which Ringholt said will be one of the most interesting elements of the nude tour. He expects people 'from all walks of life' to join in the tours, and was adamant about offering concessions for the exhibition so that a cross section of society might be emboldened to give nudity a go. 'We all share the same humanity, and it's wonderful to see people come along and be so happy. I liken the tours to a 40th birthday party of a reunion of long lost friends,' Ringholt said. Ringholt is no stranger to nude education, having guided similar tours at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and MONA in Tasmania . You don't have the clothing distracting you. And because of the light installations, everyone is very neutral,' said one woman . Mr Ringholt said that he was interested to see how the light displays interacted with the naked bodies . 'We often get nudists who are really excited to come to events, because for them it's exciting that society is saying ""you're ok, you can participate"",' he said. 'Art students also tend to come along, but there is always someone who has never done something like this before,' 'I had one woman who was so nervous but came up to me afterwards and thanked me for running the tour because she had had so much shame around her body and was able to overcome her fears.' Ringholt maintains that there is nothing sexual about the tours, and said that the human body is more sexualised with clothes on. 'With clothes on, the imagination is engaged, but with them off, there isn't the same hook. The body is quite de-sexualised,' Ringholt said. 'People don't believe me when I say this, but people all look the same with their clothes off. An 18-year-old looks like a 70-year-old,' he said. 150 outgoing art fans will take part in the National Gallery of Australia's (NGA) first ever naked art tour .

'It sounds ridiculous but until you've actually seen people in a group, nude, looking at art respectfully, it's hard to understand.' The artist, who has previously run a nude night club experience called Club Purple, began performing nude in his 20's as a way to explore the issues of shame and embarrassment. He said that nude tours in particular are excellent vehicles for promoting acceptance of one's body, and also to engage in an activity normally considered quite risque. 'It's illegal to be nude in public, so to be naked in what is normally a very public space is a form a mild protest,' Ringholt said. 'I think it's an excellent way to accept your body, and generate some self love. It's not negative, no one is looking and judging,' he said. The artist whose work is the impetus for the tours, James Turrell, was reportedly very keen to have viewers of his work wander around and experience it nude. A nude tour for one of his exhibitions was previously held in Japan, and Ringholt said he expressed interest in having the tour replicated at the Australian retrospective. The custom built light program will project different colours onto the viewers . 'We drink light through the skin as Vitamin D... so we are literally light eaters. It's part of our diet,' said Turrell . Turrell sees nothing wrong with nudity and explains: 'We drink light through the skin as Vitamin D... so we are literally light eaters. It's part of our diet.' Ringholt said that Turrell is fascinated by the element of light, and uses the term 'skyclad' instead of nude. 'He produces skyspaces, and his art has a really beautiful relationship with light perception, stars, the heavens, all things celestial,' he said. Paul Matthews, who participated in one of the nude tours run by Ringholt at the Museum of Contemporary Art, said that it was a unique experience to be in a public setting with other people while naked. Matthews, a nudist, said that he felt some of the installations were 'made complete' by the nude spectators, and that he didn't believe the experience would have been the same had the group been clothed. 'I don't think I could ever visit the MCA clothed after this tour,' he said. The tours, which will run outside of regular exhibition hours on April 1 and 2, are an hour-long adventure through Turrell's body of work .

"Jason Cotterill, 42, sent explicit revenge porn images of his ex partner to her children and set up 67 Facebook profiles to bombard her with abuse . A jilted lover who sent explicit revenge porn images of his ex-partner to her daughter and set up 67 Facebook profiles to bombard her with abuse has been jailed. Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with abusive messages over the internet after she tried to end their relationship in October last year. A court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on to her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant, saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she 'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me. 'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication. 'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' The victim said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes . In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.' The 42-year-old was 'driven insane' and suffered depression and panic attacks after Cotterill spent a year sending 'disgusting' messages. David Houldcroft, defending, said Cotterill, who had two previous convictions for harassment, accepted sending the link and that it would have caused her upset. Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim . 'He regrets that and understands that he has problems with relationships,' Mr Houldcroft said. 'He suffers from depression and has alcohol issues. He recognises that he needs help.' Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim. District Judge David Robinson said: 'You harassed the complainant over a three-month period and used social networks constantly in a threatening manner to get her to re-engage with you. 'There are a number of aggravating features in this case. 'You sought to use dozens of Facebook profiles to get in touch with her, you also found a link to a pornographic site and made use of that. 'You either involved or threatened to involve others, sending the link to the woman's friends and her sister, insinuating that her children might get to see the photos. 'You used the power you had over her by the knowledge of those photos.'","Jason Cotterill knew his victim had previously been involved in sex videos .

"Every police force in England and Wales will be required to record anti-Muslim hate crimes and treat them as seriously as anti-Semitic attacks if the Tories win the next General Election, Theresa May has announced. In a move hailed by Islamic groups, Mrs May said that police will have to record Islamophobic attacks as a separate category, just as anti-Semitic crimes are recorded separately. At present some forces, including London’s Metropolitan Police, do record Islamophobic crimes as such. Other forces categorise them as hate crimes or specific offences such as assault or grievous bodily harm. Scroll down for video . Pledge: Home Secretary Theresa May said police will have to record Islamophobic attacks as a separate category . The new requirement will create the first accurate picture of the extent of Islamophobic hate crimes in Britain. Charities say there has been a steady rise of anti-Muslim hate crimes since 9/11. But after incidents such as the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby outside Woolwich barracks in 2013 and the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January, there are spikes in incidents in the UK, say experts. Mrs May made her pledge in a speech on counter-extremism to the Foundation for Peace in London just before Parliament was dissolved. She told the conference: ‘We will require police forces to record anti-Muslim crimes as well as anti-Semitic crimes.’ On the same day, Mrs May answered a question from Labour MP Kate Green in Parliament, who asked what steps the Government was taking to record anti-Muslim hate crimes. Mrs May said: ‘A Conservative government would require the police to be recording Muslim hate crime, anti-Muslim incidents, as well as anti-Semitic incidents.’ The Home Office does not publish national statistics for Islamophobic offences. The move by Mrs May, pictured here with Prime Minister David Cameron, has been hailed by Islamic groups . But in 2013-14, police recorded 44,480 hate crimes, an increase of five per cent over the same period the previous year across England and Wales. The vast majority – 37,484 – were race-hate crimes. Tell Mama, a Government-backed Islamic group, said that more than half of all the victims (54 per cent) of Islamophobic incidents are women, perhaps because they ‘appear more Islamic’, wearing the burka or headscarf. Tell Mama figures show that in the ten months after the Lee Rigby attack, a total of 734 incidents were reported to the organisation – an increase of 20 per cent on the same period the previous year. The most serious incident is believed to be the frenzied knife attack on Saudi Arabian student Nahid Almanea, 31, in Colchester, Essex, in June last year. Detectives believe she was attacked because she was wearing Islamic clothes. So far no one has been arrested for the murder. Mohammed Amin, a patron of Tell Mama, said of Mrs May’s speech: ‘This is a positive step forward.’ The Muslim Council of Britain has also welcomed the proposal. Iqbal Sacranie, the group’s former Secretary-General, said: ‘This change will bring parity between Muslim and Jewish groups.’","All police would record anti-Muslim hate crimes if Tories win the Election .
Islamophobic attacks would be separate category, like anti-Semitic crimes .

"Australian homeowners are making room in their backyards to allow budget travellers to pitch a tent and stay for a few nights. This is the latest cost-saving travel trend, with each night costing an average of $30. HomeCamp, which launched in January, has been attracting both backpackers and locals who are looking for cheap and fast accommodation. One Sydney host, Steve York, has been using the website to connect with potential guests and has already had four successful bookings. Australian homeowners are making room in their backyards to allow budget travellers to pitch a tent and stay for a few nights . HomeCamp, which launched in January, has been attracting both backpackers and locals who are looking for cheap and fast accommodation . Sydney-sider Steve York (left) used HomeCamp to connect with Rose Smith (right) and let her stay in his backyard for three nights . As a full-time university student, Steve felt the financial burden when he moved out six months ago. The 20-year-old asked around for any 'easy money-making methods' when a friend told him about HomeCamp. 'I wasn't too keen at the start but I thought I may as well give it a go to see what it's like,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just wanted a some extra income to help pay for groceries and little things like that because I was struggling financially.' Steve says he did initially consider placing his rental property in Dee Why, Sydney's northern beaches, on Airbnb and Couchsurfing but could not warm to the idea of living under the same roof with a complete stranger. 'I really wasn't comfortable with people staying inside the house so I guess that's why HomeCamp appealed to me more,' he said. Steve listed his Dee Why home, in Sydney's northern beaches, on HomeCamp in February and has since had four bookings . There are currently more than 50 Australian homeowners using the website, according to founder David Abitbol . Steve's first booking was in February with local traveller Rose Smith of Queensland. Both parties took all precautions to ensure they were reliable. 'Obviously I wanted to make sure that I wasn't having some weird person staying in my backyard,' Steve said. 'Rose was really great and she even let me speak to her parents. I was really able to trust her for the three nights she stayed.' For Rose, she was after an affordable place to stay in Sydney and Steve's home was perfect for the occasion. 'It was also my first time staying in someone's backyard so I was a bit scared at the start,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But after a few conversations with Steve I felt more comfortable and now I'm definitely looking to do it again.' The 22-year-old says she enjoyed the freedom of having her own space as opposed to 'staying in a youth hostel in a crowded space and sharing the bathroom with other heaps of other travellers'. 'I got along with Steve so he allowed me to use the bathroom and other amenities quite freely which made the whole experience even better,' Rose said. HomeCamp was launched in Australia but has been used by homeowners worldwide including New Zealand, France, South Africa, USA, Canada and Sweden . Steve believes HomeCamp offers tourists a unique experience. 'The affordability of it and the location with a great vibe - I think that's what tourists are looking for these days,' he said. 'They're not really looking for the typical touristy places anymore but want more local and real experiences.' Rose agrees with Steve and also believes HomeCamp is 'going to be the next big thing'. There are currently more than 50 Australian homeowners using the website and that number continues to grow, according to founder David Abitbol.

"A celebrity reporter for CBS filed a lawsuit against two of his bosses at the network this week, claiming one drunkenly groped and kissed him at a Christmas party and that the other aggressively came onto him during an after-hours meeting. Kenneth Lombardi, who goes by Ken, was a red carpet regular for CBS New York, interviewing stars from Oprah to Ashton Kutcher and Arnold Schwarzenegger. However Lombardi, who is openly bisexual, says he was forced to quit his job in November and relocate to Los Angeles after two alleged sexual harassment involving two separate male bosses. Lawsuit: Kenneth Lombardi, a former entertainment reporter at CBS, claims he was sexually harassed by two male colleagues and that the network failed to reconcile his complaints. He is seen here reporting at the red carpet premiere of Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller Sabotage . Plaintiff: He also claims he was forced to leave his job as a result, and is seeking damages for violation of labor laws, emotional distress and discrimination . Furthermore he accuses the HR department at CBS of failing to reconcile either incident. The first alleged encounter occurred at a CBS Christmas party in December 2013. Lombardi claims Duane Tollison, a senior producer, grabbed his crotch and kissed his neck in front of other colleagues, The New York Daily News reported. Lombardi was upset and left the party. The next day, Tollison sent him an email, which has been included in the lawsuit. 'I wanted to apologize if anything I did offended you or crossed a line. I like to get a little crazy. If you weren't offended, then let's do it again. LOL How is your day so far? :)' Tollison wrote in the email. Defendant: Duane Tollison, a senior producer at CBS, allegedly kissed his former colleague Ken Lombardi at a 2013 work Christmas party and grabbed his crotch. Lombardi is now suing . Then, on May 8, 2014, Lombardi asked for career advice from Albert 'Chip' Colley, the CBS Evening News Director. The two went for drinks at Manhattan bar Hardware, a known gay haunt in Hell's Kitchen. The lawsuit says Colley got drunk, touched Lombardi's leg and kissed him. It also says Colley texted him links to porn sites. The documents further say Colley lambasted Lombardi for his sexual orientation. Defendant: CBS Evening News Director, Albert 'Chip' Colley, allegedly came onto Lombardi while having drinks at a Hells Kitchen bar in May 2014. He also allegedly sent him links to porn sites . 'Colley told (Lombardi) that he did not really believe being 'bisexual' was real and told plaintiff that he was actually completely gay,' documents read.

"Out of prison and free to stroll around Ireland's capital, this is the notorious 'Black Widow' killer who murdered her husband. Catherine Nevin was allowed out on day release on Wednesday afternoon despite being jailed for life in April 2000 for arranging to having her publican husband Tom shot dead. The 62-year-old was permitted to attend an addiction studies course and was pictured leaving Mountjoy prison and making her way from Dublin's Dochas Centre to the Oblates in the city's Inchicore suburb. Black Widow Catherine Nevin leaving Mountjoy Prison as she walks to get a bus. An unsuspecting commuter sat next to her as she made her way through the city centre and to her course in the suburbs . Catherine and Tom Nevin on their wedding day. The 62-year-old was given life in prison for arranging to have her husband shot dead . She walked through the city centre to Dorset Street where she waited for a bus before attending the addiction studies course. Ireland's most infamous woman prisoner went largely unnoticed as she took the bus unaccompanied after leaving prison - with an unsuspecting female commuter sitting down next to her - according the Daily Mirror. Catherine Nevin leaving the Central Criminal Court in Dublin during her trial in 2000 . Dressed in jeans, a blue fleece top and a pair of black Ugg boots, Nevin took in sights she hasn't seen since being jailed 15 years ago. She laughed and joked with a pal for more than an hour at the nearby Applegreen Garage before her course started. She failed last July to have her conviction overturned, though this outing will fuel speculation a full release from jail is imminent. Her temporary release is understood to have been approved by the parole board and sanctioned by the Justice Minister. The course is part of her pre-release plan to help her integrate back into society once freed. Nevin's current study leave is her latest educational placement after she studied the same topic at the Mounttown Community Facility in Dun Laoghaire last October. While attending that course, run by the Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Drugs Task Force, she was always accompanied by prison warders. Completion of the course gives participants a FETAC Level 5 Addiction Studies Certificate. It's believed that as well as attending the course in Inchicore, Nevin has also been using facilities at Maynooth University in Co Kildare and Trinity College over the past few weeks. While in prison Nevin has been keeping herself busy. She has a job in the jail library and likes to do makeovers on other inmates. It was revealed in July 2013 how Scissor Sister Charlotte Mulhall, who is serving life for murder, regarded her as a close friend in jail. Despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of Tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate. Tom Nevin was shot dead in the couple's pub, Jack White's Inn, in Brittas Bay, Co Wicklow, in March 1996. His wife was also convicted of soliciting three men – Gerry Heapes, William McClean and John Jones – to kill him. Despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of Tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate. Her trial was shrouded in controversy and has gone down in history as the longest ever murder trial in the history of Ireland. The trial and media coverage of the case was dominated by an intense focus on Nevin herself, forcing the judge to order a ban on all reporting of her clothing and appearance. No physical evidence linking her to horrific crime was ever discovered. Her conviction was based largely on the evidence of the three men she is alleged to have solicited. Nevin married Galway-born Tom in 1976. Over the following years they built up a property portfolio, before in 1986 buying the landmark pub where Tom was murdered . His death was initially investigated his death as a pub raid which had gone tragically wrong.

"Self-assured and poised in her stilettoes and new hairstyle, Nicola Sturgeon clearly revelled in being centre-stage – addressing a nationwide audience of Britons, rather than just the usual five million Scots. Such was her exultation that Judy Murray, mother of tennis star Andy (who was widely criticised for voicing his support for Scottish independence on the eve of last year’s independence referendum), tweeted about her triumph. Judy Murray said: ‘GSM Sturgeon’ (Game, Set and Match). Scroll down for video . The Britain-wide TV audience was clearly impressed - an instant poll by YouGov found that 28 per cent thought  Nicola Sturgeon was the best performer . For most people outside Scotland, this will have been their first proper view of Scotland’s First Minister. Until now, she had been in the substantial shadow of her noisy and bullish predecessor, Alex Salmond. But few north of the border were surprised by her performance. The fact is that Sturgeon has the most experience of governing of any of the seven politicians taking part in the TV debate, having been a member of the Scottish Cabinet and Deputy First Minister since 2007. Such is the hero-worship she attracts in Scotland, that even after the SNP lost the referendum vote last year, 12,000 people paid to see her speak at Glasgow’s Hydro, a concert venue more usually home to pop stars such as Sting or Rod Stewart. Sturgeon is a very canny operator. Her style on Thursday night was deliberately calm, natural and direct – qualities that are rare in politicians in this age of spin and slipperiness. The Britain-wide TV audience was clearly impressed. An instant poll by YouGov found that 28 per cent thought she was the best performer. Fascinatingly, one of the most-searched things on Google immediately after the end of the broadcast was whether people who don’t live in Scotland can vote for the SNP on May 7. I found myself torn. As a fellow Scot, I wanted to see her do well. But as someone who regards himself as ‘British’ and who voted to keep the union, I am all too aware of her determination to destroy my country. Indeed, Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon is a very dangerous woman. Such was her exultation that Judy Murray, mother of tennis star Andy, tweeted about her triumph. Judy Murray said: ‘GSM Sturgeon’ (Game, Set and Match) Leader: For most people outside Scotland, this will have been their first proper view of Scotland’s First Minister . Although poles apart politically – and Sturgeon herself would run the Royal Mile in Edinburgh at the comparison – she shares many similarities with Margaret Thatcher. Like Mrs T, the SNP leader transformed her image from that of a dowdy egghead into a glamorous, power-dressing imperatrix – emphasising a mixture of elegant feminine charm and steel. Her strength of character and willpower have driven her to the top of a party that has traditionally been dominated by powerful men in kilts. What has lifted her above these male rivals is her emotional intelligence. Although naturally shy, her two decades in politics has seen her grow into a polished public performer. Make no mistake, however: she is unequivocally left-wing. And she is also an avowed feminist. Indeed, during her SNP conference speech last month she said: ‘I am determined that – unlike that other woman leader we once knew – I will use my time in this job to improve the lives of women across our country.’ One of her first acts as First Minister was to create a gender-balanced Cabinet. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon greets young fans on the campaign trail in Edinburgh, where she was hailed as 'Scotland's Queen' Dangerous: SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon could hold the balance of power and be in position to decide who forms the next government . Having taken over from Alex Salmond after the SNP had lost the referendum, Sturgeon is in some ways exactly what Scotland needed. The country was – and still is – deeply divided and bruised by the vote. But the beguiling Sturgeon is a much more conciliatory and less arrogant figure than her predecessor. Very cleverly, she is now taking her Scottish independence campaign south of the border. And Thursday’s TV debate offered the perfect platform. By saying that her ‘message to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland is one of friendship’, it was a brazen charm offensive. Opinion polls suggest that post-May 7, Sturgeon could wield huge influence over who forms the next government in Westminster. And with predictions that her SNP could take 45 of Scotland’s 59 seats, there is a growing fear in England that she could hold Westminster to ransom. Range: Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, was touted as one of the victors. Analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a 'killer line' to stand out from the rest . By propping up a Miliband government, she would try to impose her left-wing agenda: big-state socialism, ferocious opposition to an austerity programme, the non-renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent, demands for expensive public spending projects that fly in the face of economic reality. If that happens, Britain would face a political crisis as the English (who number 53million) would feel justified in rebelling against a government that depended for its existence on the votes of a neighbouring country of just five million. Such a situation would, inevitably, become unworkable and collapse, with incalculable consequences for our political system. Of course, that would play right into the hands of Nicola Sturgeon. For she full knows that the growing anti-Scottish feeling in England could lead to Westminster concluding that the union with Scotland was unsustainable. Already, Scots are speculating that there would soon be a second referendum on independence. These are the cards that Sturgeon holds – and her hand is stacked with aces. The fact is that she commands her party and her nation in a way that David Cameron or Ed Miliband can only dream of. Today, Nicola Sturgeon is the most dangerous woman in British politics.","TV debate was the first proper view of Sturgeon for most outside Scotland .

"Barcelona ace Neymar scored twice as Barcelona cruised past Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain at the Nou Camp. The Brazilian was on hand to embarrass fellow countryman David Luiz as the former Chelsea defender endured a horrendous evening in Spain. Rik Sharma sorted the best from the rest during the Champions League clash at the Nou Camp... Barcelona . Marc-Andre ter Stegen 6.5: Called into action for the first time by Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the second half and dealt with the Swede’s powerful drive well, before fielding an Ezequiel Lavezzi strike too. One of the quietest evenings he will have. Dani Alves 7.5: Wound back the years to give everyone a reminder of why he was considered the best right-back in the world. Dazzling stepovers then a wicked cross for Neymar to bury. David Luiz takes on Paris Saint-Germain ace Javier Pastore during their match at the Nou Camp . Gerard Pique 5: Had little to do but shanked a couple of clearances horribly, which is out of character for the defender. Was also robbed by Ibrahimovic, though it came to nothing. Suffering a minor dip after a few months in which he has been at his very best. Javier Mascherano 6: Pique was the player assigned to deal with Ibrahimovic and Mascherano was left with little else to do, in a quiet evening for Barcelona’s defence. Javier Mascherano reacts during Barcelona's Champions League clash with PSG at the Nou Camp . Jordi Alba 6: Didn’t bother rampaging forward like you often catch him doing in La Liga. In theory that was to take care of Edinson Cavani, but the striker was extremely quiet. Sergio Busquets 7: Helped to snuff out the threat of Zlatan Ibrahimovic when the forward dropped into his midfield zone. Started a few Barcelona attacks with his usual eye for a quick pass. Ivan Rakitic 7.5: Contributed to Barcelona’s high pressing, caging PSG in their own final third. Physically fit enough to get back and help out in his own defensive quarters too. In games like these . Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic holds off opposition midfielder Pastore as the Catalan side breezed through . Andres Iniesta 9: Has not quite found his best rhythm under Luis Enrique but his amazing dribble to set up Neymar’s goal was pure Iniesta. Substituted at half-time for Xavi. Lionel Messi 6.5: Stayed wide on the right for a long while, conserving energy. Given his efforts against Valencia at the weekend, and in general during an extremely busy month, he can be forgiven. When he contributed to the game, it was with his usual quality, and whipped a strike inches wide of the left post in stoppage time. Argentinean wizard Lionel Messi dances his way through the Barcelona defence as they cruise through . Luis Suarez 6.5: Extremely unselfish. The Uruguayan did a lot of running and although it didn’t come to fruition on a personal level, he earned Neymar acres of space and Barcelona were rewarded. Huge applause when he was substituted. Neymar 9: Two clinical finishes here, and plenty of direct, dangerous running which makes him impossible to handle. Final ball when trying to set up his team-mates sometimes needs a bit more precision, but that will come. Brazilian Neymar grabbed himself two goals as the La Liga giants eased through to the next round . SUBS . Xavi Hernandez 6.5: The Camp Nou relishes every chance it gets to see this old legend, before he heads off into the sun at the end of the season. (By sun, read Qatar, although a deal has not been finalised). Sergi Roberto 6: A rare opportunity which was mainly useful for giving Sergio Busquets’ legs a rest. Pedro Rodriguez 6: This could be one of his last appearances at the Camp Nou, but didn’t have time to show off. PSG . Salvatore Sirigu 6: Could do nothing about the goals, but at least he had the perfect view of Barcelona’s calculated, technically excellent display. Gregory van der Wiel 3.5: Lost Neymar for the second goal – the Brazilian was his man – and was made to look a fool by him and Iniesta on more than one occasion. Gregory van der Wiel does his best to hold off the tackle of Barcelona's Jordi Alba at the Nou Camp . Marquinhos 4.5: His centre-back partner was in the spotlight for the goals, but he wasn’t even on the scene which was a crime in itself. Far from commanding – PSG would have looked a lot stronger had Thiago Silva been fit. David Luiz 5: It took less than three minutes for the Brazilian to end up in the book, after fouling Ivan Rakitic. Ten minutes later he was beaten for pace by Neymar, who broke the deadlock and killed the tie. Stepped up a gear in the second half – at least he cared. David Luiz puts his head in where it hurts as Psg take on Barcelona at the Nou Camp on Tuesday . Maxwell 6: Excellent defending prevented Messi from adding a third at the end. Given how little of the ball PSG had, it wasn’t an evening for showing off his attacking talents. Marco Verratti 6: Fired wide when well placed on the edge of the box in the second half. Brought a bit of spice to proceedings, but it was far from sufficient for Laurent Blanc’s side. Blaise Matuidi 6: Verratti and Luiz aside, looked like the only PSG player who really, truly cared. Put out a few fires, including a good tackle to halt a Messi surge, but that didn’t help while the rest of the side were falling apart. Blaise Matuidi has all eyes on the ball as he comes up against Barcelona's Alba during their clash . Yohan Cabaye 4: The former Newcastle midfielder’s presence on the pitch was barely noted. The game passed him by, so did Iniesta. Taken off after 66 minutes and deservedly so. Javier Pastore 3: Gave the ball away countless times in the first half. Looked on a different, albeit not necessarily better, wavelength than the other PSG players. Ruined one break in the second half with an awful through-ball, which flew straight to Ter Stegen. Pastore takes aim at Barcelona's goal as the Ligue 1 giants do their best to get back into the game . Edinson Cavani 4: Another sad night for the forward. Even before he was taken off, Barcelona’s half-time substitute Xavi had already had more touches of the ball than he had enjoyed in the entire game. Totally out of the action. Zlatan Ibrahimovic 4.5: The most danger he caused Barcelona’s defence was a stay arm that caught Mascherano square on the head. Had a point to prove to the jeering Barcelona fans but never looked like doing it. Former Barcelona striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic attempts to take the ball round Argentinean Mascherano . SUBS . Lucas Moura 6.5: Fired over the bar when well placed as the game neared its conclusion. But for an injury, would have started and could have caused Alves some problems with more time. Ezequiel Lavezzi 6.5: Added a bit of pace, in place of Cavani, which the team was missing up front. Adrien Rabiot 6: Maintained the status quo.","Neymar scored twice as Barcelona eased through at the Nou Camp .

"Prison officials must treat an inmate's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition, the Justice Department said in a court filing Friday. The Southern Poverty Law Center in February filed a lawsuit against Georgia Department of Corrections officials on behalf of Ashley Diamond, a transgender woman. The lawsuit says prison officials have failed to provide adequate treatment for Diamond's gender dysphoria, a condition that causes a person to experience extreme distress because of a disconnect between the birth sex and gender identity. Prison officials must treat an inmate's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition, according to a Justice Department ruling in the case of transgender inmate Ashley Diamond . A photo of Diamond compared to her Department of Corrections mugshot shows the drastic difference without maintaining treatment . The Justice Department filed a brief in the case Friday saying it's not taking a position on the accuracy of Diamond's claims, but reminding prison officials that the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires them to provide inmates with individualized assessment and care for the condition. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan wrote in an email that the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation. While similar cases have been brought in other courts, Justice Department officials said this is the first time the agency has gotten involved in one of these cases. That action signals this administration's commitment to protecting the interests of transgender people in this context and sends a message to state officials that the federal government has taken a clear position on the substantive legal issues in the case, said Georgia State University law professor Russell Covey. 'If Georgia disagrees, that sort of holds out the possibility of some future legal conflict between the state and the federal government,' he said. 'It's a kind of shot across the bow.' Diamond, who's 36, has identified as female since she was a child and began hormone therapy when she was 17, the lawsuit says. Diamond says she has been subject to ridicule and even sexual assault while behind bars . That gave her full breasts, a feminine shape, softer skin and a feminine appearance. Only inmates identified as transgender during their initial intake screenings are eligible for gender dysphoria treatment under Georgia Department of Corrections policy, but the personnel who do those screenings often aren't familiar with the condition, the lawsuit says. Despite having noticeable feminine physical characteristics and telling department staff she was transgender and receiving hormone therapy, Diamond was not evaluated for gender dysphoria and wasn't referred for treatment and her hormone therapy was halted, the lawsuit says. Though medical personnel subsequently evaluated her and determined she had gender dysphoria and that hormone therapy and female gender expression were medically necessary, department officials refused to authorize the treatment, the lawsuit says. So-called freeze-frame policies, that only allow inmates the level of treatment that they received before imprisonment and that allow no treatment for those who weren't initially classified as suffering from gender dysphoria are unconstitutional, the Justice Department brief says. Such policies violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Without the hormone treatment for the past three years, Diamond's body has suffered a painful physical transformation back to its masculine state and she has experienced severe mental anguish, the lawsuit says. She has also been subject to ridicule by inmates and prison staff and has been sexually assaulted by inmates because she hasn't been offered safe accommodation, the lawsuit says. Diamond, 36, identifies as a female and has been on hormone therapy since she was 17 . Southern Poverty Law Center staff attorney Chinyere Ezie said in an emailed statement Friday that the Justice Department brief bolsters their arguments. 'Transgender inmates like Ashley have a right to proper medical care,' Ezie said. 'They have a right to protection from violence and abuse and these rights are secured by the U.S. Constitution.' Other courts have ordered hormones, psychotherapy and other treatments for transgender inmates. A federal judge on Thursday ordered California's corrections department to provide a transgender inmate with sex-reassignment surgery, the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. It was only the second time anywhere in the country that a judge issued an injunction directing a state prison system to provide the surgery, said Ilona Turner, legal director at the Transgender Law Center in Oakland. The previous order in a Massachusetts case was overturned last year and is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.","The Southern Poverty Law Center in February filed a lawsuit against Georgia Department of Corrections officials on behalf of Ashley Diamond, a transgender woman .

"Model: Olsi Beheluli, pictured, claimed he appeared on Channel 4 dating show My Little Princess . A drug dealing model was jailed after he posted a picture of himself surrounded by £240,000 in cash on Twitter. Olsi Beheluli, who claims he appeared on Channel 4 dating show My Little Princess, was a member of a gang responsible for selling 'significant quantities' of class A drugs. The 24-year-old enjoyed living the 'high life' and gambling with the money he made from the illegal operation, police said. Officers seized more than £4million worth of heroin and cocaine when they raided the gang's 'stash house' in Brent, north west London. They also found stacks of money, counterfeit identity documents, and equipment used for drug dealing. Beheluli was jailed alongside fellow gang members Besim Topalli, 29, and Azem Proshka, 23, for a total of 31 years at Blackfriars Crown Court, London, on Wednesday. Officers arrested Beheluli, from Harrow, north west London, in October 2014 and searched his phone to discover a further picture of him with bundles of cash. He tried to claim it was a relative's money and was taken in Albania but detectives matched the distinctive wallpaper and furniture in the image to a picture of a home that Beheluli used to rent. A raid of the gang's 'stash house' in Brent, north west London, unearthed cash, drugs, counterfeit identity documents and drug dealing equipment such as scales. Beheluli stashed £24,000 in his bank account and told officers it was gambling winnings from the World Cup. Officers found betting slips showing he had recently placed £12,000 stakes at Ladbrokes and William Hill. National Crime Agency branch commander Oliver Higgins said: 'Beheluli seemed to enjoy the high life and gambling with the money he made from drug dealing, but in the end his luck run out. 'These men were involved in supplying significant quantities of high-purity class A drugs, as demonstrated by the value of the cash, cocaine and heroin we have seized from them.

Officers said that Beheluli appeared to 'enjoy the high life' with the money he made from drug dealing . Haul: More than £4million of cocaine and heroin (pictured) was found when police searched the 'stash house' 'But they were unaware that they were being watched by the NCA, and their arrest and subsequent conviction should have the wider criminal fraternity looking over their shoulders.' Beheluli was found guilty of conspiring to supply Class A drugs and was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment on Wednesday. Albanians Proshka and Topalli will be deported after they serve ten years in prison after admitting conspiring to supply drugs, money laundering and possessing fake ID documents.

"Teachers are set to call for 'play in the curriculum' for schoolchildren up to seven as this is more suitable than educating them in a formal way. Many children are not ready to sit down and do  reading, writing and maths when they start school at the age of four or five, according to the National Union of Teachers (NUT). At its annual conference in Harrogate, it will say schools should follow the lead of countries like Finland and introduce 45-minute lessons immediately followed by 15-minute play times. Teachers want children to have more play time to encourage greater communication and social skills . They want the UK to follow the lead of countries such as Finland which has 15 minute play time after lessons . It is also likely to say lunch and break times are being used for 'coaching and cramming', depriving youngsters of their 'fundamental human right to play' with their classmates. A resolution due to be put forward at the conference says: 'Primary schools are now being driven more and more towards a test and accountability culture which in turn makes them drive children of primary age to be educated in a formal way.' It goes on to suggest learning through play is known to help youngsters develop vital communication and social skills and that 'over-formalisation of learning can cause disaffection with school'. The motion calls on the NUT to support play in the curriculum at Key Stage 1 (five to seven-year-olds) 'to reflect the needs of the children'. Speaking ahead of the conference, NUT general secretary Christine Blower said many children are not ready for the 'formal sitting down' and 'come on let's do some work stage'' before they are seven. 'There is a question about whether we're expecting children to do things they're not developmentally ready for,' she said. The resolution, set to be heard on Saturday, also says: 'Lunchtime and break times are being used for coaching and cramming sessions, thus depriving primary age children of their fundamental human right to play and have free time to socialise with their peers.' The motion calls on the NUT to support play  for five to seven-year-olds 'to reflect the needs of the children' The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says children have the right to play and rest, it adds. Ms Blower said: 'In Finland, there are 45-minute lessons and then they have a break. Between each teaching session they have a break. One thing about our children is that, relatively speaking, they are rushed from pillar to post. Not so much in primary school, but in secondary school. 'Having a break between lessons gives a bit of space to reflect on the lesson they've just had.' The motion calls on the NUT to campaign in England and Wales for new laws to ensure children have a right to appropriate breaks and lunchtimes. The resolution comes amid growing debate over what children should learn, with politicians and education experts increasingly calling for schools to teach values such character, teamwork and resilience alongside academic subjects.","Teachers say pupils not ready for 'formal sitting down stage' before seven .

"He's been mocked for his inability to eat a bacon sandwich properly and likened to cartoon character Wallace - but that didn't prevent Ed Miliband from coming top in the sex appeal stakes during last night's debate. Moments after the Labour leader finished speaking, fans took to Twitter to coo adoringly about his 'sexy grey tie' and his smouldering looks. One rather breathless Tweet read: 'Miliband is totally talking to me and no one else, you sexy beast. Keep staring down the camera Ed! #leadersdebate' Scroll down for video . So hot right now: Ed Miliband's looks proved a hit with Twitter users during last night's debate . Another, Holly Ashby, asked why no one had asked Mr Miliband a question about his hair, complaining: . 'Why has no one asked about Ed Miliband's sexy Rogue-From-X-Men grey streak? It's all I care about tbh.' One fan even likened Miliband to Hansel, a character from modelling comedy Zoolander, tweeting: . 'Ed seducing the ladies with his patter.

On the campaign trail: Mr Miliband was canvassing for votes and drafted in his wife and sons to help out . Making his point: It wasn't just Mr Miliband's looks that got viewers talking . Impressed: A viewer finds herself enjoying the sight of Mr Miliband's saturnine looks . Enjoying it: Two watching women compare their notes on the Labour leader . Favourite bit: One Twitter user declared her love for Mr Miliband's 'Rogue-From-X-Men' grey streak . Handsome: Another Twitter user was surprised to find herself fancying the Labour leader . Last October, Swedish health minister Gabriel Wikström, 30, found himself bombarded by risqué messages from adoring Turkish fans after making a visit to the country. Nicknamed 'the handsome minister' by his growing legion of fans, Wikström, a Social Democrat who holds the position of Public Health Minister, said at the time that he was 'honoured' by all the attention. Speaking to English language Swedish daily newspaper, The Local, he said: 'I can’t feel anything but honoured and glad. And a little bit surprised, I must admit.' Denmark's prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, 48, is another politician famous for her glamorous looks, while her 39-year-old agriculture minister, Dan Jørgensen, has also proved a hit with the ladies. Impressed: Viewers appeared to appreciate Mr Miliband's 'sexy tie' and the grey streak in his hair . Seductive: Another compared Mr Miliband to Hansel from Zoolander, adding: 'He's so hot right now' Was it deliberate? One Twitter user appeared less convinced by Mr Miliband's smoulder . Swoon: A Twitter user describes Mr Miliband as a 'sexy beast' and exhorts him to keep looking at the camera . Sexy MP: Swedish health minister Gabriel Wikström has proved a big hit with the ladies . Arguably the most popular of all though, other than Wikström himself, is 36-year-old Hans Linde of Sweden's Left Party, who is as famous for his handsome face as he is for his politics. And while Denmark and Sweden have plenty of good-looking ministers to choose from, the UK has several of its own. Although Sexy MP, a website dedicated to Parliament's great and good-looking, has now shut down, it regularly put Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, 40, at the top of its looks list while running. MPs snapping at Mr Goldsmith's heels include Labour's shadow education and business secretaries, Tristram Hunt, 40, and Chuka Umunna, 36, . Other politicians to set pulses racing, both past and present, include Barack Obama, French prime minister Manuel Valls and Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto. And now, of course, Ed Miliband as well. Smouldering: Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto has won plaudits for his saturnine good looks . Hot stuff: Labour's Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt are almost as swooned over as their party leader . Conservative crumpet: Zac Goldsmith is considered one of the UK's best looking parliamentarians .

"Two men who claim they were molested as young boys by Michael Jackson are expected to find out on Tuesday if they will be allowed to sue  for a slice of the late King Of Pop's $1.5 billion estate. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once the singer's staunchest defender, now claims Jackson was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff has scheduled a hearing for Robson and another of Jackson's alleged child victims, James Safechuck, on Tuesday that could decide if their respective claims proceed. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once Michael Jackson's staunchest defender, now claims the singer was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child . Robson and Safechuck missed a statutory deadline when they filed their claims more than a year after Jackson's 2009 death. If Judge Beckloff gives Robson, 32, and Safechuck, 36, a green light to proceed with their civil claim, new child molestation allegations will likely be revealed in court against Jackson. Lawyers say the King Of Pop shelled out nearly $200 million to as many as 20 victims, reports the New York Post. The Jordan Chandler lawsuit alone is alleged to have cost more than $40 million. Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride. Safechuck alleges the singer gave him a marriage certificate and a wedding band as keepsakes and confirmation of their 'undying love'. He also alleges that Jackson wrote a check for more than $1 million to Safechuck's father, a sanitation worker. James Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride . 'Jackson was successful in his efforts to the point that my client endured repeated acts of sexual abuse of a heinous nature and was brainwashed... into believing they were acts of love and ­instigated by James himself,' Safechuck's attorneys said in the ­filings. The singer regularly dressed Safe­chuck in clothes identical to his and would tell reporters Safechuck was his cousin, a former employee said. Safechuck's attorney alleges that Jackson molested Safechuck more than 100 times. Robson was a five-year-old dance prodigy in Brisbane, Australia, when he first met the singer. Prior to filing his civil lawsuit in 2013 he had been one of the pop star's biggest supporters, including testifying under oath at Jackson's 2005 molestation trial in California he was never abused by Jackson. Robson was a key reason for Jackson's acquittal. He now says he 'lived in silence and denial for 22 years' and alleges he was seven years old when Jackson first molested him. Former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, left, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw them semi-nude in bed together . Robson accuses Jackson of first molesting him at the Neverland Ranch, while his sister slept in a separate bed just metres away. A former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw Jackson and Robson semi-nude in bed together, the Post reports. The estate has previously asked the court to reject the claims on the basis that Robson waited too long to file and because Jackson is the only other person with knowledge about the accusations and has been dead for more than five years. Robson, a choreographer for Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, says he has been unable to work because of the pain caused by Jackson's abuse. Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest.","Wade Robson and James Safechuck hope to find out on Tuesday if they can bring a civil lawsuit against the late singer's estate .

"In a show that could rival Sydney's light show 'Vivid', Carla Zampatti's SS15-16 collection made a splash at Sydney's Opera House today to celebrate the designer's 50 years in fashion. The stunning presentation kicked off proceedings for Mercedes Benz Fashion Week that officially begins this Sunday, April 12. The collection is said to be a celebratory nod to the excessive glamour of the Eighties and features bold Indian Pinks, Buttercup Yellows and Electric Blues against a backdrop of Zampatti's signature black and white tailored pieces. On Wednesdays we wear pink! Carla Zampatti presented a celebratory SS15-16 collection at Sydney's Opera House today to mark the brand's 50th year .

With satin, bold block colours and floral jacquard prints sprinkled throughout, the strong, structured and feminine collection were a feast for the eyes, especially set against Sydney's iconic Opera House. Stars including Delta Goodrem, Shanina Shaik, Kerri-Anne Kennerley, and Terry Biviano, were joined by fashion influencers Kate Waterhouse Margaret Zhang and Tanja Gacic in the front row. Captivating crowds was Zampatti's stand-out fuschia 'Opera Coat' that debuted on the catwalk featuring a pink bow and a lengthy cape that could be likened to a grown up red riding hood and starring as the perfect piece to compliment the operatic backdrop. Rainbow bright: Eye-popping bold colours were the stars of the show . Peekaboo: One model was topless beneath her fuschia coat, worn with high-waisted black shorts . Sunglasses required: The rainbow of creations made a bold statement . Mellow yellow: Buttercup creations were accented with fuchsia pink heels . It could be said that 'on Wednesdays, Zampatti's girls wear pink' with hot, pink open-toed uniform heels dominating the runway and a one-off satin head piece also making a guest appearance. The glamour didn't stop with colour either. Ruffled shoulders, strapless tops and high neck cuts also reigned supreme in Zampatti's celebratory collection, highlighting collar bones and shoulders in a showcase of chic, feminine and understated glamour. Models were adorned with jewellery from Cerrone Jewellers. Chic: The bold colours popped against Zampatti's trademark black and white designs . Mono: Plenty of wearable designs were on parade amongst the more outrageous creations . Celebrate: The collection was a nod to the excessive glamour of the Eighties .

"Attorneys for a 19-year-old accused of sexually assaulting several girls at his former high school say there is a 'treasure trove' of evidence proving the girls lied about the abuse, but the lawyers want further access to Facebook accounts to prove it. Tyler Kost, who appeared in court on Monday, was arrested last May for sexual crimes against 13 girls between 13 and 17 years old, most of whom were former classmates at Poston Butte High School. The Pinal County Attorney's Office says Kost faces 30 charges in three indictments ranging from sexual abuse to child molestation. Pictured: Tyler Kost has been in jail for over a year since a group of teenage girls accused him of sexual misdeeds . Accused: Attorneys for the 19-year-old accused of sexually assaulting several girls at his former high school say there is a 'treasure trove' of evidence proving the girls lied about the abuse . Kost stared straight ahead throughout most of the proceedings, his expression waffling between consternation and sedation. He looked older than in his booking photo with pale skin and close cropped brown hair. Kost's defense said new evidence taken from Facebook and Instagram proves the women lied about sexual abuse. 'Over a year ago Mr. Kost was publicly accused of being a serial rapist. What we know now is that there was a group of girls who conspired against Tyler to put him in jail. They succeeded in that, and Tyler has now been in jail for over a year based on those lies,' Kost attorney Christine Whalin told KSAZ. The prosecution handed over 98,000 pages of social media records from several of the alleged victims, but Defense Attorney Michael Alarid said he needs the communications of at least 8 other people to determine how far the plot spreads. The court documents reveal a group Facebook chat where three of the accusers and three witnesses made plans to 'teach a lesson' to Kost and referred to the movie 'John Tucker Must Die,' where ex-girlfriends take revenge on a former boyfriend. 'Tyler needs to be taught a lesson,' ran one interaction, reports KSAZ, as well as 'We should sacrifice him to Satan.' And another exchange read: . 'I'm down,'...'I already know this is going to be so much fun!' In court: The prosecution handed over 98,000 pages of social media records from several of the alleged victims, but Defense Attorney Michael Alarid said he needs the communications of at least 8 other people to determine how far the plot spreads . The exchange happened weeks before the women accused Kost of sexual assault. Facebook's privacy policy prevents the defense from gaining access to the other records, Alarid said. Only law enforcement can request the information from Facebook, he said. 'Quite frankly the fact that the state is refusing to get any additional social media records is concerning. It's shocking. Based on what we've uncovered so far they should be dismissing several charges. Instead they are digging their heels in and they are refusing to give us anything additional,' Alarid said. Prosecutor Shawn Jensvold said the records are not in the state's control and can't be turned over to the defense. Further, he said, the defense has not demonstrated a substantial need for the information. Taking cues? The court documents reveal a group Facebook chat where three of the accusers and three witnesses made plans to 'teach a lesson' to Kost and referred to the movie 'John Tucker Must Die,' where ex-girlfriends take revenge on a former boyfriend. The film stars Jesse Metcalfe and Ashanti . Jensvold said that the Facebook conversation only shows that three of the victims might be involved in a revenge plot, but not the other 10 victims. 'It's not the state's job to go on a fishing expedition for the defense, which is very clear within the case law,' he said. Kost was arrested after the Pinal County Sherriff's Office received a tip accusing him of sexual assault against five victims. He was booked on two counts of sexual assault and two counts of sexual misconduct with a minor. Detectives later identified eight other girls who said they were sexually abused by Kost. A spokesman for the sheriff's office said that in at least one case Kost threatened, harassed and told a victim to kill herself. In another, a victim said she became pregnant when she was raped after a Poston Butte homecoming dance. Judge Kevin White set the next hearing for May 4 at the Pinal County Superior Court. Back in court: Tyler Kost, who appeared in court on Monday, was arrested last May for sexual crimes against 13 girls between 13 and 17 years old. Kost stared straight ahead throughout most of the proceedings, his expression waffling between consternation and sedation.

"Cooking a gourmet lunch for family and friends at Easter has never been so easy - or cheap. One of Australia's most loved cooks, Lyndey Milan, has teamed up with Aldi to create Easter lunch recipes that will easily feed six people for less than $6 each. The home cook icon put her skills to the test by trawling the supermarket aisles to find healthy, fresh produce to turn into an Easter feast. Scroll down for video . One of Australia's most loved cooks, Lyndey Milan, has teamed up with Aldi to create Easter lunch recipes that will easily feed six people for less than $6 each . 'I am such of a massive fan of the hospitality of a table. I think sitting down around a table is the loveliest thing,' Milan told Daily Mail Australia. 'The worst homemade disaster is better than the shop bought stuff. You'll be wealthier, healthier and friendlier for cooking for the people you love.' The results of her Aldi experiment include Greek lamb with salad and zucchini pilaf and herb crusted salmon with pea puree, smashed potatoes and carrots. For dessert, Lyndey says her hot cross bun and Easter egg bread & butter pudding with almond praline, which came in at $2 per person, is guaranteed to be a crowd-pleaser. 'The hot cross bun pudding is so much fun. What I like about it is you can use leftovers – you'll always have stale hot cross buns and Easter eggs,' Lyndey told Daily Mail Australia. 'The salmon is smart enough for a dinner party. I would serve that for people coming for dinner. 'What I love about it is the ease of preparation. All you do it make the crusting, spread the salmon with Dijon mustard – it's not that hard, it's perfect.' The home cook icon put her skills to the test by trawling the Aldi supermarket aisles to find healthy, fresh produce to turn into an Easter feast - including hot cross bun and Easter egg bread & butter pudding . Greek lamb with salad and zucchini pilaf is also on Lyndey's menu for Easter . Lyndey was inspired by the lamb dish after filming a cooking series in Greece a few years back. 'At Easter, some people like to eat fish but then lamb is so traditional. Sometimes families aren't sure of how to cook it – the whole point of Greek lamb is it's well cooked, so you don't have that issue of cooking it rare for some and well done for others,' she said. 1. Use up all of what you buy . 2. Buy fresh produce that’s in season . 3. Store things correctly so they will keep well in your fridge . 4. Take advantage of any deals or specials and build your weekly meals around them . 5. Always try to use leftovers in another meal . 6. Only buy what you need . 7. Use your freezer . 'You can buy it from Aldi already butterflied so you can reduce cooking time. I just did that really simple zucchini pilaf, but you can use any sort of veggie. 'With a recipe, it's only a description of what you've done once… I love it when people change them and make it their own.' Lyndey had never stepped foot inside an Aldi before she partnered with them to create the Easter recipes. 'I did my personal research on Aldi, I went and visited two stores. I was waiting to get arrested by the store detective,' Lyndey said. 'I went around taking photos and making notes of the prices, which I couldn't believe by the way. I then went and bought all my ingredients... I did a spreadsheet of costs and then created. 'All of their meat is grass-fed, they have Australian cheese in there that's won Sydney Royal Medals – I just saw how much of their stuff is Australian. 'I'm now a convert.' Lyndey says her hot cross bun and Easter egg bread & butter pudding with almond praline, which came in at $2 per person, is guaranteed to be a crowd-pleaser . Lyndey says her herb crusted salmon with pea puree, smashed potatoes and carrots is quick and easy to prepare . Lyndey, who prides herself on never throwing food out, says there's a few simple tips to keep the grocery spend down and minimise waste. 1. Use up all of what you buy. Cooking a whole chicken? Boil up the bones with a carrot, onion, parsley stalks and peppercorns and make your own stock or soup base. Do the same with meat bones. 2. Buy fresh produce that’s in season. Not only does it taste better, it costs less. 3. Store things correctly so they will keep well in your fridge. Soak celery in icy cold water, drain, then wrap well in plastic in the fridge. Store herbs and shallots in damp kitchen paper inside a plastic bag to keep them fresh. Store potatoes and onions in a cool, dark place. 4. Take advantage of any deals or specials and build your weekly meals around them. ALDI has 7 Day Deals each Wednesday, which include amazing specials on meat, produce and some different and exciting products in the fridge. 5. Always try to use leftovers in another meal. Cold roast meat and vegetables can liven up a bland salad. Leftover vegies can go into a pasta, soup, frittata or risotto. Banana muffins or ice-cream can be made using over-ripe bananas and almost anything can be turned into a curry. 6. Only buy what you need. Always check the fridge and pantry before you shop and make a list before you go in store. 7. Use your freezer. Liquids like wine, coconut milk and stock can be frozen to use when needed. Bread stores well in the freezer and once defrosted, makes an excellent savoury breadcrumb topping with grated cheese. Herb Crusted Salmon with Pea Puree: . 6 salmon fillets (140g each)   3 tbsp. (1/4 cup) Dijon mustard . 25g (1/2 packet) fresh parsley   25g (1/2 packet) fresh dill . ½ cup dried bread crumbs   Olive oil . 30g butter   3 green onions (shallots), finely chopped . 2 sprigs mint   500g frozen peas   1 tbsp. lemon juice (optional) METHOD: .

Gradually add warm milk mixture as you whisk. Pour hot milk mixture over the hot cross buns. Leave to soak for at least 10 minutes, pressing down with your fingers occasionally to help the buns soak up the liquid. Place overproof dish in a large baking tray and add enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the ovenproof dish. Bake uncovered in oven for about 45 - 50 minutes or until pudding almost sets. It will still be wobbly in the middle if you shake the dish Remove the pudding from the oven and stand 5 minutes before serving.

"A US citizen has been killed in a mortar attack in Yemen after he traveled to the country in an attempt to extricate his pregnant wife and daughter from the civil war there and fly them  to California, family say. Jamal al-Labani was an Oakland gas station owner, his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told KPIX-TV. According to Alazzani, al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Alazzani told KPIX al-Labani was trying to get his family out of the war-torn Middle Eastern nation and take them to Oakland - but he couldn't because the US has withdrawn its diplomatic staff and the country has shut down most airports. Rebels from the Houthi Islamist group have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. They have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition of mainly Gulf air forces. Scroll down for video . Family: Jamal al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's 2 1/2-year-old daughter . Attack: Jamal al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died . Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia launched the air strikes on March 26 in an attempt to turn back the Iran-allied Shi'ite Houthis, who already control Yemen's capital Sanaa, and restore some of Hadi's crumbling authority. The air and sea campaign has targeted Houthi convoys, missiles and weapons stores and cut off any possible outside reinforcements - although the Houthis deny Saudi accusations that they are armed by Tehran. Career: al-Labani reportedly wished to take his family to Oakland, though there was no way to do so given what has been happening in Yemen . The fighting has failed so far to inflict any decisive defeat on the Houthis, or the supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh who are fighting alongside them, but the growing death toll and humanitarian suffering has alarmed aid groups. Speaking to CNN, al-Labani's family said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died. Council for Islamic Relations spokeswoman Zahra Billoo told CNN: 'All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. 'So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp.' In a statement issued to the television station, the State Department said 'We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. 'U.S. citizens wishing to depart [Yemen] should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available. 'Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.' At the time of the attack al-Labani was with his teenage nephew, who was also killed, Al Jazeera America reported. Alazzani told the news outlet that ahead of the attack '[al-Labani] was trying to find a way out because he felt his family was in danger.' He also told Al Jazeera America Houthi forces launched the mortal shelling on Tuesday. al-Labani's sons from an earlier marriage reside in California, according to Al Jazeera America. They are reportedly 13 and 16 years old. In a message posted Friday on its website, the State Department said 'On February 11, 2015, due to the deteriorating security situation in Sanaa, the Department of State suspended embassy operations and U.S. Embassy Sanaa American staff were relocated out of the country.' 'The level of instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain severe,' the message said. 'There are no plans for a U.S. government-coordinated evacuation of U.S. citizens at this time.' The agency also warned 'Keep vital records and travel documents close at hand; U.S. citizens should be prepared to depart at a moment’s notice. The airports are currently closed, but may open unexpectedly; other unforeseen opportunities to depart may also suddenly arise.' Houthi fighters and allied army units clashed with local militias in Aden on Sunday, and eyewitnesses said gun battles and heavy shelling ripped through a downtown district near the city's port. The United Nations said on Thursday that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in Yemen, while the International Committee of the Red Cross has appealed for an immediate 24-hour pause in fighting to allow aid into Yemen. The ICRC, which has blamed the Saudi-led coalition for delays in aid shipments, said it received approval to fly in medical supplies and staff and hoped to send two planes on Monday. A spokesman for the military coalition said the ICRC had approval to fly in aid on Sunday but pulled out because of problems with the company from which it chartered a plane. Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri also said a Sudanese flight was prevented from landing at Sanaa on Sunday by authorities in the Houthi-run capital, and a Turkish evacuation flight was held up. 'Usually, the delay is because of the other side,' he said. A pro-Hadi militia source said 36 Houthi and allied fighters were killed on Sunday in Aden's central Mualla district, near the port, while 11 of Hadi's combatants died. Houthi forces initially advanced towards the port area, but hours later had been pushed back several streets towards an army base. 'There are bodies in the streets and we can't get close because there are Houthi snipers on the rooftops. Anything that gets near they shoot at, and the shelling on Mualla has been indiscriminate,' a medic told Reuters. Asseri said the coalition was providing pro-Hadi fighters with intelligence, equipment and logistics. 'We hope in a few days they will control most of the city,' he told reporters in Riyadh. Valentina Abdul Kareem, an Aden council member, called on both sides to implement a ceasefire so that civilians could be evacuated. 'Aden is going through a humanitarian and health crisis,' Abdul Kareem said. Residents and merchants said stores had largely run out of produce, milk and other foods due a lack of access to the rocky peninsula city, whose main routes to agricultural hinterlands lie through the battle zones. Victim: al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving an Aden mosque Tuesday and soon died. His 14-year-old nephew was also reportedly killed . Business: al-Labani owned this Oakland, California, gas station . Armed: Followers of the Houthi movement raise their rifles as they shout slogans against the Saudi-led air strikes in Sanaa, Yemen on Sunday. Houthi forces have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . At least two main city districts have been without power for days after a rocket knocked out a main power station on Friday, and other areas suffered repeated cuts. Water has also been cut from some central districts. Asseri said that was a deliberate policy by the Houthis to create a 'chaotic situation' in Aden. Both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis say they are ready for talks which could return Yemen to the political transition which started when Saleh stood down in 2012 following huge street protests against his rule, inspired by wider Arab uprisings. But they have set out incompatible conditions for the talks and neighboring Oman, which often steers an independent course in the Gulf and has stayed clear of the Saudi-led military operations, said last week that neither side was ready for negotiations. A senior Houthi member said on Sunday the group is ready for peace talks as long as the Saudi-led air campaign is halted and negotiations are overseen by 'non-aggressive' parties. The fighting is only one of many conflicts in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest nation, which also faces tribal unrest, a simmering separatist movement in the south, and a threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the east. U.S. military personnel carrying out a covert drone war against AQAP were withdrawn last month after the Houthis advanced south towards Aden, close to the base out of which they operated. In the eastern coastal town of Mukalla, tribesmen deployed on the streets, pushing al Qaeda fighters out of much of the town just three days after the militants overran it, residents said. The tribal fighters entered Mukalla on Saturday, pledging to restore security after the militants broke into its jail on Thursday, freed a local al Qaeda leader, ransacked banks and took over local government buildings. France said its navy evacuated 63 people including French nationals from Aden on Sunday. Turkey said it evacuated 230 people, including non-Turkish citizens, by plane from Sanaa.","Jamal al-Labani was a Oakland, California, gas station owner, as well as a husband and a father-of-three .

"Today show hosts Savannah Guthrie and Carson Daly swapped gender roles in order to transform into two iconic characters from the hit movie Grease, before taking to the stage for a live lip sync battle against their co-hosts on Thursday morning’s show. Wearing a blonde wig and a pink jacket, Carson took on the role of Olivia Newton-John’s character Sandy, while Savannah, in a leather jacket and sunglasses, was Danny, originally played by John Travolta. The duo went head to head with Al Roker, Willie Geist and Natalie Morales, who also donned long blonde wigs for their cover of Australian singer Sia’s Chandelier. The two teams were judged by TV star and model Chrissy Teigen, one of the hosts of Spike TV’s new series Lip Sync Battle, which premieres tonight, and was the inspiration for the Today hosts’ colorful performances. Face-off: Al Roker, Natalie Morales and Willie Geist went head to head with Savannah Guthrie and Carson Daly during the Today show's first ever lip sync battle, which was judged by Chrissy Teigen . Nice touch: Savannah and Carson reversed gender roles and dressed as Danny and Sandy, respectively, from Grease . While Savannah and Carson switched gender roles and performed Summer Nights and Al, Natalie and Willie showcased their dancing skills for Chandelier, their co-host Matt Lauer somehow managed to avoid getting caught up in the battle altogether – something which Chrissy was more than happy to highlight.. When Matt announced Savannah and Carson to the stage in front of the live audience outside the show's Rockefeller studio, Chrissy couldn't help but ask: 'How did you get out of this?' 'Because I'm with you,' Matt joked.' In order to truly embrace the role of Danny, Savannah wore an oversized leather motorcycle jacket and her hair slicked back. Meanwhile, her partner Carson sported a blonde wig and a Pink Ladies bomber jacket to play Sandy. Good try: The two gave it their all as they lip synced a rendition of the class song from the film Summer Nights . Great props: Savannah wore a leather motorcycle jacket while Carson sported a Pink Ladies bomber jacket and a blonde wig . After their spirited performance of Summer Nights, Matt laughed and said: 'Don't worry. We will never show this tape again.' But even dressed as members of the opposite sex, Savannah and Carson were no match for their competition. When Al, Willie and Natalie took their turn on stage, Matt joked that Al looked 'remarkably like something out of Wayne's World' with his white wig. 'I am actually Cousin Itt,' he responded. While Willie did his best silent Sia performance, Al and Natalie flailed their bodies across the stage, in an attempt to mirror the music video’s 12-year-old star Maddie Ziegler. Imitation game: Al, Willie and Natalie donned white wigs for their performance of Sia's Chandelier . Feeling confident: Al, Willie and Natalie struck a pose as they waited for the music to start . Great performance: Willie did his best impression of Sia as he lip synced the lyrics to her hit song Chandelier . The crow erupted with applause as soon as they were finished, but Matt couldn't help but note: 'I'm humiliated for you.' Matt explained that for Today's first - and probably last - lip sync battle, the crowd would assist Chrissy in choosing the winner by a show of applause. And Savannah looked visibly irked when it became clear that Al, Willie and Natalie's performance was the audience favorite. 'I think I have to agree with the crowd,' Chrissy said. 'I'm going Team Sia.' Major moves: While Willie pretended to sing, Al and Natalie danced wildly on stage like the 12-year-old star of the Chandelier video, Maddie Ziegler . Synced up: The trio's choreography was spot on throughout their performance . After she presented them with a wrestling belt in honor of their win, Al said: 'This is so fantastic,’ before adding: 'I know Jimmy Fallon is rethinking this whole idea.' Today show fans can also look forward to Willie and his colleague Hoda Kotb duking it out in upcoming episodes of Lip Sync Battle. 'They did a really shockingly good job,' Chrissy told Matt of Willie and Hoda's performances. 'Hoda gave it her all.' In addition to the Today show stars, Dwayne Johnson, Anna Kendrick, Jennifer Lopez, John Legend, John Krasinski, Meghan Trainor, Common and Justin Bieber are all slated flaunt their lip syncing skill on the show's first season . Today show champs: Chrissy named Team Sia the winners of the lip sync battle and awarded them with a wrestling belt, which Al threw over his shoulder . Victorious: Natalie shook hands with Savannah after her team won the 'non-singing' competition .","Carson Daly transformed into Olivia Newton-John’s iconic character Sandy, while Savannah played John Travolta’s role Danny .

"A New Orleans couple bought a ramshackle historic cottage, moved it across the city and renovated it all the while using salvaged materials and respecting the home's original floor plan. Gaby Tillero and Greg Ensslen bought the the two-story 1840s Creole home from the Central City neighborhood after a church said they wanted to demolish it and expand their parking lot. The couple moved it to the Freret neighborhood where they then spent seven months renovating. Tillero and her husband Ensslen now live in the home with their two sons, six-year-old Santiago and nine-year-old Javier, as well as Tillero's mother, Olga Tillero. Scroll down for video . Gaby Tillero and Greg Ensslen bought this 1840s Creole cottage style home in the Central City neighborhood of New Orleans almost two years ago . The couple then dismantled the home, moved it to the Freret neighborhood of the city and renovated the home while respecting the floor plan and using salvaged materials to decorate the home . To honor the home's original duplex floor plan while still creating a single-family home, Ensslen and Tillero put a massive wooden staircase between the kitchen and living room . The home is decorated with materials salvaged from other homes and salvage markets. The bookshelf on the right holding dishes was part of a house Ensslen restored in 1999 . This is what the Central City house looked like before Tillero and Ensslen bought up the house and moved it to the Freret neighborhood where it sits now . The original staircase in the home separated the building into a duplex. In the renovated home Tillero and Ensslen honored the staircase idea by putting a massive wooden staircase separating the kitchen from the living room . 'We bought the house to save the house - it was slated for demolition,' Ensslen told The Times-Picayune. 'I've always liked the Creole cottage style.' Ensslen, who's a historic renovation developer and organizer of the Freret Market and Freret Street Festival, and Tillero wanted to live outside Central City, so they bought the house before they had a lot to put it on. They ended up having to dismantle the structure and put it into storage. 'We had to dismantle it completely,' Ensslen said. 'It was a stack of lumber. We put it in a few dumpsters.' The dumpsters were stored on a secured lot near the city's Industrial Canal, where they sat for a year until the couple found a lot that fit the house's dimensions. Once they sorted how to rebuilt the cottage's floor plan and collected materials for its interior, they purchased a lot. They rebuilt and renovated the house in seven months. One of the kitchen walls is decorated with a series of hand-crank egg beaters, which Ensslen began collecting in the 1980s when he moved to New Orleans . All of the wood in the home was stripped of old paint and finished with linseed oil for a more golden touch in order to give it more character . The couple bought the home almost two years before they were able to live in it. It sat in storage for a year and then went through seven months of renovations . Once the couple found a lot that would fit the cottage's dimensions, they spent seven months renovating the home . Before the couple salvaged it, the kitchen's large island was a sewing table at an old department store. Its stove top is from the 1940s . Tillero and Ensslen's kitchen was kept simple, having the counter tops made out of poured concrete that was dyed black . For the kitchen cabinets and drawers, Ensslen used forks and spooks given to him by his parents when he moved to New Orleans . The cottage was originally a duplex, but Tillero and Ensslen decided to change the home into a single-home floor plan. They added an august floating staircase in the middle of the ground floor, to honor the split. 'What a lot of New Orleans charm is about is the millwork and doors and stuff,' Ensslen said. 'I'm glad we were able to have that.' The wooden staircase features a 20th-century iron railing that was salvaged from an old housing project in another neighborhood of New Orleans. It's anchored by beams that are camouflaged by a guest bathroom that sits between the living room and the kitchen. Antique lanterns light a tiny bathroom around the corner from the entryway and flooring of the house comes from wide pine planks that once were part of the roof, which was covered by tiles. 'Until recently, there was no plywood' for roof substructures, Ensslen said. Ensslen and Tillero bought the house after a church said they wanted to tear it down and expand its parking lot to that site . Through Ensslen's work with the Preservation Resource Center, he was able to negotiate a salvage instead of a demolition of the house . From the stairs of the two-story house, a person can see both the kitchen and the living room from above . The living room of the home features a coffee table made out of an old 'pedestrians crossing' street sign and wooden legs . Tillero and Ensslen live in the home with their two sons, six-year-old Santiago and nine-year-old Javier, as well as Tillero's mother, Olga Tillero . The home features walk-through windows that raise from the ground and lead out to the cottage's massive front porch . The chest of drawers is one of the many recycled and salvaged pieces of furniture in the family's home. Ensslen and Tillero turned to artist friends to help decorate the cottage . The doors and mantels were stripped of old paint and finished with linseed oil for a more golden touch. 'The paint usually hides imperfections in the wood, but the nicks and bumps, they add more character, Ensslen said. The windows date back to before the house was purchased, before Tillero and Ensslen were married. When they were dating, Ensslen spotted the 'square, very masculine windows' at a salvage yard. 'I'd never seen anything like that.' After purchasing them they were stolen, but he got the one-of-a-kind windows back through his contacts int he salvage market industry. Tillero and Ensslen reached out to friends for interior decorating ideas. The living room features a tall built-in cabinet that was created out of wood from an old shed. A friend of the couple built the cabinet to accommodate Tillero, Ensslen and their two sons. Salvaged shutters are used as one wall of the room that Javier and Santiago share on the second floor. They seemed to have lined the shutters with ribbons they have received . Photos of Ensslen and Tillero with their sons Javier and Santiago decorate the walls of their bedroom in vintage white frames . Ensslen and Tillero's bedroom door was recycled from the old Maison Blanche department store chain in New Orleans . The door to the couple's bedroom was recycled from an old department store. Its door handle remains the same knob as the original door, marked with the Maison Blanche emblem . Another wall of the couple's room is lined with hats. Ensslen and Tillero wanted to rebuild their home on a lot that got plenty of natural light . Ensslen received these glass panels from his father who worked in a stained glass factory in New Jersey after a they 'didn't fit the client's spec' A key rack hanging in the home appears to be made out of old hooks and wood, along with recycled washers, chain links and wire . The massive, garage-door style cabinet fits a television, wine rack and cubbie holes for Javier and Santiago. Its wood, coincidentally, matches the colonial-style blue color of the kitchen walls - a paint the couple has held on to for 14 years and used in a previous home. Comic-book-style, custom-made decals line the walls of the sons' playroom, which has low desks that the kids can use for arts and crafts. The kitchen was kept simple, with counters made of black poured concrete that contrasts the bamboo and canvas blinds. A salvaged, brass-footed island sits in the middle of the kitchen. It used to be a sewing table at an old department store. As for the cabinets, the handles are created out of bent utensils. And Ensslen says that the 1940s Tappan kitchen stove top is a highlight of of the house. Though it required a bit of rehabilitation, Ensslen claims 'it's the best stove ever'. Unused signage sits in the couple's driveway, waiting to be used for their next project. The couple plans to use it to create art to put in their home . Pots and signs line the driveway of the home. Ensslen and Tillero salvaged recycled materials from all over while renovating . The windows date back to before the house was purchased, before Tillero and Ensslen were married. When they were dating, Ensslen spotted the 'square, very masculine windows' at a salvage yard . The orange front door to the cottage stands out against the home's green, white and blue paint. Walk-through windows line the porch . The home sits in New Orleans's Freret neighborhood, where Ensslen is an organizer of the Freret Market and Freret Street Festival . The home features a foliage-covered front yard and two vintage cars sit in the driveway. Though it was originally a duplex, Ensslen and Tillero decided to turn the home into a single-family structure . Not only is the inside covered in art, but the outside features salvaged materials and art as well.

"David Cameron will say that high taxes are 'immoral' as 14 million working households receive a tax cut . David Cameron will say today that high taxes and wasteful government spending are ‘immoral’ as millions receive a tax cut. As 14million working households – more than nine in ten – are given an average boost of £200 a year to their incomes, the Prime Minister will set out the Conservative case for people keeping more of their own money – because they ‘know best’ how it should be spent. And he will make a bold argument for continued lower taxes, with less spent on ‘bureaucracy’ and ‘crackpot Government schemes’. ‘There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers’ money,’ he will say. ‘And we believe it’s people – not politicians – who know best how to spend their own money. And that’s what today is all about.’ He will add that it is ‘wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees’. Among the raft of changes coming into effect today, on what Mr Cameron will dub ‘money back Monday’, are: . Other measures to encourage saving will also begin, with the Isa limit increasing to £15,240 and the 10p savings tax band abolished. Treasury analysis shows the changes will benefit 14million working households to the tune of £17 a month. And nearly million pensioner households – more than nine in ten – will benefit by £15 a month. Middle income households earning around £23,000 a year will benefit the most, and the top ten per cent of earners the least. Today will also see the abolition of the old pensions annuities, allowing retirement money to be accessed like a current account. Mr Cameron will say the changes make Britain a ‘better and fairer place to live’, adding that low taxes ‘go to the heart of what I believe as a Conservative. ‘For me, there’s the economic case: That, in a competitive world, we need to incentivise work by making it pay. ‘There’s the progressive case: That the best way to help with living standards is to let people keep more of the money they earn. ‘But above all, there is the moral case: That it is wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees.’ He will also pledge to eliminate the deficit ‘without reaching into working people’s pockets like Labour would’. However, in a speech in Yorkshire, Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes. And he will warn that the Conservatives will raise VAT. Mr Balls will say: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne are going round the country telling people they’ve never had it so good. How out of touch can they get? ‘The truth is millions are worse off because of this government’s choices. ‘And while millions are paying more, millionaires are paying less. Two years ago today they gave the top one per cent of earners in our country a £3billion a year tax cut.’ Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes . The Lib Dems said that the changes to income tax had been part of their manifesto and said Labour would cost 24million taxpayers £340 a year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say today: ‘In government, we secured a tax cut totalling £825 every year for millions of ordinary working people. We now plan to take this further, raising the [tax-free personal allowance] threshold to £12,500 and giving millions of people a further tax cut worth nearly £400.’","More than nine in ten working households will receive a tax cut from today .

"KFC has come under fire for hiring a food stylist in a bid to change its  image. Viewers unleashed a barrage of negative comments on Twitter after last night's episode of The Billion Dollar Chicken Shop on BBC One. The third programme in the series focused on the methods employed by the creative team behind KFC's rebranding exercise and showed scenes of a food stylist using hairdryers and tweezers when preparing the food for an advertisement. Scroll down for video . BBC One's The Billion Dollar Chicken Shop showed the inner workings of the fast food giant . This KFC ultimate burger (pictured) has not been styled by a food stylist . In the final episode, which aired yesterday, KFC is shown about to launch their new pulled chicken range which consists of a Twister, a mini wrap and the ultimate burger (pulled chicken piled on top of fried chicken pieces). Viewers are  introduced to food stylist Dagmar who has to prepare the new products for photography. Using her arsenal of styling tools, which include a pair of nail scissors, tweezers and a mini hairdryer, she arranges pieces of pulled chicken, snips off errant bits of meat, and melts cheese using a hairdryer. Explaining the process, the brand's new marketing director Meghan, who has been employed to change the image of the fast food giant says: 'It's meant to look like it tastes really good. 'And this needs to look amazing enough so that they [the customers] want this instead of what they normally order.' KFC has a global turnover of 23 billion dollars a year, and a billion of that comes from the UK alone . Negative comments about the styling methods were soon trending on Twitter with viewer Miss Ay tweeting: No wonder fast food never actually looks like what's advertised.. It's been designed by a bladdy food stylist! (sic). Viewer Rachel K tweeted: 'I've just witnessed a chicken burger getting a cut and blow ready for a photo shoot.' There were also some viewers who thought that they had missed their vocation in life. Katy Young expressed a desire for a career change, tweeting:  'Wonder how different life might've been if I'd pursued home ec career.... food stylist... processed cheese developer.' Hannah Tucker tweeted: 'It's all about being a food stylist... I think you missed a bit! Miss Ay tweeted: 'No wonder fast food never actually looks like what's advertised..

Neil Chetham tweeted: 'Who knew there was such a job as food stylist. What do they do five chicken fillets a short back and sides.' (sic) And there were others who expressed shock  that such a job existed. Neil Chetham tweeted: 'Who knew there was such a job as food stylist. What do they do five chicken fillets a short back and sides.' More critical comments came from Matthew Pill who said: 'As of KFC paid a food stylist to make this burger look like dog food.' A spokesperson from KFC said to FEMAIL: 'All of the food in our adverts is made using exactly the same ingredients we use in our restaurants and food stylists are there to ensure the food looks the best it can and all the ingredients can be clearly seen. 'When cooked in our restaurants our focus is delivering fresh, great tasting food fast, and so there may be some difference in how it looks - but the great taste remains.' Katy Young wondered how different her life would have turned out had she pursued a career in home economics . Hannah Tucker jokingly pointed out that the food stylist had 'missed a bit' Matthew Pill was critical, saying that the burger looked like 'dog food' Fast food is big business in the UK with 85 per cent of the British public indulging in it once a month. KFC has a global turnover of $23billion (£15) a year, and a billion of that comes from the UK alone. Some 700 million fried pieces of chicken were sold in the UK in 2014.

"You would be forgiven for thinking that the sun looked like a giant yolk after an amateur astronomer captured what looks like a chick sitting on its surface. The strange formation was photographed by amateur astronomer Gordon Ewen, and is a sun spot. The phenomenon is fairly common and the number of spots on the solar surface reflects with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section of the sun stand out from its surroundings. The sun's having a yolk! Sun spots range hugely in size, from just 10 miles (16km) to 100,000 miles (160,000km) wide - big enough to be seen from Earth without a telescope. Each one can be more than ten times the size of our planet . Gordon Ewen captured the festive photograph using a telescope at the bottom of his garden. Mr Ewen, 57, set up the observatory shed at the bottom of the garden in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, after he left his job five years ago. 'I've been interested in astronomy since I was a child. I remember I used to love borrowing books about space from the library and I had telescope when I was 10,' he said. 'But It all took a backseat when I went to university to study chemistry though.' The photograph of the chick-like sun spot was taken on March 10 at midday. The large telescope focuses on a specific wavelength of light and allows him to see the details created on the sun's surface as hydrogen gas surfaces and swirls. Sun spots range in size, from just 10 miles (16km) to 100,000 miles (160,000km) wide - big enough to be seen from Earth without a telescope, and more than ten times the size of our planet. Sunspots have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to 4,200°C (4,890 to 7,590°F), compared to 5,500°C (9,930°F) for the surrounding solar material, which is why they are so visible. Sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun, namely solar flares .

The hot spots are also the source of eruptions on the sun, mainly solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), all of which are linked to magnetic fields. The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years. This also affects the frequency of sunspots. Sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes, regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface.

"Faris Al-Khori, 62, was found with a hoard of explosive ingredients and recipes for bombs in his flats . A former Syrian doctor has been jailed after police discovered a hoard of explosive ingredients and bomb-making instructions at his home. Faris Al-Khori had dozens of chemicals, poisonous materials, bolts and handwritten notes on how to make a bomb, a court heard. The equipment was found purely by chance in April last year after a fire at a block of flats in the Muirhouse area of Edinburgh. Firefighters, who were responding to a 999 call over a fire within a rubbish chute on the 11th floor, had forced entry to a flat registered to Al-Khori and found jars containing various powders. Castor beans, which can be used to make ricin, were also found. The building was evacuated while the police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts were called in to test the substances - some of which were years old. Al-Khori also had a small amount of a highly volatile explosive lead picrate which was so dangerous that the Forensic Explosives Laboratory refused to take delivery of it and it was destroyed. A search was carried out at a further block where the 62-year-old lived with his wife in Leith and a further haul of material was recovered. Both blocks of flats were evacuated and the areas around them sealed off. Al-Khori said the materials were used for cleaning and as fertiliser but in February he pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act. Police seized bomb-making instructions and equipment including a bag containing an electrical circuit (pictured) from the properties . Two Coleman's Mustard jars were found being used to store a small amount of a highly volatile explosive, lead picrate . Sentencing him to three years and four months in prison, Judge Lady Wolffe said: 'You assembled large quantities without lawful purpose and some were stored in a high rise flat in a densely populated area. 'The number and nature of the explosive substances and the places you chose to store them lead me to conclude there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.' The court heard that much of the bomb-making equipment, which also included electrical circuits, had been ordered from online retailers. Defence QC Brian McConnachie said: 'What seems to be clear from the narrative and material is that it has been directly ordered from legitimate companies, mainly through Amazon. 'The material has always been delivered to domestic addresses and paid for by genuine credit cards registered to Mr al-Khori. 'It has always been done in the open and over a period of time. Many of the items have never been opened. Al-Khori pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act after officers seized dozens of explosive ingredients . 'It is difficult to understand the hoarding of this material but it does appear that he is someone who has some kind of academic interest in the materials. 'It seems he has accumulated materials with some kind of peculiar interest in the subject without ever intending to do anything or make anything.' Detective Superintendent David Gordon, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a significant and complex inquiry for Police Scotland, to safely deal with these volatile items and seek to establish Al-Khori's motives for storing them. 'A thorough investigation by the Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit and Crown Office found no known links to terrorist offences and we believe Faris Al-Khori was acting independently. However, he showed utter disregard for the occupants of both buildings. 'Thanks to the swift actions of our partners in the Fire Service and armed forces, we were able to quickly assess the contents of the flats and make them safe by removing a number of items for forensic examination or controlled explosion. The items from the flats in Edinburgh were discovered by chance during a fire within the rubbish chute which was then evacuated whilst the items were recovered . 'I am also grateful to the City of Edinburgh Council for their work to re-house vulnerable residents whilst we carried out our searches. 'Public safety was at the forefront of our response to this incident and all agencies worked together to minimise any risk to the public. 'Al-Khori's activities went unnoticed for many years, demonstrating the importance of community vigilance in our efforts to keep Scotland safe. 'Counter terrorism is one of Police Scotland's highest priorities, and whilst Al-Khori has no such known links we will always treat all information received with the utmost importance where any risk to the public is identified.' Al-Khori, who was born in Damascus and raised in a Christian family, trained as a doctor in Iraq but has never practised medicine in Britain after arriving here in 1984. He was the full-time carer for his wife, who suffers from schizophrenia, and has had British citizenship since 1998. Police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts had to be called in to remove the explosive materials . Lindsey Miller, the Crown Office's Procurator Fiscal for Organised Crime and Counter-Terrorism, added: 'The conviction of Al-Khori is a good example of agencies working closely together to protect the public. 'Al-Khori possessed a significant number and volume of explosive substances across two properties in Edinburgh as well as recipes for explosives. 'We worked closely with Police Service of Scotland and other agencies to prepare the case to ensure that Al-Khori was brought to justice.' 'I want to reassure the people of Scotland that we take any such offences extremely seriously, and our specialist prosecutors will continue to treat them as an absolute priority.'","Faris Al-Khori, 62, was found with dozens of bomb-making ingredients .

"He was the quiet Irishman with the hipster beard who plunged the Great British Bake Off into a storm of controversy over a Baked Alaska. Belfast-born Iain Watters had to leave the show after he binned his baked Alaska after the ice cream was left out of the freezer and it melted. But now he's back with his modern take on traditional fruity Easter  fare - a Simnel cake. Scroll down for video . Former Great British Bake Off contestant, Iain Watters, is back to revive Easter classic, the Simnel cake . Packed with moist fruit and marzipan, Simnel cake has been enjoyed since the Medieval times during Easter. Topped with 12 balls of marzipan to celebrate the 12 apostles, the cake already has a distinctive appearance but Iain has taken that even further by dying it green. Working alongside shopping website ao.com, Iain offers up a modern update on the fruit-based cake, with the twist of pistachios, figs and nutmeg seasoning. The Simnel cake took a backseat for years, replaced by other classics such as hot cross buns - until this Easter. Perhaps the trendy construction engineer can convince a new generation of bakers to attempt this hearty cake. The Belfast-baker puts a modern twist on the Easter favourite with pistachios, nutmeg and chopped figs . Instead of almond marzipan, Watters' modern update has pistachio marzipan, and the cake is decorated with orange zest and edible rose petals . The Irish baker opts for a pistachio-based marzipan, and flavours the sponge with orange zest, chopped figs and nutmeg. The recipe was created by Iain after it was revealed by ao.com that the Simnel cake was enjoying a resurgence this Easter. A survey by the shopping website also revealed that 58 per cent of the population would be indulging in home baking to celebrate Easter. For the cake: . For the pistachio marzipan: . Method: . 1. For marzipan, finely grind the pistachios in a food processor. Add the icing sugar and grind to a really fine mixture, then tip into a mixing bowl. Lightly whisk 1 egg white with a fork and stir in. Using your hand, knead the mixture until smooth. You may not need all the egg white take care as it can become too wet very quickly . 2. Wrap in cling film and allow to rest in the fridge while you are making the cake . 3. Heat the oven to 170°C/325°F/Gas mark 3, and grease and line a 22mm round, deep cake tin . 4. Prepare the figs by chopping then into large pea sizes and set aside . 5. Sift the self-raising flour and finely grate the nutmeg and set aside . 6. Beat the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy; you can use a wooden spoon or an electric whisk or mixer. Then add all the eggs including egg yolk, along with the sifted flour and grated nutmeg and beat until well combined . 7. Now fold in the fig until thoroughly dispersed . 8. Pour the mixture into the prepare cake tin and bake for 35-40mins. Inserted skewer in to the center of the cake if it comes out clean it’s done . 9. Leave to cool on a wire rack then remove from the tin and discard the lining paper . 10. Trim the top of the cake so you have a flat top for the marzipan to sit on . 11. Roll out two-thirds of the pistachio marzipan to a circle to fit the top of the cake. I rolled out the marzipan and used the base of the cake as a template and cut around it to form a perfectly sized disc Brush the top of the cake with a little warm apricot jam or honey and set the marzipan disc on top . 12. Shape the rest of the marzipan into 12 balls and arrange around the edge, again stick them on with a little warm apricot jam or honey . 13. Finally to decorate I sprinkling a few crush pistachios, zest of an orange and lemon, followed by some edible rose petals .","The contestant stormed off the show last August after dessert meltdown .

"Britain struck oil in the Falklands yesterday, a discovery likely to escalate already heightened tensions with Argentina over the ownership of the islands. Above, troops walk across the island in 1982 . Argentina has said it will prosecute oil companies operating off the Falklands coast, as tension rise on the 33rd anniversary of the conflict. Officials claim companies active there are acting 'illegally' in Argentine territory. It comes after Britain struck oil in the Falklands this week in a remote field of the islands. The find, announced by British firms that share the exploration area (Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas), could be worth billions of pounds and will increase fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory. It comes just days after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned of a 'very live threat' from Argentina. David Filmus, the Argentine minister in charge of the Malvinas, as the islands are known in Latin America, said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk.' He said the foreign and planning ministries would undertake a joint legal filing in the coming days to try and block further exploration. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes,' Mr Filmus said, adding that the process 'could end with an Argentine judge issuing an arrest warrant against those who operate illegally in Argentine waters'. The discovery at the Zebedee exploratory well comes amid worsening relations with Buenos Aires, exactly 33 years after Argentina invaded the islands. Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, said last night the find would lead to further claims by the Argentinians over the long-disputed territory in the South Atlantic. 'The rhetoric and sabre-rattling from Argentina will grow,' he added. 'The Argentinians have always been worried we will find oil and, given their economic state, they will think, 'We should have it'. 'We will have to be careful. The only way to stop them (acting) is to ensure we have sufficient military there. The rhetoric from Argentina will get worse.' Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, leading to a conflict that cost 260 British and 650 Argentine lives. The South American state still claims territorial rights to the islands. Britain pledged last week to invest £180million over the next ten years to defend the islands, with an upgrade of a surface-to-air missile system and the deployment of two Chinook helicopters. The commitment came after it was revealed earlier this year that Russia could be helping to re-arm Argentina. The latest incident sees a heightening of tensions between Argentina and Britain over the Falklands. Pictured is the bombing of the Sir Galahad Troop Carrier, after it was hit by a missile . A map shows the oil has been discovered 130 north of the island by British companies at the Zebedee oil well . Yesterday's discovery, which could yield 100 million barrels of oil, was announced by the British firms that share the exploration area, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas. Malcolm Graham-Wood, an oil industry expert and founder of the consultancy HydroCarbon Capital, said: 'This is good for Britain, good for British oil companies, good for taxes and good for the industry.' Samuel Moody, chief executive of Rockhopper, which is named after the southern rockhopper penguins found on the islands, said: 'This is a fantastic start to the 2015 Falklands drilling campaign and provides early proof of the significant remaining potential of the North Falkland Basin.' Shares in the oil-exploration companies initially soared to double digits after the discovery was announced. The row over the sovereignty of the islands, which Argentina calls Malvinas, could be intensified by the oil find. However, Mr Graham-Wood said: 'Oil is always found in difficult places, geographically and politically – look at Alaska, for instance – but that has never worried the oil industry.' Oil expert Charlie Sharp, of the investment bank Canaccord Genuity, said the Zebedee discovery was 'an excellent start to the exploration campaign'. War veterans sing the national anthem and hold the Argentinian flag during a ceremony marking the 33rd anniversary of the start of the Falklands War. Argentina has now written to the UN about British 'aggression' Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (right) pays tribute to the soldiers who died in the conflict during  the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary in Ushuaia last week . Kirchner used the anniversary - commemorated in Argentina as the Day of the Veterans and Fallen of the Malvinas Islands War - to criticise Britain's announcement it will beef up its defence of the islands . Kirchner told the crowd: 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking' Documents released by American whistleblower Edward Snowden allege Britain was actively spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011. There has been no official response from Britain or Argentina to the claims, which were published by several Argentine news agencies. The documents include allegations Britain implanted computer viruses and circulated false propaganda to discredit the Argentine government, it has been reported. It follows another made nearby in 2012 through a project called Sea Lion, but the price of oil has halved since June, forcing many explorers to cut back on spending. Experts also predict future finds could be even more significant. Stephane Foucaud, oil analyst at First Energy, said the latest discovery is 'encouraging news', but another well – called Isobel Deep, 15 miles to the south – is the 'most important' in the area. Mr Fallon said last week that existing defences in the Falklands would be modernised, with investment in 'ageing infrastructure' and an upgrade of the surface-to-air missile system. It came after news that Russian president Vladimir Putin was reportedly working on a deal to lease 12 Sukhoi Su-24 bombers to Argentina. Intelligence chiefs warned that Argentina could land forces on a remote island, and that commanders needed support helicopters to enable infantry to react to any threat.","British companies found oil and gas in a remote field north of the islands .

Fashion fans who follow many of the top bloggers on Instagram experienced an extreme case of déjà vu over the weekend after the same dress was modelled by no less than 50 fashionistas .

The move proved an instant success as the $88 Paisley Asymmetrical Dress sold out almost immediately and created an online buzz for the range. To convince that many fashionistas - including Caitlin Lindquist and Rachel Lynch - to promote your new line is extremely rare but Lord & Taylor didn’t leave anything to chance and the company has admitted that it paid the bloggers to wear the paisley-print, handkerchief-hem summer dress. Adweek reports that the bloggers received ‘unspecified compensation’ in return for giving the dress their seal of approval. ‘The goal was to make [the potential customer] stop in her feed and ask why all her favorite bloggers are wearing this dress, and what is Design Lab? Using Instagram as that vehicle is a logical choice, especially when it comes to fashion,’ said Lord & Taylor's CMO Michael Crotty. Many of the posts generated more than 1,000 Likes each, with several surpassing 5,000 Likes and some reaching rarified levels like 13,000 Likes.

The Lord & Taylor deal highlights the gray area of bloggers receiving payment for promoting some goods and services, while others they lend their credability to for free. While newspapers and websites such as the Daily Mail Online have to be upfront and clearly state when something is paid for content, the rules are less stringent on social media. Many celebrities now promote products and luxury brands via Twitter in return for either payment or freebies. Rap star Snoop Dogg and actress Lindsay Lohan are among the famous names who have been paid by big businesses to promote products to their massive Twitter followings. In leaked Sony emails in December, it was revealed that comedian Kevin Hart had been paid $2 million to send out tweets to his 14.8 million followers promoting The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington, and the Idris Elba film No Good Deed.

"Eight animals are dead, including at least one alligator that once belonged to Michael Jackson, after a fire last week destroyed two enclosures at a zoological park in Oklahoma. Authorities suspect an arsonist is to blame for the March 26 fire that left seven alligators and a crocodile 'boiled to death' at the Garold Wayne Interactive Zoological Park, News OK reports. The fire was set in the early morning hours that March day and Joe Schreibvogel, the founder of the zoo, said not only did the alleged criminal set the fire, but also stole a large amount of equipment Schreibvogel used to record his independently produced television show, JoeExotic TV. Alligators: At least one of Michael Jackson's alligators (photographed) from his Neverland Ranch died ina fire at the Garold Wayne Interactive Zoological Park in Oklahoma . Escaped: Eight animals died in the fire that destroyed two reptiles enclosures and one alligator reportedly escaped . 'This was personal,' he told News OK. 'They targeted the studio to shut me up. They wanted to get me off the air...or else they would’ve targeted something else [in the Park].' In addition to destroying the two reptile enclosures, the fire also destroyed a video production studio. Garvin County Sheriff Larry Rhodes told KJRH that the fire was arson and most likely an attempt to cover up a burglary or theft. Only one alligator escaped the blaze. KJRH reports that one alligator that reportedly belonged to the self-proclaimed King of Pop suffered severe smoke inhalation but is in recovery. Destroyed: Not only did the alleged criminal set the fire, but also stole a large amount of equipment Joe Schreibvogel, the founder of the zoo, used to record his independently produced television show, JoeExotic TV . Arson: Officials say an arson investigator has not officially declared the incident a case of arson, but has ruled out other likely causes like electrical issues and lightning from recent storms in the area . All Times: Schreibvogel said that, despite the fire, the park will remain open but armed security guards will be on duty at all times . Schreibvogel told News OK he is often targeted by animal rights groups and extremists, calling them 'animal terroristst.' He said it is an 'ongoing pattern,' noting that he has received threats before. 'It is more of disgust,' He told KJRH of his feelings toward the incident. 'If somebody has an issue with the zoo or an issue with me personally then take it up with me. 'These animals didn't deserved to be burned to death.' Rhodes told News OK that an arson investigator has not officially declared the incident a case of arson, but has ruled out other likely causes like electrical issues and lightning from recent storms in the area. King of Pop: After the worldwide mega-star died in 2009, the animals that made up his massive menagerie were spread across the U.S. to animals preserves, sanctuaries, and animal enthusiasts . No one has been arrested or charged in the case. Schreibvogel, who reportedly filed for bankruptcy in 2013, said repairs will cost $250,000. After the worldwide mega-star died in 2009, the animals that made up his massive menagerie were spread across the U.S. to animals preserves, sanctuaries, and animal enthusiasts. Jackson's alligators were taken to the Park along with his albino Python named Madonna, the Telegraph reports. 'The building can be replaced,' Schreibvogel told KXII, 'the equipment can be replaced, but Michael Jackson's alligators cannot be replaced.'

"Rutgers University has banned fraternity and sorority house parties at its main campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey, for the rest of the spring semester after several alcohol-related problems this school year, including the death of a student. The probation was decided last week but announced by the university Monday. 'Rutgers takes seriously its commitment to maintaining a healthy and safe campus environment,' the university said in a statement. Last month, a fraternity was shut down because of an underage drinking incident in November in which a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon was taken to a hospital after drinking heavily at the fraternity house. Rutgers University has banned fraternity and sorority house parties at its main campus for the rest of the spring semester after several alcohol-related problems this school year, including the death of a student . Victim: 19-year-old student Caitlyn Kovacs died of alcohol poisoning after attending a fraternity party in September 2014 . And in September, a 19-year-old student, Caitlyn Kovacs, died of alcohol poisoning after attending a fraternity party. It's not clear whether she had been drinking there or elsewhere, though. Under the ban, the university's 86 recognized fraternities and sororities will be allowed to hold spring formals and other events where third-party vendors serve alcohol. Rutgers' announcement was made less than one month until the spring semester ends May 4. After two reading days, final exams start May 7 and finish May 13. The ban was first reported by NJ.com. School officials revealed the measure to Greek community leadership at a Wednesday night meeting, according to the media outlet. In a statement to NJ.com, Rutgers spokesman E.J. Miranda said '[The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs] is taking this step out of caution and concern and will use this time to continue and reinforce its dialogue with the leadership of the university's 86 recognized fraternities and sororities about Greek life at Rutgers and their responsibilities to the campus community at large. The university said last month that six fraternities and one sorority are under review for alcohol violations. It's not clear whether Kovacs had been drinking at the fraternity house or elsewhere, though . Under the ban, the university's 86 recognized fraternities and sororities will be allowed to hold spring formals and other events where third-party vendors serve alcohol . The ban comes at a time when fraternities have had a run of bad publicity. At the University of Oklahoma, fraternity members were caught on video singing a racist song; investigators have been looking into allegations that a Penn State fraternity had a private Facebook group with pictures of nude and partially nude women, some of them asleep or unconscious; there have been allegations that members of a Dartmouth fraternity were being branded in a hazing ritual; and two organizations at North Carolina State have been shut down, one over a sexist and racist book, another over sexual assault allegations. Erin Kearns, president of the Rutgers Panhellenic Association, a governing body for sororities, told NJ.com, that many leaders of Greek groups accept the house party ban in light of the negative attention at Rutgers and elsewhere. 'Our advisers and administration thought it would be best that Rutgers doesn't fall into that trap,' she said.","Rutgers University has banned fraternity and sorority house parties at its main campus for the rest of the spring semester .

Pop stars are the best sister figures while movie actors have the ideal qualities to be brothers and Grandparents are also made up of people with successful film careers behind them. Although results show most people would love an A-List family, most people did state that the most important value to find in a parental figure was trust and kindness over being rich and good-looking.

"Poland is set to build watchtowers along the border to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, a local news agency reports. The towers, costing the Polish government £2.5million, will range from 115ft to 164ft and help monitor the 124mile long border between the two countries using CCTV. The increased border monitoring comes amid heightened tensions between Russia and Poland, a member of both NATO and the European Union, over the conflict in Ukraine. Keeping an eye out: Poland is erecting watchtowers along the border to Russian exclave Kaliningrad (pictured) as tensions between the two countries are heightened . Last month, Moscow announced plans on placing state-of-the-art Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad  for what government representatives called a 'major military exercise'. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been accused of singling out Poland as an enemy in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, accusing it of training 'Ukrainian nationalists' and instigating unrest. 'We are currently in the test phase of the technical installations on the towers,' Mirosława Aleksandrowicz from the Warmia-Masurian Border Guard told the PAP news agency. The construction of the watchtowers, due to be finished in June, is set to cost the Polish government 14million zloty (£2.5million) with a majority of the funding coming from the EU's External Borders Fund. Kaliningrad, which has a population of just under 1million, plays an important role in the maintenance of the Russian Baltic fleet. Getting ready: The CCTV towers will  will monitor the border between Poland and Kaliningrad, where Moscow recently announced they are set to place state-of-the-art Iskander missiles . When neighbouring countries Poland and Lithuania joined the EU in May 2004, strict border controls were imposed. Moscow has proposed visa-free travel between Kaliningrad and the EU several times, but the motions have been rejected. The new border watchtowers will be erected at a time when tension around the Baltic Sea is reaching new heights. Last month, Swedish Air Force and NATO jets tracked four Russian combat aircraft - two long-range, nuclear-capable Tu-22M3 bombers and two Sukhoi Su-27 fighters - flying with their transponders turned off in international airspace over the Baltic Sea. NATO said it scrambled Danish jets and Italian jets based in Lithuania  to identify the Russian aircraft which it said were heading to Kaliningrad. 'The Russian military aircraft did not use their onboard transponder; they were not in contact with civilian Air Traffic Control and they were not on a pre-filed flight plan,' a NATO military officer said. Last month, Russian military maneuvers that spread from the Arctic to the Black Sea involved 80,000 troops, about 100 navy ships and more than 220 aircraft.","CCTV towers will monitor the border between Poland and Kaliningrad .

"Weight gain: Pope Francis has been told to cut down on the pasta by doctors . The Pope has been told by doctors that he must lose weight, it has been reported. Vatican medics told Francis to cut his pasta intake to two servings a week and take a daily walk, like his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI did. They are concerned about the sedentary lifestyle of the 78-year-old Catholic leader – who spends much of his time hard at work at his desk or in meetings – as well as his considerable weight gain since he took office two years ago, sources told Italian news agency ANSA. The Pope’s weight is thought to be aggravating his sciatica, a nerve condition which causes back pain. Francis himself has suggested that he does not expect to live to an old age. Two weeks ago he told Mexican TV he did not think his papacy would last long. And on a plane back from South Korea last summer he said that his reign would only last ‘a short time, two or three years and then… to the house of the Father.’ Now doctors have told the Catholic leader that he must shed a few pounds as the extra weight is making his sciatica worse, especially when combined with his intense travel schedule. But the pope who reacted by joking refers to himself as ‘the undisciplined one’ is taking little heed of their warning, continuing to tuck into a bowl of pasta every day. More walks: The Pope arrived on his popemobile at St Peter's Square for his general audience yesterday. He is being encouraged to take more walks in a bid to improve health .","Pope's sedentary lifestyle said to be aggravating nerve condition .

"South Korean prosecutors on Wednesday indicted a man who slashed the U.S. ambassador in Seoul last month on charges of attempted murder. Kim Ki-jong, 55, was also indicted Wednesday on charges of assaulting a foreign envoy and obstruction, according to an official at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, who did not want to be named, citing department rules. On Monday, the recovering diplomat, Mark Lippert, was pictured out on the streets of Seoul flanked by five bodyguards. His left hand is still in a cast from the attack. South Korean law requires the trial to start within 14 days, and there is a possibility that it could start as early as next week, according to an official at the Seoul Central District Court, who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. He said it was too early to comment on the potential penalties Kim could face. US Ambassador Mark Lippert was pictured with five bodyguards on Wednesday, following the attack that left his arm in a cast . Lippert required 80 stitches to close up the wounds on his hand, arm and face that he sustained from the anti-US activist . Victim: U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert, pictured on March 10, was allegedly slashed by Kim KI-jong at a breakfast forum on March 5 . Charged: South Korean maverick political activist Kim Ki-Jong, who faces possible attempted murder charges after slashing US Ambassador Mark Lippert, as he leaves a police station for a court in Seoul on March 6 . Alleged attacker: Kim Ki-jong is pictured being arrested at the site where U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert was attacked on March 5, 2015 in Seoul, South Korea . Prosecutors have also been investigating whether Kim violated a controversial law that bans praise or assistance for North Korea. The court official said it was possible prosecutors may add such charges against Kim during the trial. Police say Kim attacked Ambassador Mark Lippert with a knife during a breakfast forum on March 5. He suffered deep gashes on his face and arm and was treated at a Seoul hospital for five days. Lippert, 42, was bleeding from deep wounds to his face and wrist but was able to walk after the attack. Doctors said later his condition was stable after 'very successful' surgery that required 80 stitches in his face as the White House expressed optimism for his quick return to his duties. Police say Kim chose Lippert as a target to highlight his opposition to ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills. North Korea has angrily reacted to the drills, calling them an invasion rehearsal. Anti-U.S. activists such as Kim have long blamed the presence of 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in the South as a deterrent to the North for the continuing split of the Korean Peninsula. In 2010, Kim tried to attack the Japanese ambassador to South Korea by throwing a piece of concrete and was given a suspended jail term, according to police. After the attack: Kim Ki-jong during his arrest after he allegedly attacked Ambassador Lippert with a razor blade to protest the presence of 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea .

"A gun-wielding mother has been arrested after allegedly firing into a crowd of people outside an apartment complex in a bid to break up a fight - only for the bullet to hit and kill her teenage son. Latoya Tilson, 33, took out a .25-caliber handgun and fired several times into the feuding crowd in College Park, Georgia, on Saturday night after she was hit in the face by someone, police said. But while one bullet struck a 17-year-old boy in the buttocks, another hit Tilson's 15-year-old son, Pierre, in the head. Pierre had apparently been trying to protect his  sister, 13, from the other boy. When first responders arrived at the scene, the teenager was lying unconscious on the floor. He was not breathing and a bullet was lodged in his head. His mother had fled the scene, it is alleged. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Mother Latoya Tilson (pictured), 33, has been arrested after allegedly firing into a crowd of people outside an apartment complex in a bid to break up a fight - only for the bullet to hit and kill her teenage son . Victim: Tilson fired several times into the feuding crowd in College Park, Georgia, on Saturday night after she was hit in the face by someone, police said. One of the shots killed her 17-year-old son, Pierre (pictured) Pierre was rushed to Grady Memorial Hospital with a gunshot wound to the back of his head. He remained in intensive care for two days, but despite medics' best efforts, he died on Monday. On Saturday night, Tilson was arrested on several charges, including aggravated assault and cruelty to children, after shocked witnesses told police she had seemingly accidentally shot her son. She is now expected to face upgraded charges following Pierre's death. The other shooting victim, who has not been named, is believed to have been successfully treated in hospital for his injury. During the incident outside the Godby Road apartment complex, where Tilson lived, Pierre was allegedly trying to protect his younger sister from the other boy when the situation escalated. 'The mother went out there allegedly to break it up,' Master Sergeant Jeff Hightower told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday, adding: 'During the altercation, someone hit her in the face.' Tilson then reportedly took out her small-caliber handgun and fired several shots into the crowd, accidentally striking Pierre, a freshman at Southwest DeKalb High School and a keen drummer. Scene: When first responders arrived at the scene, Pierre was lying unconscious on the floor. He was not breathing and a bullet was lodged in his head. His mother had fled, it is alleged.

He remained in intensive care for two days, but despite medics' best efforts, he died on Monday afternoon . First responders arrived at the scene in the 3100 block of Godby Road at around 8pm. They performed chest compressions on Pierre until EMS arrived and transported him to hospital. Speaking to WSB-TV before Pierre's death at 1.30pm on Monday, the victim's father, Wayne Jones, said he forgave Tilson for 'accidentally' shooting their son, adding that she was on suicide watch. 'She's very distraught at this point,' Jones said. 'If she's looking or listening, I forgive you.' Pierre and his sister reportedly lived with their father, but had been visiting their mother for the Easter weekend. Neighbors who heard the gunshots were shocked to hear Tilson had allegedly shot and killed her son, with many believing the mother should have reacted to the fight differently. One neighbor, Leslie Brooks, said: 'I just think its really sad. I just think there's another way that the situation could have been handled. Maybe the police could have been called a little sooner. 'It shocked the whole community. Because there are a lot of children out. There are a lot of parents. 'I'm a mother, so I can only imagine the devastation that she is feeling as well.' She added: 'But to pull out a gun, as a mother into a children's situation, I just think it's really sad.' Another, Stacey Marshall, who was at South Hampton Estates when the dispute broke out, told 11Alive: 'It wasn't on purpose at all. It was a mother trying to protect her kids, it just went wrong.'

He reportedly played one of the victim's drum solos in a bid to get him to respond, but to no avail. Tilson also faces charges of family violence, reckless conduct and the use of a firearm during the commission of a felony, CBS reported. And she will likely face a number of upgraded charges. She waived her first court appearance on Monday. Her next hearing will take place on April 20. Fulton County District’s Attorney Office is dealing with the case.

"A man who complained of headaches found they were caused by an infestation of maggots - which had inadvertently saved him from a deadly infection. Vietnamese labourer Pham Quang Lanh, 28, had a metal plate inserted over his skull after being struck by an iron bar on a building site. But the botched operation caused his head to become swollen with a potentially deadly infection. Fearing he couldn't afford any further medical treatment, Mr Lanh hoped the resulting headaches would eventually subside. It was only when he asked family to look at the wound that they noticed a dozen maggots crawling under the skin and they took him to the Hanoi's Viet Duc Hospital. Grim discovery: Vietnamese labourer Pham Quang Lanh shows the wound in his head where a maggot infestation had taken hold following a botched operation to repair an earlier head injury with a metal plate . Dr Nguyen Duc Anh, a neurosurgeon at the hospital, said: 'When his scar swelled a year ago, he did not go to hospital because of financial reasons. 'In fact, the reason that it was swollen was because it was infected and eventually some tissue had died, leaving him with the festering injury. 'When we took him into surgery, we discovered several maggots which were removed. 'We then needed to carry out a full operation to remove the maggots that had managed to go deeper.' But he said the infestation had actually saved Mr Lanh's life by eating the infected tissue. He said: 'This sort of fly infestation is extremely rare especially in the skull. 'I found eight references to it in medical literature worldwide and in every case the other patients died. 'In this man's case, however, the maggots had not gone on to eat any of his brain because of the metal plate. 'They actually may have kept him alive by eating the dead tissue that might otherwise have made the infection spread more quickly and killed him.' Lifesavers: Doctors say the maggots (above) ate diseased tissue that could have caused a fatal infection . The use of maggots to cleanse wounds is well known as they can remove necrotic tissue and also disinfect the wound. Mr Lanh suffered his initial head injury while working as a labourer in Malaysia. After surgery to insert a titanium plate, the wound appeared to heal well, although he did suffer headaches occasionally. He said: 'It was mostly OK until a year ago when I noticed it was swollen and sore to touch. 'I didn't want to go to hospital again because I hoped it would heal on its own and even now three years later I'm still paying the bill back for the last operation. 'I just couldn't afford another medical bill.'","Labourer Pham Quang Lanh had metal plate inserted in head after injury .

"If you were spellbound by the death-defying adventures of Katniss Everdeen, you will be very excited by the news that a Hunger Games theme park is in the planning. And fans could have the chance to experience Katniss' life as soon as next year, with the attraction expected to open in October 2016. But those looking to wield their bows and act as tribute will have to travel to Dubai for the chance to emulate the mockingjay. Hopefully the Dubai theme park will have safety measures in place for guests - unlike Katniss' experience in the arena in Hunger Games . The four million square foot Motiongate Dubai is set to attract over three million tourists annually, who will be immersed in a cinematic journey through their favourite movies via 27 different latest-in-technology rides and attractions. Contrasting with the dramatic and nail-biting theme of the Hunger Games is the incorporation of a live stage show based on Step Up: All In and Step Up: Revolution, the two most recent films in Liongate's worldwide franchise. So far there have been three 'Hunger Games' films released, featuring Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, grossing $2.3 billion at box offices worldwide. The final instalment, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, is debuting on Nov 20, 2015, and the theme park attractions will be open for fans less than a year later. Dubai Parks and Resorts Chief Executive Officer, Raed Al Nuaimi, said: 'We are thrilled to be working with a Hollywood studio whose creative resources, spirit of innovation and vision of the entertainment experience are so closely aligned with our own. 'Lionsgate's Hunger Games, Step Up and other signature properties are the perfect centerpiece for one of the most visionary new theme parks in the world. 'Through this partnership we are offering even more for the whole family to enjoy on their visit and are confident that Motiongate Dubai will set a global benchmark as the ultimate movie themed destination.' The theme park is set to open for Hunger Games fans in October 2016, and will include 27 different latest-in-technology rides and attractions . The last movie in the Hunger Games franchise is set to be released in the US in November this year . Lionsgate has partnered with Dubai Parks and Resorts to bring a Lionsgate zone to motiongate™ Dubai, the Hollywood-themed park opening in Dubai in October 2016 . 'Motiongate Dubai is poised to become one of the most exciting new entertainment destinations in the world, and we're thrilled that many of our biggest franchises will be an integral part of it,' said Lionsgate Executive Vice President of Global Franchise Management and Strategic Partnerships, Kerry Phelan, and Senior Vice President of Branded Attractions, Jenefer Brown. 'The Lionsgate section of Motiongate Dubai is an important milestone in our ongoing commitment to extend the longevity, broaden the global fan base and enrich the vitality of our most exciting entertainment properties.' If the Hunger Games and Step Up attractions were not enough to draw the crowds, Dubai Parks and Resorts even have plans for Legoland Dubai, the first of its kind in the Middle East. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Studios, Orlando, proved that if done correctly, theme parks can tap into a large movie fan base . Fans at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter can walk through a replica Hogwarts Castle, and enjoy three rollercoaster rides . Lionsgate were no doubt spurred on by the success of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which opened at Universal Studios, Florida in 2010. Attracting millions of fans from all over the globe, the attraction, which included Hogwarts Castle and Hogsmeade Village, was a rounding success. Universal opened an extension to the Harry Potter experience, Diagon Alley, last summer which cost an estimated £239million.","Motiongate Dubai will open in October, 2016 with themed zones .

"A Germanwings passenger has revealed how a pilot on a recent flight calmed fliers' nerves before takeoff by leaving the cockpit to give a speech so they could all look him in the eye. Hugh Roche Kelly, who was flying from Berlin to Paris yesterday morning, posted the account on his Twitter profile of how the pilot managed to dispel the 'tense vibe' by his actions. Data from the second black box recorder on Germanwings Flight 4U9525 today confirmed co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately flew the Airbus A320 into the side of a mountain into the French Alps, killing 150 people. Scroll down for video . A Germanwings Airbus A320 much like the one which crashed in the French Alps, killing 150 people. A passenger on one of the company's flights from Berlin to Paris has praised the pilot for calming nerves . Hugh Roche Kelly posted on his Twitter account how impressed he was with the pilot's pre-flight speech . Andreas Lubitz, the Germanwings co-pilot who deliberately brought down Flight 4U9525 last week . Nerves were calmed on Mr Kelly's flight as he took the time to say a few words in three different languages, saying he was thankful passengers were still prepared to fly with the company. Mr Kelly's post said: 'There was a tense vibe - the crew were on edge and some passengers were definitely more nervous than normal. 'Once I was actually onboard, and looked at the crew door, it was all too easy to imagine how horrific the time before that crash would have been. 'I was thinking about what kind of a response a company should make to something like this. Do you ask everyone to carry on as normal, with utmost professionalism and a stiff upper lip? 'Then, our pilot came out and made almost his normal pre flight speech, except he did so standing in the front row. 'He spoke about how it was a difficult and strange time for him and for all the cabin crew, how they still all love doing their job, and how they're thankful that they still have passengers coming onto their planes. 'Mostly though, he said he just wanted to come out and stand in front of everyone and let all the passengers on his flight have a moment of eye contact with him, and for us to meet him and for him to meet us.'

French gendarmes get ready to visit the crash site of the German Airbus A320 as part of the search operation in Seyne-les-Alpes . The first black box voice recorder from the Germanwings flight that was recovered last week revealed Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane. The second has now confirmed he intended to crash it . Relatives of the victims of the Germanwings Flight 4U9525 crash on Tuesday put down flowers at the memorial in Le Vernet, south-eastern France . Mr Kelly added that the pilot's efforts had made him feel 'enormous respect for him', adding 'anyone listening could tell it was a difficult thing to do - to stand in front of 150 more-nervous-than-they-really-needed-to-be people and say ""everything's going to be fine, because I am going to look after it"". 'So, well done that man.' The aviator's impressive efforts came just days after it emerged how fellow Germanwings pilot Frank Woiton hugged each individual passenger as they boarded a plane preparing to retrace the route taken by ill-fated Flight 4U9525 just two days after it crashed. Woiton, 48, told German newspaper Bild how he received a huge round of applause after he delivered an emotional speech before takeoff on the flight between Barcelona and Dusselforf.

French emergency rescue services work at the crash site of the Germanwings plane where 150 people died . French emergency rescue services are pictured here sifting through the wreckage of the crashed plane . The pilot, who once flew with killer airman Lubitz, told passengers: 'You can rely on the fact that I want to sit this evening with my family at the dinner table.' French air accident investigators said today the 27-year-old used the automatic pilot to put the plane into a descent and repeatedly adjusted the controls to speed up the aircraft. The revelation adds further weight to evidence from the cockpit voice recorder that Lubitz acted deliberately when he crashed the Airbus A320 into the French Alps at 430mph. A judicial source working alongside Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said the information confirmed their worst fears. The second black box, which was found charred and crumpled at the crash site yesterday, measures data such as speed, altitude and pilot action and was an 'indispensable element' in the investigation, said the source. The BEA air accident agency said in a statement that investigators have so far only obtained initial readings from the device and were continuing to extract data.

Investigation: The 74-year-old died after the burgundy Kia Venga, pictured, had its engine running and 'lurched forward', trapping her under the wheels . Emergency services, including an air ambulance, were called but she died at the scene outside the Tesco store in Pontefract, West Yorkshire on March 25. Her sister was also hurt in the accident but escaped with minor injuries. West Yorkshire Coroner David Hinchliff said today: 'Both ladies got out and Mrs Wood was standing in front of the vehicle while her sister went for a ticket. 'Mrs Wood was talking to some friends who were also there and it appears the engine was still running. 'It's not clear whether Mrs Wood's sister sat in the vehicle or leaned in but it was at that point that the vehicle rolled forward hitting Mrs Wood causing her to be trapped under the vehicle.' He said a provisional post-mortem examination showed Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, died of multiple injuries. Scene: Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, was on a shopping trip with her younger sister, who was also injured .

Attendance: 70,000 . Well, despite the horrors of the 3-1 first leg defeat in Portugal last week, that remains very much on and the statistics show that Guardiola and his players have indulged in a fair amount of self-expression along the way. Guardiola won't remember all the season's goals. He won't remember all of the seven Bayern scored against Roma and against Shakhtar, the eight they plundered at home to Hamburg or the six they put past SC Paderborn. The Spaniard will remember the half dozen his team scored here on Tuesday night, though. He will remember them - especially the five that came in a brutal, spellbinding opening half - because they will be set against the background of last week's defeat and the disgruntlement that followed. Questions were asked about his own future, Bayern's club doctor walked out, slamming the door behind him. By half-time, though, those matters seemed rather distant already and that is what brilliant football does. It makes people forget the small details. That, in a way, is the whole point of sport. Certain Bayern's rather entitled supporters will have seen little better than this over the years. Not just because of the quality of the football but because of the context and because of the sheer hunger and monotonous forward drive of this team. 'I knew my players could do this,' said Guardiola afterwards. 'But this was not perfect. We can still improve.' Having started so badly in the first leg last week – Bayern were two down early– they needed to reverse things quickly. After 23 minutes they were two goals up and, from that point on, the contest was no longer valid. Lewandowski had already struck the post when Bayern took the lead, left-back Juan Bernat crossing to the near post for Thiago Alcantara to thump in a header. The goal served to break the tension a little and as Porto failed to settle, Bayern began a hypnotic and relentless journey through the gears. A shot from Thomas Muller was saved by Fabiano soon after but that proved a rare moment of competence for the Porto goalkeeper. He had a poor night and was beaten for the second time midway through the half when Jerome Boateng glanced a header in by the post after a corner. At this point, Bayern were already mathematically through. Porto needed to score to maintain an interest but they were too skittish, too panicked and too intent in arguing with referee Martin Atkinson to ever get a foothold in a game that quickly galloped away from them.

The third goal arrived soon after – Lewandowski finishing first time after Philipp Lahm had set him up beautifully – and it was at this point a massacre seemed in the offing. A drive from Muller from distance then struck defender Casemiro and span through Fabiano's flapping legs in the 36th minute and, after a rare Porto attack culminated in a dive by, and a booking for, Jackson Martinez, Lewandowski struck again, teasing two defenders before arrowing a perfect shot in to the corner with his right foot. Half-time found the Portuguese on their knees and they crawled to the dressing room. Beyond that, Bayern lost some momentum and Porto even scored a goal, Martinez heading in. On the touchline, however, Guardiola's greatest inconvenience was a split to the seam of his suit trousers. As time wore on, he continued to instruct his players feverishly. At times he must be exhausting to play for.

"The sailor who claimed to have ‘miraculously’ survived for 66 days at sea has responded to sceptics around the world – saying: ‘God knows I am a truthful man’. Louis Jordan, 37, who was rescued 200 miles off the North Carolina coast, said he survived for more than two months on his stricken boat by eating fish he caught by trailing dirty clothes in the ocean, and by catching rainwater in a bucket. But doubters have questioned how Jordan – who declined medical help despite claiming to have broken a shoulder and who appears well-fed, with pale, unblemished skin – seemed in such good shape after such a gruelling ordeal. Scroll down for video . Louis Jordan, second from left, walks from the Coast Guard helicopter to the Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. He left hours later after he refused treatment . Doubters of Jordan's ordeal say  that despite claiming to have broken a shoulder, he appeared to be well-fed, with pale, unblemished skin . Rebutting his critics for the first time yesterday in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘God knows I am a truthful man. My family knows I am telling the truth. The people who know me know that.’ He added that the authorities had checked he had not withdrawn money from his bank account when he first went missing, though they will now scrutinise his credit card and bank statements for any activity during the period he says he was drifting. Jordan said his morale was boosted by reading the Bible from cover to cover, but claimed he lost 50 lbs after his supply of tinned food ran out and his diet was reduced to raw fish. He also gave colourful examples of his experiences, from encounters with two killer whales who had ‘such beautiful faces, they looked so friendly’, to sailing through shoals of glowing phosphorescent jellyfish at night. Jordan pictured on his 35-foot boat, which during one storm in which Jordan claims he broke his shoulder, lost its mast, rudder and radio . Jordan had been living on his docked sailboat in Conway, South Carolina, before he told his family he was 'going into the open water' to go fishing more than two months ago . Jordan, an amateur sailor who had been living on his boat, the 35 ft Angel, set off on a fishing trip from Conway, South Carolina, on January 23. He was reported missing six days later. The sailor claims he broke his shoulder during one of the three times his boat was knocked over in heavy seas – destroying the mast, rudder and radio – yet he has shown no obvious sign of injury. Last night a US Coast Guard spokesman said: ‘We don’t have any reason to doubt him but nor can we confirm he spent all this time out there. We are looking forward to learning more about what exactly happened. We are as keen as anyone to find out the truth.’ Survival expert Erik Kulik, of the True North Wilderness Survival School, said: ‘I would have expected him to be severely dehydrated. After refusing treatment at the hospital, Jordan when right into taking part in television interviews about his experience . ‘After that amount of time at sea he would have been wobbly on his feet and yet he seemed to walk perfectly. He says he broke his right shoulder and yet he didn’t even seem to be guarding that shoulder in the pictures I saw after the rescue. There is a lot that doesn’t add up.’ Jordan, who was rescued on Thursday, said his shoulder injury had healed, adding: ‘I have a bump but it’s fine. I feel no pain right now. After two months at sea it healed.’ He said he survived through ‘lots of prayer’, reading the End Time Prophecies and catching seaweed, crabs and fish by trailing dirty laundry off the hull. He said: ‘One day I caught a jellyfish and I know you can eat some types of jellyfish. I put it to my lips and it stung so badly...I spat it out. I had to put charcoal in my mouth for 45 minutes to suck out the toxin.’ He added: ‘I don’t mind being criticised. To paraphrase the Bible – fools hate to be criticised but wise men love to be criticised.’ A U.S. Coast Guard crew rescued Jordan by helicopter and said that he was smiling when they arrived . Jordan says that his morale was boosted during the trip by reading the Bible cover to cover.

"Former Saturday Night Live cast member Gary Kroeger announced Tuesday that he is running for Congress in Iowa . A former Saturday Night Live cast member is running for Congress in Iowa, and he says it isn't a laughing matter. Gary Kroeger said he will run in the 2016 Democratic primary for Iowa's 1st District. The 57-year-old Iowa native says he wants to focus on progressive policies, such as investing in education and protecting the environment. 'I'm a lion of liberalism. I truly embrace these policies of civil rights, economic equity, economic prosperity and upward mobility,' Kroeger said Tuesday. Kroeger appeared on Saturday Night Live from 1982 through 1985, and is perhaps best known for portraying Donny Osmond in a sketch with Julia Louis-Dreyfus. After a long entertainment career, he moved back to Iowa 12 years ago to raise his two sons. He now works for an advertising agency and lives in Waterloo. Freshman Republican Rep. Rod Blum currently represents the district, which covers the northeastern part of the state. Two other Democrats are already in the primary race: Cedar Rapids Councilwoman Monica Vernon and Cedar Rapids businessman Ravi Patel. Kroeger said he hasn't spoken about running for Congress with a fellow SNL alumnus, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken. Kroeger was a cast member on SNL from 1982 to 1985. Pictured on the left in a Christmas sketch with Julia Louis -Dreyfus (center) and Eddie Murphy as Gumby . Kroeger attended the the 40th anniversary of SNL in February, bringing his son Chris along for the celebrity-filled event . Kroeger said his run for office is no joke, but he hopes to enjoy the process. 'Nothing is funny about it, per se. It's very difficult,' Kroeger said. He later added: 'I am a person who is nearly 58 years old who has spent his life having a good time. Everything has to have an element of fun. There has to be a sense of joy.' He recently attended the 40th anniversary celebration of the sketch-comedy show, with son Chris as his guest.

"As the weather gets warmer many of us will dust off our large and cumbersome bladed fans. But Panasonic has developed a lighter, smaller and more powerful alternative that can blow out seven times more air than it sucks in. The Sokaze-ki Q uses fluid dynamics to take air in at the rear of the 10-inch (25cm) device, move it through specially designed channels before blasting it from the front via a turbofan. Panasonic Japan, which designed the device, said that once the turbofan has moved the air flow to the front of the device, a 'high-pressure jet airflow' creates straight, direct blasts of air. Alternatively, the Q has a '1/f fluctuation' function that reduces the force of the air flow, and sends 'natural wind' that mimics outside breeze . These channels have been designed to reduce how much drag the air flow is subjected to as it moves through the 'ball'. And the holes have been designed in such a way so that the flow collects additional air at is leaves the device to boost its trajectory and output. In particular, there is a central outlet. Air is drawn into the 'Q' using small inlets on the rear and are driven by the so-called impellers, or bladed fins. This airflow pulls in additional air using the large round air inlets plotted around the Q, and all of this is released through the main outlet.

"A Texas state trooper who did what millions of hip-hop fans would love to do and posed for a picture with Snoop Dogg was told he has ''deficiencies indicating need for counseling'. Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears posed for the photograph with Snoop at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech. Spears, who is based out of the state's Gilmer office, posed for the photo at the rapper's request. Scroll down for video . Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears (left) was disciplined last week for posing with Snoop Dogg . Snoop requested the photo at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech . Spears' bosses called Snoop a figure who has a 'criminal background including numerous drug charges' After his publicist took the photo, Snoop - whose real name is Calvin Broadus - posted it to Instagram with the caption: 'Me n my deputy dogg'. Spears' bosses at DPS saw the posting and then cited him, according to the Dallas Morning News. The official reprimand read: 'While working a secondary employment job, Trooper Spears took a photo with a public figure who has a well-known criminal background including numerous drug charges. 'The public figure posted the photo on social media and it reflects poorly on the Agency.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him. Snoop has convictions for drug possession and stood trial for murder in 1993 before being acquitted. Since Spears was only reprimanded with counseling, DPS does not view the penalty as a formal disciplinary action and the trooper cannot appeal. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said on Wednesday: 'DPS does not typically discuss or release specifics of personnel issues unless they result in disciplinary action as outlined in Government Code 411.00755 and 411.0072. 'Supervisors counsel and coach employees on a regular basis, and these efforts do not constitute formal discipline by the department.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him but that's about it . Attorney Ty Clevenger is representing Spears and covering the case on his blog. He wrote: 'DPS claims that the counseling forms are not really discipline, therefore the employee has no right to appeal. 'Yet those counseling incidents can block a trooper’s chances for promotion or advancement. 'So it appears that DPS commanders are papering Billy’s file with counseling incidents because they can’t prove that he violated any law, order, or policy, and they know that he will beat them with the law and the facts if he is given an opportunity to appeal.' Clevenger is calling public attention to the situation and has written letters to officials at DPS. It seems the Department of Public Safety has a problem with Snoop but Austin police seem okay with him .","Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears was disciplined last week .

"Jamie Carragher believes Chelsea captain John Terry is the best defender to have ever graced the Premier League. Terry, 34, has enjoyed another impressive season at Stamford Bridge and was the star performer as he led Jose Mourinho's side to a 0-0 draw against Arsenal on Sunday.

"Yemeni rebels have seized President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi's palace on the same day Al-Qaeda militants freed hundreds of inmates in a jailbreak. Security officials said member of Al-Qaeda stormed a Hadramawt provincial prison in southeast Yemen and freed more than 300 inmates, including one of their leaders Khalid Batarfi. Batarfi is among Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's  top regional commanders, known for his leading role in a 2011-2012 battle with government troops during which extremists seized large parts of the south and east. Rebels: Armed Houthi members raise their guns aloft while shouting anti-Saudi slogans during a rally protesting airstrikes carried out by a Saudi-led coalition, yesterday . Two guards and five inmates were killed in clashes, the official said. Elsewhere, the advance by Iran-backed rebels into Aden, the last bastion of Hadi supporters came despite a week of Saudi-led air strikes. A senior security official who witnessed the advance said: 'Dozens of Houthi militia and their allies arrived in armoured troop carriers and entered Al-Maashiq presidential palace'. Heavy clashes erupted afterwards between the rebels and their opponents inside the compound. A defence ministry official in Aden later confirmed the fall of the palace, saying it was now controlled by forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, which have allied with the Huthis. Escalating: Damage caused by reported Saudi-airstrikes. Reports today say Yemeni rebels have seized President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi's palace . War-zone: Yemenis walk around the damage caused by an airstrike allegedly carried out by a Saudi-led coalition against a Houthi rebels position in the city of Yarim . The rebels have seized swathes of the country including the capital Sanaa. At least 44 people, including 18 civilians, were reported dead  in fierce fighting between opponents and supporters of Hadi in the southern port city today. 'There are bodies and wounded in the streets and nobody dares to approach,' said Khaled al-Shaie, a resident in the central neighbourhood of Crater. Hadi fled to Aden from the capital after the Huthi Shiite rebels seized power in February, and the palace came under fire from warplanes twice during his stay. Carnage: A Yemeni man inspects his house damaged by an airstrike allegedly carried out by a Saudi-led coalition, yesterday. Today, rebel forces seized President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi's palace . He went into hiding last week as the rebels bore down on what was his last stronghold, later surfacing in the Saudi capital as Riyadh launched an air war on the rebels. Saudi Arabia announced Thursday its first casualties since launching the offensive, with one soldier killed and 10 more wounded by gunfire from across the Yemeni border. Rights groups have expressed alarm at civilian casualties, including in an air strike on a camp for displaced people and the bombing of a dairy. Several dozen people were killed in both incidents. ""All sides in Yemen's conflict need to do what they can to avoid harming civilians,"" said Joe Stork of New York-based Human Rights Watch. In the southern province of Dhaleh, Huthis killed 40 rebel fighters who tried to desert after their commander urged them to lay down their arms because of the intense air strikes, military sources said. Diplomats in New York said Gulf countries were locked in tough negotiations with Russia on a UN draft resolution to impose an arms embargo and sanctions on the rebels.","300 inmates including Al-Qaeda leader freed during breakout at jail .

"From working late to boring marriages and just not being in love any more, there's no end to the excuses deployed by cheating spouses to get themselves off the hook. But one man has taken the art of the creative excuse to a new level and  claimed his sexually transmitted disease was the result of car exhaust rather than cheating, according to his ex. 33-year-old Stuart, had, said ex-girlfriend Sophie, offered up the novel excuse when accused of cheating after discovering that she had mysteriously contracted chlamydia. Scroll down for video .

'I never said that!’ he insisted. Unfortunately, Stuart's appearance didn't quite go as planned with host Kyle unearthing a series of lies that belied his denial.

Along with falsely claiming to be a paramedic, he also accused Sophie of attacking his new love Linda when in fact neither were true. Linda, although described by Stuart as his 'wife', turned out to be a girlfriend instead, having changed her name by deed poll rather than tying the knot. After going on an extended moan about his lack of access to his and Sophie's children, it also transpired that he had run off with his young son for five weeks. Adding to Stuart's pain was Sophie's mother Kathy who accused him of refusing to pay child support and instead proffering a £20 note every two weeks.","33-year-old Stuart made the bizarre excuse to ex-girlfriend Sophie .

"A 14-year-old Pennsylvania girl allegedly conspired with her 20-year-old soldier boyfriend to have her mother killed, texting him hours before the woman was stabbed to death, 'I want her gone,' it emerged today. Jamie Silvonek was charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin announced Thursday. Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was fatally stabbed in the driveway of her Upper Macungie Township home early March 15, hours after taking Jamie Silvonek and the eighth-grader's boyfriend, Army Spc. Caleb Barnes, to a concert, according to court documents. Scroll down for video . Star-crossed lovers: Jamie Silvonek (left), 14, and her boyfriend, 20-year-old Army Spc Caleb Barnes (right), have been charged with killing the girl's mother for trying to break them up . Barnes, who was on leave from Fort Meade in Maryland at the time of the slaying, was previously charged with homicide. He confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. Slain in cold blood: Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was stabbed several times in the neck inside her car after driving her daughter and Barnes from a concert . The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, given the age disparity. 'There has to be some type of duress or coercion,' he said. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. 'She cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom, and told me she was coerced, she was afraid she was going to be killed, she was afraid her dad was going to be killed,' Waldron told The Associated Press. 'So there's a lot of things we have to decipher here.' Authorities said Barnes and Jamie Silvonek met in October — when she was 13 — but that she told him she was 17. He joined the military in February of 2012. Barnes graduated advanced training from the Presidio of Monterey, California, and his awards include the Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal, Army Times reported. Cheryl Silvonek found out about their relationship in early March and ordered the couple to break up, according to court documents. A day later, the teenager told Barnes she wanted her parents dead, the documents said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. Police found the victim's blood-soaked car submerged in a pond and traced it to the Silvonek family's home in Upper Macungie Township (pictured) Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life . The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' The teenager then texted Barnes: 'She threatened to throw me out of the house. I want her gone,' the affidavit said. Later, she allegedly wrote to him: 'Just do it.' Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. 'I can't stand her lying to you like this,' Jamie wrote to Barnes. 'SHE IS LYING ABOUT MY AGE,' reported Lehigh Valley Live. Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek.

"An incarcerated mother has revealed that her one-year-old son celebrated his first birthday in prison with a party that featured donated presents and a colorful cake shared by the prison staffers who served as the toddler's guests. Jayla Currie from Berne, Indiana, is a part of the Wee Ones Nursery program at the Indiana Women’s Prison, a system that was established in 2008 and allows mothers, like Jayla, to share rooms with their babies while they serve out their sentences. In 23-year-old Jayla’s case that means a 10 month sentence for drug charges. 'I’ve gotten to see Jayden reach all of his milestones,' Jayla told Yahoo Parenting of living with her son. 'The most amazing one was watching him take his first steps. It still scares me to death.' Unique location: Jayla Currie posed with her son Jayden as he enjoyed birthday cake at his first birthday party, which was held at the Indiana Women’s Prison . As a part of the program, mothers and their babies have private rooms in one housing unit, which also contains other female inmates, who don't have any violent offenses on their records, to serve as trained nannies and help care for the infants when the parents have to attend certain obligations. Jayla noted that their rooms are as 'homey as possible', adding that instead of the metal bunkbeds that are often associated with prison life, she has a bed, a crib, a dresser, a closet and even a chair. She explained that her unit has 38 women in it, meaning that Jayden has constant attention. The mother-of-one, who has already served three months of her reduced 10-month sentence for meth manufacturing and possession, never thought she would be raising her child behind bars. Her life started to spiral out of control when she dropped out of cosmetology school at 19-years-old. She started taking pharmaceutical drugs and began a relationship with a man who was making meth. Jayla recalled that by the time she was 20, she was frequently using drugs and had also stopped paying her bills. By 21 she began helping her boyfriend to manufacture and sell meth. Special bond: The 23-year-old is a part of the Wee Ones Nursery, a program that allows incarcerated mothers to share rooms with their babies . 'I was spending every waking minute trying to get high,' she said. A year later, she was arrested and charged with two counts of meth manufacturing and possession and sentenced to six years in prison. After her family posted her bond, 30 days after she was incarcerated, Jayla unexpectedly got pregnant during her 60-day release, something which she now describes as 'very bad timing'. Jayla then spent six months in county jail before she signed a plea bargain last March. When she was seven months pregnant, she was transferred to Indiana Women's Prison. Two months later she gave birth to Jayden in a single room with just a doctor and a female officer. 'I spent my whole pregnancy thinking I couldn’t keep my son because of the amount of time I had to serve my sentence,' she recalled. 'To be able to have him here with me is wonderful.' Added touches: Jayden's birthday party inside the prison included a sheet cake and numerous decorations . Different kind of home: This is an outside view of the Indiana Women’s Prison where Jayla and Jayden will live until her expected release this October . The Wee Ones Nursery program aims to help incarcerated mothers bond with their newborns in a way that would have previously been impossible for them. In order to quality, female inmates have to quality for certain criteria, including a release date that is not more than 18 months after their projected delivery dates. According to a 2013 study from the University of Indianapolis’ Community Research Center, incarcerated women who live with their newborn infants in the special nursery wing at the prison are more likely to retain custody of their children after release and less likely to be arrested again. After her expected release this October, Jayla plans on moving in with her mom and working at a recycling factory owned by her family. She is actually worried that leaving the prison community will be the hardest on her son, who has grown up with Jayla's fellow inmates. The devoted mother said that she will definitely tell him about his time in prison when he gets older. 'I’m not ashamed because I’m proud of who I’ve become,' she said.","Jayla Currie, 23, is part of the Wee Ones Nursery program at the Indiana Women’s Prison .

"Amanda Knox has said she will work to overturn miscarriages of justice after being sensationally cleared of the murder of Meredith Kercher. Knox said she would lobby on behalf of other innocent people who were jailed ‘because I know how a wrongful conviction can destroy one’s life.’ The American, known as Foxy Knoxy, and former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito served four years for the 2007 murder of the 21-year-old exchange student. Scroll down for video . Cleared: Amanda Knox is pledging to work for others who claim to have suffered miscarriages of justice . They were freed on appeal in 2011 and Knox immediately returned to the US where she rebuilt her life finding love with ex school friend Colin Sutherland. Then last year an appeal court overturned their acquittal finding the pair guilty of the murder again. Victim: Meredith Kercher was killed while in her bed in Perugia in 2007 . In a shocking twist Italy’s highest court last week conclusively cleared the former couple. A third man Rudy Guede is serving a 16 year sentence for the murder. In an open letter to the Seattle Times, Knox said she was ‘relieved and grateful’ that the court had found her innocent. She said she felt ‘lucky’ to have had the support of those belief ‘helped me survive when I was at my most vulnerable and almost entirely lost.’ She only survived the seven year ordeal she said ‘because my dear family gave up their lives to be with me in Italy, because scores of friends donated their resources, because my lawyers worked tirelessly to bring attention to the evidence that exonerated me, because strangers — from world-renowned DNA experts to former FBI crime-scene investigators to everyday citizens — saw the injustice in my case and spoke out.' Because of this she said she felt compelled to ‘give back’. She said: ‘I am all too aware of how lucky I am to have received such strong support. I am also aware that countless other wrongfully convicted persons do not have such support. I will work to give a voice to those individuals. I will do this because I know how a wrongful conviction can destroy one’s life.’ Knox -who was reportedly paid £2.7million ($4million) for her 2013 book Waiting to Be Heard -could be in line for millions in compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. It is thought the amount could reach seven figures. Suspects: Amanda Knox and then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito kissing shortly after Meredith's death. Rudy Guede (right) is serving a 16 year sentence for the murder .

"If you're a traveller with a penchant for room service, then you would be better off ordering snacks in Sofia, Bulgaria, than in the Swiss city of Zurich. In Sofia, a night's stay in a four-star hotel, along with your room service order, will only set you back £63.78, which is more than four times cheaper than at the costliest destination examined, New York. TripAdvisor's annual cost comparison report compared the cost of hotel room service items in 48 popular holiday destinations around the world and found that guests could buy 16 bottles of vodka in Kiev, Ukraine, for the same price as a club sandwich in Zurich.

"A furious landowner was forced to fork out thousands of pounds to restore a public path to one of Britain's most popular beauty spots. James Weld stumped up £15,000 to bring an end to a three year stand-off with Natural England over who was responsible for the coastal path down to the beach at Durdle Door on Dorset's Jurassic Coast. The previous steps that lead down to the popular tourist attraction were washed away in storms in 2012. James Weld has stumped up £15,000 to end a three-year stand-off with Natural England over access to Durdle Door beach . Since then visitors have faced a perilous scramble down a crumbling cliff to reach the shore, even resorting to sliding down on their backsides. The iconic rock archway and neighbouring Lulworth Cove are part of the Weld family's 12,000-acre Lulworth estate. The family have maintained the steps since they first bought the land in the 1600s. But in 2009, Natural England was handed responsibility for the country's coastal paths under the Coastal Access Act. The government also announced a 630-mile path along the south west coast which was to be opened in time for the Olympics. However, Mr Weld says that Natural England 'shirked' its duty to reinstate the steps under the law for three years by claiming they did not form part of the coastal path. Calling the long-running dispute 'laughable and ludicrous', he also accused the organisation of ignoring advice given to them on how to manage tourist hotspots like the Lulworth Estate. The steps to access the iconic rock archway on the Dorset Jurassic coast had been washed away during storms in 2012 . Natural England said they were happy the steps had been reopened but declined to comment on Mr Weld's claims. The estate took the decision to rebuild the 88 steps themselves after becoming 'utterly fed-up with the bureaucracy', Mr Weld said. Mr Weld, a chartered surveyor, said: 'For quite a number of decades now people have visited our coasts and beaches quite freely. 'About 20 or so years ago we decided to put in steps leading down to the beaches so they didn't have to scramble down the cliffs to get to them. In 2009 the Coastal Access Act came along and we had lots of meetings with Natural England about managing 'honeypot' sites like Lulworth. 'We had assurances from them that they wouldn't interfere with the Lulworth Estate because they were happy with the way we were running things. 'Then they announced their big idea, which was to open a 630-mile path along the south west coast in time for the Olympics - a path that had already existed for about 40 years - and duly spent a vast amount of money on it. The washed-away steps meant visitors were left to scramble up and down the dangerous crumbling cliffs to try and access the beach . The Government body had been granted responsibility for the country's coastal paths under the Coastal Access Act 2009 . 'You can understand the idiocy of this plan. Our view was that if the coast path was now a public right of way under the Coastal Access Act and controlled by Natural England then Natural England should pay for it. 'One would have thought that would have been the logical answer but Natural England disagreed. 'Their response was that they were giving the public access to beaches but not the means to actually do it. 'In 2012 the steps down to Durdle Door were washed away in the heavy spring weather we had. It was clear the steps needed replacing but Natural England said they weren't responsible for them. 'We got to a stand-off with Natural England - we wanted them to accept their responsibility while they were saying 'it's nothing to do with us'. 'About six months ago we got utterly fed up with all the bureaucracy and took the decision to get on with it and pay for the steps ourselves. 'The cost was about £15,000 - not a huge amount of money for a huge Government body like Natural England but a lot for us. Mr Weld says Natural England 'shirked' its duty for three years by claiming they did not form part of the coastal path, leaving him to pay the £15,000 to rebuild the steps which have now been reopened (pictured) 'We have a very good relationship with Natural England in all other areas but with coastal access they have ignored all the advice right from the beginning about managing honeypot sites. 'The whole thing has been laughable and ludicrous and I've lost patience with it. 'In the end, regardless of who was officially responsible or the cost, we felt the need to step in to put Durdle Door back on the map for walkers and sightseers, and to help minimise the environmental impact to this extraordinary coastal feature. 'Durdle Door is a national icon as well as one of Dorset's icons so we're delighted to be able to reopen it, but it's sad it's taken so long.' The £15,000 will add to the £40,000 the Lulworth Estate currently spends each year maintaining paths on its land. A spokesman for Natural England said: 'It's good news that the Durdle Door beach steps have been reopened and that local visitors can have safe access to the beach to enjoy this wonderful stretch of the English coast. 'We're not going to be responding to those remarks made by Mr Weld.' Humphrey Weld, a direct ancestor of James Weld, bought Lulworth Castle and its sprawling estate in 1641 from politician Thomas Howard, 3rd Viscount Howard of Bindon. The Weld estate owns around five miles of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which includes Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove . Natural England said it was glad Durdle Door's beach steps have been reopened but would not comment on the landowner's claims . It has remained in the Weld family ever since. It was gutted by fire in 1929 and only fully restored in the 1990s by the Weld estate and English Heritage. The estate owns around five miles of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which includes Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove. The two beauty spots attract more than 500,000 visitors a year. Agriculture plays a large part in the estate, and it still produces 25 million litres of milk a year, much of which is sold to Marks and Spencer. In 2013 Natural England said claims made by Lulworth Estate owner James Weld that the 2009 Coastal Access Act handed them responsibility for the steps to Durdle Door were untrue. A Natural England spokesman said in 2013: 'Contrary to Mr Weld's statement, the legislation does not take land away from landowners or interfere with their freedom to manage it. 'Durdle Door beach still belongs to the Lulworth Estate and is managed alongside the estate's nearby holiday park, generating revenue from visitors to the park and more widely. 'The estate has always maintained the steps down on to the beach and remains able to do so now.'","James Weld had to stump up £15,000 to restore steps to the beach  at Durdle Door which were washed away in 2012 .

"When Jasmine Midgley was born with a birthmark, her parents were assured it was nothing to worry about. But within weeks it had nearly killed her, after doctors failed to realise it was cutting off her air supply. At just 10 weeks old, she was rushed back to hospital because the seemingly harmless mark had started growing into her throat, almost closing over her airways and choking her. Jasmine Midgley nearly died after a birthmark began blocking her airways. Her parents Tanja and Steven were warned she may not survive . In the days after her birth, the seemingly harmless mark had started growing into her throat, almost closing over her airways and choking her. Doctors diagnosed a rare condition called a subglottic hemangioma - a benign tumour made up of blood vessels that can be on the skin or go deeper . Despite several trips to the GP and A&E, her parents Tanja and Steven, of Stockton-on-Tees, had been repeatedly told their daughter had bronchiolitis. This is a common infection of the upper airways that most often affects babies and young children. But when antibiotics failed to help Jasmine's severe cold-like symptoms, she was kept in the University Hospital of North Tees overnight. Her life-threatening problem was only detected the next day when a new doctor came onto the ward and noticed the birthmark  - which by now had spread all over her neck - was cutting off her air supply. Doctors explained the birthmark had sparked the problems because of a rare condition called a subglottic hemangioma. Haemangiomas are benign  tumors made up of blood vessels that can be on the skin or go deeper. They usually appear days to weeks after birth and the type that affected Jasmine occur in the breathing passage, just below the vocal cords. If they grow and are left untreated, they can cause potentially fatal breathing difficulties. Mrs Midgeley, 39, a full-time mother, said: 'I had my suspicions the birth mark might have been responsible for Jasmine's illness. 'We'd been told that it was nothing to worry about, even though it had spread all over her neck by this stage. Despite several trips to the GP and A&E, her parents Tanja and Steven, of Stockton-on-Tees, had been repeatedly told their daughter had bronchiolitis - a common infection of the airways . Jasmine was treated successfully with medication which shrunk the blood vessels over two weeks. Her mother claims doctors were surprised she survived . 'The new doctor took one look at her and knew right away that her sickness was connected to it.' Jasmine's birthmark didn't become visible until she was about a week old. Her mother added: 'It continued to grow and Steven mentioned that it was getting a lot bigger. 'But all my kids had birthmarks and I told him they just disappear on their own. She added: 'It wasn't until we were in hospital and the nurse mentioned it that we put two and two together.' After being seen by a doctor, Jasmine was transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle and taken into theatre for a closer examination. Meanwhile her father, the manager of a waste transfer centre, began Googling his daughter's symptoms. Mrs Midgley said: 'We were really scared. The search brought up some horrible pictures but at the same time, I felt we were in the best possible place and she was getting the attention she needed. Now four months old, Jasmine is thriving. Her father said: 'She is so much happier and settled. It's really scary to think that she was essentially choking on this birthmark and we didn't know' 'When the doctors and nurses wheeled Jasmine back in they were grey - they couldn't believe what they had found.' Jasmine was treated successfully with medication which shrunk the blood vessels over two weeks and her mother claims doctors were surprised she survived. Haemangiomas are benign  tumors made up of blood vessels that can be on the skin or go deeper. They usually appear days to weeks after birth and can occur anywhere in the body. In the head and neck, haemangiomas can be located on or around the face, eyes, ears, saliva glands, mouth, and tongue. The type that affected Jasmine occur in the breathing passage, just below the vocal cords, and are called 'subglottic hemangiomas'. If they grow and are left untreated, they can cause potentially fatal breathing difficulties. Subglottic hemangiomas may form a large mass in the subglottic airway causing varying degrees of airway obstruction. Many require active intervention because of their life-threatening nature in the airway. Symptoms of one include: . Croup-like cough . Noisy breathing when inhaling and exhaling . Difficulty breathing . Now four months old, Jasmine is thriving. Mr Midgley, 43, said: 'She is a completely different baby now, she is so much happier and settled. 'It's really scary to think that she was essentially choking on this birthmark and we didn't know.' A spokesman for North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Birthmarks like these are very rare and difficult to spot. 'We're very pleased that the problem was identified the very next morning and Jasmine got the care she needed.' Her father has now decided to run more than 100 miles in races, triathlons and obstacle courses to raise money for The Sick Children's Trust. The charity supported the family when Jasmine was being treated in February, putting them up free of charge near the Royal Victoria Infirmary.

"George Osborne said he wanted to see half a million first time buyers get on the housing ladder every year . Half a million first time buyers will be helped onto the housing ladder every year by 2020, George Osborne pledged today. The Chancellor said he wanted a 1980s-style property 'revolution' after years of declining home ownership. He pledged to double the number of people buying their first home using government help-to-by schemes. Since 2010 there have been 1.2 million first-time purchases and Mr Osborne wants at least 2.4 million more over the next five years. Mr Osborne said he wanted to reverse the 'steady' decline in first-time buyers getting a home. He told Sky News: 'I'm a great believer in a home-owning nation; a home-owning democracy where families can get on the housing ladder. 'And the truth is that the number of first-time buyers has fallen steadily over recent years, and I want to reverse that, and I want to help families get on that housing ladder.' David Cameron added: 'We have acted on every front, we’ll continue to do so. We have reformed the planning system so that we can build houses. 'We have help to buy, which has helped thousands of young people onto the housing ladder. 'With the help to buy ISA, a new scheme that will help people save for a deposit. 'So we’re building the homes, we’re helping young people, we are creating an economy with jobs, we want to see a doubling in the number of first-time buyers. I believe Britain should be a home-owning democracy, that’s the goal.' It came after Mr Osborne told the Sunday Telegraph that he wanted a 'massive increase in the number of people who can own their own home'. He said: 'Home ownership is an absolutely core Conservative belief and aspiration that we support. 'In the next parliament I would like to see over a million more people helped into home ownership by a Conservative government. 'I would like to see us double the number of first-time buyers up to half a million. That is the kind of level we saw in the 1980s. 'There is no reason why our country can't achieve that again. That's a goal we set ourselves today.' The Chancellor of the Exchequer was campaigning with the Tory candidate for Brentford and Isleworth, Mary Macleod, at the Wyevale Garden Centre in west London today . David Cameron last week made a general election campaign visit to a housing development for first time buyers . Labour's Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said: 'More warm words on housing from the Chancellor will be cold comfort to the record number of young people and families priced out of home ownership over the past five years. 'Under this Tory-led government we've seen the lowest levels of housebuilding in peacetime since the 1920s and home ownership has fallen to a 30-year low. 'Labour's Better Plan will ensure Britain builds the homes working people need. 'Labour will get at least 200,000 homes built a year by 2020, backed by a comprehensive plan - the first in a generation - and a £5bn Future Homes Fund to support the building of homes for first-time buyers.'","Chancellor pledged to double the number of people buying their first home .

"Two adjoining 'his and hers' mansions have gone on the market on the world-renowned Sandbanks peninsula for £13million. Standing just a few feet apart, the beachfront homes are virtually identical in every way, boasting an indoor swimming pool, four storeys and stunning sea views. But the prospective buyers might have to flip a coin to see who gets which one - because one of the homes comes with an extra en-suite bedroom. Scroll down for video . Two adjoining 'his and hers' mansions have gone on the market on the world-renowned Sandbanks peninsula for £13 million . Tom Doyle, of estate agents Lloyds Property Group which is selling both properties, said the homes would be perfect for a couple who like their independence. He said: 'It would be nice to sell them as a pair, to someone who either wants to live in one and rent out the other or even to a couple who want their own his and her homes.' The beachfront properties called la Plage and la Baie - translated as the beach and the bay - are the latest in the so-called Millionaires' Row in Poole, Dorset, to go on the market. The homes have been built on a 3,000sqm plot, which was previously occupied by a  four-bedroom house. But after buying the plot for £4.25m, developers eked out every square on the area by building two homes - a move which has trebled the value of the plot. Boasting a prime position on the south east corner of the millionaire's enclave, the mansions can be bought as a pair or separately. Standing just a few feet apart, the beachfront homes are virtually identical in every way, boasting an indoor swimming pool, four storeys and stunning sea views . The beachfront properties called la Plage and la Baie - which mean the beach and the bay - are the latest in the so-called Millionaires' Row to go on the market and boast these incredible sea views (pictured) They occupy a prime position on the south east corner of the millionaire's enclave in Poole, Dorset (pictured) While one of the homes has five en-suite bedrooms, the other has four. But both have indoor swimming pools, balconies, lifts to all floors, direct beach access and magnificent sea views. It is thought the developers have spent more than £3m building the two homes. Mr Doyle said that, if bought separately, the properties would each be sold for £6.5m - the same as the price of a 38-bed castle in the Scottish Highlands . He said: 'Development opportunities are becoming scarcer on Sandbanks and so prices for older houses are going up. 'Developers need to maximise the space available in order to make money. It is becoming harder to financially justify building one home on a plot and so we are now seeing two homes appear. The agent marketing the homes said more developers are building multiple homes on a single plot to get better value for money in the area (pictured), which is the most expensive place to buy in the UK . Over the last two decades Sandbanks has become a millionaire's playground with dozens of luxury beachfront mansions being built and sold for up to £12 million . 'Although a lot of the plots are quite deep you can't spread out or go beyond the existing building line so you have build upwards as much as the planning authorities will allow.' He added: 'Both these properties are built over four levels, with the bedrooms on the upper two floors. They are very much high end in terms of their quality. 'I can also see them appealing to middle-age professionals who want them as a second home.' Last year, two properties called Tom and Jerry went on the market in Sandbanks after being built on one plot, just 10inches apart. It paved the way for more developers to follow the trend. Over the last two decades Sandbanks has become a millionaire's playground with dozens of luxury beachfront mansions being built and sold for up to £12 million. Last year, two properties called Tom and Jerry went on the market in Sandbanks after being built on the same plot, just 10inches apart (pictured) The two homes were built on a one acre site once occupied by a single bungalow (pictured) Sandbanks is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind London, Manhattan and Tokyo - to buy property. Prices in the area have soared in the past few years, with prospective buyers even able to get more for their money in the exclusive London neighbourhood of Mayfair. In 2013, one property on Sandbanks sold for the equivalent of £1,725  per square foot, which is a record for the area. Sandbanks, though, is not a haunt of A-list actresses or pop stars - but more of football managers, including former Queen's Park Rangers boss Harry Redknapp. The football manager bought his ultra-modern property with his wife Sandra for £3million in 2001 and commuted daily from his waterfront home to QPR's London-based ground Loftus Road. Troubled footballer Paul Gascoigne also reportedly moved to the exclusive resort, where he is said to be renting a flash penthouse apartment. Other notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, and Mr Redknapp's son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there. There are also a smattering of businessmen, most of whom are newly retired and unsure what to do with all their money. Located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of property. By area Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', boasts the fourth highest land value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive properties outside London. Sandbanks' popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel. Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions. The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand. In July 2009 a 1,393-square-metre (14,990 sq ft) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre. And last year, a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 per cent increase in value. A a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country also went on sale last year for an eye-watering £2.25million. In Novembe, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £6.25m - double what it was worth when there was a house on the site. Notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie.

"Oskar Groening (pictured earlier in the hearing) is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder and faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted . An Auschwitz survivor who lost 49 family members in the Holocaust says the fact that a 93-year-old former guard at the death camp is on trial is more important than any punishment. Eva Pusztai-Fahidi, who lost her parents and sister, told the Lueneburg state court today that seeing former SS officer Oskar Groening in court is 'a kind of satisfaction.' The 89-year-old says she could never have imagined she would be testifying before a German court and that 'for me it's not about the punishment', the DPA news agency reported. Her comments come after another Holocaust survivor angered her fellow plaintiffs by forgiving Groening - known as the 'bookkeeper of death' - and said he should not be prosecuted. Eva Mozes Kor, 81, who publicly embraced Groening in court last week in an extraordinary act of forgiveness, called for the trial to end. By doing so, she faced criticism from her co-plaintiffs who suggested she should not have taken part in the trial in Germany. Groening is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder and faces a possible three to 15 years if convicted. Prosecutors argue his role sorting prisoners' stolen valuables, to which he admits, helped the death camp function. Mrs Kor made her comments during a television appearance on Sunday discussing the purpose of the trial. She argued that any Nazis still alive should instead come forward to speak publicly about what they did to help counter the threat of neo-Nazi Holocaust deniers in Germany. In response, her co-plaintiffs released a statement through their lawyers yesterday saying: 'Our clients would not comment here – who better than a survivor of Auschwitz knows that everyone needs to find their own way to overcome their suffering – if Mrs Kor did not repeatedly stage her 'forgiveness' publicly. Scroll down for video . Embrace: Seventy years after Auschwitz was liberated, Eva Kor embraced former Nazi guard Oskar Groening . Survivor: Eva Kor spoke of how Josef Mengele stood over her bed and laughed when she was injected with a 'deadly germ' Regret: Groening (pictured) described in chilling detail Wednesday how cattle cars full of Jews were brought to the Auschwitz death camp, the people stripped of their belongings and then  led directly into gas chambers . 'The subject of this criminal procedure is NOT that Mr Groening has done anything personally to Mrs Kor or any of the other co-plaintiffs. 'Whether it is Mrs Kor's place to forgive Mr Groening's participation in the murder of her relatives is up to everyone to decide for themselves. 'But if Mrs Kor says 'these prosecutions must stop' then she should not have become a co-plaintiff.' The statement added: 'We cannot forgive Mr Groening his participation in the murder of our relatives and another 299,000 people – especially since he feels free from any legal guilt. 'We want justice and we welcome the resolution that this trial brings.' In court in Luneburg last Wednesday Mrs Kor detailed how she and her twin sister Miriam were forced to endure horrifying medical experiments at Auschwitz by Josef Mengele, known as the 'Angel of Death'. She told the hearing how they evaded being gassed on arrival at the death camp thanks to Mengele's twisted obsession with twins. He experimented on twins in a sickening attempt to develop genetic techniques for Hitler's dream of creating a 'pure' Aryan race. Mengele used 1,500 sets of twins in his experiments, and only an estimated 180 to 250 individuals survived. Despite her ordeal, Mrs Kor found the compassion to forgive her Nazi tormentors - and even unofficially adopted the grandson of SS commander Rudolf Hoess, who oversaw the murder of more than 1 million people at Auschwitz. Liberation: Auschwitz survivors  during the first hours of the concentration camp's liberation in January 1945 . Chilling: A sign over the Auschwitz camp reads 'Arbeit Macht Frei' meaning 'Work makes you free' She spoke after giving evidence against the former Nazi SS guard Groening for his alleged complicity in the murder of 300,000 Hungarian Jewish prisoners at the death camp in the summer of 1944. As a qualified bookkeeper, it was his job to sort and store the Jews' money that the Nazis kept. After giving evidence, she approached and embraced Groening, but added: 'My forgiveness does not absolve the perpetrator from taking responsibility for his actions. Neither does it diminish my need to know what happened there.' She claims Groening was so overwhelmed by her unexpected gesture that he fainted. Asked why she had hugged him, she said it had not been planned and added: 'I wanted to thank him for having some human decency in accepting responsibility for what he has done. 'I was always interested in meeting him face to face because I believe that there is a human interaction that I cannot predict and no one else can predict.' She added: 'I don't forget what they have done to me. But I am not a poor person – I am a victorious woman who has been able to rise above the pain and forgive the Nazis.' Mrs Kor later tweeted: 'I met Oskar Groening, introduced myself reached to shake his hand-he grabbed my arm & fainted-I screamed 4 help. It was a strange reaction!!' Both Mrs Kor's parents and two older sisters were killed at the camp. In 1984 she founded the organization CANDLES (an acronym for 'Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiments Survivors'), through which she located 122 other living Mengele twins, as the experiment survivors came to be known.","Oskar Groening accused of complicity in the murder of 300,000 Jews .

"A woman told she was infertile after undergoing gruelling cancer treatment has spoken of her joy at giving birth to a baby boy. Doctors told Cara Newton, 32, from Fleet, Hampshire, she had a zero per cent chance of conceiving naturally after being diagnosed with bone cancer in 2009. While Mrs Newton and her husband, Chris, 34, were relieved that chemotherapy had worked, they were devastated to be told they would never have a family of their own. Some chemotherapy drugs permanently stop the ovaries from producing eggs. This means a woman can no longer get pregnant and may have symptoms of the menopause, as Mrs Newton did. Cara Newton, 32 (with husband Chris), was told she had a zero per cent chance of conceiving naturally after being diagnosed with bone cancer in 2009. To her utter surprise, she conceived baby Sebastian naturally . Mrs Newton was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma - a rare type of bone cancer - in April 2009. She had to undergo several rounds of chemotherapy which doctors said would destroy her fertility . After IVF failed, the couple feared they would never become parents. But 10 months later they were astounded to discover Mrs Newton had become pregnant naturally with baby Sebastian, who was born last April . The couple tried IVF using a donor egg but when that failed, they feared the worst. Then 10 months later, to their utter surprise, Mrs Newton became pregnant naturally with baby Sebastian, who was born last April. She said: 'I was heartbroken when doctors told me I had zero chance of ever becoming a mum. 'Chemotherapy had taken my hair, made me sick and plummeted by body into early menopause. 'I had always wanted children but my hopes of having my own family had been destroyed overnight.' She added: 'Chris and I decided to try IVF using a donor egg. Even though the baby wouldn't biologically be mine, at least I would experience pregnancy and we would become parents.' 'When it failed I was gutted, but just months later I fell pregnant naturally, it was a dream come true. We had to keep pinching ourselves to check it was real.' Mrs Newton was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma - a rare type of bone cancer - in April 2009. She had become concerned after suffering from pain in her leg - something she first thought was a pulled a muscle. But an MRI confirmed her worst fears - she had bone cancer and could lose her leg. She said: 'I was terrified when I heard the word ""cancer"" and the amount of treatment I would need.' During surgery, Mrs Newton had 13cm of bone removed from her femur, which was replaced with a metal internal prosthesis. Mrs Newton had 13cm of bone removed from her femur, which was replaced with a metal internal prosthesis . She also underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy, all the time worrying she would lose her leg. She said: 'I ended up in intensive care a couple of times as the chemotherapy made me so ill that my body couldn't cope with the treatment. Chemotherapy can stop a woman's ovaries from working either temporarily or possibly permanently. The extend of the damage on fertility depends on the drugs and doses a patient receives. Some chemotherapy drugs are also more likely than others to cause infertility. Permanent infertility is more likely if a patient have higher doses of the drugs. It is also more likely in older women, especially those nearing the age where they would naturally have a menopause. Some chemotherapy drugs permanently stop the ovaries from producing eggs. If this happens, a woman can no longer get pregnant and may have symptoms of the menopause. While it is not as easy for women to preserve their fertility as it is for men, but there are ways of doing it, such as freezing embryos, freezing eggs or freezing ovarian tissue. These techniques are done before the chemotherapy starts and involve having some eggs collected. Source: Cancer Research UK . 'I was in a situation where I had to continue with chemotherapy or the cancer would kill me - but at times it was a risk that the chemo could kill me. It was terrifying.' It was the support of her now husband that got her through the ordeal, she says. 'Chris was my rock throughout it all and he proposed to me when I finished treatment in 2010 but I wanted to wait until my hair grew back before we got married,' she said. After marrying the following year, the couple were overjoyed to be told Mrs Newton was in remission - and they turned their thoughts to starting a family. But the gruelling treatment Mrs Newton had undergone severely hindered their chance of conceiving. 'The treatment stopped us from trying IVF through using a donor egg straight away,' she said. 'And when it failed in October 2012 and I fought off two serious infections that could have cost me my leg, I felt as though I would never become a mum.' With Mrs Newton on strong medication until July 2013, they were unable to try for a baby. 'So when I fell pregnant naturally in August we both felt like it was a complete miracle,' she said. 'Being a mum to Seb is the best thing in the world, Chris and I finally have the perfect family we have always wanted.' She added: 'If someone could have told me five years ago that I would keep my leg, by cancer free and become a mum I would never have believed them.' She said: 'When I fell pregnant naturally, it was a dream come true. We had to keep pinching ourselves to check it was real' With Sebastian now a year old, she said: 'Being a mum to Seb is the best thing in the world, Chris and I finally have the perfect family we have always wanted' She has now shared her story will give other women hope. 'I hope my story shows other women who have battled cancer that despite going through the menopause after chemotherapy, that miracles do happen and that one day they could have a baby too.' Mrs Newton has also been supported throughout her illness by the Bone Cancer Research Trust. Julie Harrington, Bone Cancer Research Trust chief executive, said: 'Finding out you have primary bone cancer is devastating enough but to be told you may never have children as a result is a real shock. 'Cara has shown incredible bravery and strength throughout her journey and is now blessed to have a beautiful baby boy.' 'Every year in the UK and Ireland 600 families will be affected by this brutal disease which leaves long-lasting physical and emotional scars, even after treatment. 'Cara's story gives a ray of hope to others through their darkest times and we wish her and her husband all the very best for their new life as parents.'","Cara Newton, 32, was told she was infertile after undergoing chemotherapy .

"Thousands of children who fail maths and English tests in primary school will be forced by the Tories to re-sit them to ensure they can read, write and add up. David Cameron will today announce that all children who do not pass their tests aged 11 will have to take them again in the first year of secondary school, when they are 12. Around 100,000 pupils a year do not pass the English and maths tests before they leave primary school. The Prime Minister said these children will be given extra help and support to ensure they do not fall behind in secondary school. Thousands of children who fail maths and English tests in primary school will be forced by the Tories to re-sit them to ensure they can read, write and add up (file picture) ‘The Conservatives are the union for parents,’ he said. ‘We represent every hardworking mother and father who wants to see their child succeed in a great school. ‘These past five years have been about getting changes in place which stretch our children – and the results have been extraordinary. The next five will be about finishing the job. More discipline, more rigour, zero-tolerance of failure and mediocrity. ‘There’s hardly anything more important to our long-term economic plan for Britain. ‘There is no job that doesn’t require English and maths and this is about making sure every child gets the best start in life and that our country can compete in the world.’ From 2016, if the Tories win the election, any pupil who does not achieve a good pass in English and maths tests taken at age 11, will be required to take a resit test in the first year of secondary school. These resit tests will be designed to make sure that pupils who leave primary school without being able to read, write and add up properly have caught up by age 12. Statistics from the Department for Education show that around 100,000 young people - one in five - fail to reach the expected standard in English and Maths at the age of 11. Of these children, only 7 per cent go on to get five good GCSEs including English and maths – compared to 72 per cent of their classmates who do make the grade. David Cameron will today announce that all children who do not pass their tests aged 11 will have to take them again in the first year of secondary school, when they are 12 . Secondary schools currently receive a £500 ‘catch-up premium’ for any child who arrives without having met the expected standard by the time they leave primary school. The Conservatives hope the new resit tests will ensure that secondary schools are using the money effectively and getting young people to where they need to be to succeed throughout rest of their school career. Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary, said: ‘We know that the biggest predictor of success at GCSE is whether young people have mastered the basics at age 11. ‘That means if we fail to get it right for young people at the start of secondary school they’ll struggle for the rest of their time in education. ‘Under Labour one in three children left primary school unable to read, write and add up properly, thanks to our reforms and teachers’ hard work we’ve seen that fall just to one in five. ‘But even one child falling behind, or being written off, is a child too many. That’s why the next Conservative Government will require schools to enter any child who doesn’t have the literacy and numeracy skills they need to succeed in secondary school, for new year seven resit tests that will guarantee they’ve caught up. Around 100,000 pupils a year do not pass the English and maths tests before they leave primary school (file picture) The resit tests will be slimmed down literacy and numeracy checks containing content from the assessments taken in the last year of primary school, as well as some content from the curriculum of the first year in secondary school. Schools will be able to enter students twice for the new tests in either spring or summer term of the first secondary school year. The tests will be marked by teachers and publicly reported as part of school performance tables. Last night Tristram Hunt, Labour’s education spokesman, said: ‘This is desperate attempt by the Tories to try to overshadow their failures on school standards. ‘On their watch, 1.6million pupils are being educated in schools that are rated lower than “good” by Ofsted. And as a result of David Cameron’s unqualified teachers policy, more than 400,000 pupils are being taught by unqualified teachers. ‘Labour has a better plan for education. We will ensure that every teacher is qualified or working towards qualified teacher status and introduce a new Master Teacher status to raise the standing of the profession. That is how we improve education for every child, in every classroom.’","David Cameron to announce that children will have to retake the three Rs .

"A Canadian teacher was jailed for ten years today after being found guilty of sexually abusing children at an elite international school in Indonesia. Neil Bantleman, who also holds British nationality, was afforded one final kiss from his wife before being led away by police after the verdict was handed down. The sentence sparked outrage from his supporters, including the school itself and the international community, who insist he is innocent and expressed concern over the rule of law in Indonesia. Scroll down for video . Last embrace: Canadian teacher Neil Bantleman kisses his wife Tracy before being sentenced to ten years in prison for sexually abusing three young children at a prestigious international school in Indonesia today . In a packed courtroom, the administrator was convicted of abusing three young boys at the Jakarta Intercultural School, which has for decades been favoured by expatriates and wealthy Indonesians. Also standing trial for abusing the children is Ferdinand Tjiong, an Indonesian teaching assistant at the school. A verdict on his case was to be handed down later today. Both men, who have strongly denied committing abuse, received backing from the school, parents, and the international community. Their supporters have said the case is deeply flawed and motivated by a bid by one alleged victim's family to get compensation from the school. Before the trial: The couple were pictured hugging before Mr Bantleman was handed the devastating verdict in Jakarta today . Behind bars: Tracy Bantleman looked on in misery as her husband of two years languished behind bars while awaiting his trial . Following the verdict, Canada and Britain called for the authorities to follow due legal process, while America said it was 'deeply disappointed' and warned it could damage Indonesia's reputation. After nine hours reading the verdict at South Jakarta District Court, presiding judge Nur Aslam said that Bantleman was guilty of abusing the children. 'The defendant did not admit his crime or express regret for his deeds, nor did he apologise for what he did, which psychologically damaged underage children,' she said. He was sentenced to ten years in jail and ordered to pay a fine of 100 million rupiah (£5,200). Prosecutors had sought a 12-year term. To applause and cheers from his supporters, who included many parents at the school, Bantleman said that he would appeal the verdict: 'We will continue to fight until the truth comes out.' Her voice breaking with emotion, his wife Tracy Bantleman said that she was 'deeply disturbed and appalled by the decision of the panel of judges. Devastating news: Mr Bantleman looked up in dismay as his guilty verdict was read out by the judge . Shock: A stunned Tracy Bantleman, pictured moments after her husband's guilty verdict was read out . Led away: The teacher, who also holds British nationality, was found guilty of abusing boys at the Jakarta Intercultural School Intercultural School, sparking anger among supporters who insist he is innocent . 'They have absolutely, utterly ignored evidence in support of my husband'. The scandal, which erupted in April last year with accusations of abuse levelled at cleaning staff, has sparked deep unease among Jakarta's expatriate community and foreign governments alike. U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, Robert Blake, said there were serious questions about 'the investigative process and lack of credible evidence against the teachers'. 'We are deeply disappointed with this outcome... the broad international community is following this case closely. 'The outcome of the legal process and what it reveals about the rule of law in Indonesia will have a significant impact on Indonesia's reputation abroad.' The British Embassy in Jakarta said in a statement there were 'concerns about irregularities in this case'. Hefty sentence: The ten-year jail term has sparked outrage from Mr Bantleman's supporters, including the school itself and the international community . Emotional goodbye: Tracy Bantleman hugs her husband as he is led away from court after being sentenced . International disapproval: The British Embassy in Jakarta said in a statement there were 'concerns about irregularities in this case' Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Rob Nicholson said that Canada had 'called for a fair and transparent trial throughout the judicial process'. Accusations of assault at the school - formerly known as the Jakarta International School - initially sparked horror among the expatriate community. But the focus soon shifted to what supporters say was an unfair attempt to target Bantleman and Tjiong by Indonesia's notoriously corrupt police and judicial system. Supporters have accused police of a botched investigation, and point to unfair trials, which the judge closed to the public as they involved children. The court was open to the public for the reading of the verdicts. The prosecution insists that the testimony of the alleged victims, all boys, is the truth and that their claims are backed up by evidence from medical examinations. However, the defence argues the medical exams were flawed. The men have said the decision to prosecute them revolved around a separate lawsuit filed by the family of one of the alleged victims, which demands $125million in compensation from the school.

"The militant Unite union was facing embarrassment last night over claims it ‘sacked’ an activist for complaining about being hired on a zero-hours contract. Former lecturer Martyn Reuby won the first round in his legal battle against Unite, after a tribunal ruled that he had been employed to teach its courses. The employment tribunal ruling is a major embarrassment to the union, which has led the campaign against the use of zero-hours contracts, which it says amount to ‘exploitation’. Ed Miliband was left embarrassed today after Labour's biggest backer was accused of employing workers on zero-hours contracts . It is also a blow to Ed Miliband, who has received more than £13million from Unite since becoming leader in 2010. Mr Reuby, a Unite member for 42 years, claims he was sacked by the union after complaining that he and more than 100 colleagues were employed on a zero-hours basis, with no entitlement to sick pay or paid leave. The 59-year-old yesterday welcomed the ruling, saying: ‘I never thought I would be taking my union to court. It is hypocrisy (on their part) because effectively what they were using was zero-hours contracts through the back door.’ Mr Reuby’s lawyer Jahad Rahman said Unite had repeatedly tried to avoid its responsibilities. He added: ‘There’s a moral as well as legal issue here because workers should not be denied basic employment rights. ‘Unite has openly campaigned about the use of zero-hours contracts, which provide far fewer benefits such as holiday pay and pension, yet there is evidence in this case that tutors employed by Unite and other colleges worked under zero-hours contracts. My client was dismissed without any notice. He received a P45 in the post. No fair process was followed.’ Mr Reuby was employed to deliver Unite courses at a string of colleges in London and the South East. The union provided the training, syllabus and course materials. Mr Rahman said his client would now pursue a case for wrongful dismissal against the union. Unite, which is appealing the judgment, claimed it did not employ Mr Reuby, who had a series of short-term contracts from colleges, which did not guarantee any minimum hours. But the tribunal ruled that he was effectively employed by Unite. A spokesman for the union said: ‘Unite does not use zero-hours contracts and it is misleading to say so. The tribunal did not find that Mr Reuby was employed on a zero-hour contract, but rather he was employed on a series of short- term contracts.’ Labour was facing further embarrassment over the issue last night after Parliament’s expenses watchdog confirmed some of the party’s MPs were employing staff on a zero-hours basis. Some 68 Labour MPs have used zero-hours contracts in the past two years, including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham and Mr Miliband’s parliamentary aide Karen Buck. Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured today in Bury, has vowed to crackdown on zero-hours contracts . Mr Miliband posed for a 'selfie' with youngsters after a Q&A session at Bury Town Hall before tonight's debate . Ed Miliband's promised crackdown on zero-hours contracts backfired after it emerged: . Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt dismissed the figures, saying: ‘These were not zero-hours contracts – they were casual contracts, such as students and interns.’ But the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority said the contracts were offered by MPs on a zero-hours basis, adding: ‘The MP is the employer – it is a matter for them whether they choose to use zero hours.’ Meanwhile, the Conservatives were also facing difficulties last night after a prominent businessman withdrew his name from a letter of support. Pascal Soriot, chief executive of pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, was one of more than 100 senior executives who endorsed a warning that a ‘change in course’ would risk jobs and deter investment. Tory sources last night said Mr Soriot had agreed in writing to have his name added to the letter. But yesterday he issued a statement saying that neither he nor his company endorsed any political party. He added: ‘My name should not be used in the context of the letter.’ Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna said: ‘Like most business leaders, Mr Soriot will want to contribute to policy debate but won’t want to get involved in party politics.’","Unite accused of employing workers on contracts 'effectively zero hours'

"There has been a lot of hype surrounding the April lunar eclipse as the moon is set to turn blood red this Easter weekend. But in the lead up to the rare event tomorrow, the Sydney Observatory has been expressing their concerns over the bad weather forecast for the big night. So much so, they're plans to regularly update keen spectators with phase process images have been thwarted due to cloudy conditions. And according to the Bureau of Meteorology, it won't be getting any better. A blood red moon lights up the sky during a total lunar eclipse at on October 8, 2014 in Australia. The next two eclipses are forecast to happen are on April 4 and September 28, 2015 . But in the lead up to the rare event on Easter Saturday, the Sydney Observatory has been expressing their concerns over the bad weather forecast for the big night . The lunar eclipse this month will appear in Sydney's north-eastern sky however Sydney Observatory astronomer Andrew Smith told the ABC this could be one of the shortest eclipses. 'Some sources indicate it will be around 10 minutes of totality, which will make it the shortest since 1917, but other sources say it will be less than five minutes which makes it the shortest since 1592,' he said. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. Saturday’s total lunar eclipse will turn the moon a burnt reddish orange. In this image the last blood moon is situated high above Sydney . This month's event is now booked out at the Sydney Observatory however more tickets may be released on Saturday morning if weather conditions improve. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. However the forecast for Easter Saturday isn't looking very promising across Australia, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Simon Allen, BOM's senior meteorologist, told the ABC that Adelaide will be have the clearest skies out of all the states - where the partial eclipse is set to begin at 8.45pm. Perth and Darwin may be lucky depending on the location of cloud bands. The partial eclipse is set to start at 6.15pm and 7.45pm respectively. Cairns, Hobart and Melbourne will most likely see patchy cloud conditions while Mr Allen says 'Sydney and Brisbane are the least likely to see it [the eclipse]'. The partial eclipse is set to start at about 8.15pm in Cairns. Sydney, Canberra, Hobart and Melbourne can expect theirs at 9.15pm.","The April lunar eclipse is set to turn the moon into blood red this Easter weekend .

"A parolee who crashed into and killed a newlywed mother while fleeing police in a high speed pursuit apologized to her husband as he was sentenced to at least 20 years' in jail. John McCallum, 27, was this week sentenced for a charge of second-degree murder after he broadsided Francesca Weatherhead, 25, while fleeing police following a botched burglary. The crash at an intersection in Redford, Detroit, flipped Mrs Weatherhead's vehicle and killed her on October 6 last year. Francesca Weatherhead (pictured) was killed when parolee John McCallum collided with her vehicle while fleeing police . McCallum (left) was sentenced to 20 - 45 years' in jail for the killing of Francesca Weatherhead, who had only months before married her college sweetheart Matthew (pictured together right) Her death caused outrage when it was revealed McCallum had been paroled not five months prior - despite being sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison on his latest break-in and drug possession arrest. He had first been eligible for parole in September 2013 but was held longer because authorities thought he needed to complete a violence prevention program. Yet he was released just months later, after the Michigan Department of Corrections decided he successfully passed the program. During sentencing on Tuesday, McCallum told Mrs Weatherhead's husband he thought of what happened every day from inside his jail cell. He said: 'If I could have avoided the death of her, I would have. I would like to say I'm sorry,' the Detroit Free Press reported. Despite his contrition, Judge Cynthia Gray Hathaway sentenced him to 20-45 years in prison after he struck a plea deal with prosecutors in which charges of home invasion and reckless driving causing death were dropped. Mrs Weatherhead was driving to her job as a sales manager when McCallum ran a red light in his Ford Escape and struck her car. Francesca and Matthew Weatherhead pose for an engagement photo. The couple married in June but she was killed only months later . The two met at Michigan State University, where Matthew Weatherhead was going to medical school . She had married Matthew Weatherhead in June, and was putting her husband through medical school at MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine. Mrs Weatherhead graduated from Trenton High School, where she played softball and was named homecoming queen. She went on to attend Michigan State University and graduated in 2010 with a degree in business administration and marketing. Her family previously expressed their dismay at losing such a beloved family member, The News Herald reported. Her younger sister Nina Vitale said: 'Words cannot express what an overwhelming feeling it is to lose someone so close to you. 'She was more than a daughter, sister, wife or friend. She was our strength and we are lost without her.' Mr Weatherhead told the court his partner was a wonderful wife and would have been a great mother .","John McCallum has apologized for the death of Francesca Weatherhead .

"The three daughters of a New York SUV driver involved in a train wreck that claimed six lives claim that their mother 'is not a murderer'. The defense from the daughters comes nearly two months after their mother Ellen Brody was killed along with five passengers when a train crashed into her SUV on the tracks at a railroad crossing in the Westchester County town of Valhalla. Though the cause of the collision remains unknown, Danielle, Julia and Alexa Brody say that their mother has been criticized and that people have jumped to conclusions about what happened. Scroll down for video . Ellen Brody's (second from right) three daughters, Alexa (left), Danielle (second from left) and Julia (right) Brody, have spoken out to say that their mother is not a murderer and that it was an accident that she drove on to the tracks . Ellen Brody was killed along with five passengers when a train crashed into her SUV on the tracks at a railroad crossing in early February. Her car had gotten stuck between the railroad crossings and instead of reversing she drove on to the tracks . Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . 'I went on Google, and I searched my mom's name and I was just reading the comments,' Julia told NBC's Matt Lauer. 'And just the fact that people are like, 'You know, I don't even feel bad for her. How could she possibly do that?'' Julia went on to admit that she first thought that a driver had intentionally driven on to the tracks, before she knew her mother was driving. 'So I was like, ""Why? Why? Why would this woman do that?'"" When we were watching that, though, when he described the woman, I was like, ""That could've been Mommy."" And my sisters were just like, ""Julia, no,""' she said. According to investigators' preliminary findings,  Brody's car was in the danger zone inside railroad crossing gates for about half a minute before the train hit. Brody got ahead of the crossing gate in inching traffic, then got out of her car to examine it after the gate came down and hit the back of it, a witness has said. Nearly two months after the crash Alexa (left), Julia (center) and Danielle (right) Brody told Matt Lauer that people are still jumping to conclusions about what happened . The cause of the collision remains unknown and Brody's daughters remain adamant that their mother never meant to hurt anyone . But then she got back in, seeming unhurried, and advanced onto the track, the witness told news outlets and investigators. The train's engineer also told investigators that he saw the Mercedes SUV moving onto the tracks. But her daughters are adamant that their mother wouldn't have meant to hurt anyone. 'I know who my mom was,' Alexa told NBC. 'I know that she would never, never intentionally hurt people.' 'A lot of times people just want to find a reason,' Danielle added. 'It's just not true. It was an accident.' And Julia put it simply: 'She's not a murderer,' she said. Julia (second from left), Danielle (center) and Alexa (right), pictured with their mother Ellen (left) and father Alan Brody (second from right),  say when they Google their mother's name, they see that commenters have been criticizing their mother . Alexa said that her mother was her best friend and that she would think of her every time she smiled. Trains hit cars on the tracks many times a year, but such crashes rarely kill train riders. Investigators emphasized in February that they want to figure out why this one did, becoming the deadliest accident in the 32-year history of one of the nation's busiest commuter railroads. Investigators looked for any elements that may have intensified the fire, which they believe was ignited by the SUV's gas tank. The NTSB has examined such factors as the adequacy of emergency exits, the train cars and the unusual design of the Metro-North line's third rail. There is no barrier at the crossing between the street and the tracks where the crash occurred. MTA is considering all possible safety enhancements that would prevent deadly accidents in the future, the company's chairman said.","Ellen Brody, a mother-of-three was killed along with five rail passengers in February in the horrific crash in Valhalla, New York .

"Blown up in Iraq, Hannah Campbell defied the odds to have a miracle baby after shrapnel damaged her womb. But behind the joy of celebrating daughter Lexi-River’s first birthday, the former Army corporal has battled new agony after twice nearly dying from a mystery illness since the birth. Miss Campbell, 30, was struck down with a condition that caused her stomach to rupture, leaving her fighting for her life in intensive care, and feared she would not be there to help Lexi-River blow out the candles on her cake. Scroll down for video . Hannah Campbell, pictured with her daughters Milly (left) and Lexi-River (right), defied the odds to have a miracle baby after shrapnel damaged her womb from a blast in Basra . And as she struggled to recover, her relationship broke down with long-term partner and Lexi-River’s father Anthony McMorrow, who proposed to her on Valentine’s Day last year. Miss Campbell said: ‘I was just so desperately ill that the relationship was put under extreme pressure.’ But the split was amicable, with Miss Campbell and Mr McMorrow, 32, a marketing consultant, making Lexi-River their priority. Miss Campbell suffered horrific injuries when a mortar bomb hit the building in Basra she was guarding while serving with 19 Tank Transporter Squadron in 2007 as a young mum with a then three-year-old daughter, Milly, from a previous relationship. She has since split from long-term partner Anthony McMorrow (left). She was serving with 19 Tank Transporter Squadron (right) in 2007 when the blast happened . The couple, pictured with Hannah's daughter Milly and Anthony's son Leo, have decided to split after Hannah began suffering from a mystery condition . She was blinded in one eye, her left hand was split in two and her left leg was shattered. Shrapnel damaged her abdomen, leading doctors to tell her she’d never be able to have another child. Two years after the blast she elected to have her leg amputated, as unbearable pain had left her housebound. During her recovery she gained weight from being wheelchair-bound, going from 9½ st to 21st, while post-traumatic stress disorder caused her to lose her hair. With the help of doctors Miss Campbell, from Northampton, rebuilt herself with a £52,500 makeover including a prosthetic leg, make-up which is tattooed on, Botox, gastric band weight loss treatment, a tummy tuck and hair extensions. She even treated herself to breast enlargements. She underwent a £52,500 makeover after she gained weight from being wheelchair-bound after her leg was amputated following the blast . Although doctors told her she would never conceive again, she gave birth to Lexi-River on March 31 last year. But when Lexi-River was ten days old, Miss Campbell suffered excruciating stomach pain and was rushed to hospital. Miss Campbell was previously married to husband Jamie, father to their daughter Milly . She said: ‘It was like history was repeating itself as I lost so much of Milly’s childhood having operations and recovering after the blast.’ Doctors found she had a perforated ulcer and operated to stem the bleeding. Six months later she developed a larger ulcer, which perforated. She said: ‘I ended up with 40 staples holding my stomach together. I was in hospital all over Christmas and finally got out in early January this year.’ Last weekend she was readmitted with stomach pains, but she was determined not to miss Lexi-River’s birthday on Tuesday and checked herself out 24 hours before, getting home in time to make cupcakes with Milly for the party. Miss Campbell said: ‘Because of everything I’ve been through celebrating Lexi-River’s first birthday is a milestone not only for her, but also for me. In my darkest times I feared I wasn’t going to make it, but I just couldn’t give up because of my two daughters.’ She will spend the next month having tests as doctors explore the possibility she may have a rare condition which is causing her stomach to ulcerate.","Hannah Campbell, 30, had miracle baby after shrapnel damaged her womb .

"Nicola Sturgeon was hailed the shock winner of last night’s TV debate according to one snap poll, inflicting a damaging blow to Ed Miliband’s election hopes. In a nightmare for Labour, which is battling to fend off an SNP landslide in its traditional Scottish heartlands, Miss Sturgeon was deemed well ahead – with Mr Miliband trailing David Cameron and Nigel Farage. Overall, an average of four polls of viewers put Mr Cameron just ahead – and to the Tories’ delight, he also emerged with a clear lead on who is seen ‘most capable of leading the country’. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon was hailed as the shock winner of the TV debate by one poll, inflicting a damaging blow to Ed Miliband's election hopes . ComRes put him on 40 per cent as the best prime minister, with Mr Miliband on 28 per cent and Mr Farage just 10 per cent. Last night a national voting intention poll by YouGov put the Conservatives ahead of their vote share at the last election, and at their highest point since 2013, with 37 per cent to Labour’s 35 per cent. But it was Miss Sturgeon’s success among viewers across the UK that was the biggest surprise of the night. Peeping out: The Tory poster depicting Ed Miliband in Nicola Sturgeon's pocket . The Tories rushed out a poster depicting Ed Miliband in Nicola Sturgeon’s pocket last night – saying the SNP leader had ‘dominated’ him in the debate. A hapless-looking Labour leader was seen peering out of the top pocket of a contented Miss Sturgeon, who triumphed in one of the main post-debate polls. If Labour fails to win a majority in the election, it is expected that Mr Miliband may have to come to a deal with the Scottish Nationalists if he is to get into Number 10. A tweet from Conservative campaign headquarters said: ‘Nicola Sturgeon dominated Miliband – an interesting glimpse into what life would be like under a Miliband/SNP deal’. The poster follows a similar one released last month showing Mr Miliband in the pocket of former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who has declared that he will help write the Labour budget. It revives memories of the 1980s Spitting Image depiction of the then Liberal leader David Steel in the pocket of David Owen, leader of the SDP. The two parties were in alliance at the time. Scotland’s steely First Minister left the Labour leader squirming as she attacked him from the Left on tax and spending. In the key moments in last night’s two hour, seven-way clash: . Miss Sturgeon, a veteran of TV debates in the Scottish referendum campaign, repeatedly left the Labour leader discomforted – and forced him to suggest that Labour is not now committed to plans to find another £30billion through tax rises and spending cuts, which he voted for earlier this year. But Miss Sturgeon also gave Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg a rough ride, saying it was time to ‘break the old boys’ network at Westminster’. In an early intervention, she mocked the Coalition leaders for arguing about their future spending plans, saying: ‘It is really interesting watching David Cameron and Nick Clegg attack each other, when they have been working hand in glove for the past five years.’ But Miss Sturgeon saved her main fire for Mr Miliband, scolding him for paying lip service to the need for further cuts. ‘Ed talks the language on austerity, but it’s only a few weeks since he trooped through the lobbies to vote for £30billion of cuts,’ she said. Challenging the Labour leader directly, she said: ‘We need to invest and grow our way out of austerity – why did you vote for £30billion of cuts?’ As Mr Cameron looked on smiling, Mr Miliband responded weakly: ‘That wasn’t what the vote was for.’ Mr Clegg ambushed the Prime Minister at the first opportunity after five years of Coalition, saying: ‘I believe you need to make the necessary cuts because you have to. 'George Osborne and David Cameron do it because they want to.’ Mr Cameron retorted: ‘I defend all our decisions – you have a pick-and-mix approach.’ Miss Sturgeon forced Milband to suggest that Labour is not now committed to plans to find another £30billion through tax rises and spending cuts, which he voted for earlier this year . The seven leaders in the TV debate: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative) Cameron heckler is thrown out . A female heckler was removed from the debate audience after she interrupted the Prime Minister. Victoria Prosser, 33, said that she wanted to challenge the ‘1 per cent at the top’. As David Cameron tried to answer a question, the self-described ‘wellbeing guru’, who was dressed in a sheepskin-style gilet, stood up and heckled. She called out: ‘There’s homeless people on the streets that have been in the services.’ Debate moderator Julie Etchingham tried to stop the woman, telling her: ‘Not from the audience thank you.’ 'I'm sorry': As David Cameron tried to answer a question Victoria Prosser, 33, stood up and heckled him about homeless people who had served in the armed forces . But she continued: ‘I have to speak out because I’m worried. At the end of the day there’s more of us than them and they’re not listening to us.’ Mr Cameron replied: ‘The lady makes an important point that there are people who come out of our armed services who have difficulties and that’s why we should be putting money into armed forces charities that help homeless people.’ During his response, she could be heard shouting: ‘It’s not the truth.’ She was then forcibly removed from the TV studio. On her Twitter account she describes herself as ‘mum, coach, artist, wellbeing guru!’ She has previously re-tweeted negative posts about Ukip and Mr Cameron. According to her internet profiles, she volunteers at a homeless project in Manchester as well as working at a vegetarian cafe in Salford. Outside the studio, Miss Prosser said she had been ‘emotionally moved by David Cameron using vulnerable people’. She added: ‘I can’t vote for anyone who I know is lying or omitting facts. That means I couldn’t vote for any of the people that I saw tonight.’ Ed Miliband sent an aide to Manchester to pick up two pairs of shoes for last night’s debate. The Labour leader’s assistant was despatched to Clark’s on Market Street in Manchester to pick up two pairs of classic black shoes. She bought the Francis Air and Glenrise Walk brands, each priced at £65. The revelation that Mr Miliband bought two pairs of shoes for one debate will add to claims he is indecisive, and comes just weeks after it emerged his house has two kitchens. Clark’s assistant Laura Roberts, 22, said: ‘I helped his aide pick the two choices. They are two of our best-sellers. I’ll be watching to see which one he chooses.’","Nicola Surgeon hailed shock winner of TV debate, according to one poll .

"Millions of Americans avoid inviting people round because they are embarrassed about the state of their homes. According to new research, 61 per cent of US adults have admitted that they don't extend invitations to friends and family because of their 'home shame'. General mess, dated carpets and kitchens, unfinished DIY projects and the small size of their property rank highest on the list of embarrassments - which awful color schemes, shabby furniture and poor location also proved to be particularly shameful for homeowners. Shame: More than 60 per cent of Americans have admitted to being ashamed of their own homes . In a study of 1,000 people for Sugru, makers of moldable glue, 48 per cent said their embarrassment about their home is usually confined to just a few rooms or areas, however 33 per cent acknowledge they are ashamed of their whole house. 1.Mess . 2. Dated carpets . 3. Dated kitchen . 4. Dirty/stained carpets . 5. DIY jobs that haven't been started . 6. Bad smells . 7. Size . 8. Cracked walls/ceilings . 9. Badly decorated . 10. Faded or peeling paint . 11. Old/broken furniture . 12. Patchy lawn . 13. Too much clutter or trash . 14. Incomplete DIY jobs . 15. Bad/anti-social neighbors . 16. Dated/shabby wall paper . 17. Overgrown yard . 18. Mold or mildew patches . 19. Bad location . 20. Bold/garish color schemes . More than half haven't let visitors in to certain rooms, and 36 per cent steer people away from coming to visit altogether. Interestingly, more than half of the participants (54 per cent) admitted that it is their friends whom they try to avoid inviting over, while 38 per cent were more concerned about having strangers visit their humble abodes; 33 per cent on the other hand are most concerned about work colleagues taking a peek at their home. Top on the list of cringe-worthy rooms is the living room, followed by the kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms. What's worse, 62 per cent worry they will never get their home to the point where they are no longer ashamed by it. Sugru spokeswoman Jane ni Dhulchaointigh said of the survey: 'When you first move into a house, most people have ideas about how they want to make it their ideal home. 'But a lack of time, money and even basic DIY skills can mean many struggle to see all, or even any of these plans through. 'Sometimes all it takes are a few minor changes here and there. Start small with a DIY project that you're going to actually enjoy, with simple tools that you're confident using and focus on one room at a time. 'The pride that you'll get from one successful project will help spur you straight on to the next.' According to the survey, a whopping 30 per cent of people have actually pretended to be out when someone they knew knocked on their door, and 14 per cent admit that they have had someone drop them off elsewhere rather than allowing them to see their home. A further 39 per cent, at one point or another, have avoided hosting an event at their home. Nearly a quarter of people surveyed (21 per cent) also admit to ending a date early rather than inviting their date back to their home. Envy: Many Americans confessed that they would love the chance to take a look inside the Obama family's private living area . LIfestyle guru: Martha Stewart's home topped the list of celebrities houses people would most like to see inside . The study found that 63 per cent have plans to improve their home, with 18 per cent saying the motivation for getting it done is based on pure embarrassment. Other motivators for wanting to work on their home include time off from work, upcoming visits from family and friends and looking at homes on TV. 1. Martha Stewart . 2. The Obamas' living quarters in the White House . 3. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie . 4. Jennifer Aniston . 5. Oprah Winfrey . 6. George Clooney/Lake Como . 7. Taylor Swift . 8. Ellen Degeneres and Portia De Rossi . 9. The Playboy Mansion . 10. Madonna . And when it comes to celebrity home envy, it was lifestyle guru Martha Stewart's home that topped the list of houses the participants would most like to see, while the Obamas' living area in the White House and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's home placed second and third respectively. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 46 per cent of respondents admitted that they are struggling to make the changes they would like to their home because it costs too much money, while 23 per cent say they're not making improvements because they are planning to move soon. 16 per cent admit they don't know how to fix or repair what needs to be fixed to make their homes look presentable. An overwhelming 88 per cent would feel less embarrassed about the state of their home if they could redecorate all or part of their home, or at least get those pesky DIY jobs done. Ms ni Dhulchaointigh adds, 'We are all busy, which often leaves less time to pay attention to those small home improvement jobs. 'That's why we've created something that makes quick fixes, repairs and improvements easy. It's all about making people's lives simpler and getting that home pride back.","Many people also confessed that they would love to take a tour of lifestyle Martha Stewart's home, as well as the Obamas' private living area ."
"First it was revealed that lashings of baby oil were used to keep Aidan Turner's rippling torso looking suitably divine in the hit BBC Sunday night series Poldark. Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer, @AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said: 'I just can't forgive that chest hair. I just can't! But it's Aiden turner I could try. #Poldark'. And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.'","Photos taken for BBC show Being Human see Aidan Turner with a full 'rug'

"Technology that claims to transform any smartphone into a Star Trek-style tricorder is set to be unveiled in Israel. The company behind the device says it has the potential to break down the chemical components of almost any object from a distance. The technology could help a range of industries such as food and drink, healthcare and the defence sector, the researchers claim. Scroll down for video . Technology that claims to transform any smartphone into a Star Trek-style tricorder is set to be unveiled in Israel. The company behind the device says it has the potential to break down the chemical components of almost any object from a distance. The image shows how the picture might be used . Unispectral Technologies and Tel Aviv University, who are behind the system, say it works by analysing a materials 'hyperspectral signature', which is its unique chemical fingerprint. The team have already patented the optical part of the system, which is based on existing microelectromechanical or 'MEMS' technology. 'The optical element acts as a tunable filter and the software - an image fusion library - would support this new component and extract all the relevant information from the image,' said Professor David Mendlovic at Tel Aviv University. Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe. It was used largely by Mr Spock, the alien first officer of the Starship Enterprise . Once the camera take an image, the data would be further analysed by a third-party to extract the hyperspectral signature at any location in the image. Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. For each pixel in an image, a hyperspectral camera acquires the light intensity for a large number of different spectral bands. This allows it to provide more detailed information about the scene than a normal color camera, which only acquires three different spectral bands. The imaging works in both video and still photography, he says. 'We are close to producing a prototype, which is scheduled for release in June,' said Professor Mendlovic. 'A long list of fields stand to gain from this new technology. 'We predict hyperspectral imaging will play a major role in consumer electronics, the automotive industry, biotechnology, and homeland security.' This back-end analyser would need a large database of hyperspectral signatures at its disposal. Applications of the sensor include remote health monitoring and industrial quality control. 'Agricultural applications may also benefit because hyperspectral imaging could be used to identify properties of crops, vegetables, and other types of foods,' Mr Raz says. 'Its hyperspectral platform is also suitable for wearable devices.' A first-generation demonstration system of the camera.  Once the camera take an image, the data would be further analysed by a third-party to extract the hyperspectral signature at any location in the image . According to Professor Mendlovic, Unispectral is currently in discussions with major smartphone makers, car companies, and wearable device makers to move the technology forward. A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe. There are two variations; a regular (engineering) Tricorder and a medical Tricorder. Medical Tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient, either in a ‘sick bay’ on a star ship or during an away mission. The scanning tool can determine a patient’s medical status, and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination. And the company isn't the only one hoping to recreate Spock's Tricorder. Earlier this year, researchers revealed a gadget that can be used to diagnose an illness simply by holding it to the forehead. Named Scanadu Scout, the small round device is able to read a number of vital signs, including heart rate and temperature. It contains a variety of different sensors alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget that together, can read vital signs, including body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen level, heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time (PWTT). PWTT is the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person's body and is related to blood pressure. Its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds. Scanadu was finalist in the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, which was launched in 2013 to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases, including anaemia, tuberculosis and diabetes. Another device by London-based, ScanNurse, uses computer-vision techniques to analyse images taken with a camera. The scientists hope their system will make observations of the inside of the ears or throat, in the same way a doctor would, and then feed it into a computer for analysis. Other teams are using blood and urine samples to test for key markers. The tiny microfluidic devices will, they claim, work in a similar way to hospital-lab tests.","System uses combination of powerful software and 'MEMS' technology .

"A Liberal Democrat candidate has thanked Nick Clegg for not visiting his seat because he said it would turn off voters. Josh Mason, who is standing in Lib Dem-held Redcar, said the Deputy Prime Minister was 'not the most popular'. He said that a visit from the party leader to the seat, which is currently held by the Lib Dems,would not 'do us any favours'. Scroll down for video . Josh Mason, who is standing in Lib Dem-held Redcar, said his own party leader Nick Clegg was 'not the most popular' But after Lib Dem HQ heard about the remarks he was forced to make an embarrassing U-turn. Mr Clegg has seen a dramatic collapse in his popularity since the heyday of the 2010 election campaign when he was lauded as being more popular than Winston Churchill. The party secured 23 per cent of the vote in the 2010 election. Since taking the Lib Dems into government and breaking his promise to scrap tuition fees, the party's poll ratings have slumped to single figures. Most Lib Dem MPs are choosing to keep Mr Clegg off their leaflets and instead campaign on local issues. Mr Mason told ITV Tyne Tees: 'I think that Nick Clegg coming to Redcar might be a little bit of a double-edged sword for us. 'He’s not the most popular politician in the mainstream political circuit at the moment and I’m not convinced that his presence here would actually do us many favours.' After the interview, the Lib Dems issued a 121 word statement on Mr Mason's behalf praising Mr Clegg for having 'real guts'. Mr Clegg is touring the country in a bright yellow battlebus, which stopped off in Cardiff yesterday where he campaigned with leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Kirsty Williams (pictured) Mr Mason said he was now in 'no doubt' that Mr Clegg would be 'well received' if he paid a visit. The statement said: 'Nick has shown real guts as our party leader and is someone I admire and respect. 'As Deputy Prime Minister he delivered tax cuts for low earners, more jobs and apprenticeships, and ensured real investment has come to Redcar after decades of neglect by Labour and the Tories. 'Whilst this real difference to real people’s lives has not always been given a fair hearing in the mainstream political circuit, the election campaign at last gives Nick and our party a chance to be heard directly by the public. 'As such I have no doubt that if Nick now came to Redcar and met all the people who have benefited from having the Liberal Democrats in government he would be well received.'‎ . The Lib Dems won the Redcar seat with a 5,000 strong majority in 2010 but MP Ian Swales has stepped down. Mr Clegg faces a tough fight to keep hold of his Sheffield Hallam seat and polls have predicted his party could lose more than half of its MPs.‎ .","Josh Mason gave TV interview thanking Clegg for not visiting his seat .

"A former Fortune 500 executive from New Hampshire who caused a highway crash that killed a Vermont couple and their unborn baby said during his sentencing Wednesday that he wasn't suicidal. Prosecutors previously said that Robert Dellinger, 54, told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across a median at more than 100mph and plowed into an oncoming SUV. The crash killed 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was eight months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Speaking out: Former Fortune 500 executive Robert Dellinger, 54, said in court during his sentencing Wednesday that he was not suicidal on the day he crashed into a couple's SUV, killing them instantly . Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 . Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . During the first day of what is expected to be a two-day sentencing, the former executive at PPG Industries Inc told the court he has 'never been suicidal.,' according to Valley News. Deborah Dellinger, the defendant's wife, described her husband from the witness stand Wednesday as a 'man of ethics, integrity and friendship' who has lived his life with 'grace and modesty,' despite being plagued with serious health problems. Addressing the victims' families sitting in the courtroom, Mrs Dellinger said: 'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones. We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median in December 2013 . Dellinger pleaded guilty in February to negligent homicide in the deaths of the young couple and to one count of assault for the fetus' death. He faces 12 to 24 years in prison when sentencing resumes Thursday. The defendant also faces a wrongful death lawsuit filed in February by the estate of Amanda Murphy. Robert Dellinger's attorneys claimed that the former high-powered executive was suffering from Ambien withdrawal, the effects of a psychiatric drug overdose and Prozac, and the advanced symptoms of multiple sclerosis . Dellinger, who held high-level posts at PPG Industries Inc., Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co., told investigators he was trying to kill himself on December 7, 2013, when he steered his pickup across a highway median in Lebanon, New Hampshire. His truck became airborne and sheared the top off of the victims' SUV, causing injuries so severe that the medical examiner said the couple looked like they had been in a plane crash. The Vermont couple, who had met while working at a home for the elderly, were killed instantly. Dellinger, who suffered cuts on his head and face, was initially charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter, which were later upgraded to negligent homicide. Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, 2013, a few days after the crash . According to the prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his . medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, . however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a . 'productive and exemplary life.' He . took a severance package worth more than $1million in cash plus stocks . when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents . filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

"Prince Harry will go on tough bush patrols and take part in 'indigenous engagement' programmes during his four-week secondment with Australian Defence Force, Kensington Palace has revealed. The prince is due to arrive in Australia on the 6th April and will split his time between capital Canberra, Sydney, Darwin and Perth. On arrival, Harry will be taken straight to the Australian War Memorial on arrival before heading to barracks to report for duty. On his way: Harry will deploy to Australia next week and will begin with a visit to the Australian War Memorial . Last trip: Harry last headed Down Under in 2013 when he took part in Navy celebrations . First though, he will pay his respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where he will be joined by Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove. Afterwards, the 30-year-old will tour the World War I and Afghanistan galleries before meeting members of the public. Harry will then report to Australia's defence chief, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, and army boss Lieutenant General David Morrison for duty. 'Prince Harry is tremendously looking forward to starting his four week attachment with the ADF,' said a source. 'It has been an opportunity he has been keen to explore for a couple of years now and is delighted to be able to do it before completing his military service with the British Armed Forces later this year.' News of Harry's deployment Down Under emerged two weeks ago, when Kensington Palace announced that the prince would be ending his army career after a decade of service. This month's secondment to Australia will be one of the final acts of his military life, which will come to an end this summer. Afterwards, the prince will travel to Africa to work on charitable projects before returning to the UK to take part in the Walk of Britain with injured veterans to support Walking With the Wounded. During his Australian military career, Captain Wales, as he is known in the Army, will take part in urban training exercises, regional bush patrols and joint fire exercises, and will also spend time meeting the local Aboriginal population. He will also briefly travel back in order to visit Turkey with the Prince of Wales later this month in order to take part in a memorial service for the men who fought and died at Gallipoli. The World War I battle, which pitted British forces against the Ottoman Empire, claimed the lives of 34,000 British soldiers, 8,700 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders. Making friends: On that occasion, Harry met some of the locals and even pulled faces for a little boy . Warm welcome: Prince Harry was met by crowds of well-wishers during his last visit in October 2013 . Harry has visited Australia twice before, most recently in 2013 when he took part in the International Fleet Review in Sydney. Harry has served with the Australian Armed Forces in the past, most notably during his two tours of Afghanistan. 'He has met [Australian troops] during the Invictus Games and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,' added the spokesman. 'Those experiences reinforced the huge admiration and respect he already had for Australian servicemen and women and has stoked his enthusiasm even more to build on those relationships in the next four weeks. Entertainer: Harry also met Prime Minister Tony Abbott, his wife and two daughters Bridget and Frances . 'He knows he will learn a huge amount from his Australian colleagues during this attachment and he is grateful to the ADF for producing such a varied and interesting programme for him. 'He is also looking forward to learning how wounded, injured and ill servicemen and women are supported here in Australia and hopes to pass on some of his experience from his current role in the UK. 'Prince Harry has been to Australia twice before, so he knows he is in for a great experience. He particularly appreciates the opportunity to pay his respects to the fallen by traveling straight to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra upon arrival into the country on Monday, and fully appreciates the significance of commemoration in this centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign.'","Details of Prince Harry's Australian deployment have been released .

"Purvi Patel, pictured, was jailed for 20 years for feticide and neglect of a dependent following a hearing at South Bend, Indiana . A 33-year-old woman who took abortion drugs she bought on the internet to cause a miscarriage and disposed of her fetus in a dumpster has been jailed for 20 years. Purvi Patel, 33, of Granger, Indiana has been jailed after she was convicted on charges of feticide and neglect of a dependent. St Joseph Superior Court heard that Ms Patel attended St Joseph's Hospital in Mishawaka, Indiana on July 13, 2013 soon after giving birth. After arriving at the hospital, she denied that she had even been pregnant, even though medical staff found an umbilical cord attached to her. According to court documents: 'Concerned for the child's welfare, doctors continued to question Purvi Patel of the whereabouts of the child. Eventually, she told the medical staff that she had delivered a baby in her home in Granger, Indiana. 'She further told the medical staff that she did not see the child breathing or moving and believed it to be dead. 'Purvi Patel told the medical staff that she put the dead body in a bag and placed it in a dumpster behind the Super Target. She further told medical personnel that she was roughly two months along and had a miscarriage.' The court heard that Dr Kelly McGuire drove to the Super Target store and began searching the dumpsters, having informed St. Joseph County Police. Officers recovered the body in a dumpster behind Moe's Southwest Grill. According to Forensic Pathologist Dr Joseph Prahlow, the body was 12.2 inches long and weighed 1.46 pounds. His report claimed 'the child had been born alive and had taken a breath'. Court records showed that police examined Ms Patel's mobile phone and was able to extract some evidence. According to Detective Galen Pelletier of County Metro Homicide Unit: 'In her text messages, officers found that on June 19, 2013, Purvi Patel admitted to this friend that she was over 60 days pregnant. She also admitted that she had obtained two drugs from Hong Kong, in an attempt to abort the child. 'Purvi Patel told his friend that she began taking the drugs on July 10, 2013.' St Joseph Superior Court heard that Ms Patel, pictured, purchased abortion drugs from Hong Kong online . Ms Patel, pictured, told medics that she gave birth to a stillborn and disposed of the body in a dumpster . Ms Patel's lawyer Jeff Sanford said his client was planning to appeal the case within 30 days . Medics claimed the first drug would induce labor while the second was designed to end the life of the fetus, however, only if it was less than nine weeks old. Justice Elizabeth Hurley gave Ms Patel a 30-year jail term for neglect, suspending the final ten. She also handed down a six-year term on the feticide charge which will run concurrently. Handing down the sentence, Judge Hurley said: 'You Ms. Patel, are an educated woman of considerable means. If you wished to terminate your pregnancy safely and legally, you could have done so. You planned a course of action and took matters into your own hands.' According to the South Bend Tribune, prosecutors had urged Judge Hurley to hand down a 40-year jail term. Judge Hurley said she considered Ms Patel's lack of prior criminal history and remorse, but condemned her for treating the baby 'literally as a piece of trash'. Chief Deputy Prosecutor Mark Roule said Ms Patel could have sought help for the infant. 'His only chance at survival was his mother. In this case, the mother did nothing, left him on the floor to die and threw him in the trash.' Her lawyer Jeff Sanford said Ms Patel was planning to appeal the case.","Purvi Patel, 33, purchased two abortion pills online from Hong Kong .

"Parents have been outraged to discover  a heritage railway attraction was used to shoot a 'hardcore schoolgirl' porn film. The 28 minute movie in which a woman, dressed as a school girl, has sex with a man in a vintage train carriage was filmed on board the Epping Ongar historic railway in south-west Essex. Locals in the area were shocked to learn the location, a favourite with families and children, had been rented out by its bosses to American Adult film company Brazzers, the Brentwood Gazette reported. Scroll down for video . In the 28 minute movie a woman dressed as a school girl has sex with a man on board an Epping Ongar train . The storyline, which is apparently set in the 1940s, then moves to a wooden-panelled train carriage . Locals were shocked to learn the location had been rented out to American Adult film company Brazzers . In the opening scene of the pornographic film a young woman dressed as a school girl walks along the clearly recognisable train station platform. The storyline, which is apparently set in the 1940s, then moves to one of the attraction's wooden-panelled train carriages where the pair have sex on the seats. Parents were quoted as saying they were disgusted and mortified by the decision to use the railway as the setting for the porn film, which has now been viewed more than 235,000 times. Mum-of-two Amanda Mendel from Fyfield Road in Rainham, Essex said it did not seem right that the railway should present itself as a family business and then allow the filming of 'an orgy train'. She said she would be think twice about taking her children on the railway after what had gone on. Mrs Mendel added that the whole thing was 'disgusting'. Similarly Carla Ince 41 from in Brentwood Road in Marden Ash, said it was 'terrible' and a 'stupid, disgusting decision'. She highlighted its hypocrisy explaining that the Epping Ongar railway advertised itself for Christmas and Easter events. Parents were quoted as saying they were disgusted and mortified by the decision to use the railway . Epping Ognar Railway has apologised for allowing the railway to be used as a backdrop for pornography . Epping Ognar Railway has apologised for allowing the heritage railway to be used as a backdrop for pornography. Its business development manager, Dean Wilton, said the decision was an 'error of judgement' and that the attraction had put in place policy safeguards to ensure the refusal of 'any further approaches for this kind of production'. He apologised for a second time for any offence caused. Originally opened in 1865 as the final section of the Eastern Railway Branch line, the Epping Ognar Railway was run by London Underground from 1949. It ran until 1994 when it was closed and its passenger service was withdrawn. It lay in disuse until restoration to turn it into a historic site began in 1994. The heritage line operates between Ongar through North Weald to the boundary of the London Underground’s Central line. It is connected to a historic bus line which connects North Weald to Epping tube station for the ease of its customers. The railway is predominantly staffed by volunteers as indeed are most heritage lines. The Ongar Epping line has been lovingly restored to ensure its features closely resemble the historical past. The station and signal signalbox at Ongar has been painted and recreated to look as it would have on the Great Eastern Railway in the 19th Century. The North Weald station box has been restored to its original 1930s and 60s appearance.","The 28 minute pornographic film was shot at Epping Ongar historic railway .

The new menu also features two new flavors of the chain's Cheesecake Square Donuts, which each contain upwards of 340 calories . Obesity and obesity-related illness has become epidemic; in the US alone obesity and obesity-related illness accounts for a $150 billion dollars of healthcare expenditures annually . 'As adults we must set good examples for our children because they pattern our behavior we must avoid eating food such as these presented on the new menu at Dunkin' Donuts.' Indeed, the food chain's new Pretzel Roll Chicken Sandwich - which is described on the Dunkin Donuts website as containing 'delicious breaded chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon and honey mustard' which are all  'served on an oven-toasted pretzel bun' - contains a whopping 640 calories, almost a third of your recommended daily intake. Additionally, the sandwich contains 1,560mg of sale, which is equal to 68 per cent of the daily recommended intake of 2,300mg. The roll also contains 25g of fat - 38 per cent of your daily intake. And when paired with one of Dunkin Donuts' new ice cream-inspired coffee flavors - Rocky Road Swirl, Butter Pecan Swirl, or Cookie Dough Swirl - customers are adding a minimum of 200 odd calories to their meal, if they opt for whole milk and sugar in their coffee. Another option listed on the new menu is the Southwest Supreme Bagel, which is stuffed with cheese, corn, black beans, peppers, tomatoes, onions and spices and contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt - which is 37 per cent of the recommended intake. Something savory: The Southwest Supreme Bagel contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt . Healthy? The 210-calorie Snack N’ Go Steak Wrap is intended to be a low-calorie alternative to the other menu options, however it still contains 25 per cent of your daily saturated fat intake . Healthier than the pretzel roll, yes, but still not the most nutritious treat around. Indeed, the only 'healthy' option offered on the new menu is a small Snack N’ Go Steak Wrap, a 210-calorie snack that contains 'our delicious angus steak, a slice of cheddar cheese and honey mustard sauce, wrapped in a warm tortilla'. But while this tasty treat is being marketed as a healthier, low-calorie option, it still contains five grams of saturated fats, which is the equivalent of 25 per cent of your recommended daily intake. Last, but not least, the menu also contains two new varieties of Dunkin Donuts' signature Cheesecake Square Donut, which is essentially a sugary pastry stuffed with cheesecake filling, this time in Oreo and raspberry flavors. And while the nutritional information for these individual sweet treats has not yet been made available on the Dunkin website, the standard Cheesecake Square Donut contains 340 calories and eight grams of saturated fats - 40 per cent of your daily allowance. Unsurprisingly, the chain's unhealthy menu options have prompted some health-conscious Twitter users to voice their concerns over the calorie-laden choices. 'If Dunkin Donuts replaced their white flour with organic whole wheat and sugar with stevia, they would probably still be unhealthy,' one man wrote, while one woman added: 'These Dunkin Donuts options have to be the most unhealthy things ever.'","The popular food chain's new spring menu includes a 650-calorie chicken-filled pretzel roll and a 400 calorie bagel .

"A new diet could more than halve a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, according to new research. Experts said the diet, known by the acronym MIND, could reduce the risk of the illness even if it not meticulously followed. The 'Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay' (MIND) diet includes at least three daily servings of wholegrains and salad  – along with an extra vegetable and a glass of wine. The new diet could more than halve a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, new research has found, and even has an effect when a person doesn't follow it meticulously . These 'brain-healthy foods' lowered the risk of Alzheimer's by 53 per cent in those who stuck to the diet rigidly. For those that followed it moderately well, it lowered the risk by about 35 per cent. Professor Martha Morris, a nutritional epidemiologist of the Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago,  said: 'One of the more exciting things about this is that people who adhered even moderately to the MIND diet had a reduction in their risk for Alzheimer's disease. 'I think that will motivate people.' Professor Morris and her colleagues developed the MIND diet based on years of past research about what foods and nutrients have good and bad effects on the functioning of the brain. This is the first study to relate the MIND diet to Alzheimer's disease. 'I was so very pleased to see the outcome we got from the new diet,' she said. The MIND diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, both of which have been found to reduce the risk of cardiovascular conditions, like high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke. Wine is a 'healthy brain food', researchers said . 10 HEALTHY BRAIN FOODS: . Green leafy vegetables . Other vegetables . Nuts . Berries . Beans . Wholegrains . Fish . Poultry . Olive oil . Wine . 5 UNHEALTHY BRAIN FOODS: . Red meats . Butter and margarine . Cheese . Pastries and sweets . Fried or fast food . Some researchers have found that the two older diets provide protection against dementia as well. In the latest study, the MIND diet was compared with the two other diets. People with high adherence to the DASH and Mediterranean diets also had reductions in Alzheimer's disease— 39 per cent with the DASH diet and 54 per cent with the Mediterranean diet. However, the diets had negligible benefits when people only adhered to it moderately. Professor Morris added that the MIND diet is also easier to follow than the Mediterranean diet, which calls for daily consumption of fish and three to four daily servings of fruits and vegetables. The MIND diet has 15 components, including 10 'brain-healthy food groups' — green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. It also has five unhealthy groups that comprise red meats, butter and stick margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and fried or fast food. The MIND diet includes at least three servings of wholegrains, a salad and one other vegetable every day — along with a glass of wine. It also involves snacking most days on nuts and eating beans every other day or so, poultry and berries at least twice a week and fish at least once a week. Dieters must limit eating the designated unhealthy foods, eating less than one tablespoon of butter a day and eating cheese, fried or fast food to less than once a week. Limiting these foods is essential to have a real shot at avoiding the devastating effects of Alzheimer's, according to the study. Berries are the only fruit specifically to make the MIND diet. Professor Morris said: 'Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,' adding that strawberries have also performed well in past studies of the effect of food on cognitive function. The diet suggests 10 brain-healthy foods including wholegrains, salad, vegetables, berries, nuts, beans, olive oil, poultry and fish . The MIND diet was not an intervention in this study, however; researchers looked at what people were already eating. Participants earned points if they ate brain-healthy foods frequently and avoided unhealthy foods. The one exception was that participants got one point if they said olive oil was the primary oil used in their homes. The study enlisted volunteers already participating in the ongoing Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), which began in 1997 among residents of Chicago-area retirement communities and senior public housing complexes. An optional 'food frequency questionnaire' was added from 2004 to February 2013, and the MIND diet study looked at results for 923 volunteers. The diet advises limiting butter to one tablespoon a day and limiting cheese, pastries, sweets and fast or friend food to once a week . A total of 144 cases of Alzheimer's disease developed in this group of people. The disease, which takes a devastating toll on cognitive function, is not unlike heart disease in that there appear to be 'many factors that play into who gets the disease,' including behavioral, environmental and genetic components, Professor Morris said. She continued: 'With late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with that older group of people, genetic risk factors are a small piece of the picture.' Past studies have yielded evidence that suggests what we eat may play a significant role in determining who gets the illness and who doesn't, Professor Morris added. When the researchers in the new study left out of analysis of participants who changed their diets somewhere along the line — say, on a doctor's orders after a stroke — they found there was a stronger link between the MIND diet and more favourable outcomes in terms of Alzheimer's disease. The diet's developer said blueberries are 'one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain' He said: 'That probably means that people who eat this diet consistently over the years get the best protection.' In other words, it looks like the longer a person eats the MIND diet, the less risk that person will have of developing Alzheimer's, Professor Morris said. As is the case with many health-related habits, including physical exercise, she said, 'You'll be healthier if you've been doing the right thing for a long time.' She added that the study did not establish a cause and effect relationship between the MIND diet and a lowered risk of Alzheimer's. Other studies on different populations would need to be carried out to do this, she said. The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging.","Called the 'Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay'

"Real Madrid and Atletico will both be missing one player each in the second leg of their Champions League quarter final next week. Marcelo and Mario Suarez were both booked during the 0-0 draw at the Vicente Calderon and due to accumulation of yellow cards will not be present during the return at the Santiago Bernabeu. Neither player were happy with referee Milorad Mazic, both feeling that their challenges weren't strong enough to be punished with a card. Atletico Madrid midfielder Mario Suarez (right) will miss next week's second leg against Real Madrid . Suarez has blasted the performance of referee Milorad Mazic after being booked on Tuesday night . Suarez expressed his frustration after the game, saying on Spanish TV: 'The referee is very bad. They can't use a Serbian referee for these type of games, with all my respect. 'I hope that in the return leg they pick a better referee.' His comment could result in matches being added to his one-game suspension. The midfielder published a statement on Twitter after the game, reading: 'I'd like to apologise if anyone has been offended by my words after the game, it was not my intention. 'I meant to say that games of this magnitude should be given to a referee from one of the big leagues. Nothing more, we all make mistakes. Lets keep working. #AupaAtleti.' Ancelotti did not agree with the Atletico Madrid man. He said: 'For me, the referee had a good game, it was a difficult match [to control].' Marcelo (right), pictured complaining after being booked, will also miss the second leg at the Bernabeu . Mario Mandzukic makes a point to referee Mazic after being cut by an elbow from Sergio Ramos . There could be worse to follow for Madrid too, with Dani Carvajal at risk of being given a suspension for punching Mario Mandzukic. The Los Blancos right-back was frustrated with the Croatian's physicality and thew a fist at the striker's chest. Both managers claimed in their post-match press conferences that they had not seen the incident. Fabio Coentrao is likely to replace Marcelo at left-back in the second leg, while Atletico have several players who can fill in for Suarez, with Tiago Mendes the most likely.

"When Emma Jackson, 28, moved into a quiet cul-de-sac in Hull just over a year ago, she thought she had found the perfect place to call home. But within a week of moving in, her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching TV with the volume turned up at all hours of the day. Unable to sleep because of the racket, the photography student asked unemployed Mark Ray, 56, to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated, a year later, in violent threats and stalking. Terrified: Emma Jackson, 28, was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour . Now Ms Jackson has been forced to move home because of Mr Ray but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address. Ms Jackson's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat, which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with Mr Ray. 'I was told that the previous tenants antagonised him but I'm obviously not like that so I didn't think it would be a problem,' she said. Then the daily barrage of noise began. 'On the first morning, I was laid in bed and it was about 6am and all of a sudden, there was this noise. 'The TV was on at full blast to the point that you could hear what he was watching. The ceilings are really low so it was right above my bed.' After a week, Ms Jackson approached her neighbour to ask whether he would mind turning the sound down a bit but found herself on the receiving end of an expletive-laden tirade. Aggressive: Mark Ray, 56, waged a year-long campaign of terror against Ms Jackson . Quiet: Ms Jackson and Mr Ray were neighbours in this quiet cul-de-sac in Hull . 'I got this explosion, this tirade of abuse,' she remembers. 'Then he ran off and went into his flat and I was just totally shocked. It was the first time I'd met him and that's what I got from him.' The noise continued, with Ms Jackson forced to resort to headphones in order to get any sleep at all. Worse still, Mr Ray began to subject her to vile tirades every time he spotted her in the street or over the garden fence. Incensed, Ms Jackson got in touch with the local Housing Association. Although ordered to turn his television down, the 28-year-old says Mr Ray's new leaf lasted for just seven days. 'He kept to that for about a week and then he just crept back up again and it went back to how it was before.' Finally at breaking point, Ms Jackson snapped and banged on the ceiling with a broom handle during a cleaning session. Mr Ray responded by banging on her front door and, when confronted and accused of bullying by Ms Jackson, threw a 3ft wooden pole at her. Damage: As well as threatening violence, Mr Ray nailed the shed door shut (see photo held by Ms Jackson) Traumatised: Ms Jackson says her year of living next door to Mr Ray was the worst of her life . As the situation at home worsened, it began to affect all areas of Ms Jackson's life, with Mr Ray even turning up at her workplace. Her family were also affected, with Mr Ray physically threatening her step-mother and father when they visited Ms Jackson's home. 'Mr Ray came out, he was shouting and swearing as usual and red in the face,' she remembers. 'He had a massive rock on top of his bin. 'My step-mum was standing close to the fence and he held it over his head as high as it could go and said ""I'm going to kill you"". 'My dad ran forward and put his hand out to stop it. I was just totally shocked and I feared for my step-mum's life. If he'd have dropped it on her, he would definitely have killed her.' The police were called and Mr Ray was handed an injunction that prevented him from approaching or speaking to Ms Jackson. But even that wasn't enough to stop him. 'I think he was scared for a bit and didn't want to get into any trouble,' she says. 'But then his actual personality must have got the better of him because he started again a few weeks later. 'Instead of overtly harassing me, he would follow me down the street. You could hear it was him because of his stick. 'Everywhere I went, he turned up, he was there. It made me feel really paranoid because every time I walked down the street, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head.' By now at her wits end, Ms Jackson says every part of her life was suffering. 'It was affecting everything in my life,' she says. 'It was affecting my studies because I couldn't sleep. It was affecting my work because I had everything going on at once and it was just ridiculous. 'My hair started falling out because I was just that stressed about it all.' Eventually, Ms Jackson installed a CCTV camera and was finally able to gather the evidence she needed to prove Mr Ray was breaking the terms of the injunction. In October 2014, he was issued with a new injunction that said he would face immediate arrest should he become violent or threaten it. But for Ms Jackson, it was too little, too late and she has now moved into a new home away from Mr Ray. 'It's been the worst year of my life,' she says. 'I've been depressed. It's affected my relationships with people. 'I don't want him to find out where I live [now] because I'm sure he would do something. He is that type of person and that does scare me.'","Emma Jackson, 28, from Hull was subjected to a campaign of terror .

"Hollywood screen icon Lauren Bacall's carefully-collected personal mementos fetched $3.64 million on the auction block at Bonhams New York earlier this week. There were hundreds of items up for grabs at the two-day sale, which came to an end on Wednesday - including housewares, furniture, fine art, jewelry and clothing - and every single one of them found a buyer, a spokesperson for the auction house confirmed. Bacall, one of Hollywood's great golden age actresses, died in August aged 89 in her nine-room home overlooking New York's Central Park, which is also on the market for $26 million. Rest in peace: Lauren Bacall, pictured circa 1950, died of a stroke in New York last August at the age of 89 . Old school glamor: Bacall, pictured in her Manhattan apartment in 1969, bought the home for just $48,000 and it's currently on the market for $26 million . Among the most valuable items purchased during the auction were a hand-colored etching by naturalist John James Audubon American White Pelican, which fetched an impressive $173,000, three times more than was expected, Bonhams said in a statement. From the Humphrey Bogart years, before he died from cancer in 1957, was his black granite games table and a pair of silver candelabras from the couple's marital home in Los Angeles. The table brought in $26,250 - almost nine times the estimated value. Buyers also snapped up Albert Edward York's oil paintings Landscape with trees and A country fence together for $161,000, while another purchased a Henry Moore sculpture Three-Quarter Mother and Child on Round Base for $118,750, the auctioneers said. Other items included Indian miniatures, a Japanese portable brass tea set and a marble table inscribed with 'in the name of Allah' in Arabic calligraphy. A piece of history: This enamel, cultured pearl and diamond broach (R), by jewelry designer Elizabeth Gage, sold for $23,750. It was worn by Bacall at the premiere of Meet Joe Black in 1998 (L) Shine bright: Two 18-karat bracelets (R), one of which features diamonds, worn by Bacall when she starred in A Dozen Deadly Roses (L), sold for more than $30,000 each . And from Bacall's collection of precious gems and jewels, her Tiffany necklace sold for $52,500 and another 18-karat gold bracelet went for $50,000. Bacall's grand Central Park-facing apartment, which is currently on the market, spans approximately 100 feet and boats several bedrooms, a library and seven fireplaces. And while the sprawling Manhattan home is estimated to be worth an impressive $26 million, the husky-voiced actress bought the property, in the city's exclusive Dakota Building, for just $48,000 in 1961 and lived there with her three children for the rest of her life. The Dakota also counted John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono as residents, and it was outside that building on December 8, 1980, that Mark David Chapman shot the Beatles legend dead. Other neighbors of Bacall included Boris Karloff, Judy Holliday and Roberta Flack. In a 2011 Vanity Fair article, the apartment was described as 'cavernous', with a wood-trimmed parlor and huge windows that 'overlook Central Park, 30 feet above the tree line'. House and home: Hundreds of items from Bacall's expansive three-bedroom Manhattan property were included in the auction, from furniture to art . Personal touch: Many of the pieces which will go up for sale were clearly identified as having belonged to Bacall, including this director's chair . Bacall married fellow actor Humphrey Bogart, 25 years her senior, in 1945 at the age of 20. He died of throat cancer in 1957. She married her second husband actor Jason Robards in 1961, but the couple divorced in 1969. As for the rest of her fortune - built up from a lifetime of lucrative films and her marriage to Bogart - almost all of Bacall's estate will be split among her three children, Sam Robards and his half-siblings Stephen Humphrey Bogart and Leslie Bogart. Sam, 53, is an actor, while Stephen, 65, is a news producer and Leslie, 58, is a yoga instructor. Bacall also left $250,000 to each of her grandsons, according to the New York Daily News. The first item in Bacall's will - filed in a rush order at Manhattan Surrogate’s Court in August - left $10,000 for Sam to take care of her beloved spaniel, Sophie. Precious jewels: The auction included a number of unique accessories, including this collection of costume jewelry . Style star: Former model Bacall was known to be one New York's most fashionable women, and several of her most iconic pieces, from designers like Ralph Lauren and Chanel, were up for auction . Dear husband: This Hartmann steamer trunk, which bears Bogart's initials, was sold for $47,500 . A sum of $15,000 was also left to Isla Hernandez, who worked as the former model's maid for the last 14 years. 'It’s wonderful - I never thought she would do something for me,' Ms Hernandez, a Honduran immigrant, told the New York Post shortly after the news was revealed. Another staffer, Maria Santos, was left $20,000. Bacall was sure to stress that her family keep some of her items private, even if the majority were put up for auction. 'I request that my children respect my wish to keep private certain personal letters, writings, diaries and other papers or memorabilia,' she wrote in her will. Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske in Brooklyn in 1924. She attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, alongside Kirk Douglas, and supported herself by working as an usherette and a model. Happy couple: Bacall married Bogart, 25 years her senior, in 1945 at the age of 20. He died of throat cancer in 1957. The couple are pictured together in the 1950s . Career-driven couple: Bogart and Bacall, pictured in the 1950s, appeared in a number of movies together and were renowned for their incredible on-screen chemistry . Filled with art: Bacall poses in 1979 at her home, the mementos of her life on show behind her . It was her work in modeling which led to her real career breakthrough: she was spotted by Diana Vreeland, then fashion editor of Harper’s Bazaar, who saw a unique spark in the young Bacall and immediately began working with her. Bacall soon appeared on the cover of Harper's, catching the attention of the celebrated director, Howard Hawks shortly after. it was Hawks who made the decision to change Bacall’s name to Lauren, when he took a chance on the inexperienced starlet, casting her in his adaption of Hemingway’s tale, To Have and Have Not. Bacall, who was then only 19-years-old, was reportedly so nervous about the role, her head shook involuntarily, so she tilted her chin down to steady herself, with the result being that she looked up at the camera. However it was this unusual style of delivery, combined with the script’s many innuendos, that proved to be a winning formula, sparking a decades-long career in both television and film.","The items went under the hammer at Bonhams New York on March 31 and April 1 .
Several pieces once belonging to Bacall's first husband Humphrey Bogart were included in the auction ."
"A traumatised mother has been left with a phobia of all things yellow after she was hit by a canary-coloured taxi. Lorraine Cobourn cannot even handle bananas following the incident that left her with a broken hip. The 51-year-old had to leave her job as a Barclays bank clerk as a result of the injuries she suffered when the yellow taxi struck her in May last year. She has received two payouts and is now undergoing counselling to help her deal with the psychological damage she received - including a terrible fear of anything yellow. Lorraine Cobourn (pictured) cannot even handle bananas after being hit by a yellow taxi in May last year . Ms Cobourn, of Oakwood, Derby, said: 'It sounds crazy I know, but I can't even touch bananas unless they're wrapped in cellophane - and I only ever buy green ones. 'I can't look at yellow number plates either. And If something yellow comes into the corner of my eye when I am watching TV I have to switch channels. 'I also gasp or sigh if I see a yellow taxi when I am out. I'm terrified of them, and if I saw a yellow taxi on the street I would feel this urge just to drive into it.' She added: 'Obviously I didn't but it felt like there was something in my brain that needed to be released. 'It's very difficult but I try to have yellow flowers in my house to try and cure this fear.' She added: 'It has had an absolutely massive impact on my life. 'The whole incident was incredibly traumatic and I am still coming to terms with it. I cannot face returning to the accident site. The mother-of-two was hit by one of Derby's distinctive yellow Hackney Carriages (pictured) in the city centre . The 51-year-old had to leave her job as a Barclays bank clerk as a result of the injuries she suffered . 'You never expect something like this to happen to you.' She was struck by one of Derby's distinctive yellow Hackney Carriages in the city centre as she crossed a road ten months ago. She was hit as the cab reversed at speed - before the driver left the scene without helping her. He initially denied any involvement in the incident, but was charged with driving without due care and attention, eventually pleading guilty to the offence on the day of his trial. He was fined £400 pounds and given seven penalty points. Speaking about the accident, Ms Cobourn said: 'I looked up and the next thing I knew I was on the road. I couldn't feel anything from my waist down, I thought I had broken both my legs. The pain was like nothing I have ever felt before - it was absolutely agonising.' Chromophobia, also known as chromatophobia or chrematophobia, is a persistent, irrational fear of colours. More severe cases of this phobia can hinder daily activities for some people. People with the phobia may associate a distressing event with a specific colour. The phobia can develop following a trauamatic event involved either one or more colours, while some people become sensitive only to particular shades. Fears of specific colour is called erythrophobia for the fear of red and leukophobia for the fear of white. Although actually clinical phobias to colours are rare, colours can elicit psychological reactions or hormonal responses. Symptoms can vary and may include anxiety, including palpitations, chest discomfort, shortness of breath and tremors. Effective treatment for this phobia involves methods that include systematic desensitization and therapy. She initially had pins put in her hip at the Royal Derby Hospital but later needed a second operation - and a complete replacement. She now has to rely on son Jack, 16, to help around the house. She has received two interim payments to help pay her mortgage and bills while injury lawyers deal with her claim for compensation. The taxi driver's insurers have already admitted liability. Ms Cobourn added: 'One of the most difficult aspects to deal with was the fact the driver did not try to help me and also denied the incident. 'I had to brace myself for a criminal trial only for the guilty plea to come at the last minute - when paired with my health problems, it was incredibly hard to cope with. 'The financial support my lawyers have secured has been a huge help and really eased my financial worries while I have been unable to work. 'I'm now looking to the future and hope that gaining justice regarding the crash will help me to move forward with my life.' Ian Whittaker, an associate solicitor at legal firm Irwin Mitchell, which is representing Ms Cobourn, said: 'This case is a terrible example of the life-changing consequences that road traffic collisions can have on those involved. 'Not only did Mrs Cobourn need major hip surgery and require adaptations to her home, but she has suffered financial worries due to being unable to work and continues to receive counselling support as she works to come to terms with the psychological effects of the incident. 'We are delighted to have helped her secure interim payments that provide reassurance and financial support at this incredibly difficult time, and also hope to work quickly to help her secure justice regarding her case following the admission of liability from the driver's insurer.'","Lorraine Cobourn cannot even handle bananas following the incident .

"We all joke about how bad school dinners are but a secondary school in China takes this age old gripe to another level. In protest at their 'horrible' school meals, high school students in north east China's Jilin province are being forced to the sidewalk everyday to eat their lunch. With teachers banning packed lunches and erecting barbed wire and metal sheeting to prevent smuggling, the students' only option is to leave school grounds to eat everyday, the People's Daily Online reports. A group of students eat their lunch together at a local street vendor near the school premises . Left, a group of students eat their lunch while sitting on the sidewalk. Right, they make their way back to class after being forced to leave the school grounds to eat . Pictures of large groups of students sitting on the kerb eating their lunch have spread rapidly across Wechat, China's version of Whatsapp. According to students, their school banned all pre-packed lunches and cut their lunch break from one hour to 30 minutes, forcing students to eat their lunch outside on the street. Students claim food cooked in the school canteen is simply too horrible to eat, and it is so bad that at one point the canteen even closed down. The school has resorted to drastic measures to keep out students who may try to smuggle in food by putting up barbed wire and metal sheeting to block off the back entrance. The school canteen also fought back by only serving staff - but they are continuing to sell lunch boxes at 10 yuan a piece which the school recommends the students buy. And in a further effort to make eating outside of the school more difficult, street vendors are banned from operating outside of its gates. The images attracted thousands of comments on various Chinese websites. One person, from Jiangsu, said the schools were 'only after money'. Others also questioned those who were in charge of the greatly-despised canteen, including the school's headmaster, who was branded 'shameless'. The school has banned students from bringing food onto the premises and has even erected barbed wire and metal sheeting to prevent smuggling at its back entrance .","Students at school in China pictured eating their lunches on the sidewalk .

"Facebook has two days to release all emails to a defense lawyer whose client has fled from criminal charges that he falsely claimed a majority ownership in the social media giant. The documents requested include details relating to a contract with Paul Ceglia during an 18-month stretch beginning in 2003. Ceglia has been on the run for a month after cutting off his electronic ankle bracelet. His father told a court they believe Facebook and the prosecutors were conspiring against him. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick told Facebook Inc. and owner Mark Zuckerberg they have until Monday to relinquish the information that was requested by Ceglia's lawyer, Robert Ross Fogg. The order ignores Zuckerberg's request to wait until Ceglia is caught before handing over the documents. Mark Zuckerberg must release documents and electronic correspondence to a defense lawyer whose client has fled from criminal charges that he falsely claimed a majority ownership in the social media giant . With a May 4 trial approaching, Ceglia cut off his electronic ankle bracelet last month and fled. His wife, two children and dog are also missing from their home in Wellsville, 70 miles southeast of Buffalo. Ceglia's father told Broderick at a hearing last week that he believed his son might have fled because he believed Facebook and Zuckerberg were working together with prosecutors against him, jeopardizing his chance for a fair trial. The judge said he would not allow a trial to proceed unjustly. Federal prosecutors had urged Broderick not to force Facebook and Zuckerberg to turn over the documents, saying doing so would 'reward Ceglia's flouting of the judicial process while unreasonably drawing on the resources of the government and the authority of the court.' The criminal case against Ceglia was brought after a judge threw out his 2010 civil lawsuit claiming that he gave Zuckerberg, a student at Harvard University at the time, $1,000 in startup money in exchange for 50 percent of the future company. Prosecutors said a forensic analysis of his computers and Harvard's email archive determined Ceglia had altered an unrelated software development contract he signed with Zuckerberg in 2003 and falsified emails to make it appear Zuckerberg had promised him a half-share of Facebook. Zuckerberg has said he didn't come up with the idea for Facebook until months after he responded to Ceglia's online help-wanted ad and signed a contract agreeing to create some software for him. A lawyer for Facebook and Zuckerberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday on the judge's order. Neither did a spokesman for government attorneys nor Fogg. Fogg said in an email Wednesday that he and others 'continue to fight for Paul, even in his absence, with the same vigor and fortitude and in a sense — more determined than ever.'","Paul Ceglia on the run from criminal charges he falsely claimed ownership .

"A precious couple, who have been through thick and thin together for the last seven years, have finally committed to tying the knot in a glitzy wedding that will see all funds raised go to charity. Jasper and Jasmine may not be your regular bride and groom, but the rescued pugs' May 17 ceremony at the St Kilda beachfront in Melbourne will have some of the biggest stylists and designers ensuring their big day runs smoothly. Both adorable dogs were surrendered to Pug Rescue and Adoption Victoria in 2013 with a variety of health problems. Jasper (left) and Jasmine (right) will be 'married' in a charity event in May to raise money for Pug Rescue and Adoption Victoria . Both adorable dogs were surrendered to the organisation in 2013 with a variety of health problems. Both were morbidly obese, struggling to breathe, and almost blind . After six months of rehabilitation, in which both dogs lost 3kg and had their sight almost entirely restored, they were found a loving new home . They were morbidly obese, struggling to breathe, and almost blind due to pigmentary keratitis, where a thick brown pigment covered their corneas. Jasper also suffered from severe dental problems and entropion, a condition which caused his eyelids to curl in and his eyelashes to painfully rub against his eyes. After six months of rehabilitation, in which both dogs lost 3kg and had their sight almost entirely restored - and Jasper underwent entropion surgery to reshape and remodel his eyelids as well as major dental work - , both dogs managed to find a loving home with Alison and Matt Rowe. The couple, who describe their new pets as inseparable, soon decided that Jasper and Jasmine's relationship was like that of a boyfriend and girlfriend. Valentines day: Their new owners noticed a great bond between the dogs and always joked they were boyfriend and girlfriend . 'At the day spa getting ready for our engagement photoshoot': They decided to 'wed' their new pups in an effort to raise money for the organisation that helped save them . Jasmine gets fitted for her wedding gown: The well-awaited wedding dress will be designed and created by former Project Runway designer Craig Braybrook (left), a pug owner and lover . 'They sleep together, they eat together, they bath together and cuddle each other every day. They are so close they even clean each other's ears,' Alison said. The notion presented the perfect idea for a fundraiser event for Pug Rescue and Adoption Victoria, which rescues and cares for up to 100 surrendered pugs each year. Running entirely on donations, vet discounts and the kindness and passion of their volunteers, the organisation hopes to raise enough money through admission tickets and the wedding's 'gift registry' to continue funding the various operations required by newcomers. Jasmine's bridal consultation saw her try on her custom headpiece for the big day .

They are so close they even clean each other's ears,' owner Alison Rowe said . Pug Rescue and Adoption Victoria run entirely on donations, vet discounts and the kindness and passion of their volunteers . 'We are a foster based group - we don't have a shelter or kennels or office. All the dogs are fostered in volunteer's homes and cared for by their foster parents. No one is paid within our organisation and we started up about five years ago,' Founder Joana Herceg told Daily Mail Australia. 'Why pugs? You need dedicated breed rescuers because a lot of the time, pugs will come into care and volunteers will pick-up a medical issues that an old owner or vet didn't pick up - it might be behaviour that people might think is unusual or naughty, but is really just how a pug behaves.'

"Rotherham have been charged with fielding an ineligible player in their Sky Bet Championship meeting with Brighton on Easter Monday. On-loan defender Farrend Rawson played 90 minutes in the Millers' 1-0 win and boss Steve Evans claimed after the game that the Derby man's youth loan had been extended until the end of the season.

"You may not like the meager in-flight sandwich. But Southwest have raised their game by throwing two passengers an impromptu wedding shower. Andy McIlvaine, 33, was lugging three bottles of champagne onto a flight from Baltimore to Maine in October to propose to his 30-year-old girlfriend Kelley Mulfinger when he got talking to a group of SouthWest employees.

"Israel's leader reacted furiously to the West’s nuclear deal with Iran yesterday, warning that it would threaten his country’s very survival. Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran’s agreement to reduce some of its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions would pave the way for Tehran to build an atomic bomb. In Iran yesterday, thousands danced in the streets to celebrate the landmark accord which could finally result in the easing of economic restrictions that have caused the price of essentials to soar and businesses to go bust. Danger: Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal will 'increase Iran's aggression and terror throughout the Middle-East' But Israel, which fears an Iranian nuclear attack, issued a series of dire warnings. Mr Netanyahu insisted that he and his Cabinet were united in ‘strongly opposing’ an agreement. ‘This deal would legitimise Iran’s nuclear programme, bolster Iran’s economy and increase Iran’s aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond,’ the prime minister said. ‘It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war.’ Other critics including Saudi Arabia and Republicans in the US say the deal leaves scope for Iran to cheat. Barack Obama, however, has hailed the agreement struck after tortuous negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland, as a ‘historic understanding’. There are still many details to be thrashed out before the deal is due to be signed on June 30, including the pace at which sanctions will be lifted and what happens if Iran is found to have breached the terms. But Mr Netanyahu told President Obama in a phone call yesterday that the existing framework ‘would threaten the survival of Israel’. According to tweets from his spokesman Mark Regev, Mr Netanyahu said: ‘The deal would not shut down a single nuclear facility in Iran. The deal would legitimise Iran’s illegal nuclear programme. ‘The alternative is standing firm and increasing the pressure on Iran until a better deal is achieved.’ Historic understanding: President Barack Obama hailed the nuclear agreement between Iran and U.S. while critics issued stark warnings . Mr Netanyahu is demanding that any final agreement must involve Iran’s recognition of Israel’s right to exist. President Hassan Rouhani has pledged that Iran will abide by its commitments in the nuclear agreement, which ends a standoff between Western powers and Iran lasting several years. Countries involved in the so-called P5+1 talks are the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany. Under the proposed terms, Iran must reduce the number of its centrifuges, the equipment used to enrich uranium into nuclear fuel, by two thirds, and can only enrich it enough to use for domestic power generation, not weapons. The deal also means that for the first time the Iranians will agree to have their nuclear plants inspected. And a major nuclear plant at Fordow will have to become a research lab, although one at Natanz can still carry out enrichment. Mr Obama said yesterday: ‘This will be a long-term deal, that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb. If Iran cheats, the world will know about it.’ He said that if the deal is finalised, ‘we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully’. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted his country was not surrendering and stood to gain from the deal. After arriving home, he issued a statement saying: ‘We have serious goals in the negotiations and eventually, based on what we have achieved so far, we believe we can reach them.’","Lifting sanctions could pave the way for Iran to build atomic bomb .

"Despite being paraded as a prominent backer of Mr Miliband hours earlier, throughout the television debate on Thursday night she instead tweeted praise for Green Party leader Natalie Bennett . Ed Miliband faced yet more humiliation today as he lost the support of a plus-sized blogger just hours after she signed a high-profile letter backing him. Campaign chiefs had attempted to rebuff a letter from 100 business leaders that criticised the party by publishing its own message calling for a Labour government signed by people ‘from all walks of life’. But the plan quickly unravelled as it was revealed the 100 'working people' supporting Mr Miliband included a benefit fraudster, a boss who has used zero-hours workers, affluent students and a string of union and party activists. Today the move continued to backfire spectacularly as another of the signatories appeared to switch her allegiance to Green Party leader Natalie Bennett. Callie Thorpe was listed on the letter supporting Mr Miliband as a receptionist, but online she also describes herself as a 'plus size style and lifestyle blogger, fan of lipsticks, food, travel and self love'. Despite being paraded as a prominent backer of Mr Miliband hours earlier, throughout the television debate on Thursday night she instead tweeted praise for Miss Bennett. She posted: 'I really like Natalie Bennett', before later writing: 'I honestly believe that Natalie Bennett was wonderful.' In a further snub to Mr Miliband, who she failed to tweet about, she added: 'The female party members were incredible.' The 25-year-old, who signed the letter saying the country needs 'a better plan for prosperity', has boasted on her blog about her exotic holidays. She wrote: ‘Travelling the world has always been a passion of mine, especially Thailand and I thought I would share with you the best five weeks of my life hoping that I can impart some knowledge if you too, are looking to travel around Thailand or Cambodia.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) has faced further embarrassment today after plus-sized blogger Callie Thorpe Right) withdrew her support of a high-profile letter backing him .

She is a size 18 to 20. The signatories of the letter supporting Mr Miliband said they were ‘all working people’. They warned about the ‘proliferation of zero-hours contracts’, which they claimed were ‘letting down Britain’ and showed that ‘we need a Labour Government to put working people first’. But Labour removed the name of one of the signatories after she was exposed as Nigerian woman convicted of a £27,000 benefit fraud. The blogger posted during the election debate (pictured) that she 'really liked Natalie Bennett', before later writing: 'I honestly believe that Natalie Bennett was wonderful' Others included 21-year-old Manchester University students John-Jo Pierce and Rory Somerville, who were pictured on their Facebook pages smoking cigars whilst dressed in black tie. Mr Pierce's mother, who lives in a £1million house in Surrey, said her son had signed the letter despite knowing 'nothing about politics'. Several of the signatories were also exposed as Labour councillors and even an ex-MP. Miss Thorpe tonight wrote on Twitter that she had signed the letter 'as a woman who grew up on a council estate with a single parent income'. She added: 'I work x2 jobs and feel passionately about supporting the most vulnerable in our society.'","Ed Miliband lost one of the backers of his high profile support letter .

"China is poised for its biggest corruption case since Mao Zedong's widow went on trial for treason with the rest of the 'Gang of Four'. Former national security chief Zhou Yongkang – an ally of Bo Xilai, the top official jailed two years ago over the murder of Briton Neil Heywood - is accused of corruption and leaking of state secrets, Beijing prosecutors announced yesterday. He is likely to be found guilty, and could be executed. The all-powerful Chinese Communist Party has always been reluctant to admit to any high level wrongdoing, despite growing murmurs that the greed of officials has been running out of control while the economy has been ballooning in size. Trial: Former national security chief Zhou Yongkang is embroiled in the biggest corruption case since Mao Zedong's widow (pictured right) went on trial with the rest of the 'Gang of Four' So the move to announce charges against Zhou is being touted by official media as proof that the leadership is determined to take action – although some commentators argue that it is simply a sign of internal divisions and score-settling between factions in the party. Officially, however, Zhou, 72, is the highest-level official charged as part of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign that began in late 2012. If the trial proceeds as expected he will be the most senior politician to face court since the sensational 1981 trial of Chairman Mao's widow, his fourth and last wife Jiang Qing, and the rest of the 'Gang of Four' over claims they persecuted political opponents during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. A useful side effect of the case will be that it will destroy for ever any hopes Zhou may have had of rivalling the party's leadership. China's Supreme Court last month said in a report that Zhou and Bo Xilai had both engaged in political activities that damaged the unity of the ruling Communist Party. The wording left it unclear whether the two were being accused of plotting together or separately. But Zhou is charged with 'huge' bribe-taking, abuse of power and intentionally leaking state secrets. Given his previous role as a security chief, there is scant sympathy for him. The China director of Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said on Twitter: 'Zhou Yongkang, pivotal in denying so many the right to a fair trial, won't get one himself.'","Zhou Yongkang most senior politician to face court since Mao's widow .

"Healing: Mothers have reported powerful properting from eating their placenta. Pictured: a smoothie . There is a tall glass of something very red and rather alarming on the kitchen counter when I meet Kathryn Beale at her three-bedroom home in Swindon. More scary still, she appears to be drinking it. Fortunately it soon becomes clear that my suspicions are unwarranted, as the substance in the tumbler is nothing more troubling than plain old fruit juice. But I am here because Kathryn is a national expert in the art of the strange foodstuff, and one very disconcerting product in particular. The 41-year-old mother-of-two is part of a rapidly growing cottage industry that prepares fresh placenta for new mothers. Along with some 60 other specialists in this country, she whizzes it into smoothies, or grinds it into pills for women convinced of its health benefits. Mothers have reported powerful healing properties, saying that eating their own placenta (the blood-filled organ that supports the foetus in the womb) has helped to increase their milk supply, reduce post-natal bleeding, stabilise blood pressure, and, crucially, provide them with more energy to care for their babies. Celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include Hollywood actresses January Jones and Alicia Silverstone and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton. Kathryn has had no reported cases of food poisoning among her clients. Nor, for that matter, has any other practitioner in the 70-strong Independent Placenta Encapsulation Network (IPEN), of which Kathryn is a member. IPEN estimates that between 4,000 and 5,000 women have used the service since it started in 2010, the majority in Britain. Yet Kathryn is in despair, having found herself at the centre of a storm which could not only destroy her own business, but help put an end to placenta-eating across the country. Scroll down for video . Natural: Kathryn Beale whizzes plcenta into smoothies or into pills for women convinced of its health benefits . Swindon Council is claiming that her services pose a danger to the mothers she is trying to help, and are taking her to court saying they want to stop her from trading. They have already taken half her essential kit, including a grinder and a pill-maker, meaning she can no longer provide her service. She said: ‘It does seem like a witch-hunt. Why should they be doing everything they can to stop me providing a service which I believe helps new mothers? Yes, some people might be squeamish about it, but that doesn’t give the council the right to just close me down.’ IPEN director Lynnea Shrief lost her court battle against Dacorum Council in Hertfordshire last year. She believes the legal action is part of a national move to shut down the industry. Three other IPEN businesses have also faced opposition from local authorities. Benefits: Mothers say eating placenta has helped to increase their milk supply and reduce post-natal bleeding. Pictured: Placenta capsules . It was in March that the council took action against Kathryn. Health bosses claimed that dangerous microbes would multiply while the placenta was being processed in her kitchen – with the risk of poisoning the mother. Last month, Swindon failed to convince a magistrate to grant a hygiene emergency prohibition order against Kathryn, who contested the order. Despite noting her various food-safety certificates, and failing to advise how she might satisfy their health risk concerns, the council is trying again and she will re-appear in court in May. Kathryn says of the council’s inspection: ‘It was clear they didn’t know how a maternity ward works. They had the impression that placentas were just falling out of women all over the floor and being put into buckets with other placentas. It’s just not the case.’ Kathryn provides her clients – mostly well-educated, professional women – with a large zip-lock bag into which the placenta is placed. The bagged organ is then put into a large leak-proof plastic box, which goes into a cool bag packed with ice packs ready for Kathryn to collect. Celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include Mad Men star January Jones (left) and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton (right) If the mother has requested a £20 placenta smoothie at the birth, Kathryn blends some with fruit and apple juice using a hand-held blender. She takes the remainder home and either steams the organ with lemon, ginger and green chilli, or dries slices of placenta in a dehydrator before grinding the pieces into a powder which she makes into capsules. This service costs £150. Kathryn, a former primary school teacher turned birth ‘doula’ – a non-medical supporter for expectant mothers – became interested in placenta consumption after watching chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall flambee one on TV. She added placenta processing to her birth doula business in March 2013 after a day-long IPEN training course. She obtained certificates in food safety for manufacturing, infection control, and HACCP, a food safety management system. A Swindon Council spokesman said: ‘Preparation of foodstuffs using human placenta in this way can present a number of potentially serious health risks to those who consume them. We are legally obliged to investigate and take whatever steps are necessary to protect consumers.’ A key genetic mutation could explain why some children who catch flu are left fighting for their lives in hospital – while others just need a day or two in bed. Scientists discovered the mutation after studying a two-year-old French girl who nearly died from the flu. They found she was particularly vulnerable because she had inherited a rare double genetic mutation from both of her parents which meant she was unable to produce a protein called interferon. Interferon, which is commercially available, helps the immune system attack flu and could now be used to save young victims. Professor Jean-Laurent Casanova, from the Imagine Institute of Genetic Diseases in Paris, and the St Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Disease at Rockefeller University in the US, said: ‘This finding suggests that one could treat severe childhood flu with interferon.’ The girl, who was critically ill with flu in 2011, has not had the virus since, after being vaccinated annually. The researchers’ findings have been published in the journal Science.","Kathryn Beale, 41, is a national expert in the art of the strange foodstuff .

"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wasn't looking too presidential Tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting. And now the state's largest teacher's union is calling him out for his 'bullying' behavior. 'He's always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events,' Steve Wollmer of the NJ Education Association told NJ.com. 'It's the one thing that never seems to change.' Scroll Down for Video . Not being nice: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (left) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher (Kathy Mooney, right) at a Tuesday night town hall meeting . That sentiment doesn't ring well with Christie's ambitions to run in the Republican presidential primaries next year. Tuesday night, Christie appeared at Kenilworth Town Hall to take questions from a group of citizens, when Kathy Mooney, a high school English Teacher from Roselle Park, took the microphone. Ms Mooney, who has been a teacher for 27 years, questioned Christie's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company ExxonMobil which could have contributed drastically to the state's pension plans for teachers. Christie settled the deal for $225million, despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $8.9billion which Mooney described as 'favoring the affluent' and 'kicking state workers under the bus'. 'I know that you could have gotten more money, on the dollar,' Mooney said. 'Do you?' a defensive Christie quickly responded. 'You do know that? Really? You know that?' Mooney started to respond, but not before being cut off by the governor. A good deal? Mooney questioned Christie's decision-making behind a $225million legal settlement. The state originally wanted $8.9billion from the oil company, and Mooney says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees . 'I mean: Do you know that?' Christie continued. 'I wanna know how you know that. Because you're a teacher, and you're standing in front of students every day, conveying to them, facts - things that they need to learn. So I would like to understand your analysis of how you know that in a ten year long, court case, that you have enough detail to know.' Mooney explains that she read about the deal in the newspaper and did not attend the meeting 'to be bullied'. 'You're not being bullied, because you're asking me a question, I'm going to ask you questions back,' Christie says, as he continues to dodge the issue. 'He said, ""I'm not bullying you' as he bullied her,""' Wollmer said of the exchange. Perhaps the reason why Wollmer and his union responded sharply to Christie's town hall meeting Tuesday night, is that he blamed the union for their role in the current pension system. 'The fact is your union, over the course of time, has asked for significantly higher benefits - more expensive benefits - that your union knew the state could not afford,' Christie said Tuesday.","The presidential hopeful held a town hall meeting in Kenilworth on Tuesday .
