"An NFL defensive back with a history of legal problems is being investigated after reports of an early-morning incident involving a physical fight and at least one shot being fired at a Texas club. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother are being investigated for aggravated assault after an altercation at a Dallas-area nightclub on Wednesday morning, according to reports. During a 2011 incident involving two guns when he playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Talib and his mother were accused of shooting a gun at his sister's live-in boyfriend in Garland, Texas. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother Yaqub are being investigated for aggravated assault . Talib was in trouble before and was wanted on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2011 . During the latest incident, a shot was fired outside of Club Luxx in Dallas, Texas, after a physical fight inside . During the incident on Wednesday, Talib and his brother Yaqub had a physical altercation with someone inside Club Luxx and then a shot was fired outside around 2am, WFAA reported. When Dallas officers responded to the active shooter call, the man who called police said three black men had been involved in a disturbance and one of them had tried to punch him. The man also said one of the men pulled out a gun and aimed it at him before firing a round off into the sky outside the bar and causing 'an immediate panic'. The Talibs left the area in a Range Rover and a Jaguar and went to the XTC Cabaret. Police found the brothers at the second club and impounded the vehicles to look for evidence. The brothers were both questioned and an investigation into the incident is ongoing. The general manager of Club Luxx, confirmed the Talibs were at the club but denied that anything with a gun transpired, the Dallas Morning News reported. Hanney Kamal said: 'One-hundred percent that did not happen. 'I was there. Somebody might have called the police because there was a yelling argument. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract last year . 'It's athletes — someone sees them yelling and dials 911. 'Everyone was asked to leave the club, which they did of their own free will, and that was it.' Broncos vice president of public relations Patrick Smyth said: 'We have been in touch with Aqib regarding these reports and will continue to monitor this situation.' Dallas police falsely reported Talib had been arrested for throwing bottles last June during an NFL camp afterparty, the Denver Post reported. The police apologized after it ended up being Yaqub who was arrested. During the 2011 incident in Garland, felony warrants were issued for Talib and his mother Okolo Talib on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police suspected them both of firing shots from a Ruger .380 handgun at Shannon Billings, the boyfriend of Talib's sister, and also believed the NFL back attempted to pistol-whip Billings with a Springfield 9mm semiautomatic handgun during the incident, the Boston Globe reported. They had apparently learned Billings was being physically abusive towards their family member. Talib, who owned both weapons. reportedly yelled during the pistol-whipping: 'You're going to make me throw away my career.' The charges were dropped because prosecutors believed Billings, a registered sex offender with the state of Texas, would not make a credible witness. Garland Police spokesman Joe Harn said: 'It was very fortunate no one was killed and no one was hurt seriously. 'There wasn't a great deal of distance from one person to the other that was shooting.' After the 2011 incident, a felony warrant was issued for  Okolo Talib for assault with a deadly weapon charge . In addition to playing for the Broncos, Talib has also played for the Patriots and the Buccaneers . In addition to the gun incidents, Talib was investigated after an alleged assault on a Florida cab driver. He then resisted arrest on charges of simple battery. The shutdown corner also fought with teammates and was suspended for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract with Denver in March 2014. He also has played for the New England Patriots during his seven-year career. During his time with the reigning Super Bowl champs, Talib said: 'I'm a competitor on the field, man. 'That's kind of what we're talking about right now, just football.' If charges are brought with regard to the incident in Dallas, Talib could face discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy and a suspension seems possible given his history.

"Adrian Peterson is to meet with the NFL to discuss his reinstatement. The Minnesota Vikings running back played once last season before being placed on the Commissioner's Exempt list due to a child abuse case. The 30-year-old was was due to be reinstated on April 15, but according to NFL media insider Ian Rapoport, Peterson will meet with the NFL this week. Peterson's situation is far from clear, with the 2012 MVP telling ESPN he was 'uneasy' about returning to the franchise. Adrian Peterson has plenty to chew over but the Minnesota Vikings do not want to trade their star back . It has been a turbulent seven months for Peterson, who has been linked with the Cowboys and Cardinals . His main bone of contention  is said to be with chief operating officer Kevin Warren, whom the Peterson camp claims attempted to keep him off the field last year. The Vikings start offseason workouts in a fortnight and head coach Mike Zimmer has repeatedly spoken of his desire for Peterson to stay. 'I'm not going to speculate on what he wants or doesn't want,' Zimmer said last month. 'Adrian's under contract for three more years with us, and that's why you sign those contracts. That's why you get these big bonuses, you know?' 'We have no plans to trade Adrian,' he said, definitively. Peterson is under contract for 2015, and is set to earn a base salary of $12.75million from the Vikings. The Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals are repeatedly linked as potential landing spots and when his status is settled, it will be one step nearer to finding out where his future lies.","Peterson has been banned since September 17 after child abuse case involving his four-year-old son and a switch .

"The NFL is set to hire Sarah Thomas as its first permanent female official for regular season games, according to reports. The 42-year-old mother-of-three from Mississippi has officiated pre-season games as a line judge. The Baltimore Sun's Aaron Wilson broke the story, with the NFL refusing to confirm the appointment. The Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas will be one of eight new officials for the 2015 season. Sarah Thomas is set to become the NFL's first full-time female official after refereeing college games . Thomas was on the NFL's list of officiating prospects and is set to be named as one of eight new officials . Thomas has a history of trailblazing since beginning her refereeing career in 1999. Starting at high school level, she would go on to become the first woman to referee in a Big Ten stadium and a bowl game. 'She has the right temperament and attitude and feel for the game,' a source told The Baltimore Sun. 'She knows the rules and understands how to apply them in the spirit of the rules. That sets her apart, male or female.' 'I set out to do this and get involved in officiating not having any idea that there were not any females officiating football,' Thomas told NFL Network. 'Being a former basketball player, you saw female officiating all the time. So, no, I don't feel like a pioneer.' In 2012, Shannon Eastin was hired during an officiating lockout and was line judge during the regular season game between the Green Bay Packers and the St Louis Rams. She was not hired permanently, however.","Thomas set to be named as one of eight new referees for the 2015 season .

"Nicola Adams has been forced to withdraw from this weekend's English National Championships following a burglary at her home in Leeds. Adams and other family members were at home at the time but were not aware of the break-in, in which two cars, training kit and valuable personal possessions were taken. Adams had been due to contest the women's 51kg flyweight division including a prospective final showdown against her Great Britain rival Lisa Whiteside. Olympic gold medallist Nicola Adams has had to pull out of the English National Championships . Adams said in a statement: 'Nothing makes me prouder than boxing on home ground with the support I get from the nation. 'So, after much thought and discussion with England Boxing, I'm deeply regretful to have to pull out. It's not an easy time for me and my family. We would like to thank everyone for their understanding and support - the boxing team, the police and all my supporters.' Adams had been due to fight on Saturday in what would have been her first fight in England since her gold medal triumph at London 2012. Victory was likely to have taken her through to the Sunday final to face Whiteside - a former police officer - who won a world silver medal last year in Adams' injury-enforced absence. Adams (right) decided not to fight after a burglary at her home, which occurred while she was in the house . The bout at Liverpool's Echo Arena was widely seen to have been an opportunity for Adams to reassert her dominance over her rival as part of preparations for next year's Rio Olympics. England Boxing chief executive Mark Abberley said: 'The most important thing is that Nicola and her family were unharmed and our thoughts and best wishes are with them. 'We were looking forward to Nicola taking part in the first ever England Boxing Championships in which the men and women's finals are held as part of the same tournament, however it is completely understandable that Nicola does not feel in any fit state to compete and we wish her all the very best in coming to terms with this upsetting incident.'","Nicola Adams and her family were at home during the break-in .

"Unbeaten Floyd Mayweather faces more pressure than Manny Pacquiao when the pair meet in Las Vegas on May 2 but he will still be victorious, says Joe Calzaghe. It is being billed as The Fight of the Century, and is worth at least $180million and $120m to Mayweather and Pacquiao respectively, but former undefeated world super-middleweight and light-heavyweight boxing champion Calzaghe is confident he can predict the outcome.

Mayweather has an impressive record, winning all of his previous 47 professional career fights, 26 by knockout.

"Luke Rockhold staked his claim in New Jersey as the top middleweight contender in the UFC. Up next, Rockhold wants a title shot and a shot at MMA history in New York. Rockhold capped a brief and brilliant appearance in the cage with a rear naked choke at 2:32 of the second round and made Lyoto Machida tap to win a main event showdown between two of the top middleweights in UFC on Saturday night. Luke Rockhold beat Lyoto Machida by second-round submission in New Jersey . Rockhold celebrates his victory and now wants a shot at the middleweight title . 'I am the No 1 contender,' Rockhold said. 'I'm the best guy around.' Rockhold should be next in line for a pay-per-view title shot in the 185-pound division. With a dominant win over the 36-year-old Machida, he positioned himself to take on the winner of the UFC 187 fight next month between Chris Weidman and Vitor Belfort. Machida never put up much of a fight in his brief stint in the cage. Rockhold lost on his UFC debut in 2013, then rebounded with wins over Costas Philippou, Tim Boetsch, Michael Bisping. He won his third straight fight via submission and looked at his best at the Prudential Center. 'I did my part,' Rockhold said. 'Weidman, you're going to do your part. Let's take this across the way. Madison Square Garden, let's make history.' Rockhold was dominant from the first bell as he cruised to victory against Machida . Machida was marked up badly after the first round and didn't last long in the second session . MMA would have to become legalized in New York for that bout to happen . The Senate again approved a bill to legalize and regulate the combat sport that includes boxing, judo, wrestling and kickboxing. UFC remained hopeful that the assembly will finally approve the bill that would allow the promotion to stage a dream card in December at MSG. 'If it doesn't happen, it'll be crazy,' UFC President Dana White said. Jacare Souza, the No 1 ranked middleweight, made short work of Chris Camozzi in the co-main event. Souza won with an armbar submission at 2:33 of the first round. Jacare Souza (right) grapples with Chris Camozzi on his way to victory in the first round . Souza needed less than five minutes to earn victory and also wants a middleweight title shot . Souza, who lost to Rockhold in his Strikeforce days, hoped he could earn a shot at Weidman's title with a fight against Olympic silver medalist Yoel Romero. But when Romero was injured, Camozzi stepped in on short notice - and a shorter fight. Souza won his eighth straight UFC fight and hoped a month ago a win would mean his name would get called next for a middleweight title fight. Machida-Rockhold and Souza-Romero would have been a Final Four showcase of the best of the UFC middleweight contenders. But Romero's last-minute scratch meant Souza likely has a longer wait for the biggest fight of his UFC career. 'I want to get the shot at the title next,' Souza said. 'It's my time. I'm coming off five victories.'","Luke Rockhold submitted Lyoto Machida in the second round .

Machida earlier told Sportsmail he hopes victory over Rockhold would lead to a title shot. ‘I think if I apply my style, my technique, I can stop Luke, you know. If I can do my strategy, I can win the fight,’ he said. ‘I know there was another fight in line for the title shot - Jacare vs Yoel Romero – but now, whoever wins out of me and Luke – deserves a title shot I think. ‘I can see a couple of weaknesses in Luke but it’s hard to say before the fight, it’s hard to foresee the fight.

"Luke Rockhold is ready to be the bull to Lyoto Machida's matador when the middleweights collide in New Jersey on Saturday.

Lyoto Machida (left) and Luke Rockhold face off ahead of their middleweight clash this weekend . 'A big set of balls. I've just got to come forward and go out there and dominate him,' he said. 'Machida likes to run around and dance and do his thing. I've just got to cut him off, slowly progress and be the bull. He tries to be the matador – sometimes you've got to play one role or the other and this is the time to be the bull and slowly progress, put him in a bad spot and make him fight my fight. 'I've seen little things that he doesn't like – there's plenty of other fights too that I've seen that show a lot of holes and areas where I can take advantage of. 'You see fights where guys stand in the middle ground too long – I've just got to make him think about everything. I'm a true mixed martial artist; I have everything to my game. He's got to think about me taking him down, and then my kicks and my punches and everything that I bring to the table. 'Machida has got a very small avenue to win this fight on the feet. Other than that, my avenue is quite big comparably to his.. He doesn't really have much of a chance on the ground. Rockhold performs during an open workout as he bids to extend his winning streak to five . Machida lands a side kick as he works out in front of fans and media . 'I'll be operating at a different frequency than him – he doesn't have the hip movement and the speed to keep up with me.' And while Rockhold afforded Machida his respect, he has no plans to let it get in the way of victory. 'I think there is a mutual respect between Machida and me – I respect what he does,' he said. 'He's one of the best in the game and has been for a long, long time. 'He's right here at the top, where he's been for the whole of his career. He's a martial artist – he lives by the code. A lot of people love his fighting style, a lot of people hate his fighting style, but you have to respect his fighting style . 'I respect what he does and I like a lot of the things he does. But at the same time, I'm going to go out there and show him my style and dominate. 'I've been running marathons every day so I'm ready to go in there and chase him down.' Rockhold's last victory came against Michael Bisping last November in Australia . Machida is also coming off the back of a victory, against CB Dollaway in Brazil . Machida, meanwhile, is confident he can upset Rockhold and earn himself a title shot. 'I think if I apply my style, my technique, I can stop Luke, you know,' he said. 'If I can do my strategy, I can win the fight. 'I know there was another fight in line for the title shot - Jacare vs Yoel Romero – but now, whoever wins out of me and Luke – deserves a title shot I think.

"Conor McGregor has claimed he would 'kill' Floyd Mayweather 'in less than 30 seconds' if he was ever pitted against the best boxer in the world. McGregor, who is preparing for his world title fight against UFC featherweight champion Jose Aldo in July, said Mayweather lacked the skills in areas other than boxing. 'I don't look at a man who's expert in one area as a specialist,' he told Esquire. 'I look at him as a rookie in ten other areas. If you can box, what happens if I grab hold of your legs?

'If you put me face-to-face with Floyd Mayweather - pound-for-pound boxing's best - if I fought Floyd, I would kill him in less than thirty seconds.

Toney lasted just over three minutes before he tapped out having been taking to the canvas in the opening seconds.

A huge WWE fan, Rousey made her first in-ring performance on March 29 in front of almost 77,000 people in Levi's Stadium in California and admits she caught the bug. Rousey told retired wrestling legend Roddy Piper's Piper Pit podcast that 'there's nothing like' WWE but she is focussed on her upcoming fight against fierce UFC rival Bethe Correia. Ronda Rousey wants to 'find a way' to return to the WWE after taking down co-owner Stephanie McMahon . Rousey was a hot with fans at Wrestlemania 31 but her focus for now is on her fight against Bethe Correia . 'I need to find a way (to return), but I have a lot of stuff going on. I'm fighting August 1st,' Rousey said ahead of her 12th UFC fight in Rio de Janeiro. 'First of all, the kind of beating Bethe is going to get in Brazil is nothing compared to anything anyone can make up in the meantime. 'So I can't make anyone excited about anything while that fight is looming over my head.' Fans were ecstatic when Rousey helped The Rock take down The Authority, otherwise known as WWE co-owner Stephanie McMahon and Triple H, who she threw over her shoulder with what looked like a trademark judo move, on the Sunday night show on March 29. Piper said: 'I've never seen Triple H hip-tossed any better.' UFC women's bantamweight champion Rousey appeared with Fast and Furious 7 co-star The Rock . Rousey's focus is on her much-anticipated UFC bout against also undefeated Bethe Correia (left) in Brazil . On the following evening's WWE Raw, when former UFC champion Brock Lesner made his entrance, they chanted Rousey's name. Rousey admitted she had been given the most high-profile of introduction to the WWE crowd. 'I hit the ground running ... the first I ever wrestled was at Wrestlemania with an attendance record at Levi's Stadium,' she told Piper, whose nickname Rowdy she took for herself with his blessing. 'I had a problem when I left though. There's no way I can't not go back in there again. There's no way. After experiencing that, there's nothing like it. Yeah. 'The second I left I was already thinking, 'How can I possibly go back?' I didn't even change yet. I hadn't even gotten out of my outfit yet.' Rousey tweeted 'We're just gettin' started' after the event fuelling speculation for a return however her agent Brad Slater told Fox Sports' UFC Tonight that it was just a one-off. Rousey throws Triple H over her shoulder and into the canvas as The Rock watches on in the hit appearance . Speaking to Piper about the differences between WWE and UFC, Rousey said it was about the 'uncertainty of the fight'. 'I don't know exactly what's going to happen,' she said of UFC, even though a predicted early attack in her last fight out led to her ending Cat Zingano's night after a record 14 seconds. 'I don't know if I'm going to get really hurt,' she continues. 'I don't know what they're going to come out with. My mind is still running over a million things that could possibly happen, whereas when I know exactly what's going to go down (in WWE), roughly, because it didn't go down exactly as I thought. Give or take. I'm like, 'OK, this is the way it's going to be and if it's going to be this way I'm not going to screw it up.' 'Whereas in a fight, I'm like, 'Don't get stuck in a certain way. It can go any way so don't screw it up.' It's a different kind of anxiety, for sure.' From dangerous to demure, Rousey poses in front of a fast car at the premiere of Fast & Furious 7 . Rousey flies in for a punch on Michelle Rodriguez in their highly acclaimed Fast & Furious fight scene . After some high-profile movie roles, including the blockbuster Fast and Furious release that includes an epic fight scene with Michelle Rodriguez, and the completion of her book My Fight, Your Fight (out in May), Rousey's focus returns to her day job as the headline bout for UFC 190. Her UFC bantamweight title will be up for grabs at the HSBC Arena against Correia, who is also undefeated in the Octagon and has been campaigning for a title shot with taunts at the expense of Rousey's 'Four Horsewomen' friends. 'This fight is not going to be short,' Rousey told Piper. 'I don't want her walking out of there the same way she she when she walked in.'","Ronda Rousey told Roddy Piper's podcast she loved her WWE appearance .

Jimi Manuwa confident he can forget about his first career loss and defeat Polish fighter Jan Blachowicz . ‘My training camp in Sweden has gone perfectly,’ he said. ‘I did the camp in Stockholm and then the last two weeks in London with my team. I’ve got the team here with me now and we’re feeling great for the fight - I’m looking forward to it. ‘I did my camp at All Stars because it’s a great team out there, they’ve got great fighters, great management over there. And it lets me get away from my duties in London and I can focus solely on my training. ‘Once I get in the Octagon it’s going to be down to business and I’m going to get the job done. I know the fans will be cheering for me afterwards if they appreciate the good finish I’m going to get. The Londoner believes his 'aggression and killer instinct' will help him finish his opponent inside two rounds . ‘Look at my record - I always bring a finish. I’ve never been a decision fighter. I’ve never even been past the second round and so I don’t expect to this time. I know he’s a tough opponent but I expect to get the finish as usual. ‘I’ve got aggression and killer instinct - more than him. ‘He’s a great all-rounder, he’s good everywhere. But I think I’m an all-round better fighter. My striking is better than his and I wouldn’t say his grappling is better than mine. But that’s the great thing about MMA, you know, you can never predict what’s going to happen.

"Mirko ‘Cro Crop’ Filipovic is desperate to scratch his eight-year itch when he takes on Gabriel Gonzaga in Poland on Saturday. Cro Crop lost to the Brazilian in 2007 when a first-round head kick brought a swift end to the bout at UFC 70. But he is confident he can avenge the defeat on home territory. Mirko Filipovic (right) faces Gabriel Gonzaga in Poland on Saturday, eight years after losing to the Brazilian . In 2007, Filipovic (right) was beaten by a first-round head kick and wants to avenge that defeat . Filipovic admitted revenge is a motivating factor ahead of the encounter against Gonzaga . ‘I want to beat all the opponents who have beaten me before,’ Cro Crop said. ‘But especially this fight because I lost to him and this time I feel better motivated and more prepared than I did last time. ‘He [Gonzaga] is a big guy. He is tough - he always goes for the victory and sometimes he is successful, sometimes he is less successful. But he definitely is a tough opponent for everyone. ‘I don’t want to think too far ahead - I am focusing on this fight and whatever is next, will happen. ‘I am in really great shape. My training is great - I keep the same schedule of training and I am prepared and ready for this fight. ‘I have been training with Stipe [Miocic] - he is a really great guy. We have been training really hard to prepare for both of our fights. He is just a great guy to train with and to be around. ‘All of the people I have lost against, I always want to fight again. UFC decided it would be Gonzaga and yes I wanted this rematch very much.’ Gonzaga, meanwhile, insists he does not view the fight as a rematch, given the eight-year wait. ‘I didn’t make any mistakes [in his last fight against Cro Cop] and he did make one, and I tried to capitalise on that,’ he said. ‘Eight years can change a lot. So much can change in that time so I do not consider this a rematch; I consider this a new fight. ‘I’ve got better in that time - my skill set has got better. ‘I’m going to try to avoid his high kick. But I will be ready wherever the fight goes. Gonzaga said he does not consider the fight with Filipovic a rematch because of the gap of eight years . Gonzaga believes that his skillset has got even better since the last time he took on Filipovic . ‘That’s the thing about the heavyweight division in the UFC, you know, one punch can change everything. ‘I believe people are never going to forget our first fight. But right now I just need to win this fight. ‘I always need to keep working towards the title shot. I am always trying to get there and I’m here to do that, to move closer to it.’","Mirko Filipovic aims to avenge 2007 first-round defeat to Gabriel Gonzaga .

"Paula Creamer has called for a Masters tournament for women at Augusta National. Creamer, who won the 2010 women's US Open, first floated the idea on Twitter following Jordan Spieth's stunning victory at the Masters on April 14 stating: 'I hope The Masters will consider a Women's Masters soon. They do so much to grow the game. Fastest area of golf growth is women! #6Majors?' In the lead up to this week's Swinging Skirts LPGA Classic in northern California, Creamer suggested a women's event could be staged the week following the men's showpiece in April.

Why wouldn't you?,' Creamer said. 'It's 2015. I think Augusta and the Masters and everybody with that event, they want to grow the game so badly. 'That's what it is, about growing the game and giving people opportunities. There's no reason why we can't do that in women's golf. We're just as much a part of growing the game.'' Creamer continued: 'There's no reason why you can't revisit things. I think somebody's got to speak up and somebody's got to say something. 'It's an idea, I don't think that people should be ashamed to talk about it. I'd like to know truthfully why we wouldn't be able to have a tournament there.

"Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor may have taken the spotlight over the past two weeks when it comes to the UFC's featherweight division, but this weekend it's time for two other top ranked 145ers to take centre stage, as No 1 ranked Chad Mendes and No 4 ranked Ricardo Lamas meet in Fairfax, in a bout which could potentially determine the next challenger to the title. Mendes' only two professional losses have come at the hands of the Brazilian king and Lamas also dropped a decision to Aldo when the two met in February last year. But it is Aldo's upcoming opponent, Irishman McGregor, who has dominated conversation in the lead up to this weekend's fight. Opponents Chad Mendes and Ricardo Lamas face off during the UFC weigh-in at the Patriot Center . Lamas holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym on in Fairfax, Virginia . 'I thought Aldo handled it well' said Team Alpha Male's Mendes, when asked about Aldo's reaction to McGregor snatching the championship belt on stage in Dublin. 'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued. 'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good. I think Aldo is a better mixed martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.' A stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event. Mendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre . Mendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield . Anticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo. 'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added. 'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens. 'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.' Mendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia . And Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes. 'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out. 'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we're going to bring the best out of each other, for sure.' Lamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an open training session . Meanwhile arguably two of the lightweight division's most exciting fighters, Jorge Masvidal and Al Iaquinta, meet in the co-main event - a bout which should showcase some of the finest striking in the division.

"Justin Rose will make his first appearance since finishing second in the Masters in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, an event where he has an impressive recent record. Former US Open champion Rose, who was joint second with Phil Mickelson behind Jordan Spieth at Augusta National, has not been outside the top 15 on his last three outings at TPC Louisiana. Since missing the cut in 2011, the 34-year-old Ryder Cup star has finished 10th, 15th and eighth and is a total of 38 under par, with his last 12 rounds all at par or better. Justin Rose finished joint second in The Masters at Augusta National earlier this month . Rose returns to action at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans at TPC Louisiana this week . Rose will play alongside two other players who performed well in the Masters for the first two rounds, world number 13 Rickie Fowler finishing 12th and Steve Stricker - 28th in his first tournament of 2015. Stricker underwent back surgery in December last year and will continue to play a limited schedule as he works his way back to full fitness, but the 48-year-old has not given up hope of another Ryder Cup appearance even though the Seniors Tour looms when he turns 50. 'No matter what tournament I go to I want to be prepared and to play well and this is no different,' Stricker told a pre-tournament press conference. 'Even though it's only my second event, I have high expectations of what I can do and what I should do. So I come here thinking that I can play well, but deep down I know it's a process and I've got some work to do. Rose looks on as Jordan Spieth celebrates becoming Masters champion earlier this month . 'I'm probably a little more relaxed with things now than I was say 10 years ago when I was trying to find my game. I would say that I'm more comfortable in my own skin and what I do out here on tour is just kind of bonus. 'I've kind of relaxed my schedule the last few years, so that's probably why I have this attitude about playing. I'm much more excited to play when I do come to an event because I'm not playing as much. I enjoy my time at home probably more so because I'm spending bigger blocks of time at home. Steve Stricker (right) is making his way back to full fitness after back surgery last December and will also play in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans . 'So right now I have really the best of both worlds and that's what I'll continue to do all the way up to the senior tour when I start playing some of that. 'I'm still very competitive though. I say I'm pretty relaxed and casual with things. But when it comes down to it, I really still want to win again and play well and maybe make another team event before all is said and done. So I still have some drive in there.'","Justin Rose finished runner-up in The Masters earlier this month .

"Chad Mendes underlined his No 1 spot in UFC's featherweight rankings with an explosive first-round technical knockout of former title contender Ricardo Lamas in Fairfax on Saturday night. Coming into the fight on the back of a decision loss in what was 2014's 'Fight of the Year' against champion Jose Aldo, Mendes did not disappoint. The featherweight came out hard and fast, and quickly landed a right hand which inevitably led to Lamas' downfall. Chad Mendes punches Ricardo Lamas in their featherweight fight during the UFC Fight Night event . Mendes celebrates his first-round victory against Lamas as he returned to action in Virginia . Mendes celebrates in style after his victory ensured he retains his No 1 featherweight ranking . 'It feels great,' said Mendes. 'I needed to come in here and make a statement. That's what I said I was going to try and do and I got it done. Ricardo is a great opponent, he's been on a tear so it means a lot. 'We've been working on slipping that right hand and throwing; that's something that I've done for a long time. I was walking him down, he was catching me with a couple of kicks, I hit him big and he went down.' Mendes piled on the pressure from the first bell despite Lamas threatening him with a diverse array of striking techniques. Just shy of the two-minute mark, the piston-like right hand buckled Lamas and, despite his best efforts to recover, Mendes was just too much for him. Lamas did well to get back to his feet after the initial knockdown but Mendes swarmed him and subsequently landed some punishing blows, including a knee from the clinch. He then connected with a powerful left hook that put Lamas down for a second time, but again Lamas rose. But, losing his balance as he moved away from Mendes, Lamas folded against the Octagon. Mendes evaded Lamas' attempts to get hold of him as he scrambled on all fours, and 'Money' dropped some big shots on his counterpart before gesturing to referee Dan Miragliotta, who stopped the bout inside the third minute of the first round.

When Masvidal heard the judges' decision he stormed out of the Octagon while Iaquinta cut his post-fight interview short amid a chorus of boos from the crowd. Earlier, Dustin Poirier and Julianna Pena made successful returns to the Octagon with two first-round finishes that won both fighters 'Performance of the Night' honours.

"Bubba Watson is used to wowing spectators with unorthodox golf shots on the course, but the two-time Masters champion has proved he can go one step further in practice. The 36-year-old took to Twitter on Saturday to show fans a new trick he had been working on. Working with his caddie in China, Watson pulled off a baseball-style shot with a driver, striking the ball as it was dropped from a height.

"Jim Furyk defeated Kevin Kisner on the second play-off hole to win the RBC Heritage title at Hilton Head and record a first PGA Tour victory since 2010. The former US Open champion, 44, carded a superb final round eight-under-par 63 which included six birdies on his first nine holes to move ahead of overnight leader Troy Merritt, whose three-shot lead evaporated with a 69 on Sunday, when play was started early because of fears over the weather. However, it was not enough to see off Kisner, who also tied at 18 under when he sank a birdie with his final putt. US veteran Jim Furyk celebrates after completing victory at the RBC Heritage . The 2010 winner claimed a second title at Harbour Town after coming through a playoff against Kevin Kisner . The former US Open champion hit a final round 63 to finish 18-under in regulation play . Jim Furyk                        -18 . Kevin Kisner                    -18 . Troy Merritt                      -16 . Brendon Todd                 -15 . Matt Kuchar                     -14 . After levelling the first additional hole with birdies on the 18th, it was Furyk who emerged victorious to claim the tartan jacket when he dropped in his second shot at the par-three 17th from 12ft after Kisner had come up short. Furyk revealed his delight at ending his title drought, telling the PGA Tour website: 'I've let so many slide by, I really dug deep today and I'm happy I got it done.' He admitted he rode his luck on the front nine, where he approached the turn on six under for his round despite several way ward shots. 'I hit a bad drive at two, I hit a bad second shot at two, I hit about 14 trees down the right side and I hit a nine iron to two feet and made birdie,' he said. 'I tugged it off three, it's going way left - where I'm going to get blocked out - and it hits a tree and drops on the fairway, I knock a five iron on to the green. 'Then I tugged it off the fifth tee really bad, hit a tree and dropped down in front of the lake instead of going in the lake and turned that into a par. 'At that point I'm thinking 'I've got to start hitting the ball a little bit better here but things are going my way'. I kind of righted the ship for six through 10 and felt a little bit better about my swing and putts were going in left and right on that front nine. 'I really didn't hit it that well to shoot 30 on the front (nine), I know it sounds funny but I just made everything.' Kisner took his countryman all the way before losing sudden death playoff at the 17th hole . Recent US Masters champion Jordan Spieth finished tied 11th after a final round 70 . Luke Donald was the highest placed Englishman after tied 15th on nine-under par . Merrit, who had hit a course-record 61 on Friday, finished third on 16 under, one stroke ahead of Brendon Todd with defending champion Matt Kuchar one further back. US Masters champion Jordan Spieth ended tied for 11th at 10 under following a closing round of 70, which included a double bogey on the par-three 14th after his tee shot went into the water. Former Open champion Louis Oosthuizen was tied seventh after a 67 left the South African on 12 under. A 70 from England's Luke Donald saw him slip down the field to finish tied 15th at nine under having looked in contention after successive rounds of 66.","Jim Furyk has won the 2015 RBC Heritage at Harbour Town .

"Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat produced a brilliant finish to claim his second European Tour title and break Chinese hearts in the inaugural Shenzhen International on Sunday. Teenager Li Hao-tong looked to have done enough to secure a hugely popular victory on home soil, the 19-year-old emerging from a crowded leaderboard to card a closing 67 to finish 12 under par. That left overnight leader Aphibarnrat two shots behind with two holes to play, only for the 25-year-old to hole from 18 feet for an eagle on the 17th and then miss from 12 feet for what would have been a winning birdie on the last. Kiradech Aphibarnrat poses with the trophy having won his second European Tour title in Shenzhen . The players returned to the 18th for the play-off and Aphibarnrat completed victory in style, hitting his approach to virtually the same place as he had in regulation and this time holing the birdie putt after Li had missed from long range. 'I have been struggling for a year,' said Aphibarnrat, whose previous win came in the Malaysian Open in 2013. 'I lost my coach (Natpasit Chokthanasart, who died in December 2013), I changed my equipment and haven't been on the top of the leaderboard for a while but finally I can do it and it was great. 'I had a chance to win in 72 holes but the putt in the play-off is the best putt I have ever made in my life.' Aphibarnrat can't hold back his emotions, celebrating on the 18th green with his Mother . Aphibarnrat had been six shots clear of the field after 16 holes of the third round, but finished double-bogey, bogey to take a two-shot advantage into the final day. That was wiped out by a fast start from Spain's Pablo Larrazabal, who carded four birdies and one bogey in his first six holes, with Aphibarnrat also dropping shots on the fifth and seventh. Birdies on the ninth and 10th took Aphibarnrat back into the lead as Larrazabal fell away, but bogeys on the 12th and 15th opened the door for Li to take over at the top thanks to birdies on the 11th, 13th and 14th. The 25-year-old was evidently emotional (left), and congratulated by Chinese teenager Li Hao-tong (right) Another birdie on the 17th made Li odds-on favourite to become the first Chinese winner of a European Tour event on home soil, but the 19-year-old could only watch on television as Aphibarnrat conjured up a brilliant finish. 'It's been such a tough day today,' Aphibarnrat added. 'I didn't start well like the other days with three or four birdies, I was one over on the front nine and Pablo was playing great to start. He put a lot of pressure on me. 'I tried to play more safe than the first three rounds because the wind was picking up and it was not easy to make birdies. I just tried to hit it on the greens but I was struggling with my putting, everything was too tight and I felt nervous on the front nine. 'Special thanks to my caddie, he was always pushing me. When we were two behind on the last two holes he said you have not lost, we have not signed the scorecard yet and he was completely right and I just got the job done.' England's Tommy Fleetwood finished a shot outside the play-off after missing from long range for birdie on the 18th in a third consecutive 69, with seven players tied for fourth on 10 under.

"Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat fired six birdies in the space of nine holes to surge into the lead at the Shenzhen International in China on Saturday. Aphibarnrat began the third round one shot behind American Peter Uihlein but birdied his first three holes before carding what would prove to be his only par on the front nine on the fourth. The 25-year-old, whose sole European Tour win to date came in the Malaysian Open in 2013, then bogeyed the fifth but bounced back with another birdie on the sixth, and repeated the trick after a bogey on the seventh.

Aphibarnrat fired six birdies in the space of nine holes on Saturday to overtake American Peter Uihlein (left) A two-putt birdie on the ninth saw Aphibarnrat reach the turn in 32 and at 12 under par he enjoyed a two-shot lead over Uihlein and Spain's Pablo Larrazabal, who was compiling the round of the week. Larrazabal had raced to the turn in 31 and picked up further shots on the 11th, 15th and 16th, while Uihlein had carded two birdies and one bogey on the front nine. Chinese number one Hao-tong Li had earlier carded a flawless 65 to set the clubhouse target on seven under, a total matched by England's Tom Lewis and former US PGA champion YE Yang, who both shot 66.

Larrazabal was fortunate to see his approach to the 17th stop just a few feet from the water to the right of the green, but from there he could only pitch into a bunker and recorded his first bogey of the day. A par at the last meant the three-time European Tour winner had to settle for a 65 to finish nine under, which was now six shots off the blistering pace being set by Aphibarnrat. Aphibarnrat holed from six feet for birdie on the 10th and chipped to within inches of the hole for another on the short par-four 11th, before also two-putting the par-five 13th to reach 15 under. Uihlein also birdied the 11th and 13th but had bogeyed the 10th after failing to get up and down from the back of the green and found himself four shots off the lead.","Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat takes lead at the Shenzhen International .

"Masters champion Jordan Spieth roared back into contention at the RBC Heritage with a second-round 62 on Friday.

Yet Merritt took everyone by surprise with a storming run which saw him pick up seven shots on the back nine and shoot to the top of the leaderboard on 12 under overall. The 29-year-old American, who finished a flawless round with four successive birdies, admitted everything simply fell into place for him. 'It was a lot of fun,' he told the PGA Tour website. 'I had the college mentality of 'just try to make one more (birdie), just try to make one more and see what happens'. And I was just fortunate to close with four in a row. 'I haven't played poorly all year, it's just the tempo issue with me. If I don't have it right away, it's tough to find it and then I'm scrabbling all day and trying to shoot one or two under. Today I wasn't worrying about that.' Kuchar is tied for second place with John Merrick, having followed his first-round 68 with a 66.

"Rory McIlroy's powers of persuasion have resulted in US Open champion Martin Kaymer, former world number one Luke Donald and American Ryder Cup star Patrick Reed confirming their participation in the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open. McIlroy's foundation is hosting the event at Royal County Down from May 28-31 and the world number one has been a major influence in attracting a top-class field, who will compete for a prize fund of £1.8million, an increase of 25 per cent from last year. Reed let the cat out of the bag on the final day of the Masters at Augusta National, also revealing he would compete in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth the week before. Rory McIlroy managed to persuade some of golf's biggest stars to take part in the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open . But the addition of Kaymer and Donald means the tournament will feature five players who have been world number one - McIlroy, Donald, Kaymer, Ernie Els and Lee Westwood - and eight major champions in McIlroy, Els, Kaymer, Darren Clarke, Padraig Harrington, Graeme McDowell, Paul Lawrie and Jose Maria Olazabal. Ryder Cup captain Clarke said: 'Rory has pulled in a lot of favours and it's a testament to the high esteem Rory is held that it's going to be the strongest field for a long time. 'It's a huge positive for the European Tour to have such a tournament on one of the best golf courses in the world. 'I have always wanted to win the Irish Open but have not managed to play well in it that often. Hopefully being back at Royal County Down I will have a decent week this year.' Luke Donald is one star who McIlroy managed to persuade to take part in his foundations tournament . Donald, who last played in the Irish Open in 2004, said: 'My performances and results have been getting better and better recently and I am feeling very positive about a huge summer of golf ahead. 'The Irish Open will be a big part of that and I am looking forward to playing Royal County Down and some really 'old school' links golf - I think the links golf factor will add a lot to the event and it's looking like it's going to be a great week.' Kaymer added: 'There is definitely a good feeling about this year's Irish Open and I think Rory has done a great job to get such a great field for the event and to create a really nice atmosphere about the tournament.' The nature of the course means that spectator numbers will be limited to 20,000 a day, although 5,000 grandstand seats will be erected.

"Jordan Spieth's first outing after winning the Masters did not go according to plan as he finished the first round of the RBC Heritage on three over par. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a whirlwind few days since dominating in Augusta to win by four shots from Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson, but that rollercoaster ride interrupted his preparations here as he did not play a practice round and he looked tired as he struggled in difficult conditions in South Carolina. Jordan Spieth looked tired as he struggled in difficult conditions in South Carolina . In cold temperatures and with strong northerly winds, Spieth three-putted the sixth to drop his first shot of the day and looked lethargic as he missed birdie opportunities on the ninth and 10th greens. He dropped another shot on the 11th and on the par-three 14th he sent his tee shot straight into the water, setting up a double bogey that put him four over par. He pulled one back with a birdie on the par-five 15th, but nevertheless finished well off the pace with three-over 74 even as the conditions kept the scoring under control. The Masters champion finished well off the pace by carding a three-over-par 74 . After his round, Spieth told Sky Sports 4 he had no idea how many interviews and appearances he has made since Sunday. 'I've lost track,' he said. 'Just getting to experience all these incredible things, whether it's a business interview, a sports interview, appearing on Letterman (The David Letterman Show), meeting President Clinton, a lot took place and it's almost sad to leave. 'There were so many great experiences you'd like to have each of those each day, to have them all in one is almost a shame, but it's good sharing my story, sharing our story, getting our brand out there.' Spieth admitted lack of preparation affected his first round in South Carolina . Unless he has something very special up his sleeve for Friday, Spieth appears set for a much-needed weekend off. Matt Every and Graeme McDowell shared the lead on five under after the first round at Hilton Head. In difficult conditions, with strong winds and a distinct chill in South Carolina, birdies were hard to come by but Every carded six before a bogey on the 18th, while McDowell matched him only in reverse after bogeying the first. Given the way the course was playing, staying at the top of the leaderboard was as much about survival as anything. 'I was greasy today,' Every said on the PGA Tour website. 'It wasn't my best ball striking, it wasn't easy out there, but I got the best out of it. Graeme McDowell shared the lead on five under  with Matt Every after the first round . 'It was blowing. Back in the trees, when it's coming from the north and banking off the trees going the other way, it's dicey, but for the most part I did a good job.' Sangmoon Bae is alone in third place, one shot back, ahead of a five-way tie for fourth which includes Kevin Kisner, Scott Langley, Morgan Hoffman, Matt Kuchar and Cameron Smith. Smith could have been much better placed but for a bogey on the third and a double bogey on the seventh, where his tee shot put him in the trees and he faced a long road back. He had earlier carded five birdies in six holes between the second and seventh holes.","Jordan Spieth struggled on his return to action following Augusta triumph .

"Rafael Nadal's bid for a ninth Barcelona Open title ended in third-round defeat as Italian Fabio Fognini edged a hard-fought encounter 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) to move into the quarter-finals. Second-seed Nadal had easily seen off Nicolas Almagro in the previous round but found himself in trouble against Fognini, who had won in three sets in their previous meeting on the clay of Rio earlier this year. And on the same surface in front of Nadal's home crowd, it was Fognini who took the opening set 6-4 after a crucial break in the latter stages, though the second set was to prove an even tighter affair. Rafael Nadal was dumped out of the Barcelona Open after losing to Italian Fabio Fognini in the third round . In front of a home crowd, the world No 4 was looking for his ninth career title on the Catalan clay court . Fognini was able to save six break points in the opening game before conceding it to Nadal, though neither player really dominated even as the Spaniard went 4-2 up. After Fognini first fought back to 4-4, the set eventually went to a tie-break with Nadal this time having to work his way back from facing match point at 6-3 to level up. Nadal showed his resolve late on but it was Fognini who eventually won through 8-6, with his opponent missing a relatively routine forehand. It was Fognini's first win in his six Barcelona appearances but he will now face Pablo Andujar, who also caused an upset in coming through 6-3, 6-4 against fifth-seed Feliciano Lopez. Nadal, who was denied his 20th win of the season, cut an extremely disappointed figure after his defeat, going so far as terming it 'a disaster'. In quotes published on the Barcelona Open website, the world No 4 said: 'My game was mundane. I didn't have enough power, speed and control in my forehand. I didn't manage to push Fognini back. Fognini edged a hard-fought encounter 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) to move into the quarter-finals of the Barcelona Open . 'Fabio played better and he deserved to win. I did not deserve to win.

Bubba Watson was off the pace at the Shenzhen International and had to settle for an opening-day 70 . China's Huang, who only started playing at the age of 22 some 12 years ago, carded eight birdies and two bogeys in his six-under-par round as he finished the first day one clear of a group of four players. Among them are American Peter Uihlein after he completed the final 10 holes at Genzon Golf Club in six under par, and South Korea's Byeong, whose ace came on the 226-yard eighth - his penultimate hole - as he finished birdie-par-eagle-birdie.

"Masters champion Jordan Spieth is back to work this week at the RBC Heritage Classic after two days celebrating his victory at Augusta National and being showered with attention. Spieth arrived at Sea Pines Resort late Tuesday night after a media whirlwind in New York since tying Tiger Woods' Masters record of 18-under 270 to capture the green jacket. The 21-year-old said it was a dizzying stretch with 26 appearances and interviews in 25 hours. 'It was a little crazy in New York having paparazzi know where we were going to eat dinner even though we never told anybody,' Spieth said Wednesday. Spieth doesn't believe the success will change him. In fact, he said he upheld his commitment to the RBC Heritage in part to chase down Rory McIlroy for world No. 1. 'I wouldn't come to a tournament just to come to a tournament, especially with that goal still in mind,' said Spieth, who moved to No. 2 in the world rankings with the Masters' win. Jordan Spieth returns to golf just days after winning the Masters and will play in the RBC Heritage Classic . Spieth has had two victories and two runner-up finishes in his past four events. He would have liked to have had his normal pre-tournament preparations at Harbour Town Golf Links. Instead, he'll go into his first-round tee time Thursday not having played a hole of practice on the tricky, Pete Dye-designed layout. 'I'm sure Jordan's wiped,' said Kevin Streelman, the Par-3 contest winner at Augusta National last week who finished tied for 12th behind Spieth. 'But he's 21 years old, he can handle it.' Spieth has had success here the previous two years, finishing ninth in 2013 and 12th last year. The RBC Heritage gave him an invite two years ago when Spieth was a rising, yet largely unknown 19 -year-old trying to make his way on tour. The top-10 finish, Spieth said, helped his confidence and status on the PGA Tour. 'This tournament helped with job security,' Spieth said. 'So it's a tournament that's close to me and I love it here.' The 21-year-old was in formidable form at Augusta and equaled Tiger Woods' tournament birdie record . Most Masters champions - and many of the game's best players - take the next week off after a pressure-packed week at Augusta National. Spieth heads a group of five ranked in the top 20 of the world (No. 10 Jim Furyk, No. 14 Patrick Reed, No. 17 Matt Kuchar and No. 19 Billy Horschel are the others) to compete this week. Streelman enjoys playing right after a major, knowing his game is honed in and peaking after a Grand Slam event. 'Your game is really primed and amped up,' he said. 'I'm very prepared.' Kuchar is the tournament's defending champion, holing out from a green-side bunker on the 72nd hole to defeat Luke Donald by a stroke. Spieth's success has him atop the FedEx Cup standings, the youngest player ever to lead that category. Spieth celebrates after putting the winning hole and winning the Masters at such a young age . There have only been two Masters winners the past 15 years to follow up their victories by playing Harbour Town. Vijay Singh tied for third here in 2000 a week after winning the Masters while Zach Johnson was sixth in 2007. Only Bernhard Langer is 1985 followed a Masters victory with a triumph a week later at the RBC Heritage. Spieth believes he'll be the same driven, focused competitor he's always been after winning the major he dreamed of as a child. That might be difficult after this week's spotlight. Spieth got congratulatory Tweets from stars like Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant and about 200 texts and emails since the victory. 'Given some time, that will subside a little bit,' he said. What won't ease up, Spieth said, is his desire to achieve the very best in golf, a quest that continues at Harbour Town. 'I was very much looking forward to getting back here, getting on solid ground and taking a deep breath,' Spieth said. 'I'm really looking forward to this week.'","Jordan Speith poised to play in the RBC Heritage Classic, South Carolina .

"Rafael Nadal eased past Spanish compatriot Nicolas Almagro 6-3 6-1 to reach the Barcelona Open third round on Wednesday as he began his bid for a ninth title on the clay in the Catalan capital. Watched by Barcelona forward Neymar in the crowd, the world No 4 and second seed comfortably dismissed the unseeded Almagro - who is battling back after foot surgery that sidelined him for the second half of last year and has dropped out of the top 100.

Nadal, whose 2014 season was wrecked by illness and injury, is looking to rediscover his best form on the red dust before he makes a bid for a record-extending 10th French Open crown starting at the end of next month. The Majorca native lost to world No 1 Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals of last week's Monte Carlo Masters and many are tipping the Serb to end his Spanish rival's stranglehold at Roland Garros. Nadal said he was happy with the way he has been playing the past couple of weeks. 'I had today's match more or less under control and I think I made very few errors,' he told Spanish television. 'It was the first match of the week against someone who beat me last year and for whom I have maximum respect,' added the 28-year-old, who is chasing a 66th career title.

"Ordinary British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer and are likely to end up with less than half the overall allocation. There will be a capacity of 7,000 for July's match against France at London's Queen's Club, but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in Glasgow for last month's first round. The rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies, with a considerable percentage going to well-heeled Queen's members as part of the deal to play the tie there. British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer . Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp . The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times . Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year . The above will have until May 27 to take up or return their tickets, with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public. A minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are British Tennis Members – something that anyone can become by joining free – while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the British team. 'We have obligations to certain groups within the tennis family,' said an LTA spokesman. 'There are restrictions on numbers at the venue and we have to work within that.' Andy Murray, who has won the AEGON title three times, will lead the GB team in the match that takes place from July 17-19. France have seven singles players in the world's top 50, with their best grass court player Jo Wilfried Tsonga having just recovered from injury. The former Wimbledon champion – currently practising in Spain before beginning his Spring clay court campaign – is pleased with the venue, and may be called upon to play doubles as well as two singles matches.","Davis Cup quarter-final tickets will be hard to find for fans this summer .

"U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic was eliminated in the second round of the Barcelona Open on Wednesday, losing to Victor Estrella of the Dominican Republic 6-4, 6-4. Also, Santiago Giraldo of Colombia beat Joao Sousa of Portugal 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, to reach a third-round meeting against top-seeded Kei Nishikori, setting up a rematch of last year's final won by the Japanese. Estrella broke Cilic four times on the outdoor red clay, stealing his serve to go ahead 5-4 in the second set, and finishing off the ninth-ranked Croat by holding serve to love. Victor Estrella of the Dominican Republic recorded a 6-4 6-4 victory over Main Cilic at the Barcelona Open . Cilic is the 2014 U.S. Open champion but is struggling for fitness and form after a shoulder injury . Estrella, who had won only one match in his last five tournaments, celebrated after placing a long forehand out of Cilic's reach on match point. It was only Cilic's third tournament of the season after he rested to recover from a shoulder injury. As the fourth seed, he had a bye in the first round. 'I was not too happy with the way I played,' Cilic said. 'I made a lot of unforced errors. I feel I still need several matches to get my form to a good stage.'

"Twice French Open champion Serena Williams said her struggle to beat Sara Errani in the Fed Cup on Sunday had been a real 'eye-opener' as the claycourt season gets into full swing.

Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves . Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world No 1's power proved to be too much . 'Today has been a big eye opener,' Williams said afterwards. 'I'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as I thought I was. Now I'm in the mindset of, ""You know what, I'm not on hard court."" I'm playing like I'm on hard court and I'm not. 'So I have to play and be ready to hit a thousand shots if necessary.' Williams, 33, won her 19th singles grand slam at the Australian Open and her dominance has raised talk of her claiming all the majors this year.

"A red hot Novak Djokovic is being tipped to end Rafa Nadal's stranglehold at Roland Garros in June but the Spaniard dismissed the threat as being no different to those he has faced before. The Serbian world number one has been an unstoppable force in recent weeks, winning 17 matches on the bounce and becoming the first man to win the season's first three Masters title. He comfortably beat Nadal on his beloved red clay in last week's Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals, and the nature of Djokovic's 6-3 6-3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first French Open.

"Andy Murray and his Davis Cup colleagues have got their preferred venue by securing London’s Queen’s Club as the place where they will take on France in their quarter final. The venerable club in Baron’s Court will host Britain’s biggest home tie in three decades from July 17-19, after agreement was reached between its management and the Lawn Tennis Association today. British Captain Leon Smith and his lead player had made it clear that they wanted to take on the strong French team on grass, as it would appear to give them fewer selection options from their rich resources. Andy Murray in action last year at the Queen's Club, which will host the Davis Cup quarter final against France . Murray celebrates winning at Queen's in 2013 - one of three triumphs he has had at the tournament . Tickets go on sale on May 27 and the match is sure to sell out quickly with the likely capacity of the one court used being around 7,000, as it is for the AEGON Championships, which takes place two weeks before Wimbledon. The All England Club’s overworked show courts, plus the redevelopment work being done there, meant that SW19 was never an option only five days after the Championships finish. The fixture means a bumper helping of six weeks’ top level grass court tennis in the UK this summer, a far cry from 20 years ago when some believed the sport’s one organic surface might even disappear. This time there will be three weeks between Roland Garros and Wimbledon, so by the time GB take on France for a place in the World Group semi-finals all the players will be perfectly attuned to the grass. The court at Queen’s is at least the equal of Wimbledon in terms of quality, and the atmosphere will be very different from the usually staid one that accompanies the principle warm-up event for the big fortnight. Thanks to Murray, GB and France look well-matched and it could well depend on who wins the doubles rubber on the Saturday. France has seven players in the world’s singles top 50, although some have been affected by injuries this season. However, they will be encouraged by the recent comeback of Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who is their best grass court exponent and looking in decent form after overcoming arm problems. He has done well at Queen’s before but his record is not as impressive as that of Murray, who has won the pre-Wimbledon title three times. Murray said: 'Queen’s will be a perfect venue for our quarter-final match against France. I’ve been playing at Queen’s for ten years now so I feel very at home there as do the rest of the British team, so it’s a great choice. Fingers crossed it’s a memorable summer for British tennis.'

"Jenson Button was denied his 100th race for McLaren after an Energy Recovery System prevented him from making it to the start-line. It capped a miserable weekend for the Briton; his time in Bahrain plagued by reliability issues. Button spent much of the race on Twitter delivering his verdict as the action unfolded. 'Kimi is the man to watch,’ and ‘loving the sparks’, were among his pearls of wisdom, but the tweet which courted the most attention was a rather mischievous one: ‘Ooh is Lewis backing his team mate into Vettel?’ he quizzed after Rosberg accused Hamilton of pulling off such a manoeuvre in China. Jenson Button waves to the crowd ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix which he failed to start . Perhaps a career in the media beckons… . Lewis Hamilton  has out-qualified and finished ahead of Nico Rosberg at every race this season. Indeed Rosberg has now beaten his Mercedes team-mate only once in the 11 races since the pair infamously collided in Belgium last year. Hamilton secured the 36th win of his career in Bahrain and his 21st from pole position. Only Michael Schumacher (40), Ayrton Senna (29) and Sebastian Vettel (27) have more. He also became only the sixth F1 driver to lead 2,000 laps. Nico Rosberg has been left in the shade by Lewis Hamilton who celebrates winning his third race of the year . Kimi Raikkonen secured a record seventh podium finish in Bahrain following his superb late salvo, although the Ferrari driver has never won in the Gulf Kingdom. It was the Finn’s first trip to the rostrum since the 2013 Korean Grand Prix, but his triumph brought a typically deadpan response: ‘You're never happy when you finish second… I'm a bit pleased to get a result.’ Sparks fly off the back of Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari en route to finishing second in Bahrain . Bernie Ecclestone was in the Bahrain paddock this weekend. He denied trying to engineer a deal for Hamilton, out of contract at the end of the season, to join Ferrari despite earlier insisting that such a move would be ‘great’ for the sport. The 84-year-old also confirmed that F1 would be in Azerbaijan for the first time next year, even with concerns surrounding the country’s human rights record. ‘I think everybody seems to be happy,’ Ecclestone said. ‘There doesn't seem to be any big problem there.

"Jenson Button could do no more than 'look at the positives' in the wake of another frustrating day at the wheel of his faltering McLaren. After stopping on track in each of the practice sessions on Friday due to technical issues, Button made it a hat-trick in qualifying for the Bahrain Grand Prix. After just three corners of the Bahrain International Circuit, the 35-year-old ground to a halt with what the team believe to be another electrical issue. Jenson Button was given a lift back to the pits on a motorcycle by a marshal after his engine failure . In first practice on Friday, the engine in Button's car cut out at the first corner of his opening quick lap due to an electrical failure, and then come FP2 a sensor issue forced him to pull over. Racing director Eric Boullier insists the problems are 'unrelated', and 'just glitches stopping the car'. The latest glitch, however, means Button will start the race 20th and last - his lowest grid slot since the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, when he was driving for current power-unit suppliers Honda. In contrast, and on the upside, team-mate Fernando Alonso managed to get a McLaren into Q2 for the first time this season and will start 14th. Describing his emotions, Button said: 'We're racing drivers and you want to drive your racing car as fast as you can. 'Obviously when you are limited to running in P1 and P2, with two stops on the circuit, it's tough. 'But given how things felt this weekend, in terms of driving the car this morning, it felt pretty good. Button jumps out of his McLaren after failing to complete the qualifying session in Bahrain . 'I was quite happy with it. I ended up 11th. It's still only P3, but it was a good feeling. 'With Fernando in qualifying, our best qualifying getting into Q2, you have to look at the positives. 'You would say we're definitely making progress - we're improving every race we go to - but just a tough weekend on my side of the garage.' Alonso finished just four tenths of a second off reaching the top-10 shoot-out, but concedes he needs a helping hand if he is to finish in the points. The double world champion said: 'We're a little closer than any other race this year, but we have to keep our feet on the ground. Fernando Alonso managed to get a McLaren into Q2 for the first time this season . '(On Saturday) we were 14th fastest, so (on Sunday) if nothing happens we will be 14th fastest in the race probably. 'This is not enough to be in the points. We know our limitations are still there, so we will try to do our best. 'Races can change quickly. Some things can happen at the start, with pit stops, so we will take any opportunity we have. 'The main priority is to finish the race, hopefully with both cars, to learn as much as we can with this car. 'The position at the end will depend on many factors, and probably a little bit it depends on the others as well. 'If we want some points probably we need some help.'","Jenson Button suffering a third car failure of the weekend in Bahrain .

"Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has given Azerbaijan the all-clear ahead of its debut next season despite serious concerns over the country's human rights record. Human Rights Watch's 2015 report on the former Soviet republic stated there had been 'a dramatic deterioration in its already poor rights record' particularly in its treatment of opponents of the political regime. However, Ecclestone maintains F1 has conducted its due diligence on Azerbaijan. The capital, Baku, will host a street race to be known as the European Grand Prix. Bernie Ecclestone, speaking in Bahrain, has confirmed Azerbaijan will stage the European Grand Prix . The race will be held in the capital of Baku, despite the country's poor human rights record . Asked whether Azerbaijan's human rights record would be checked, the 84-year-old replied: 'We have. 'I think everybody seems to be happy. There doesn't seem to be any big problem there. 'There's no question of it not being on the calendar. It's going to be another good race.' The sport recently published a 'Statement of Commitment to Respect for Human Rights' that was posted on the formula1.com website. It said: 'The Formula One Group is committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights in its operations globally. 'Whilst respecting human rights in all of our activities, we focus our efforts in relation to those areas which are within our own direct influence.' It added that the sport would also 'identify and assess...any actual or potential adverse human rights impacts with which we may be involved either through our own activities or as a result of our business relationships, including, but not limited to, our suppliers and promoters.' Lewis Hamilton celebrates another victory at the Bahrain Grand Prix . The Mercedes driver has now won three of the opening four races this season . The Human Rights Watch report on Azerbaijan for 2015 was pretty damning. 'The Azerbaijani government escalated repression against its critics, marking a dramatic deterioration in its already poor rights record,' the report states. 'The authorities convicted or imprisoned at least 33 human rights defenders, political and civil activists, journalists, and bloggers on politically motivated charges, prompting others to flee the country or go into hiding. 'Authorities froze the bank accounts of independent civic groups and their leaders, impeded their work by refusing to register foreign grants, and imposed foreign travel bans on some. 'Many of those detained complained of ill-treatment in police custody. Many organisations, including several leading rights groups, were forced to cease activities.' Concerns remain, however, over the Italian Grand Prix, one of the most historic races in F1. Hamilton leads the 2014 Italian Grand Prix, although Monza's future on the circuit is uncertain . Ecclestone is currently negotiating with promoters at Monza over a new contract, with the current one due to expire after next year's race. Officials have made it clear they can no longer afford Ecclestone's terms and are hoping he will reduce his fees. Ecclestone, though, seems unconcerned at losing F1's heartland of Europe as key races such as those at Imola, France and Germany have disappeared. 'We have to wait and see. They don't have an agreement. Bit like Germany really,' said Ecclestone. Suggested to Ecclestone it was unthinkable the race could be dropped, he replied: 'I tell you something, I was told that when we didn't have a race in France actually. And Germany now. We've got some good replacements, haven't we?'","The European Grand Prix will be staged in Azerbaijan next year .

Djokovic had overpowered eight-time champion Rafael Nadal to reach the final, not dropping a set on his 2015 clay-court debut this week. However, the 27-year-old Serb did not have it all his own way in a rain-hit match against Berdych, who had forced a break in the very first game and later rallied to force a deciding set.

"Nico Rosberg is too polite to say what precisely he finds irritating about the team-mate with whom he is locked in the battle of his career. Sitting in an air-conditioned room away from the dry heat of the Bahrain paddock, he goes so far as to say this of Lewis Hamilton: ‘I know exactly how he is functioning. I understand him really, really well. All his attitudes. I can tell why he is doing whatever he is doing. Sometimes he annoys me. Some character traits.’ Go on, then, tell us what it is that gets under your skin. Lewis Hamilton waves after qualifying on pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday . Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg was third six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton . Hamilton has dominated Roberg this season and has got pole in every race during the current campaign . ‘I don’t want to give details,’ says Rosberg, diplomatic to the core. At this point the door of the Mercedes hospitality area, in which Rosberg and I are sitting alone, opens fast and loudly. It is Hamilton invading the quiet of the interview. He turns to face the door he has just walked through and slammed shut, his head down, and shouts in an almost childlike way: ‘Phew, phew, man, it’s hot,’ deporting himself as if he is about to pass out from heat stroke. ‘You see...?’ says Rosberg, his eyebrows arched. The daunting task he faces against his extraordinary team-mate was made vividly clear under the lights in qualifying for Sunday’s Bahrain Grand Prix. Not only will he start behind Hamilton for the fourth consecutive race but behind the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, who is emerging as a putative title contender. ROSBERG'S CORNER . Keke Rosberg . The 1982 world champion attended pre-season testing with friends but rarely goes to races and does not give interviews. Nico said he got his father’s advice before the last race in Abu Dhabi but he generally gives his son space. Vivian Rosberg . Nico’s long-term girlfriend turned wife. She attends a few races, sometimes with a clutch of their long-standing friends, but is happy in the background. She works as an interior designer. Georg Nolte . A popular, mild-mannered former Bild sports journalist, who is Nico’s PR and Man Friday. Tony Ross . Rosberg’s race engineer. His attachment to Rosberg is such that he moved from Williams to Mercedes at the driver’s request. HAMILTON'S CORNER . Anthony Hamilton . Father is rarely seen at races since being dropped as Lewis’s manager but he is still the family patriarch. He established the business side of his son’s career and still controls elements of it. Niki Lauda . The Mercedes chairman is strictly neutral but has a vested interest in Hamilton being successful, having brought him to the team after telling the board he was the driver who could win them the title. Daniel ‘Spinz’ Forrest . Hamilton’s new travelling companion. A music producer, he looks after Hamilton’s social media output. Peter Bonnington . Hamilton’s race engineer. He did the same job for Michael Schumacher. Rosberg’s deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second on Saturday. He is also separated from the Briton by 17 points. But even more separates them as people. Rosberg grew up the son of privilege. His father, Keke, was 1982 world champion. He was brought up in Monaco. He attended a smart international school there. He speaks five languages. But his life is the quiet life. Not for him the Hamilton whirl of red carpets and celebrity acquaintances in Los Angeles. He is not tattooed from chest to leg. While Hamilton courts fame, Rosberg’s dream evening finishes with him and wife, Vivian, staying in to watch an ‘educational documentary’, their yellow Labrador, Bailey, at their side. Family is important. He has known Vivian, an interior designer, since his teenage years. They make smoothies or ‘healthy’ pancakes when they home in Monaco or Ibiza. They gather fresh vegetables from their bio-garden. He relishes a bike ride to the beach for lunch. He loves his classic car — a light blue Mercedes 280SL Pagoda, as perfect as the day it was made in 1970. He bought it without Vivian knowing, but they both enjoy it now. He drives them through the sweeping mountain roads of southern France. Rosberg has a trait rare among modern Formula One drivers: a hinterland. He turned down a place at Imperial College to become a full-time racing driver. If he wins the World Championship this year he will do so with a book under his arm. He is the driver who never stops learning. Having married last year, he and Vivian are expecting their first child in August, during the sport’s summer break. ‘Typical German precision,’ he jokes. ‘I’m very excited and very lucky,’ he says. ‘I just hope it all goes well. There is a link between your personal life and your racing life, naturally.’ But we know he is a nice, intelligent chap, more settled in life than his rival. The point when it comes to winning the most prestigious title in motor racing is whether he has the capacity — the skill and cutting edge — to beat such an extravagant talent as Hamilton, who eclipsed him last year. Rosberg has failed to match Hamilton this season, raising the question whether he will go the way of Mark Webber, who fell away after making his Red Bull team-mate Vettel fight him for his first title. Rosberg’s deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second in qualifying on Saturday . Jenson Button will start his 100th race for McLaren from last on the grid after his ailing machine again gave up on him during qualifying. It was the third time this weekend he had suffered a failure, the latest coming just four corners into his first lap. ‘It was a power cut,’ said Button. ‘I don’t know where it came from.' It is Rosberg who begins work with his engineers earlier and finishes later — and always turns up on time, unlike Hamilton — but genius sometimes makes its own rules. Raw talent is outstripping endeavour. As a barbecue was staged in a paddock here on Friday, he toiled in engineering meetings while the rest of us tucked in. He arrived after a brief stop in Dubai, relaxing and training, before heading to the track to face an inquisition. Why had he criticised Hamilton for slowing down seven days ago in China and thus imperilling Mercedes’ one-two finish? Rosberg answered in a relaxed and courteous manner. ‘Only today have there been millions of questions,’ he tells me once the wider interrogation was over. ‘Other than that I’ve had some distance from it all. I don’t think about it in terms of me getting under his skin or him getting under mine. For both of us it has been annoying to spend so much time on the topic. Hamilton and Rosberg pose together during their unveiling as Mercedes' new team in February 2013 . ‘Lewis and I are going through a difficult period. We cannot totally be friends. We go through ups and downs. We are only speaking when we need to but sometimes we have a laugh together. We have so much to do with each other. We karted together. We are here together. I am not an ice man, either. Things can get to me but I do not get angry. I am rational. You won’t catch me getting very emotional.’ The feud between the two has been running for a year, each upsetting the other in turn, a situation magnified because there has been nobody else with whom to scrap. If Ferrari seriously push their way into the championship contest, that might change somewhat. ‘There are so many experiences that I can build on,’ says Rosberg. ‘Even now when he has taken quite a few points off me and been on a winning streak, I think back to last year when I had my best run after he had won four in a row. Nico's father Keke (left) was also a famous racing driver and won the 1982 Formula One World Championship . ‘I like to push myself. I am not at my peak as a driver, though I am probably close to it. But I have the experience of how to set up the car and deal with the whole world of Formula One. The intra-team stuff, personal relations are helped by last year. It was so valuable.’ Rosberg was born 29 years ago in Wiesbaden, Germany to a German mother, Sina, and his famous Finnish father. He soon moved to Monaco and developed as European polyglot. His solid family background is the bedrock of his life. Hamilton said last year that Rosberg was not as hungry as him because of their different backgrounds, the former being from a council estate in Stevenage and the latter from a plutocrat’s playground. Fair? ‘I had it easy if you think of people who have money struggles in their lives. People reading this may think I had it easy. But I had my personal battles. Even making it to Formula One was not easy; it was a constant challenge and commitment. My whole life has taken a lot of sacrifice. ‘Some people say I am not strong enough to beat Lewis but I have as much belief as ever. I only wouldn’t believe I could beat him if I got to the end of the championship and I had lost. That is not what I want to happen and I am constantly learning to make sure it’s not what happens.’ Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel pipped Rosberg to second in qualifying on Saturday .","Lewis Hamilton qualified in pole position for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix .

But despite frantic work from his McLaren team to get his car ready in time for the race in Sakhir, Button was forced to watch from the sidelines.

"Lewis Hamilton dominated qualifying for the Bahrain Grand Prix – taking pole position under the lights at Sakhir by four-tenths of a second from Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari. Hamilton’s Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who took pole here in the previous two years, was third six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton, a disappointment for the German on a track where he had hoped to rekindle his championship fight. The truth is that nobody can live with Hamilton at the moment. He has got pole in every race this season and been impressively quick in each race.

Hamilton made it four poles out of four this season under the lights at the Sakhir circuit . Rosberg shook Hamilton’s hand afterwards but kept his helmet on for longer than usual at the end of the session, no doubt contemplating how a Ferrari got between Hamilton and him. The last few minutes were dramatic. First Vettel set the fastest time, Rosberg failed to match it, before Hamilton swept to the front commandingly. The double world champion’s smile was broad as he posed for pictures after taking his first pole in Bahrain. Rosberg was disconsolate. Qualifying proved that Ferrari are now in the championship fight, changing the dynamic for Hamilton and particularly Rosberg. Yes, it was pleasantly warm here but not sweltering hot, proving that Ferrari are not only fast in high temperatures. Hamilton in action during Saturday's qualifying session in Bahrain as he takes pole again . Jenson Button’s misery continued. His McLaren broke down with him having done just one sector of one lap. His car was pushed away and he walked back through the paddock. He will start 20th and last – no place to start his 100th race for the team. ‘It was a power cut,’ said Button. ‘I don't know where it came from. It's a shame because after practice we thought the car was doing pretty well.’ Back in the garage Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, shrugged his hands in disappointment. There was a twist of embarrassment to his reaction, too, given that the team’s biggest shareholders are the Bahraini royal family.

"Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene has urged Kimi Raikkonen to prove himself if he wants to remain with the Maranello marque. Raikkonen's contract finishes at the end of the current Formula One season, although there is an option for 2016 providing both parties are in agreement. The Finn stated this week he has never been happier working with a team in his entire F1 career, although his form to date has not matched that of team-mate Sebastian Vettel. Kimi Raikkonen has been urged to improve his performances if he wants to stay at Ferrari . Sparks fly as the Finn overtakes Pastor Maldonado during practice ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix . In particular, Raikkonen has let himself down in qualifying, although has recovered well in the last two races in Malaysia and China to finish fourth. The 35-year-old has certainly shown he has the speed and, given his state of mind, appears keen on staying. According to Arrivabene, however, results have to improve. Ahead of Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix he said: 'You want to know what I said to Kimi?

"Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene has revealed to using a carrot-and-stick method with Kimi Raikkonen to keep his desire to remain with the Maranello marque high. With Lewis Hamilton yet to sign his new contract as he negotiates the finer details with Mercedes, it has been suggested that the 30-year-old will replace Raikkonen at Ferrari for next season.

Raikkonen shakes hands with Hamilton in parc ferme after finishing behind the race winner in Bahrain . Last week Arrivabene urged Raikkonen to raise his game in the wake of an indifferent start to the campaign, certainly compared with team-mate Sebastian Vettel. In Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix, Raikkonen did exactly that, finishing on the podium for the first time in 26 grands prix as runner-up to Hamilton. The performance naturally resulted in Arrivabene being asked as to Raikkonen's chances of staying, given he has an option on his deal for next year, but also whether Ferrari were interested in Hamilton. Arrivabene said: 'Does Lewis Hamilton call you? Because he never calls me. Every driver here in the paddock wants to drive for Ferrari, this is normal, even guys that were quite a lot of the time world champion. 'I'm happy with the drivers we have, but this does not mean I am going to sign with Kimi tomorrow. Nico Rosberg duels for position with Sebastian Vettel heading into Turn 1 during Sunday's race in Bahrain . Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, celebrates his first podium finish since the 2013 Korean Grand Prix . 'We are very clear, I repeat again: I said to Kimi, 'Look, it depends on your performance' and he has demonstrated he's a great driver. 'So if you ask me now ""Does he deserve to renew the option?"" I am going to say yes. But if I am going to say yes, I don't want the driver to fall asleep. I want to keep him awake. Kimi is at his best when he is in a bit in trouble. This is a psychological approach. So the paper (the contract) at the moment is white. Sometimes I have to take the pen, then take it back.' Raikkonen produced his best performance of the season to finish second behind Hamilton . Although Raikkonen managed to split Mercedes duo Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, with Vettel down in fifth, it was not the result practice had suggested as Ferrari appeared stronger on long-run pace than Mercedes. Arrivabene knows Ferrari still have plenty of work to do if they are to keep pace with Mercedes on a regular basis. 'We put together an aggressive strategy, which is exactly what we discussed,' added Arrivabene. 'We recognise the gap we have to Mercedes, so the only way is to be aggressive, even though at this stage you can make a mistake if you are aggressive. 'If one day we are able to catch them, of course the strategy must be put together in a way that is a bit different.'","Lewis Hamilton won Sunday's Barhain Grand Prix ahead of Kimi Raikkonen .

"Nico Rosberg fears the threat from Ferrari in this weekend's Bahrain Grand Prix, describing their pace as 'dangerous' and 'worrying'. Following Friday practice, in particular the evening session under the lights at the Bahrain International Circuit, Mercedes appeared comfortable. Rosberg topped the timesheet with a lap of one minute 34.647secs, finishing 0.115secs quicker than team-mate Lewis Hamilton after the reigning champion locked up in the second sector, costing him four tenths of a second. Nico Rosberg has admitted he's wary of the threat rivals Ferrari pose ahead of Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix . The Mercedes driver was complimentary of Ferrari and described their pace as 'dangerous' and 'worrying' Ferrari duo Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel finished third and fourth quickest, just over half a second adrift of Rosberg. Yet the 29-year-old German, who trails Hamilton by 17 points in the drivers' standings, is deeply concerned by Ferrari from what he witnessed over the course of the two 90-minute sessions. 'We are very quick on one lap again, and Ferrari are very dangerous on the long run,' said Rosberg. 'They have serious pace, which is very worrying. It looks like they are a genuine threat. 'In qualifying we are much quicker, but in the race they are quick. 'Tyre wise, it is pretty straightforward, with both tyres (the soft and medium-compound Pirellis) quite robust. It is just the absolute pace which is important.' Rosberg (left) trails team-mate Lewis Hamilton by 17 points in the drivers' standings ahead of Sunday's race . Barring mistakes it appears another Mercedes front-row lock-out is likely, with the Ferrari's occupying the second row, and from there a battle with strategy and pace. Hamilton has also expressed concerns about Ferrari as he said: 'They are going to be very close. They look very good, from what I can see, in the long run. 'The crucial part is we know we have speed in a qualifying lap, so it's more the speed on the race runs. 'That's an area we're really trying to work on, but other than that the car has been feeling very good, I'm really happy with it.' But the 29-year-old topped the timesheet with a lap of one minute 34.647secs during Friday practice . Vettel, 13 points adrift of Hamilton, endured a disruptive day as a loss of power compromised FP1, whilst a collision with Sergio Perez in his Force India hampered FP2. McLaren's Jenson Button also suffered a wretched day with technical issues in both sessions, resulting in a lack of running that left him down in 19th position, 4.5 seconds behind Rosberg and sandwiched between Manor duo Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi. Saturday could be problematic for all, though, as a sandstorm has been forecast to hit the area at some point during the day.","Nico Rosberg described Ferrari's pace as 'dangerous' and 'worrying'

"Bernie Ecclestone has urged Lewis Hamilton to think the unthinkable — and consider a move from Mercedes to Ferrari. Formula One’s puppeteer, who still pulls virtually every string in the paddock at the age of 84, was speaking after calling Hamilton in for talks at his office in Bahrain. Hamilton, 30, has yet to put pen to paper on a new contract with Mercedes. He says that only small details need finalising, but until the ink is dry there are no guarantees he will stay. Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone with Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain . Nico Rosberg got the better of Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain second practice . Rosberg was slower in sectors one and two of FP2 but a mistake from Hamilton gifted him first place . Hamilton takes a corner in Sakhir, Bahrain ahead of Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel . That leaves the door ajar for Hamilton to team up with Sebastian Vettel at Ferrari to settle which of the pair, who hold six world titles between them, is the better driver. ‘It would be great to see Lewis at Ferrari,’ said Ecclestone ahead of practice for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. ‘Whether Sebastian would want that, I really don’t know. But if Lewis went there, it would be great for the sport — 100 per cent.’ Every racer dreams of driving the red car of Ferrari and, given their improvement in pace this season, they are an attractive proposition. Hamilton is helped given the fact that Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne has admitted privately that he covets the Brit, rating him as the star driver of his generation. Another team principal suggested Ferrari might approach Hamilton’s camp out of mischief to unsettle Mercedes, who remain confident that only legal formalities are delaying them closing the deal. It also remains to be seen if Vettel would veto a move for Hamilton. It is understood that a clause in his contract would allow the German to do so. For now Hamilton is putting his contract negotiations to one side in an attempt to extend his 13-point lead over Vettel in the drivers’ championship. He won a titanic battle at the front in a memorable race here at Bahrain’s Sakhir International Circuit last year against Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton’s confidence is high, a result of being in the form of his life. ‘I’ve almost surprised myself,’ he said. ‘I have been strong and built on last year. I have been adapting to things well. Hamilton suffered a lock-up in the second sector of the Bahrain International Circuit, leaving him in second . Sparks fly from the rear end of Hamilton's Mercedes during a practice session in Bahrain . ‘Winning a second title gives you an extra hop in your walk. I’m enjoying the feeling of the hard work I, and my team, have put in.’ The problem for Rosberg is how to stop a rival who is so confident.

Did the bust-up rattle Hamilton? ‘I just try and laugh it off and let it go over my head,’ he said. ‘It’s irrelevant to the race result. I’m not one to arrive here and think, “I’ve got the upper hand; just keep going”. ‘I feel very strong in my understanding of the car and what I need to get from the tyres. My race craft is still there, race pace is good, and then qualifying has picked up a little bit. That has been a focus for improvement. ‘But even in the last qualifying session my final lap in Q3 was not perfect, so I’ve still got to improve that. ‘Overall I feel that if I remove the power of somebody else to give me confidence or take my confidence away, then I’m never affected.’ Sebastian Vettel had issues throughout the day, eventually finishing the second practice in fourth place .

It was the second time within a year that the rider suffered a similar injury. Jockey Davy Condon suffered spinal concussion in a fall at Aintree during the Grand National this month . Condon had resigned himself to the fact he would be out of action for a lengthy period of time but after seeing a specialist on Wednesday he has been advised to call time on his career. Dr Adrian McGoldrick, chief medical officer of the Irish Turf Club issued a statement on behalf of Condon which read: 'Davy Condon suffered a spinal injury in a fall during the Grand National at Aintree.

"French trainer Freddy Head has favourably compared his 2,000 Guineas hope Ride Like The Wind to last year's fifth-placed runner Charm Spirit, who landed three Group One races in 2014. Ride Like The Wind was one of 34 colts which remain in the first Classic of the season run on Saturday, May 2. Ride Like The Wind won just one of his four starts last season but he has run twice this term, posting a career best on his most recent start when landing the Group Three Prix Djebel by a head. French trainer Freddy Head likens his 2,000 Guineas hope Ride Like The Wind to Charm Spirit . Both the runner-up that day, Make Believe, and the fifth home, Sinfonietta, could reoppose in the Guineas to make it a three-pronged French assault on the 2,000 Guineas. Head said: ‘Ride Like The Wind will run in the 2,000 Guineas. He has done very well since his last race, his work has been good, and I think that he has improved a bit. ‘He is on the same sort of level as Charm Spirit was at this time last year. They are similar horses in that they tend to be a bit keen and if Ride Like The Wind settles better than Charm Spirit did last year I think that he has a good chance. Head says Ride Like The Wind is 'on the same sort of level' as Charm Spirit was at this time last year . ‘That is why I have given him two runs already this season, to get the freshness out of him before the Guineas. 'I was very happy with his Prix Djebel victory. He settled then quickened well and it was to his credit that he won despite being held up at the back of the field when the pace was slow. 'The undulations at Newmarket won’t be a problem for him and although seven furlongs is a good trip for him at the moment I think that he will stay a mile as long as he relaxes.’ The Aidan O’Brien-trained pair of Gleneagles and Highland Reel head the 2,000 Guineas entries. Also still in contention are the three winners of last week’s Classic trials – Kool Kompany (Craven Stakes), Home Of The Brave (Free Handicap) and Muhaarar (Greenham Stakes). Gleneagles and Highland Reel, both trained by Aidan O’Brien, lead the entries for the 2,000 Guineas . Roger Varian’s impressive Newbury winner Intilaaq could still be supplemented to the Guineas. Connections would have to pay £30,000 on Monday to add him to the line-up. One colt who is looking likely to be supplemented to the 2,000 Guineas field is Godolphin's Territories, who has pleased Andre Fabre since winning a Group Three at Longchamp. A statement on Godolphin’s website quoted Fabre as saying: ‘Territories has come out of his trial very well and has come on for the run. At this stage, a supplementary entry in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket is under serious consideration and we are 90% certain to take that route, subject to the horse continuing to please me.’","Ride Like The Wind is one of 34 colts still in the first Classic of the season .

"Jenson Button was left to reflect on 'not a great day' and fears he will again be at the back of the grid for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. Just three minutes into the first practice session, Button's McLaren suffered an electrical fault that cut the engine and forced him into a spin at turn one of the Bahrain International Circuit. Although the car was recovered, his mechanics failed to fix the fault until just before the start of FP2, in which three laps in he had to stop out on track as a safety precaution for the engine. Jenson Button makes his way back to the pits after his McLaren broke down on Friday . Again the car returned to the garage, and although he made it out on track later in the session, further issues arose that compromised his running. The 35-year-old ultimately finished down in 19th place, sandwiched between Manor duo Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi, with the best of his 19 laps almost 4.5 seconds off the pace of Nico Rosberg in his Mercedes. Clearly frustrated Button said: 'The guys worked really hard, from P1 to P2 they did a great job but we still had our problems in P2. 'I went out on the soft tyre but had to quickly come back in, and then I went out on low fuel when everyone else was on high fuel, so it was difficult to get in any running. Overall not a great day. 'There was a lot of useful data from the other car (Fernando Alonso), but the frustrating thing is our cars were set up quite differently to get a lot of useful information about parts, and we weren't able to do that on our car. 'It doesn't help either of us for Saturday but hopefully we've resolved the issues I've had.' Team members recover Button's McLaren in the pit-lane during the first free practice . Button, though, knows the teams ahead of a struggling McLaren will all turn up the gas in qualifying, which is likely to leave only the Manor boys behind the Briton and Alonso, as was the case in China on Sunday. 'I think some teams were on high fuel all day as well, so it's not going to be an easy weekend,' added Button. 'But we're not kidding ourselves, we know it's going to be a tricky qualifying session and I suppose for us at the moment we're going to qualify near the back. 'In reality it's not such a problem. The race pace is something that is more important.'","Jenson Button's McLaren suffered electrical fault in first practice session .

"Robbie McNamara is feeling 'great and optimistic' as he continues to recover from serious injuries suffered in a fall at Wexford.

I'd be hoping when all that swelling and bruising goes down, some of the nerve damage might repair and some feeling might come back. 'I'm very active every day. I'm doing physio already and working on balance and reflexes. 'I can't do a whole pile as I broke eight ribs and cracked six vertebrae as well, so I can't do anything very strenuous.

I've no negative thoughts whatsoever. 'It was my first time out of the bed (on Tuesday). It was a surprise I was allowed to go outside, it went grand and it was a beautiful day for it.

"Retiring AP McCoy has confirmed he will ride to the final race at Sandown on Saturday if he can secure mounts. There had been speculation that the soon-to-be-crowned 20-time champion jockey would end his career after riding in the AP McCoy Celebration Chase, in which he definitely partners Mr Mole, or the feature Bet365 Gold Cup. But there is now a good chance his final mount as a professional jockey will come in the handicap hurdle run at 5.35. AP McCoy has confirmed he will ride to the final race at Sandown on Saturday if he can secure mounts . McCoy's boss, JP McManus, has Jonjo O'Neill-trained Box Office in the race while O'Neill also has entered Champagne Present. Both would be appropriately named last ever rides for the peerless champion. McCoy told Racemail: 'I will not stop. I will ride anything JP runs and, after that, any rides offered. But it won't be until Friday morning until everything is sorted out.' John Ferguson-trained Aqalim, a winner at Cheltenham last week, looks another prospective mount for McCoy in the Listed Select Hurdle. With top weight On His Own now bound for next week's Punchestown Festival and Paul Nicholls-trained Rocky Creek, the next highest rated, still not certain to run, there remains a chance the weight of O'Neill-trained Lost Legend will rise sufficiently for McCoy to ride him in the Bet365 Gold Cup.

"Arsenal legend Ian Wright has been confirmed as the man who will present AP McCoy with his 20th and final champion jockeys trophy at Sandown on Saturday. Track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club which the retiring rider fervently supports. Wright, who had seven seasons at Arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book, will hand over McCoy’s trophy before travelling back into London to present his BBC5Live radio phone in. AP McCoy will be presented with his final champion jockeys trophy by Ian Wright at Sandown on Saturday . Wright (centre) is now a television pundit but played for Arsenal during his years as a professional . McCoy is a huge Arsenal supporter and has been invited to attend a home game before the end of the season . Sandown initially tried to secure Thierry Henry to be the Arsenal celebrity to hand over the trophy to McCoy. But his Sky employers vetoed the move. A request to secure another Arsenal legend in Tony Adams also proved logistically impossible because he currently manages Gabala in Azabaijan. A Sandown spokesman said; ‘Tony wanted to do it but his side are playing on Friday night and he just could not get back on time. Tony’s wife will be at Sandown on Saturday along with Ian and his wife.’ Another famous Arsenal name expected at Sandown is Liam Brady, one of McCoy’s sporting heroes from his childhood. Wright was a player for Arsenal as a striker for seven years, from 1991 until 1998 . Iconic Arsenal striker Thierry Henry (centre) was asked to present the award but Sky did not allow it .

"A bruising training session involving 50 scrums is how Tom Wood’s Northampton prepared for Saturday’s top-of-the-table meeting with Saracens. The Champions have creaked in recent weeks and England flanker Wood, who claims Saints’ opponents have ‘smelt blood’, is desperate to re-gather the momentum that was lost following the exodus of key international players during the RBS 6 Nations. Defeats by Clermont and Exeter have done little to restore confidence but the East Midlands side are ready to address their mini-slump and breathe life back into the title push. Northampton flanker Tom Wood is keen for his side to regain their form following some recent poor results . The Saints were dumped out of the Champions Cup quarter-finals as Clermont ran riot on their home turf . ‘I don’t think anyone intentionally switches off, but the intensity of a Six Nations camp like that is very difficult to manage,’ said Wood. ‘Some people think you’re away at a five-star holiday resort but the pressure is real. It’s a couple of per cent across the board. ‘You might win it and be partying or you might have lost and come back with a lack of confidence. Then the guys who have stayed back in the trenches for Saints feel like the cavalry have arrived. In fact, the guys coming back are equally tired or even more so. It’s a combination of things and it’s difficult to manage. ‘Now there’s light at the end of the tunnel and we’re not far off full strength. It’s the home straight.’ Saturday’s showpiece fixture will be staged at stadiummk, rather than Franklin’s Gardens, and a record attendance is expected at the home of MK Dons. Northampton’s scrummaging pride was dented in the defeat by Exeter and, according to Wood, the players have paid the price with gruelling fitness sessions. ‘We’ve had to speak a few hard truths and take a good look at ourselves,’ said Wood. ‘Teams have smelt blood a little bit. The last couple of teams have really got into us and pressured us at the scrum, which is something we pride ourselves on. ‘When you give them an in, the fear factor goes all of a sudden and the reputation can dwindle quickly. We’ve got to plug that hole if we really want to be title challengers. You don’t win a Premiership without a strong scrum and set piece. Jim Mallinder's side have been boosted by the return of England lock Courtney Lawes . ‘We’ve definitely been knocked off our rhythm but I don’t think we’ve played well for a long time. Winning can paper over a lot of problems and mask a lot of issues.’ But Saints’ season is still very much alive. They will almost guarantee a home play-off with victory while, in contrast, Harlequins campaign will be over if they lose to Sale. The west London club also felt the squeeze of the Six Nations and they must win at the AJ Bell Stadium to keep alive their slim hopes of Champions Cup qualification. Harlequins full back Ugo Monye (centre) is hanging up his boots at the end of the season . For winger Ugo Monye, who lines up against Mark Cueto this afternoon as both players prepare to hang up their boots, it is the last chance to leave his childhood club with European rugby. ‘I’m not going to be here next season but I want to finish in the best possible way,’ said Monye. ‘It’s hard to get your head around 14 years coming to an end, because I’ve been here since I finished school and it’s all I’ve known. I might be locking horns with Mark Cueto, who’s also retiring, this weekend and it will be just as competitive as the first time I faced him.’ GLOUCESTER v NEWCASTLE (SATURDAY: Kingsholm, 3pm) Dan Robson and Billy Burns form a new half-back pairing for the hosts, in a reshuffled side led by Billy Twelvetrees.

"Aviva Premiership club Gloucester will face a Rugby Football Union hearing after selecting lock Mariano Galarza for their league game against Sale Sharks last month. The RFU has said Galarza should have been ineligible for the match. In a statement, the RFU said: 'In the Aviva Premiership rugby match against Sale Sharks on March 29, Gloucester Rugby breached Aviva Premiership Rugby regulation 3.3(a) by selecting a player (Mariano Galarza) who did not hold effective registration for Gloucester Rugby.

"England centre Manu Tuilagi is taking his rehabilitation 'week by week' as the powerhouse midfielder continues his recovery from a troublesome groin injury that has sidelined him for most of the season. Tuilagi has been out of action since October and missed the autumn internationals as well as England's entire RBS 6 Nations campaign - but the 23-year-old is targeting a return to action in the summer in time for his country's pre-World Cup preparations. 'The injuries coming along well,' Tuilagi told Kicca.com. Manu Tuilagi has not featured for England since the three-Test summer tour of New Zealand in 2014 . 'I'm doing this training at St Georges Park. Training in the altitude chamber trying to speed up my fitness. I'm taking it week by week - I haven't got a set date for a goal that I need to be fit and a time that I need to be fit in time for.' Tuilagi's last appearance in an England shirt was during the three-Test summer tour of New Zealand in 2014. The Tigers three-quarter impressed throughout the series and looked set to have a stellar season in 2015 before he picked up the injury playing against Ulster in October. Leicester Tigers centre Tuilagi has been out of action since his picked up a groin injury in October . Tuilagi has struggled with the injury all season with Richard Cockerill, Tigers' director of rugby, recently confirming that the England star was highly unlikely to play any rugby this campaign. 'I thought I was out for eight weeks originally,' Tuilagi explained. 'And then I had a scan again later on and they said ""It's very bad"" - I split my pubus and... it's been tough since then. It's been very frustrating watching your team-mates (from the sideline). You can't do anything about it - all you have to do is your rehab and recovery.' Tuilagi's absence has allowed other players to stake their claim in England's midfield with Bath's Jonathan Joseph filing the number 13 with aplomb during the championship. 'JJ had a brilliant Six Nations and is a fantastic player. There's a lot of competition in the team but it's always been that way. Your spot in the team is never set; if you don't perform well, you'll lose your spot and that's just the way it is.' Bath centre Jonathan Joseph flourished at outside centre for England in the RBS 6 Nations . England will begin their preparations for the World Cup with a two-week training camp at Pennyhill Park in early July. The squad will then embark on a trip to Colorado in Texas for a fortnight of high-intensity training at high-altitude before returning for three warm-up games against France (twice) and Ireland prior to the tournament - and Tuilagi is hoping to be back in the mix for selection by then. 'When you get injured, that's when you realise how much you love the game,' Tuilagi added. 'Sometimes you forget that when you're playing a lot. I just can't wait to get back.'","Manu Tuilagi has been out of action since October .

"England full back Mike Brown is still showing signs of concussion and may not play again until the World Cup warm-up matches in August. Nine weeks after being knocked out in the RBS 6 Nations Test against Italy, Brown is still suffering from headaches and has taken no part in training or team meetings since he returned to Harlequins. Conor O'Shea, Harlequins director of rugby, has ruled the 29-year-old out of Saturday's Aviva Premiership match against Sale and he is not expected to face Bath the following week. England star Mike Brown could miss the rest of the season after failing to recover from concussion . Brown was taken off after clashing with Italy's Andrea Masi during the Six Nations match in February . Brown has continued to suffer headaches nine weeks after his injury and has been advised not to play . 'He has headaches throughout the day,' explained O'Shea. 'He's frustrated because he wants to help his team-mates. What's even more frustrating is he can't contribute in meetings. He can't even be in the room to help people because we're sending him home to get himself right. I want to see Mike Brown right when he is in his 50s, not when he is in his prime.' Brown was knocked cold in an accidental collision during England's 47-17 victory over Italy at Twickenham in February and forced to leave the field. He missed the next game against Ireland but played against Scotland and in the championship decider against France after which he admitted he 'didn't feel quite right'. Assuming Harlequins do not reach the Champions Cup play-offs, Brown's last chance to feature before the end of the season will be in the final-round fixture against Newcastle. 'You can't rule out the possibility that he might not play again this season,' said O'Shea. 'Do I think he'll be right for Bath? I don't think so. Do I think we're looking at Newcastle? Yes, but if he's not right then, he's not right.' Feb 14: Knocked out in 13th minute of England's RBS 6 Nations fixture against Italy following huge collision with Andrea Masi. Feb 25: Ruled out of England's Test against Ireland after failing to come through the necessary safety tests. Mar 14: Played 76 minutes in England's Calcutta Cup victory over Scotland. Mar 21: Played full game in England's final-round victory over France. Mar 23: Stood down by club medical staff on day of his return to Harlequins. Cleared to have a week-long holiday in Dubai to aid recovery. Mar 28: Sidelined for Aviva Premiership match against Saracens. Apr 11: Sidelined for Aviva Premiership match against Gloucester. Brown, who is not even allowed to train on an indoor bike until he is symptom free, is England head coach Stuart Lancaster's first-choice full back going into the World Cup and O'Shea backs the player to regain his form quickly. England play a double-header against France in August, before facing Ireland in their third and final warm-up fixture in September. 'He'll have the World Cup warm-ups and he'll be fine,' said O'Shea. 'The World Cup is not an issue at all. Mentally, Mike Brown is unflappable and will just get on with it. With your England hat on, you might say this enforced break is the best thing for his limbs. What he's been told to do is take complete and utter rest. We normally have to pull him away from extra training but he'll look back on this window and learn from it. 'He will not undergo a normal return to play procedure now — it will be a more extensive procedure. It's not about Quins; it's about Mike. As a club, we've looked after the player and didn't have a second thought about standing him down the Monday he came in. This isn't like the old days — it's not a badge of honour to play on any more.' Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea says that he does not blame the England for Brown's injury . Having played only six of Quins' last 19 fixtures, brown will gain valuable game time in the England preparation games. It raises the question as to whether he was rushed back too early, although O'Shea does not lay any blame at England's door. 'I'm not remotely frustrated at them,' said O'Shea. 'Mike was honest enough to pull himself out from the Irish game and everyone has a duty of care towards the player. 'Even a slight intimation that anyone does not look after the player's best interests is just wrong.'

"England and Wales are facing a new World Cup threat after Australia performed a U-turn aimed at drafting Matt Giteau back into the Wallabies squad. The master playmaker has been an outstanding force for Toulon in the French club's back-to-back Heineken Cup triumphs and Top 14 title success last season. Now, four years after his Test career appeared to be over when he was left out for the last World Cup, the 32-year-old has discovered that he is eligible to play for the Wallabies again. Toulon fly half Matt Giteau (left) takes on Leinster centre Ian Madigan during the Champions Cup semi-final . Former Wallabies Drew Mitchell (left) and Giteau have been integral to Toulon's European dominance . Giteau has not featured for Australia since he missed out on selection for the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand . Like England, Australia had a policy of not picking anyone who plays abroad. But Giteau's supreme form for Toulon led to a clamour for him to be recalled and on Wednesday the ARU announced a change which is seemingly tailor-made for the man once known as Kid Dynamite. With immediate effect, Australia will pick 'elite' players based abroad — providing they have 60 caps and seven years of professional service at home. At a stroke, the Wallabies have gained more experience and firepower for the World Cup, while their Pool A rivals England and Wales have extra cause for concern. Former England lock Nick Kennedy was a Toulon team-mate during the victorious 2012-13 European campaign and the London Irish academy director told Sportsmail: 'When I turned up at Toulon there were many excellent players, but the one guy who stood head and shoulders above the rest was Matt Giteau. AUSSIES WHO CAN PLAY . Matt Giteau (Toulon): Can operate at No 10 or centre. Has excelled in France and craves another shot. Drew Mitchell (Toulon): The 31-year-old former Reds and Waratahs wing has 30 tries in his 63 Test appearances. George Smith (Lyon): Openside with 111 caps was last picked by the Wallabies for 2013 decider against the Lions. ENGLAND STARS WHO CAN'T . Nick Abendanon (Clermont Auvergne): On shortlist for European Player of the Year award. Steffon Armitage (Toulon): Reigning European Player of the Year and having another superb campaign. Toby Flood (Toulouse): Usurped by Owen Farrell in the England team, the rise of George Ford has left him off the radar. 'I had watched him play for years but seeing him in training, seeing what he could do, was a shock. He is just so talented and is still one of the best players in the world. 'His ability is incredible, as is his decision-making. He's still got pace, his passing is so accurate and he's got a great kicking game. Defensively he gets stuck in, too. He's a great all-round player and, if anything, he has improved from spending time in France. He can do it all.' Giteau himself greeted the announcement from Down Under on Wednesday by tweeting: 'Massive news re policy change. The ultimate honour to represent your country, however form still must warrant selection.' That shouldn't be an issue. His Toulon team-mate, Drew Mitchell, is another Australian who could find himself back in World Cup contention but his initial reaction was to champion Giteau's claims. 'The fact he is not only playing in Europe but dominating it for a number of years — he not only would be able to handle Test rugby, he'd add a great deal of value in the World Cup squad,' said Mitchell . Ex-Toulon lock Nick Kennedy considers his former team-mate Giteau one the best players in the world . The ARU decision has been made in response to an exodus of leading lights to Europe. There are potential implications for the clubs who have recruited these players, who may now be called upon for Test duty rather than being able to commit themselves fully to their new employers throughout the season. That in turn may lead to renewed club v country tension, but not in the case of Harlequins, who have signed Australia lock and former captain James Horwill. 'It's not an issue for us,' said Conor O'Shea, Quins' director of rugby. 'We never want our players to turn their backs on playing for their country and there are windows for that. If the Wallabies wanted to pick James, that's great.' James Horwill (above) has recently signed for Harlequins but will still be eligible to play for the Wallabies . Australia's revised stance will lead to further calls for the RFU to relax their policy against picking players based abroad but Northampton's England flanker Tom Wood on Wednesday echoed comments by Tom Youngs of Leicester about the threat to squad unity and morale if the 'exceptional circumstances' clause is invoked to call up the likes of Steffon Armitage from Toulon. 'I am not against it in principle but I wouldn't like us to back-pedal on that now,' he said. 'It could have an effect on the team and undermine some of the togetherness we have built. 'If people start to lose faith and think there is an imbalance, then people aren't pulling in the same direction.' Tom Wood (right) believes Stuart Lancaster should still not select overseas players such as Steffon Armitage .","Australia have relaxed their policy on selecting overseas players .

"It may be another 149 days until England begin their World Cup campaign against Fiji at Twickenham, but England assistant coach Andy Farrell can already feel the excitement building across the country. Stuart Lancaster’s side will take on the South Sea Islanders in the World Cup curtain-raiser on September 18 at England HQ in a tournament that will encompass 48 matches spread across 44 days of action. ‘Rugby is going to be the sport of the year with the World Cup coming up,’ said Farrell. Andy Farrell says rugby union is going to be the sport of the year with the World Cup coming up in England . ‘It's as though the tournament is going to start in a few weeks’ time. If it’s already like it is now, I think we'll never have seen anything like it come World Cup time. The important thing on the back of that is obviously seizing the opportunity for the legacy after it. ‘I've absolutely no doubt that this is going to be the biggest World Cup ever. You go to places like Gloucester or Exeter; you see the buzz around the place because they know it's coming. It's going to be fantastic.’ England came within six points of claiming the RBS 6 Nations following their pulsating 55-35 victory against France on the final day of the championship – as Ireland secured a second successive title on points difference. It was the fourth consecutive time that England had finished second in the championship, but Farrell saw plenty of positives with international rookies like Jonathan Joseph, Anthony Watson and George Ford impressing throughout while established campaigners such as Ben Youngs and Billy Vunipola looked rejuvenated. ‘Coming into the World Cup, we're in a great place,’ Farrell explained. ‘There were a few injuries before the Six Nations and people got their opportunity. A lot of people took those opportunities. We're fortunate now that when we pick a 31-man squad; all these guys will have had some experience at international level. ‘Not just experience, but in pressure situations like the French game for example. We’re certainly going to have a squad full of people that can certainly cope in this environment.’ The England assistant coach says England are in great shape ahead of the tournament this summer . England will begin their preparations for the tournament with a two-week training camp at Pennyhill Park in early July. The squad will then embark on a trip to Colorado in Texas for a fortnight of high-intensity training at high-altitude before returning for three warm-up games against France (twice) and Ireland prior to the tournament. England must name a 31-man World Cup squad by August 31 and Farrell admits that some tough selection calls lay ahead. ‘The first train-on squad, we could pick up to 50 players. There'll be good players disappointed that they've not got into that squad! ‘Imagine taking it down to 31 - there's going to be a lot of players, good players, missing out on what is dream playing in a home World Cup so it's a big thing for us selection because you've got to get it right… it's so important. ‘We're together for at least three months before the competition starts which will hopefully be seven weeks long for us so it's a hell of a long time together so we have to make sure that we break it up.’ It doesn’t get any easier once the tournament begins as England will look to qualify from a group that also contains Test heavyweights Australia and Wales. England missed out on the Six Nations title despite an impressive victory against France . Farrell (right) says Stuart Lancaster (left) has some tough decisions to make in terms of selection . Home advantage may prove decisive and Farrell cites the Twickenham factor as a major fillip for his side ahead of the tournament. ‘Obviously, Twickenham's our home. It's a bit of a fortress for us. We play very well here. The crowd always gets behind us. They are the 16th man. We've been fortunate over the last three years. You can't actually nail your hat on which was the best atmosphere now because there's been so many of them. ‘The New Zealand game, all the Welsh games, the Irish games or the last game here (against France) - they're all pretty special. Following their meetings with Fiji, Australia and Wales at Twickenham, England will play their final Pool A game against minnows Uruguay at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester. And Farrell, who was born and bred in Wigan, is thrilled that England are venturing out of the capital during the tournament. ‘It's going to be great for us to get up north because there's a lot of northerners in our side anyway,’ Farrell added. ‘It'll be great to get back to our roots and show the people of Manchester what it's about as well. We want to feel the buzz around the whole country behind us not just people down here.’ Farrel says the home crowd will be vital at Twickenham at the World Cup .

"The Australian Rugby Union reacted to the flood of top players heading abroad on Wednesday with a groundbreaking policy shift which will allow experienced Wallabies playing at foreign clubs to be selected for test matches. Effective immediately, players with 60 caps who have held professional contract with Australian Rugby for at least seven years will be eligible to continue their international careers even if they are signed to a club overseas. Other players based abroad will immediately become eligible if they commit to playing Super Rugby in Australia for the following two seasons.

'While we do not belief these policy changes are a silver bullet, we do believe that they represent a positive step towards delivering the outcomes we want.' Flyhalf Matt Giteau and winger Drew Mitchell, who both play for Toulon, as well as flanker George Smith, who also plays in France, would immediately qualify to play at the World Cup later this year. Wallabies Will Genia, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Nic White, Peter Betham, Sekope Kepu and James Horwill are all off to European clubs for next year, while Wycliff Palu is decamping to Japan. Media reports on Wednesday said flyhalf Quade Cooper was on the verge of signing for Toulon and two other high profile Wallabies backs, Israel Folau and Kurtley Beale, have yet to commit to the ARU beyond the end of the season. George Smith is currently a flanker for Lyon and would be eligible to play for Australia again . James Horwill is set to leave the Reds to join Harlequins in England next season .

'It is deliberately a high number,' Pulver added. 'It ensures only the truly elite players overseas will be eligible and it provides real incentive for younger elite players to stay in Australia longer in order to meet that threshold.' The ARU's parlous financial position -- losses of £3.26million for 2014 were announced this week -- has made it hard for them to counter offers from wealthy European clubs. Pulver said the ARU was going to be more aggressive about repatriating players in the future and hoped the new policy would make Australians less attractive to foreign clubs. 'I think to some extent historically, foreign clubs have looked at Australian talent as an easy target because of the policy we had,' he said. 'With World Rugby's Regulation Nine, we clearly have the capability to pull them out of club competition to play international rugby and maybe they'll think twice about recruiting some of these players.'

"England's Joe Root has every hope the team can kick on and win the second Test against West Indies, after his first overseas century headlined a positive day for the visitors. Root's unbeaten 118 came with England posting a 74-run lead at the end of day three, while the score of 373 for six was also down to some impressive batting from England's top order. Captain Alastair Cook got 76 in a century stand with Jonathan Trott (59) at the top before Gary Ballance's 77 boosted his 165-run partnership with Root, making it a very happy St George's Day in St George's, Grenada.

The end of the day was slightly marred by the loss of three quick wickets, with Ballance, Moeen Ali and Ben Stokes departing deep into the final session, leaving Jos Buttler (four) to start day four alongside Root. When asked about England's chances of victory, Root told Sky Sports: 'Absolutely. We've got plenty of batting left in that dressing room. 'Build a partnership with Jos tomorrow morning and hopefully we get a big score and only have to bat once.

'(We) had a blip towards the end there but there is still plenty of batting left in that dressing room and fingers crossed we can kick on and make a big first innings score.' Root's personal effort was also his sixth Test century - his first came on home territory at Headingley in 2013 against New Zealand, a side he could well be facing later this year. The Yorkshireman added: 'I'm just trying to score as many runs as I can each time. The more I can make over a hundred, the better. 'I feel good. My movements are very good at the minute. You go through blips (in your career) and the key now for me is to score as many as I can while I have this going for me.' Ben Stokes is given a salute send-off by his West Indian rival Marlon Samuels after holing out for eight runs . Trott answered some of the criticisms levelled at him after he struggled on his Test comeback in Antigua, but was still after more. 'Alastair and I were really pleased to put on a good start but I'm sure both of us are disappointed we couldn't go on and make a bigger score,' he said. 'You don't spend all those hours in the nets to get fifties, you go there to get match defining hundreds. 'But we get on pretty well, we've got a goods understanding in the middle and it was nice to get back in the groove.'","Joe Root hit 118 not out to help England into a 74-run lead on day three .

"Alastair Cook hung his head in disbelief after wasting a golden opportunity to end his long wait for a century before the man who seems destined to succeed him as England captain showed how to do it. There was agony for Cook on the third day of the second Test as he again fell short of the magic three figures despite looking as solid and unflustered at the crease as at any time in the two years since his last century. But the problems Cook had in finding fluency in his 211-ball 76 were put into stark perspective by yet another display of the rare class and maturity that has made Joe Root England’s outstanding batsman. Joe Root celebrates his century and is 118 not out at stumps on day three of the second Test against the West Indies . England's Root smashes a short ball to the boundary as West Indies keeper and captain Denesh Ramdin can only watch on . Root plays confidently off the back foot through the offside during a commanding innings once he got his chance on day three . Root and Gary Ballance run between wickets as they easily work the West Indian bowling around on a hot day in Grenada . Ben Stokes is giving a salute send-off by his West Indian rival Marlon Samuels after holing out for eight runs . This has been another slow, attritional Test in conditions that are hardly conducive to entertaining cricket. Yet as soon as Root took guard, batting at Grenada’s National Stadium was suddenly taken to another level. There were no problems for the Yorkshireman in reaching three figures — his sixth Test century and his first overseas — and his average has now reached a hundred since his return to the England team last summer. Here he took advantage of the solid platform that had been painstakingly laid by Cook and Jonathan Trott to give England a chance of going on to the sort of total that could put pressure on West Indies on the final day. Only a late burst of madness which saw Moeen Ali run himself out and Ben Stokes hit a Devendra Bishoo long-hop straight down deep square leg’s throat spoilt England’s day. They ended on 373 for six, a lead of 74, and Root and Jos Buttler will have to stick around for as long as possible on Friday if England are going to dictate terms.

Jermaine Blackwood clutches onto an edge from Trott off the bowling of Devendra Bishoo to end the opener's innings . Trott appears disappointed after the conditions appeared to favour the batsmen after they'd done the hard work early on . Root ’s fastest hundred for England, coming from 125 balls and including 13 fours, two sixes. This is his sixth Test century for his country. First 100 scored overseas. His previous high was 87 in Adelaide against Australia in 2013. In the past year he has scored four Test centuries . Root is the fifth England batsman  to score six consecutive 50s in Test innings. Since June 2014 he has scored 1,037 runs, averaging 103.7 . Root has featured in five of England’s past six Test partnerships of 150-plus runs. Alastair Cook has gone 34 innings and 697 days without a Test ton. Root said: ‘We had a blip towards the end but there is still plenty of batting left in that dressing room and fingers crossed we can kick on. Build a partnership with Jos tomorrow morning and hopefully we get a big score and only have to bat once. ‘My movements are very good at the minute. You go through blips in your career and the key now for me is to score as many as I can while I have this going for me.’ While Root was the star of the day, this was hardly a failure for an England captain who has now made four scores of 70-plus in his last seven Test innings, but Cook would have given anything to have been able to add those extra, elusive 24 runs. The brutal reality is that only Mike Brearley among England captains and opening batsmen has gone longer without a hundred than Cook’s 34 innings and he had the advantage of being considered the best leader of them all. It is now 697 days since Cook made the last of his record 25 Test centuries, at Headingley against New Zealand way back in 2013 when everything seemed well with the world of England and their captain. Here Cook and Trott recorded England’s first century opening partnership for 31 innings as England went about their quest for a decisive lead in workmanlike fashion on a slow pitch and an even slower outfield. The second-slowest half-century of Trott’s career, which was reached off 137 balls, was also one of the most important for a man who was in almost as great a need of runs as Cook after his double failure in Antigua. If Trott’s wicket came almost out of the blue when he drove the leg-spin of Bishoo to second slip then Cook seemed sure to make this the day when he finally threw off any doubts about him at the helm for another Ashes. Not only had he been dropped on 29 on the second evening but  he survived an lbw shout on 65 on Thursday by a whisker when the deserving Bishoo saw his review of Steve Davis’ not out decision deemed umpire’s call. Just when Cook was looking at his best after lunch, Shannon Gabriel went round the wicket, bowled short and wide and somehow forced Cook to inside edge an attempted cut into his stumps. He stood for a moment, hunched over his bat, before trudging off with a score worth perhaps 20 more because of the slowness of the outfield but one that to Cook will seem not nearly enough. Trott summed up the mood of frustration, saying: ‘Alastair and I were really pleased to put on a good start but you don’t spend all those hours in the nets to get fifties, you go there to get match-defining hundreds.’ When Ian Bell also chopped on to Gabriel, a sure sign of a slow surface, West Indies were back in the match and England’s nerves were starting to fray. Yet that was to underestimate the extraordinary potential of the two exciting and prolific young Yorkshire batsmen in England’s middle order. The lack of touch and confidence that Gary Ballance displayed in the World Cup now looks light years away as he has returned to the Test form that made him the ICC’s emerging player of 2014. Ballance made 122 in Antigua and carried on here, bringing an urgency to England’s innings that was lacking when they managed just 69 runs in an extended morning session. Cook stands and waits for the result of a West Indies decision review after an LBW appeal was judged not out by the on-field umpire . Cook is lucky the umpire gave him not out initially after the ball pitched outside off and hit in line but was only just clipping the stumps .

Gabriel and his team-mates celebrate as Cook leans on his bat in disappointment after being dismissed for 76 . Cook trudges off the field after a solid innings that ultimately fell short of an elusive hundred for the left-handed opener . But if Ballance was busy then Root roistered along, reaching 50 off 69 balls and 100 off 125. He has been a class apart almost from the moment England recalled him, after leaving him out of the last Test of their Ashes humiliation, and restored him to the middle order where he belongs. This was his England record-equalling sixth successive Test score of 50 or more, a landmark shared with Patsy Hendren, Ted Dexter, Ken Barrington and Cook himself. No Englishman has ever made seven in succession. At least not until Root bats again. Together, Root and Ballance took England beyond West Indies’ score after tea and added 165 before Marlon Samuels found a way through Ballance. The late flurry of activity, culminating in Stokes being given a salute as a send-off by his bete noire Samuels, reduced England’s chances of going to Barbados next week one up. But while there is Root, there is hope. A second drag-on for the St George's Day play came for England No 4 Ian Bell, who also cut Gabriel onto his off stump .

And West Indies great Curtly Ambrose, now the bowling coach, insisted afterwards that the eccentric Samuels was just having a bit of fun. ‘I didn’t really see it, but there’s nothing wrong with a little banter in international cricket,’ said Ambrose. ‘As long as it doesn’t go over the top I’m fine with it. I think it’s more friendly. He gave a salute? Is that a sign of respect, I don’t know. 'That's something that we don't really preach. We always make sure that we tell the guys to keep it clean, and keep it within a certain range, and don't go over the top. 'International cricket is hard, and they must find ways to relax themselves, and smiling is one of those things. As much as we're working hard and want to win, you must have some fun doing it. You've got to enjoy what you are doing. ‘I’m hoping it was light-hearted because we always make sure we tell the guys to keep it clean and don’t go over the top. I don’t think Marlon meant anything by it. You have to find ways to relax and have fun.’ The gesture was seen as good 'banter' by Geoffrey Boycott in commentary for BBC's Test Match Special. Boycott said: 'The Samuels salute was all right because it is banter and fun. It is not punishable — it was funny.' Stokes doesn't get a full piece of an innocuous delivery from Bishoo and skies his shot into the outfield . Stokes looks on in hope as the ball floats into the safe hands of Blackwood, who took his second catch . After the pair clashed in Windies' first innings while Samuels got 103, the all-rounder gave Stokes a slaute . Graeme Swann said immediately after the day's play that while not the biggest fan of Samuels the gesture made him laugh. 'He can be an absolute tool sometimes but I have to admit Marlon Samuels just made me laugh tea out of my nose with his saluting send off,' Swann wrote on Twitter. 'Heavy money on @benstokes38 getting Marlon out in the 2nd dig. Eng should line up a guard of honour for him. Love to see humour on the field.'

"Stuart Broad backed Alastair Cook to hit the Test century that has eluded him for 33 innings on Thursday and put England in a winning position in the second Test. Broad produced his best and quickest bowling since knee surgery last year to take three wickets for 19 here in Grenada before a defiant last wicket stand of 52 from Devendra Bishoo and Shannon Gabriel lifted West Indies to 299. Then Cook, fighting for his captaincy in this series, and the under pressure Jonathan Trott joined forces to hit their first half-century partnership as an opening pair and reach 74 without loss by the close of a rain-affected second day.

Captain Alastair Cook, who won the toss and chose to bowl, worked his way to 37 not out at stumps . Broad backs Cook to go onto a big hundred and get his side in a winning position with three days left . When Cook reached 17 of his unbeaten 37 he went past Alec Stewart to become the second highest run-scorer in England's Test history and now only his mentor in Graham Gooch stands ahead of him. 'He's been an amazing performer for eight or nine years now,' said Broad. 'And he's such a level headed character that you never know whether he's got nought or 200 if you bumped into him in the evening. 'Cooky won't be thinking about personal landmarks now. He knows if he gets a big hundred tomorrow he will set his team up with a fantastic chance of getting a result and it was great to see Cook and Trott back together again. Hopefully they can score a lot more runs tomorrow.' Broad revealed that a chat with new bowling coach Ottis Gibson and a change of technique led him to add 10 miles per hour to his bowling overnight and look back to his best. Cook plays a shot to the legside as he found some form on a rain-interrupted day two at St George's . Broad celebrates the wicket of West indies captain Denesh Ramdin, who was caught behind on 31 . 'I made a slight change overnight after watching quite a lot of footage of how I got my wickets and I was a bit wider on the crease which allowed my momentum to go straight through,' said Broad, who touched 91 miles per hour when bowling a beauty to take Denesh Ramdin's wicket. 'It seemed to work and I was really pleased with how I bowled today.' Despite some momentum in the favour of Cook's side, Broad admits England are battling both the weather and an at time defiant West Indies as they look to force victory. With unpredictable forecasts around, Broad knows only full days of cricket and a sizeable first-innings lead will leave the tourists on track. Broad celebrates after reaching 91 miles per hour for the delivery that took Denesh Ramdin's wicket . Cook and Jonathan Trott leave the field at stumps having guided England to 74 runs without loss . 'The only way we can win is by getting 400, 450 in the first innings and applying pressure that way,' he said. 'We need a bit of lady luck, blue skies in the morning and hopefully there's not too much swing. 'You can't have mornings like we've had on every day of the Test or it will be a draw. 'But we've got a pretty simple job from now, which is to bat a day and half to two days because I don't think anyone really knows how this wicket will behave late on day three, four or five.'","England captain Alastair Cook hasn't scored a Test century for 33 inning .

"Alastair Cook passed another landmark on his way to becoming England’s highest runscorer as he pursued the equally important prize of cementing his place as their Ashes captain. When Cook slapped a Kemar Roach full toss to the boundary in the early stages of his reply to West Indies’ 299 on Wednesday, he moved beyond Alec Stewart into second place among England’s great Test accumulators. Now only Graham Gooch, the man Cook returned to earlier this year to try to restore his batting to full working order, stands above an England captain who is very much fighting for his leadership future in this series. Alastair Cook passed Alec Stewart's 8,463 runs to become England's second highest Test run-scorer . Cook had watched West Indies’ last pair of Devendra Bishoo and Shannon Gabriel add an unlikely 52 to undo much of the good work provided by a welcome burst of wickets from Stuart Broad. It lifted the hosts to a score that should have been beyond them and left Cook and Jonathan Trott, both under pressure after their failures in Antigua, with the final session of the second day to begin the climb towards a total big enough to press for a priceless victory. Trott had been frenetic on his return to the side in Antigua but here he was much more like his old self, scratching away at the crease and meticulous both off his pads and on the drive. Anything short, particularly from the pacey Gabriel, was swiftly ducked. Cook, meanwhile, looked comfortable with his new stance even though he could easily have fallen on 29 off the leg-spinner Bishoo. When bad light stopped play they had reached 74 and England, perhaps, were back on top. One man who definitely looked back to his best form was Broad, who bowled beyond 90mph for the first time since returning from surgery while claiming three wickets for 19 when rain finally relented. Earlier the crowd for only the third Test to be staged on the spice island , which included thousands of England supporters, had to display extreme patience as cricket again embarrassed itself in the face of weather problems. Yes, there was nothing the umpires could do about the squally showers that wiped out the bulk of the morning session but there was plenty they could do as the sun shone throughout the lunch interval. Then they could have avoided an additional 10-minute delay when they were slow in coming back out after an afternoon shower because they said the outfield was still wet. What difference does 10 minutes make? When the weather relented there was plenty of drama, not least when Marlon Samuels gave his wicket away just two balls after reaching a century that had England, in particular Ben Stokes, cursing him on the first evening. Anderson had clenched his fist and roared into Samuels’ face, earning himself a rebuke from the umpires, after making a breakthrough England badly wanted. The sight of his strike partner fired up seemed to bring the best from Broad, who then bowled his best and fastest spell of a troubled winter. It has taken Broad time to get back to his best after knee surgery before the World Cup but there was evidence he was approaching it here as a beauty clocked at 91mph took Ramdin’s edge. Cook and Jonathan Trott shared a first half-century stand after safely negotiating the final session on day two . Stuart Broad bowled beyond 90 miles per hour for the first time since returning from knee surgery . There have been serious concerns about Stuart Broad’s speed, or lack thereof, since his comeback from a knee injury. At times in this Test he has dipped below 80mph, a far cry from his best and well short of Australia’s Mitchell Johnson, who will send down 90mph snorters in the Ashes. But Broad’s speed picked up markedly in his fourth spell and he regularly touched 90mph. MICHAEL VAUGHAN . ‘He is much more effective when he’s above 85mph. Yes, it’s hard on the body, but at 82, 83, there’s nothing on it.’ GEOFFREY BOYCOTT . ‘We saw Broad bowl very well in moments today.’ SIMON JONES . ‘Pace is certainly up! Good gas!’ Broad followed that up with the wickets of Jason Holder and Kemar Roach, the heroes of Antigua, but not before we had another example of the limitations of technology and another display of Holder’s rich batting promise. Holder, who made a hundred in frustrating England in the first Test, really does look like a proper batsman at No 8, as he showed when hitting two mighty sixes off Anderson and Broad. He also perhaps had a slice of luck when he pulled Broad to deep mid-wicket only to pick out Moeen Ali, who appeared to take a low catch but admitted he could not be sure he had claimed it cleanly. As ever, the pictures were inconclusive and Billy Bowden said he could not be sure whether the call had carried or not. This time it cost England just six runs before Holder was undone by Broad but the ICC really should look at this and perhaps go back to Ricky Ponting’s quest for the fielder’s word to be taken on catches. When Roach fell three wickets had gone in eight overs from Broad at a cost of 19 runs but any hopes England had of quickly ending West Indies innings was held up by Bishoo and Gabriel. Their stand left England running out of time if they were to move into a strong position but at least Cook, without a century in 33 innings, and Trott looked at ease against an attack lacking the best bowler in Antigua in Jerome Taylor. The pair survived the odd nervous moment, notably when the captain was missed in the slips off Bishoo, as they reached their first half-century partnership as an opening pair. They need plenty more if England are going to have a chance of winning this second Test. England paceman Broad grabbed four wickets including wicket of Denesh Ramdin .

"A play-off career high 32 points from Kawhi Leonard helped the San Antonio Spurs on their way to a 100-73 mauling of the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 3 on Friday. The newly crowned Defensive Player of the Year was in excellent form for the reigning NBA champions as they took a 2-1 lead in the first-round series. The Clippers had won the first game of the series convincingly at the Staples Center, but must now come from behind after two straight defeats.

The Clippers scored a franchise postseason low and their 11 points in the third were their fewest in any quarter this season. Blake Griffin had 14 points and 10 rebounds and DeAndre Jordan added 10 points for the Clippers. Griffin averaged 27.5 points on 47 percent shooting in the first two games, but was held to 6-for-15 shooting against a collapsing Spurs' defence in Game 3.

Paul Pierce hit a 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter to give Washington a 3-0 lead over the Toronto Raptors . Game 4 is Sunday at Dallas. No team has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit to win an NBA postseason series. That unlikely challenge now also faces Toronto after Washington went ahead 3-0 with a 106-99 victory over the Raptors. John Wall had 19 points and 15 assists and 37-year-old Paul Pierce hit two key late 3-pointers for the Wizards. Six Wizards scored in double figures, including Marcin Gortat, who had 24 points and 13 rebounds. Pierce's 18 points were highlighted by a 3-pointer that capped a 10-2 run with 2 minutes left, and another with 16.3 seconds remaining after Toronto got within three points.

"COOK'S BRADMAN JINX . With overcast conditions and moisture in the air, it’s easy to see why the out-of-nick Alastair Cook put West Indies in to bat. On Test Match Special, Graeme Swann revealed the exact moment Cook’s form with the bat took a turn for the worse. He said: ‘Two years ago when England were in New Zealand, Brendon McCullum said Cook was the closest thing to Don Bradman. 'He hasn’t scored a ton since. It’s the greatest piece of reverse psychology I’ve ever seen.’ Alastair Cook's former team-mate Graeme Swann pointed out when the England captain's form turned . RASHID MADE TO WAIT . While the rain came down in the morning, there was much talk of whether Yorkshire’s leg-spinning all-rounder Adil Rashid would play in this Test. Despite many calling for his inclusion, the 27-year-old will have to wait to make his debut. Assuming he is the next man to do so, he will be England’s 666th Test player - though he will have the chance to skip straight to 667. Adil Rashid was made to wait for his Test debut after being left out after much discussion on day one . WOE FOR BRAVO . Marlon Samuels might have an excellent record against England, but Darren Bravo does not. The batsman has no 50s in five Tests against them - at a paltry average of 19.75 - so who can blame him for getting fidgety and poking at a wide ball from Stuart Broad as he crept towards the half-century mark?

He was making a rare county appearance for Lancashire in a Roses Match in Liverpool and let’s just say he was quite aggressive. 'He took me a bit by surprise and on that initial evidence I wasn’t a massive fan.’ FAMILY VALUES . At tea, Anderson’s father, Michael, spoke to TMS about the making of England’s leading wicket taker. ‘Every evening when I came home from work we would play out in the garden and he wouldn’t let me give my wicket away - he would always make sure he got me out,’ he said.","Graeme Swann revealed the exact moment Alastair Cook’s form turned .

"Ben Stokes was involved in a war of words with West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels last night after a hard-fought opening day of the second Test. The two clashed repeatedly on the pitch and Samuels later taunted the Durham all-rounder, saying: ‘The English boys don’t learn.’ Right-hander Samuels, who is 94 not out after West Indies toiled to 188 for five, said: ‘Ben Stokes was basically battling himself because he has just come into cricket while I’ve been around for a while. Marlon Samuels says the England players 'don't learn' as he found verbal alternations helpful while batting . Ben Stokes is spoken to by umpire Steve Davis after a heated exchange with Samuels, who is 94 not out .

He keeps on talking to me and he keeps on motivating me to carry on batting. ‘It all depends on how tomorrow goes,’ said Samuels, who then talked of himself in the third person. ‘Marlon Samuels with 150 and Ben Stokes with the ball in his hands. It will be very interesting. The English boys don’t learn because whenever they talk to me I continue to score runs!’ Samuels also had an angry exchange with Jimmy Anderson at Trent Bridge three years ago and went on to score 117. Samuels smashes a shot through the offside as he approaches a century ahead of day two in Grenada . Samuels claimed inexperienced Stokes is 'battling himself' and that England 'can't help' talking to him .

Australian umpire Steve Davis had to step in to calm down Stokes and Samuels after the Englishman’s sledging ended with him hurling the ball in frustration to try to run his opponent out and conceding overthrows. Samuels said: ‘I can’t tell you what he said, that’s between umpire and players. But the talk between me and Stokes was nothing big.’ The Jamaican should have been caught by Alastair Cook at slip on 32 off Chris Jordan, who said: ‘Stokesy likes to get in a battle and you saw two cricketers going at it for their country so I guess it makes good viewing. ‘That kind of stuff makes Stokesy tick. Any time he is in a battle, all of us will back him. It’s good to see two cricketers going at it without crossing the line.’ Stokes had earlier twisted his hip on the greasy outfield and had lengthy treatment.

The five-time former champion was a 10-3 winner against Craig Steadman, a 32-year-old from Manchester who endured a painful Crucible debut. O’Sullivan was hurting, too, after earning his last-16 place — due to the discomfort his shoes were causing him. Ronnie O'Sullivan moved into the second round of the World Snooker Championship on Wednesday . The five-time world champion beat Craig Steadman 10-3 in their first round contest at The Crucible . He might have faced a fine of around £250 for briefly playing on without shoes, but because O’Sullivan was ready to accept any other pair of size eights offered his way, tournament officials decided there was no case of a dress-code breach to answer. The title favourite dug out an old pair of dress shoes for yesterday’s play, as he converted a 7-2 overnight lead, before putting out a call for help. ‘If any top shoemakers feel like they want to come and sort me out with a new pair, send your boys down.

"Reanne Evans saw her 10-year reign as women's world snooker champion surprisingly ended on Tuesday. The 29-year-old from Dudley earlier this month lost narrowly to Ken Doherty in the first round of qualifying for the Crucible-staged Betfred World Championship. She suffered a fresh blow at the Northern Snooker Centre in Leeds as she relinquished her WLBSA World Ladies title, losing 4-2 in the semi-finals to Hong Kong's Ng On Yee, who went on to defeat England's Emma Bonney 6-2 in the final. Reanne Evans has seen her reign as women's world snooker champion come to a shock end . Hong Kong's Ng On Yee poses with the women's title of the World Amateur Snooker Championship in 2009 . Hong Kong's Yee, the 2009 and 2010 World Amateur champion only dropped four frames in four maths from the last-16 stage onwards. But it is her win over Evans which really stands out. Evans has dominated the ladies' game and in 2010 became the first woman to be afforded the chance to qualify for men' events since 1994.

"Washington, Cleveland and Houston all earned 2-0 leads in their NBA first-round playoff series with victories on Tuesday, continuing the previous day's pattern. All five of the series that have played two games now stand at 2-0, with the Wizards, Cavaliers and Rockets joining Monday's winners Chicago and Golden State with the early two-game buffer in the best-of-seven series. Washington's 117-106 victory at Toronto owed most to John Wall, who had 26 points and 17 assists, and Bradley Beal, who scored 28 points. LeBron James scored 30 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers moved into a 2-0 lead over the Boston Celtics . Cleveland's 99-91 win  followed their victory at the weekend to put them in a strong position in the tie . Marcin Gortat scored 16 points, Otto Porter had 15 and Paul Pierce added 10 for the Wizards, who return home to host Game 3 on Friday. Jonas Valanciunas had 15 points and 10 rebounds and Sixth Man Award winner Lou Williams scored 20 points for the Raptors, who have lost four straight playoff games over the past two seasons. Washington lost 15 of their final 19 road games in the regular season but rediscovered their best away from home in time for the playoffs. Dating back to last year, the Wizards have won seven of eight away from home in the post-season. Paul Pierce celebrates after his Washington Wizards team moved 2-0 ahead on the Toronto Raptors . Wizards guard Bradley Beal scored 28 points in a 117-106 victory on Tuesday in Toronto . DeMar DeRozan scored 20 points, Patrick Patterson had 15 and Amir Johnson added 10 for Toronto, who have won just one playoff series in six previous post-season appearances. Cleveland shook off a persistent Boston to win 99-91 at home, with LeBron James leading the way with 30 points and Kyrie Irving contributing 26. James scored 15 points in the fourth quarter, moved past Hall of Famer Jerry West on the career playoff scoring list and made sure the Cavs didn't slip up at home. He and Irving combined for all of Cleveland's 24 points in the final period. Timofey Mozgov added 16 points and Tristan Thompson had 11 rebounds for Cleveland. Dwight Howard and Josh Smith celebrate the Houston Rockets taking a 2-0 lead over the Dallas Mavericks . Howard scored 28 points and had 12 rebounds in a 111-99 victory for the Rockets at the Toyota Center .

"Judd Trump was in confident mood after safely moving through to the second round of the Betfred World Championship in Sheffield. Trump led 7-2 overnight and many thought he would make light work of Stuart Carrington but he was made to battle before eventually securing a 10-6 victory. The 25-year-old closed with a century and will now face Marco Fu in the next round. Judd Trump beat Stuart Carrington 10-6 on Thursday in the first round of the World Championship . 'I'm just going to focus on my own game,' he told BBC Two. 'If I play how I know I can, I'll win it.' A re-rack was required in the 10th frame but that did not distract Carrington who produced a break of 97 to reduce the gap to four. Trump took the next with a streak of 74 but a 74 of his own from Carrington followed by a run of 70 in the next meant it was 8-5 at the interval. Carrington got amongst the balls after the interval but was halted at 24 and Trump swept in with a 76 to move within one frame of victory. Grimsby potter Carrington showed his mettle, though, with a 99 in the next before a closing 109 from Trump put an end to his campaign. And the 2011 finalist was quick to praise his opponent, who was making his Crucible debut. Trump (pictured) led 7-2 from Wednesday and got the job done despite a good display by Carrington . 'He played really well considering it's his first time here,' he said. 'Second session he hardly missed a ball. He probably won't take as much credit as he would if it was a top player making those breaks. 'He played as good as anyone I've seen first time here.' Trump is one of the crowd favourites wherever he plays and admits there is a weight of expectation on him this year. 'There's obviously a lot of anticipation this year,' he added. 'My results have shown that I'm playing some good stuff, I felt like I played well over the past two days. 'There's obviously a few things I need to work on but other than that I feel very confident. 'It was nice for Stuart to play as he did, it just shows there is always stuff to work on and you won't get many sessions where someone plays that well.' After being five frames behind, Carrington closed the gap to three before Trump earned the victory . At the press conference following his win, Trump was asked about the footwear problems encountered by long-time rival Ronnie O'Sullivan, whose 10-3 victory over Craig Steadman required a change of shoes. Having started Tuesday's match in a new pair of shoes, O'Sullivan discarded them due to the acute discomfort they were causing him; he briefly played in socks before accepting tournament director Mike Ganley's shoes which 'felt great' to him. Of the incident, Trump said: 'I didn't really see it but I heard about it. Obviously, he likes attention. I don't know if he's done it on purpose or not, who knows?' As to the overall favourite for the World Championship, Trump was quick to divert attention away from O'Sullivan, adding: 'In my eyes, I think Neil's (Robertson) probably the underdog, . Ronnie O'Sullivan was forced into borrowing a pair of shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley . 'I think Neil's favourite to win the tournament. Neil and Mark (Selby) are going to be the toughest two. Ronnie is obviously a good player but I'm confident of beating anyone.' On the other table, defending champion Mark Selby was locked in a tough battle with Anthony McGill in the opening second round match. Selby, who needed to scrap for a 10-9 win over Kurt Maflin in the first round, got off to a slow start as he surrendered the first two frames. The first was a scrappy encounter but a break of 63 sealed the second for McGill before runs of 51 and 46 saw Selby on the board. The Leicester cueman then levelled things up at the mid-session interval with a 65 and an 87 at the third time of asking saw him edge ahead. Defending champion Mark Selby closed the session at 4-4 with Anthony McGill in their second round match . McGill was not daunted, though, and breaks of 74 and 73 in the next two saw him take a 4-3 lead before Selby drew level again to end the session at 4-4. Shaun Murphy, the 2005 world champion and current Masters title holder, conceded just the one additional frame to his overnight lead of 7-2 as he wrapped up a 10-3 win over Robin Hull. Murphy's first frame on Thursday was a tight affair at 56-55 and he went on to win the next 64-33. Finland's Hull was able to pick up frame 12 but Murphy's wrapped up the contest with a break of 111. It sealed his passage to the second round where he will meet Joe Perry, who had beaten Zhang Anda 10-4. Shaun Murphy wrapped up victory against Finland's Robin Hull with a 10-3 win on Thursday . Ding Junhui has a chance of progressing past John Higgins after his break of 94 sealed frame eight to leave the Chinese 5-3 down going into Friday's session. Higgins had picked up back-to-back frames at the start without much fuss, including 81 on the first, though Ding's class showed in a 135 break in the third. Four-time World Championship winner Higgins then threatened to walk away with the match by winning three frames on the bounce, starting with 116-6 in the fourth and going on to lead 5-1. However, Ding fought back in the closing stages to narrow the deficit, though he did miss out on a second century break of the match after failing to pot the black, on what was to prove the last shot of the day.","Judd Trump beat Stuart Carrington 10-6 in the first round at the Cucible .

"A celebrity doctor known as ‘Healing Hans’ has played a key role in getting Paula Radcliffe to the start line for Sunday’s London Marathon. ‘I was close to pulling out,’ she admitted. ‘There was definitely a point I was worried because I thought, “God, if I can’t run for 45 minutes, I can’t get round a marathon”.’ Instead Radcliffe turned to renowned German doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, who has worked with the likes of Ronaldo, Michael Owen and Usain Bolt. World record holder Paula Radcliffe said she 'was close to pulling out' of the London Marathon on Sunday . But Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, who has worked with Ronaldo, has made sure Radcliffe will race . Despite a very public split with Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola last week, Muller-Wohlfahrt joined an American foot surgeon, orthotics specialists in Belgium and physiotherapists at British Athletics to make sure Radcliffe will reach the start line for her final competitive marathon on Sunday. The 750,000 who are expected to pack the 26.2-mile course from London’s Blackheath to Pall Mall will not witness a Radcliffe of 2003 vintage. Her world record time of 2:15:25 still stands 12 years later but the 41-year-old will be nowhere near that mark this time, setting off with the good club runners rather than the elite women. Finishing the race will be a victory of sorts for her after fearing a degenerative injury to her foot would rule her out. ‘I was in Kenya and training was going well,’ she said. 'But because the trails are pretty rocky out there I tweaked my achilles. I went down to Font Romeu (her training camp in Italy) and it snowed there so I did a couple of runs on the treadmill. Maybe because it was harder on the treadmill my achilles started to get really sore.’ Sunday's London Marathon will be Radcliffe's final competitive marathon of her career . Celebrity doctor Muller-Wohlfahrt (left), known as ‘Healing Hans’, recently German giants Bayern Munich . The turning point came four weeks ago while on a run in the park near her home in Monaco with daughter Isla, eight. ‘She was on her bike and it’s quite hilly so I was more impressed that she kept up. 'From that day, I’ve been able to gradually increase it and get back, with ice buckets after every run, and I’m just really grateful to everyone who has helped me. ‘If I was being competitive I would have pulled out five weeks ago. But I’ve just been there so many times and this time I just thought it doesn’t matter if I run it in three hours or 2:45. ‘I’m almost there and I’m hoping my body will remember a little bit once I get running.’","Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt has been working with Paula Radcliffe .

Eight-time NBA All-Star Paul will captain Team World, while Britain's two-time NBA All-Star Deng - who was born in South Sudan - will lead out Team Africa. 'I am extremely proud to be a part of the NBA's first game in Africa,' said Miami Heat’s small forward Deng. 'Coming from South Sudan and having participated in the Basketball without Borders Africa camps in Johannesburg previously, I am truly honoured to be part of this historic event.' Los Angeles Clippers' point guard Paul was equally enthusiastic about the summer showpiece: 'I look forward to representing Team World in the first NBA game in Africa,' he added. 'It will be my first visit to the continent, and I cannot wait to contribute to the growth of the game on and off the court.' In addition to Paul and Deng, NBA executives, general managers and legends will also participate including 2014-15 NBA Coach of the Year Mike Budenholzer of the Atlanta Hawks, San Antonio Spurs chief Gregg Popovich and the sport's Global Ambassador Dikembe Mutombo. The game will take place following the 13th edition of Basketball without Borders (BWB) Africa, the NBA and FIBA's global basketball development and community outreach program that has reached 1,000 campers from 31 African countries since 2003.

"Neil Robertson revealed a new practice repertoire which he hopes will lift him among the game's all-time greats after storming into the second round of the Betfred World Championship. The 2010 champion rattled in an opening break of 133 as he reeled off the three frames required to turn a 7-2 lead into a 10-2 victory over Welshman Jamie Jones in Sheffield. Robertson has committed more hours to the game than ever before and he believes it will help him finally fulfil his potential and become a multiple winner of the sport's major crowns. Australia's Neil Robertson plays a shot during his  match against Wales's Jamie Jones at The Crucible . 'I have put in more hours for this tournament than any other in my whole career,' the 33-year-old Australian said. 'Before I played my first-round match I potted 300 balls without missing - that's the stuff (Stephen) Hendry used to do. Hendry used to not miss for six or seven frames, and that's what you have to do if you want to dominate matches. 'If you were to stop my career and look back, I would definitely have a feeling of 'what if I had practised more?'. I think I could do more so I've left no stone unturned coming into this tournament. 'It would be harsh to say I have under-achieved, but I think I could have won a lot more if I'd sacrificed a little bit more.' Barry Hawkins found himself the reluctant star of another Crucible epic after clinging on to beat qualifier Matthew Selt in a final-frame decider. The 2013 finalist looked set to ease through to the last 16 after resuming on Monday with a 7-2 overnight lead which he extended to 9-4 to move within one frame of victory. Robertson celebrates winning in his World Snooker Championship first round match against Wales's Jones . But Selt responded by reeling off five frames in a row - including back-to-back centuries - before a cool clearance from Hawkins saw him into the second round with a 10-9 win. Hawkins - who fought off a similar fightback from Dominic Dale in last year's quarter-finals, admitted: 'I can't keep putting myself through that. 'There's nothing worse than when someone is coming back at you like that and you can see your lead disappearing. Robertson contemplates a shot during his World Snooker Championship first round match at The Crucible . 'You're telling yourself it's only one frame but you can see him growing in confidence and potting long balls so it is a horrible place to be.' Ding Junhui's dismal record at the Crucible looked set to continue as he lost the first four frames of his first-round match against veteran Mark Davis. The world number three looked distinctly out of sorts in the early stages, but clawed his way back to reduce the deficit to 3-4 overnight.","Neil Robertson has committed more hours to practice than ever before .

"Arsene Wenger wants Cesc Fabregas to be shown the ‘respect he deserves’ when he returns to the Emirates Stadium in the blue of Chelsea on Sunday. The problem with that is a decent chunk of Arsenal’s supporters feel he doesn’t deserve much. That became obvious on Thursday, when one prominent fan called for the removal of a Fabregas banner from the Ken Friar Bridge. Cesc Fabregas returns to Arsenal on Sunday and Arsene Wenger hopes fans will give him a good reception . Wenger wants 'respect' for the club's former players and counts Fabregas as a man who deserves that . Gunners fans offer their good luck to Fabregas in 2011, but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time . Extreme, perhaps, but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where Fabregas built his career, not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from Barcelona to Chelsea are still as clear as mud. Any clarity, it seems, will have to wait. Wenger was at his cryptic best on Thursday when asked if it was his call to not take up an option he had to re-sign the player, saying: ‘We will have to discuss that one day. With all the terms.’ When pressed on whether it was his decision, he added: ‘It’s not as clean as that. I cannot speak to you about that now because that will not help us to win on Sunday.’ At that point it was suggested to Wenger that Fabregas chose not to come back and Wenger said: ‘I don’t know, I don’t know.’ The Frenchman has previously claimed that by the time he knew Fabregas was available, a deal with Chelsea was virtually concluded — comments which jarred a little with the Spaniard’s statement last summer that Arsenal ‘decided not to take’ their option. Whatever, it would be ambitious for Fabregas to expect an overwhelmingly positive reception on Sunday. The midfielder set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Certainly, there was already a degree of disappointment within the club about how their relationship with the player ended when he left in 2011. But Wenger said: ‘I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday, (I want him) to be respected like he deserves.’ Wenger added: ‘The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc’s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here.’ When he returns, it will be as a key part of the champions-elect and under a manager in Jose Mourinho who has won seven and drawn five of his 12 meetings with Wenger. That clash, in itself, is a fascinating sub-plot to this fixture between the top and second-placed teams in the Barclays Premier League. Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010 . Playing down his poor record against Mourinho, Wenger said: ‘We have not always lost, first of all, in 12 attempts. ‘We have come close to beating them and they’ve always had very strong teams. Having said all of that, the result on Sunday will be just down to the performance on the day. It’s not a confrontation (with Mourinho), it’s a confrontation of two teams. I’m not a great believer in history. I just think football is down to the fact the performance on the day will decide the game and the result.’ With seven straight league wins, Arsenal approach the fixture at speed, but Wenger accepts it is unlikely Chelsea will lose a 10-point advantage on the run-in. He said: ‘We dropped points at the start of the season but since January we have been top of the (form) table. We want to continue to win and strengthen our position in second place because that’s far from being done. 'Now what we can do is get closer to them and we have that opportunity. It still means even if we beat them, mathematically they are still in a very strong position. But you never know.’","Arsenal face Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday afternoon .

"It's truly squeaky bum time in the Premier League relegation battle as just nine points separates the bottom seven teams. Sportsmail asks some of the managers in and among the dog fight what they feel is required for them to avoid the drop this season. Question: 'What will it take for your club to stay in the Premier League?' CHRIS RAMSEY (QPR) 'If we win three games I think we will stay up. It might take less. I'm not saying that's the definitive amount - but we really need to start winning, starting with this weekend. To do that, we need to concentrate right to the end and make sure that our performances stay similar with a bit more defensive resilience.' QPR manager Chris Ramsey (centre) feels they will avoid relegation if they win three more league games . TIM SHERWOOD (Aston Villa) 'I don't know how many points it will take. We've done alright. Nothing's been achieved yet. I'm a new voice and given them a lot of belief and confidence that they are better than what they were showing. They have managed to score a few more goals and have real belief they can go to places and win. Something was probably a little bit missing previously. I want to make sure that I don't take my foot off pedal. I'll make sure the players don't.' Tim Sherwood (left) believes his appointment at Aston Villa has given them a lot of belief and confidence . NIGEL PEARSON (Leicester) 'We've put ourselves in a position now where we have a more realistic chance. That's where we are. If it raises optimism elsewhere, fine. If it applies a bit more pressure on other sides around us, fine also. But as far as I'm concerned it's about making sure we're back to business when we play Burnley. Because it's a really big game for both sides. We've got players in decent form. We want to keep the work ethic that we've shown all season.' Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson (right) hopes his side can continue their momentum against Burnley . SEAN DYCHE (Burnley) 'The biggest psychological difference is that others are talking about relegation. Our fuel is about staying in the Premier League. It's a slightly different twist. 'Others are scared of relegation. We're not scared of relegation because we were told by everyone we were going to get relegated. We are actually looking for the goal of being in the Premier League.'

"Former Everton chairman Sir Philip Carter has died aged 87. Carter also served as president of the Football League and a vice-president of the Football Association but it is as chairman of Everton throughout the 1980s that he will be remembered. Under his stewardship, the club won two league titles, an FA Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup, which is still the Toffees' only piece of continental silverware. Former Everton chairman and life president Sir Phillip Carter passed away on Thursday. He was 87 . Carter also served as president of the Football League and a vice-president of the Football Association . 'Everton Football Club is deeply saddened to announce that Sir Philip Carter has passed away,' read an Everton statement. 'Sir Philip died peacefully at home on Thursday morning after a short illness. 'He served Everton with immense distinction over three spells. 'At this time it would be appreciated if everyone can please respect the family's wish for privacy.' Current Toffees Chairman Bill Kenwright also paid tribute to Sir Philip, who he recalled to the board of directors at Goodison Park for a second time in 2008. Bill Kenwright said Carter was a great man and the very best friend anyone could ask for . 'Words cannot describe my feelings of loss primarily as a friend but also as an Evertonian,' Kenwright said. 'Sir Philip was simply a giant...a great man a great leader and the very best friend and colleague anyone could ask for. I never once met him without calling him Chairman. I never will. 'That title was his by right. He will always have a major place in our great club's history. To his wondrous Lady Rita and his family we send the deepest of condolences together with our undying love and gratitude for his life.' Bill Kenwright, Chairman of Everton Football Club, said: 'Words cannot describe my feelings of loss primarily as a friend but also as an Evertonian.

That title was his by right. He will always have a major place in our great club's history. To his wondrous Lady Rita and his family we send the deepest of condolences together with our undying love and gratitude for his life.' Roberto Martinez, Manager of Everton Football Club, said: 'This is a sad day for Everton Football Club and for every Evertonian. Sir Philip was an incredible custodian of the Club, a pure gentleman and a man I feel really fortunate to have met, for I learnt much about the essence of Everton from him. From my earliest days here, I was able to sit down and chat with Sir Philip at Finch Farm. He was generous with his time and with his recollection of so many of the experiences he went through as Chairman. Some of those moments had been extremely difficult but, ultimately, his guiding hand contributed to some of the Club's greatest successes and, for me personally, the conversations we shared will always give me guidance in terms of the future that we are trying to build for Everton. 'As a man, he was an example for every Evertonian. He took pride in all aspects of our Club, he loved the community in which we are rooted and he was an Evertonian through and through. I got a real sense and understanding of Everton from the time I was able to spend with him and I am especially grateful for this. He will forever be part of the history of this great Club.' Robert Elstone, Chief Executive of Everton Football Club, said: 'In the last few hours, the world of football has been moved to express great sadness, great admiration and, above all else, great respect for Sir Philip Carter. In such a short space of time, the number of people who have been moved to contact me, and the Club, and the depth of feelings expressed, sums up the great man. One text reads, ""true gentlemen and the perfect embodiment of the values of Everton"". They are right. 'Sir Philip was part of a small family of highly respected and universally loved 'football men'; a man who shaped the Game, a man who shaped Everton, and a man who, over the past year, almost everyone I have met has asked about. 'On a personal level, he was a mentor, a confidant, a voice of reason but more than all of that, with his amazing wife, a great friend. Sir Philip left a lasting impression on anyone who entered the Everton Boardroom. He will leave one on me.' Denise Barrett-Baxendale, Chief Executive of Everton In The Community and Deputy Chief Executive of Everton Football Club, said: 'Today is an unbelievably sad day for everybody at Everton Football Club and for everybody at Everton In The Community. Sir Philip was the ultimate community man - a gentleman, a people's man, someone with wisdom, character, distinction and strong, abiding principles. What he did for this Club, this city, this community, this country has left a lasting legacy. But today we feel bereft. Our thoughts are with his family - the incredible Lady Rita, his children and grandchildren. We are all devastated by his passing.'","Sir Philip Carter died at his home on Thursday morning after a short illness .

"Burnley manager Sean Dyche has attempted to protect out-of-sorts striker Danny Ings by calling on the rest of his team-mates to share the goalscoring burden to keep the team in the Premier League. Ings, strongly linked with a move to Manchester United or Liverpool when his contract at Turf Moor runs out in the summer, hasn't scored since February 11 — a run of eight matches — and missed his side's best chance in Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Everton that left Burnley bottom. As a team, they have scored just one goal in their last seven matches and while Dyche needs 23-year-old Ings to rediscover his mojo quickly, starting with the critical home game against relegation rivals Leicester City, he insists it's unfair to pin the club's survival hopes on one man. Burnley striker Danny Ings is struggling for form at the moment and hasn't scored since February 11 . Everton full-back Seamus Coleman (right) comes forward with the ball as Ings (left) gives chase on Saturday . Ings runs away in celebration after scoring for Burnley against Manchester United at Old Trafford in February . Burnley manager Sean Dyche insists that the rest of his players must help to relieve the pressure on Ings . 'Yes, Danny needs to find his goal touch but it's not just him. You want everyone and anyone to score. Boydy (George Boyde) has got goals, Scott Arfield's chipped in. David Jones had a great chance against Everton so the whole team has to step up to the plate. 'I'd be questioning us more if we weren't creating chances but we have been creating. It's rare at this level that you see a whole plethora of chances, say 15 or 20 like you see in other leagues, so when your chances come you have to take them.' Ings was mentioned in the same breath as Harry Kane not so long ago but you could see a lack of confidence as he misdirected a header from a Kieran Trippier cross in the closing minutes. It is 43 months since Everton last lost a 3pm Saturday home game, a 1-0 defeat against QPR which marked Tony Fernandes' first match in charge as the visitors' new owner. Everton won the game with a first-half goal from Kevin Mirallas who was later fortunate not to become the second player to be dismissed by referee Mike Jones when he caught Boyd on the shin. Burnley's Ashley Barnes had earlier been sent off for two bookable challenges, a decision Dyche had no complaints about. Everton's stand-out performer was winger Aaron Lennon who has impressed since a January loan move from Tottenham. Even so, manager Roberto Martinez insists there are no plans at this stage to sign him on a permanent basis. 'With all honesty, we are not going to think about that situation until the season is over,' said Martinez. 'When you have a loan player it is always a three-way conversation. The player is the first one that needs to make a decision and the parent club has a big say. I've never been worried about what is going to happen at the end of it. 'You see sometimes when you make loan moves permanent, they don't work out. Then sometimes it is the opposite, you sign a loan player and he becomes the best player you could ever sign because you know him and they know the way the team works.' Everton's young England player Ross Barkley suffered the indignity of missing an early penalty when he stepped up instead of Leighton Baines, whose conversion rate in the Premier League is 15 from 16. Even so, Martinez insists he will continue to leave it to the players to decide who takes penalties if the regular taker Romelu Lukaku isn't on the pitch. Everton winger Kevin Mirallas scores his side's winning goal against Burnley at Goodison Park on Saturday .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists the focus has to be on getting the most out of Aaron Lennon's loan spell before thoughts even turn to a permanent deal. The Tottenham winger has been one of the more impressive performers since moving to Goodison Park in the winter transfer window. Lennon, 28, has just four more matches to impress as he is ineligible to play against his parent club on the final day of the season and Martinez said that must be the priority for all concerned. Aaron Lennon (right) has four games remaining of his loan spell at Everton from Tottenham . Roberto Martinez wants to get the most out of Lennon in the time he has left at Goodison Park . Martinez said discussions about Lennon's future will come at the end of the Premier League season . 'Aaron is enjoying his football and his contribution to the team has been significant,' said the manager. 'He has got four games left and all I want is for him to enjoy every single second of it and make sure he enjoys the experience as much as we have benefited from his talent. 'Then, at the end of the season, will be the moment to sit down. A loan is a loan and it means that we are looking for a successful outcome out of that. 'Then, when the loan finishes, you have got a three-way conversation to see where that will take us. 'But the focus now is to see 'Azza' enjoying his football in the next four games.' Reports have linked Lennon with a swap deal with Toffees' forward Kevin Mirallas come the summer, with the Belgium international's future at Goodison uncertain after declaring in February he was looking for a new challenge. Mirallas scored on his first start since early March with the only goal against Burnley and Martinez is looking for the 27-year-old to finish the season strongly. 'Kevin is a special player for us,' Martinez told evertontv. 'He brings a goalscoring threat that is so important in football. It's good to see that Kevin is well over his injury now and can challenge for a place in the team. Martinez also praised the attacking talents of Kevin Mirallas (right) and rejected reports he could exit the club . Reports have linked Mirallas (right) with a switch to Tottenham with Lennon signing with Everton permanently .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists keeping Kevin Mirallas happy is key to holding on to him in the summer. There has been plenty of speculation about the Belgium international and he even admitted himself in February he fancied a new challenge and had an ambition to play in the Champions League next season. Injuries have prevented the 27-year-old from really finding his best form this campaign with a run of consistent performances but Martinez was delighted to see him score his first Premier League goal since December 28 in last weekend's win over Burnley. Kevin Mirallas has been linked with a move away from Everton following an injury-hit term at the Toffees . Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits to not knowing what the future holds for his Belgian star . There were reports this week Tottenham would try to make the forward part of a swap deal with their winger Aaron Lennon, who is currently on loan at Goodison Park. However, Martinez backed Mirallas to put the continuing debate about his future to one side. 'The total honest truth is we don't know what is going to happen in the future,' he said. 'I heard somewhere that he had one year left and it was a bit of an unsettled situation but that is not the case, he has two years left. 'I don't think it has ever been an issue. Sometimes there has been too much said on the outside. 'With any footballer now it does not matter whether you have one year or six years left, what is more important is being happy, feeling ready to be part of the project and be an important player going forward.

'He is someone who takes responsibility on the pitch, wants to make things happen and scoring the goal was an important moment. 'Kevin has always been a really hard-working player day-to-day and I have seen him progressing but I have never seen an issue in his performances at all. 'The way he performed on Saturday showed that. In every window you have to sit down and make sure everyone who is fully committed is ready to be part of the future.

The 25-year-old Dutch midfielder has not appeared since he damaged medial ligaments in his knee during in a 2-0 win at Sunderland in mid-February, when he opened the scoring. Leroy Fer could be rushed back after injuring his knee against Sunderland back in February . The Dutch midfielder has struggled for form and fitness since arriving from Norwich in the summer . 'He is in contention,' said Ramsey. 'He's not where we want him to be but we can't put him too much in cotton wool and you sometimes need to take a chance on someone.

"Steve McClaren has called the constant speculation linking him with Newcastle 'disrespectful' and insists his sole focus remains on trying to get Derby promoted to the Barclays Premier League. McClaren admitted there had been interest in him from Newcastle around the turn of the year, when Alan Pardew left as manager to take over at Crystal Palace. But with John Carver since appointed, the Rams head coach is reluctant to discuss the continuing reports. McClaren is understood to be one of two people on Newcastle's short list for the head coach role at St James' Park next season, according to reports in the North East. The other is thought to be Carver. Derby manager Steve McClaren has called speculation linking him with the Newcastle job as 'disrespectful' John Carver is the current incumbent in the Newcastle hotseat having replaced Alan Pardew in January . Reports this week have suggested that McClaren could leave Derby should, like last season, he fail to get them promoted from the Championship via the play-offs. Asked if he intended to still be in charge at the iPro Stadium at the start of the 2015-16 campaign, the former England boss said: 'I am contracted to Derby County, so yes. 'I have got a contract here for the next two years after this and I hope to honour that contract. 'But it is football, that might change, who knows. But at the present moment I am the Derby County head coach and will remain so until things change. 'So, let's get on with the job. My goal is to get in the play-offs and do as well as we can.' On the reports linking him with Newcastle, McClaren added: 'I haven't got a clue if I'm a candidate for the Newcastle job. McClaren insists his sole focus is steering Derby to  promotion at the end of the season . 'I think there was no secret that there was an interest in December and January. We talked about that and in the end they didn't have a manager then. 'What they did was appoint a manager [John Carver] and that is what they have got, and he is fighting for the job. 'While somebody is in a job it is a little bit disrespectful. It's disrespectful to John Carver, to Newcastle, my focus is purely on Derby.

"Steve Bruce is adamant he can keep Hull City in the Barclays Premier League after a 2-0 defeat by Southampton left them battling to stay up. At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation . They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone . 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth . Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday. But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice. Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone.

"Crystal Palace would sell coveted winger Yannick Bolasie for '£40million to £60million', according to manager Alan Pardew. Pardew claims all his players are 'undervalued' as the Selhurst Park club bid to assert their Barclays Premier League clout. The former Newcastle boss is ready to fend off big-money bids for his in-demand stars like Bolasie and defender Scott Dann - but conceded 'every player has a price'. Alan Pardew says he would sell Yannick Bolasie if Crystal Palace were offered £40-60million . Bolasie has been in fine form in recent weeks as Palace have enjoyed a successful second half of the season . Democratic Republic of Congo star Bolasie joined Palace for around £400,000 from Bristol City in 2012 but has risen steadily in standing ever since. Last week Pardew slapped a £20m price tag on the 25-year-old's head with Liverpool circling - now he has casually bandied about figures three times as high. 'I'll sell Yannick, if someone wants to give me £40m to £60m, somewhere in there, that would be good,' Pardew said. 'I'll take it and we'll build the team around that money. Every player has a price, of course. All these players here are undervalued, in my opinion. 'This is a top-10 team at the moment, top 12, yet if you put the valuation of our squad against any of the other teams above us, and some below, it's not right. 'So I'm going to address that. Anyone who rings me up will get a proper price. It's only our second year in the Premier League so it's understandable (if players are undervalued). Bolasie celebrates after netting for Palace, as he has begun to add goalscoring to his all-round game . Bolasie scored a hat-trick against Sunderland a few weeks ago, and is attracting the attention of top clubs . 'You need to put your credentials there every week. I think these players are starting to do that now; Bolasie, (Jason) Puncheon, (Joel) Ward, (Damien) Delaney. 'Therefore when I hear figures being talked about players, they are not even close to where I value these players. 'It's very easy to address: a manager has to ring me up and I will tell him the price, and that will be addressed.' Lyon-born Bolasie bagged a hat-trick in Palace's 4-1 Premier League win at Sunderland on April 11, his fine form since prompting a raft of transfer speculation. Liverpool's initial plans to offer £10million this summer have been thwarted, but boss Brendan Rodgers is weighing up offering striker Rickie Lambert as well as increasing his transfer bid. Pardew says he is not keen to lose his star man, but would sell him if the right offer came in . Pardew insists several of his players, including Jason Puncheon (left) and Joel Ward, are undervalued . While Pardew will be at pains to hold onto all his front-line talents at Palace over the summer, the ex-Eagles midfielder conceded the club may not be able to resist an outrageous bid. Pardew said Palace could end up wise to repeat the calculated 'gamble' he helped take at Newcastle when the St James' Park club sold Andy Carroll to Liverpool for £35million in 2011. The Selhurst Park manager believes selling one star for big money can help rejuvenate an entire squad. 'I can think of a situation I had at Newcastle, the last day of the window, a team that wasn't great, not too far away from the relegation zone and we accepted a big bid for Andy Carroll,' Pardew said. 'I said to the chairman at the time that that was a gamble. We were by no means secure; we'd only just come up from the Championship that year. 'But we did it, we spent the money wisely and we ended up with a very, very good team. So it is about the right price for the right player, and then you have to build on that.'","Alan Pardew insists every player has a price, even Yannick Bolasie .

"John Carver says Newcastle’s hierarchy must try to bring an end to protests against the club after admitting it is affecting performances on the pitch. The Magpies slumped to a sixth straight defeat at home to Spurs last weekend amid an atmosphere of unrest after thousands of supporters boycotted the match in protest at a lack of ambition and investment from owner Mike Ashley. Fans group AshleyOut.com are now encouraging supporters to ‘Stand Up To Ashley’ when Swansea visit St James’ Park on Saturday. This will involve a 34th-minute protest in recognition of the £34million which was last week revealed to be sitting in the club’s bank. Newcastle interim manager John Carver has called for unity at the club following a divisive season . Carver has said he is not afraid about giving his honest opinion on events at St James' Park . And Carver said: ‘We have to find a way of dealing with it and managing the situation because it can only hurt us – that is the fans and the club. ‘We need to find a solution. I don’t know what that is and I haven’t had talks about it, but if I get asked my opinion then I would give an honest answer. ‘It would be fantastic (if this was resolved ahead of next season). From day one it would be better. That is what we need to do.’ Carver, meanwhile, says his players were affected by the protest during the 3-1 loss against Spurs. ‘When I came away from the game I thought about it and the people who were in the stadium weren’t quite sure how to react. Some of them were annoyed that people had stayed away, others were delighted. It was strange,’ he said. ‘When it all kicked off last year you knew where you stood. This wasn’t a nice situation to be in, it was uncomfortable. ‘There was a lot of apprehension around the place on Sunday. I hear there was anger with each other and people falling out with each other in the stands. That cannot help, surely not. ‘I thought it didn’t affect us during the game, but on reflection I think it did.’ Carver – who is likely to be replaced by Steve McClaren in the summer - says he has not been told if he will still have a role at the club next season. Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon . At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs . However, he hopes that the club make a swift announcement on the future of the managerial position. ‘That would be for everyone’s benefit,’ said Carver when asked if the week after the season’s end was the best time to resolve the current uncertainty. ‘The fans, myself, everyone could enjoy their summer. I think it will be (sorted quickly) because don’t forget the window opens very soon after the season finishes. It has to be done and your recruitment has to be done in that period of time.’ He added: ‘I don’t know (if it will be me). I think people understand the situation I’m in and know what I’m trying to do. ‘Only they (hierarchy) know. But every time I get together with them they are positive – whether that’s to keep me going or they have someone else lined up, I don’t know. ‘That doesn’t affect me, the future will take care of itself. I’m just concentrating on now.’ The supporters' group have asked fans to stand in the 34th minute of Saturday's  match against Swansea . Fans boycotting the Spurs match hold banners demanding the resignation of Ashley as Newcastle director .

"Everton striker Romelu Lukaku dealt with racism as a youngster by using it as an added motivation to score goals. The Belgium international revealed he encountered abuse playing in youth teams back in his homeland but found the perfect response. 'I didn't suffer too much but when you hear it for the first time you are like 'Oh my God',' said the 21-year-old, speaking at a Kick It Out session at a school in Liverpool. Romelu Lukaku applauds the Everton fans after a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Burnley at Goodison Park . Lukaku hailed the work rate of strike partner Arouna Kone, who allows him to focus on scoring more goals . 'But I just responded by scoring goals. I used it as motivation. 'I remember one game for Anderlecht under-15s, a parent said something but we ended up winning 7-1 and I scored four, so it doesn't matter. 'I've not experienced it (racism) like other players but it is still out there, we all know that.' Lukaku is Everton's top scorer this season with 18 goals. Most have come playing as a lone front man but he said he likes having someone alongside him and is hoping to strike up a partnership with Arouna Kone, who has managed just one goal in 21 starts over almost two injury-ravaged seasons. Lukaku signs autographs for fans ahead of a Barclays Premier League match at Goodison Park . 'There were some games where I used to play down the sides, it didn't work out for me,' Lukaku told the Liverpool Echo. 'In all the games when I've played as a striker I have scored goals so when the manager switched over with two strikers with Arouna, that was heaven for me because I could do whatever I wanted because there was somebody next to me who had a work ethic the same as me. It was very pleasing. 'The manager knew that if I had that type of distraction next to me on the pitch then I would be much more free to score and create goals. 'Now, when you play with somebody next to you, you always know you are in a one v one situation.'","Romelu Lukaku has opened up about receiving racist abuse when just 15 .

"Southampton supporters are planning on turning St Mary’s orange when they face Tottenham on Saturday to shun former manager Mauricio Pochettino. Fans are campaigning to show support for their Dutch manager Ronald Koeman, his brother and assistant head coach Erwin Koeman and fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg. They are encouraging match-goers to wear orange instead of the usual red and white club colours to display their discontent at Pochettino leaving last year.

"Chris Ramsey believes three wins from the last five games will be enough to secure Queens Park Rangers' top flight status. Rangers are in the drop zone of the Barclays Premier League with 28 points as they prepare for a London derby at home to West Ham. 'If you win three games you're probably going to stay up,' said Ramsey. 'As long as we're above the line come the end of May we'll be happy. I just care if we win. I just take care of our own game. If we don't get good results it doesn't matter what they do. Queens Park Rangers boss Chris Ramsey believes his side will stay in the Premier League with three wins . Clint Hill reacts after QPR conceded a late goal against Chelsea to lose 1-0 at Loftus Road . Ramsey spoke of his dismay at the nature of the late defeat by Chelsea in their last game . 'We know the enormity of the task ahead but you can only plan and prepare as best you can and what happens happens. We understand there is pressure in these last few games. I can't say I don't feel pressure but it depends on how you deal with it.' He believes QPR's chances of achieving these victories from games against West Ham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Leicester will hinge on their an ability to kick the habit of conceding late goals, like the one which turned a draw into defeat on their last outing against Chelsea. 'It is down to a lack of continued concentration,' said Ramsey. 'The managers of other teams near the bottom would say the same. 'Not many teams are getting slaughtered but the quality at the top end is why they're there. We're not happy with late goals. We need to stop conceding those late goals.

'I didn't get over it quickly. We had a game-plan and we didn't do it until the end. It was more for the players who ran their legs off.

"Every weekend, Sportsmail tallies up the match ratings handed out by our team of reporters to bring you the Barclays Premier League team of the day. Eden Hazard leads the way this weekend, having powered Chelsea to a vital, narrow win against Manchester United as they hunt down the Premier League title. He is joined by two team-mates from Jose Mourinho's champions-elect. Craig Gardner starred as Tony Pulis' West Bromwich Albion side gave him a winning return to Crystal Palace, even despite the efforts of in-form Palace winger Yannick Bolasie. Everton claimed a win over struggling Burnley, Stoke City saw off Southampton and Leonardo Ulloa scored to continue Leicester City's late surge against Swansea City. GOALKEEPER . Tom Heaton 7.5 (Everton vs BURNLEY) Burnley might have lost at Goodison Park but goalkeeper Tom Heaton was in no way to blame, producing a string of saves to keep Everton to just one goal in a narrow defeat. The performance was topped off with a penalty save from Ross Barkley and his showing bodes well for Burnley's hopes of a great escape. Tom Heaton produced a string of saves against Everton and saved Ross Barkley's penalty . DEFENCE . Seamus Coleman 7.5 (EVERTON vs Burnley) Seamus Coleman was key to Everton's win over Burnley, laying on the only goal of the game for Kevin Mirallas and helping to keep a clean sheet. And it was Coleman who was fouled by Ashley Barnes to reduce Burnley to 10 men on the stroke of half-time in an all-action showing. Seamus Coleman was key to Everton's win over Burnley, laying on the only goal of the game on Saturday . John Terry 7 (CHELSEA vs Manchester United) Defences across the country have found it impossible to cope with Manchester United of late, but a John Terry-marshalled Chelsea kept them out to take another step towards the Premier League title. The Blues skipper bullied Radamel Falcao out of the game at Stamford Bridge and helped to limit United to just two shots on target. A John Terry-marshalled Chelsea kept outut Manchester United to take another step towards the title . Philipp Wollscheid 7 (STOKE CITY vs Southampton) A classy performance from the German centre back kept Graziano Pelle and Dusan Tadic quiet in a win over Southampton.

Philipp Wollscheid revels in the physicality of English-style defending and he dominated in defence for Stoke . Luke Shaw 7 (Chelsea vs MANCHESTER UNITED) Drafted in to replace Daley Blind, Luke Shaw proved to be Manchester United's most penetrative attacking threat in a game they dominated against Chelsea. Shaw was rarely tested defensively and took plenty of opportunities to go forward. His cutback should have seen Wayne Rooney open the scoring. Luke Shaw proved to be Manchester United's most penetrative attacking threat in a game they dominated . MIDFIELD . Aaron Lennon 8 (EVERTON vs Burnley) Enjoying his football and finding form again at Everton, it was another good weekend for Aaron Lennon. The Tottenham loanee won a penalty in a man-of-the-match display at Goodison Park. It was another good weekend for Aaron Lennon, who won a penalty for Everton against Burnley . Craig Gardner 7.5 (Crystal Palace vs WEST BROMWICH ALBION) Craig Gardner's beautiful 30-yard curler sealed victory for West Brom away at one of the Premier League's in-form sides. His solid passing in midfield helped to put a stop to Crystal Palace's free-flowing style as Tony Pulis enjoyed a winning return to Selhurst Park. Craig Gardner's beautiful 30-yard curler sealed victory for West Brom away at Crystal Palace on Saturday . Eden Hazard 8.5 (CHELSEA vs Manchester United) Made the difference in a big game again. Eden Hazard was a constant outlet for Chelsea's midfield and he slotted between David de Gea’s legs for a decisive goal. Hazard's form seems to make him a nailed-on bet for the Player of the Year prizes come the end of the season. Eden Hazard was a constant outlet for Chelsea and he slotted between David de Gea’s legs for a goal . Yannick Bolasie 8 (CRYSTAL PALACE vs West Bromwich Albion) Yannick Bolasie was not as successful this week as he was with his hat-trick against Sunderland last time around, but still a threat to West Brom with his pace and power. Every attack for Palace seemed to come down the left and he was denied a deserved goal when Boaz Myhill clawed away his bicycle kick. Yannick Bolasie was not as successful this week as he was last week but he was still a threat with his pace . FORWARDS . Leonardo Ulloa 7 (LEICESTER CITY vs Swansea City) Leonardo Ulloa's first goal in the Premier League since Boxing Day brought another victory in the fight for survival.

"England Under 21 captain Jack Butland has revealed voting for team-mate Harry Kane as this season's PFA Young Player of the Year and hopes the Tottenham hotshot can help him emulate goalkeeping skipper Iker Casillas at the European Championship in the Czech Republic this summer. Butland joined his England manager Gareth Southgate and former World Cup legend Michael Owen at St George's Park on St George's Day as around 35 local schoolchildren from the east Midlands were put through their paces by FA skills coaches at England's plush headquarters. The 22-year-old Stoke City goalkeeper is bidding to be the first England captain to lift the European Under 21 championship since Dave Sexton's team won the trophy in 1984 and Kane is expected to be a big part of their team as they attempt to end 31 years of hurt. Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland has reveled he voted for Harry Kane to win PFA Player of the Year . England U21 captain Jack Butland joined manager Gareth Southgate at St George's Park on Thursday . England U21 boss Southgate demonstrates a drill as 35 local school children were put through their paces . FA chief Greg Dyke has said that Kane's agent had called him to say the Spurs striker wanted to be part of the Three Lions team in June even though he has to go to Australia first for a post-season friendly with his club. On his decision to vote for Kane for the PFA award, Butland said: 'For someone who hadn't previously been given a lot of opportunities, he's been phenomenal. He's come out of nowhere and shown what he's about. 'He has constantly been 100 per cent driven and his finishing is among the best I've seen even though he is young. 'For me, there's not a player of the same age near him.' Kane took his tally of goals to 30 for the season with this strike against Newcastle last Sunday . Butland hopes Kane can fire the young Lions to European Championship glory this summer . Butland was part of the ill-fated England side that crashed out of the Under 21 finals at the group stages two years ago, though he did help the Under 17s win their European Championship in 2010. He said: 'With no World Cup or Olympics, it's a chance to grab peoples attention and show there is hope if you like and that there are good players coming through. 'With the incredibly gifted players we have in this country, we need to produce at a higher level. Players like myself, Nathaniel Chalobah and Nathan Redmond experienced tournament football and won it with the Under 17s and that should help massively. Kane has declared that he wants to play in the tournament in the Czech Republic this summer . 'It can bring a calming influence to the group, we will be able to to give a few words of advice here and there and give people an idea of what to expect.' It is unusual for a goalkeeper to be captain but Dino Zoff (1982) and Casillas (2010) led their country to World Cup wins. 'I dreamed of winning the trophy in the last tournament but it didn't go well then. The motivation has been even stronger to produce something this time as a team and do ourselves proud. Butland wants to emulate Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas by captaining his side to tournament glory . 'It has to be the dream, and to lift the trophy would be a huge honour. Casillas has done it, as a Spain captain he has lifted everything. Whether I was captain or not, lifting the trophy would be incredible.' England's squad for the finals will be announced on June 2. Their first match is on June 18.","Jack Butland voted for Harry Kane to win Young Player of the Year .

"Brendan Rodgers has launched an impassioned defence of his abilities, insisting there is nobody better equipped to manage Liverpool under the Fenway Sports Group model. It has been a difficult week for Rodgers, with the meek manner of last Sunday’s 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final ensuring his position has come under scrutiny like at no point during his three-year reign at the club. FSG, Liverpool’s owners, maintain Rodgers’ job is not even up for discussion but that has not stopped Jurgen Klopp – who will leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the campaign – being mentioned as a possible successor. Brendan Rodgers insists he is the man to guide Liverpool to success despite a disappointing season . The Liverpool manager is under pressure following the FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa last Sunday . But Rodgers has been boosted by the news that Jordan Henderson (left) has committed his future to the club . But Rodgers has not been rattled by the intensity of the criticism nor is he dwelling on the disappointment. He is concentrating on building Liverpool back up and wants the club to be 'really forceful' when they embark on their summer recruitment drive. ‘After the weekend there is always emotion,’ said Rodgers, who will again be without Daniel Sturridge at West Brom and is 'unsure' when he will return. ‘When you lose a big game this is when you find out you are at a big club because the critics come after you. ‘Three months ago, I was a tactical genius. Now I have lost a couple of games and it is not so good. ‘That is something you have to deal with. When I sit down and look at it, I will hold myself up against anyone to manage this club and to fit the model of what they (FSG) want. I am super ambitious in terms of wanting to win and there will be no greater place to do that than here. ‘Of course in modern football there are lots of processes that go on behind the scenes that people will never be aware of. In terms of what we are trying to do, I do not see anyone better in terms of the hand we were given. We are here to win. We do not want to be “nearly men”. ‘There is no-one more ambitious. If there comes a time when that is not the case and we move on, there will be no-one who respects the owners more than me. But Christ, no, I will fight for my life. If I can get the tools here to help us, we can be really successful.’ Henderson (left) is 'over the moon' after signing new long-term contract at Anfield worth over £100,000 a week . The former Sunderland player hopes Raheem Sterling (pictured) will follow his lead and commit his future . Liverpool have identified a number of targets, principally PSV Eindhoven’s Memphis Depay but they must trump Manchester United; Burnley striker Danny Ings and Manchester City’s James Milner are attractive Bosman options but the feeling is the club need to make a statement of intent. ‘We’ve enough potential and players we can develop and improve,’ said Rodgers. ‘But it is definitely starters we need and we have to be really forceful to get (them).’ There was some good news for Rodgers after Jordan Henderson completed the formalities of signing his new five-year contract, which is heavily incentivised and worth more than £100,000 per week. Liverpool’s vice captain said he was 'over the moon' to conclude the talks, which began at the start of the season and were successfully negotiated by his agent, Neil Fewings. He now hopes Raheem Sterling will follow suit and commit to Liverpool’s future like him, Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho. Sterling, who told BT Sport criticism of his contract talks have been going 'in one ear and out the other', will resume negotiations at the end of the season. ‘Raheem is a good friend of mine and he just has to do what he thinks is best,’ said Henderson. ‘But, if I was giving him advice, I would say: ""This is Liverpool"" – I think this is best place for him. That decision is up to him. He is a fantastic player for us. I hope he stays here and develops with us.'","Brendan Rodgers is under pressure following FA Cup semi-final defeat .

"With six games to go - five for QPR and seven for Leicester - there are just four points separating the bottom five sides in the Premier League. As things stand the three promoted clubs, Leicester, Burnley and QPR, would make an immediate return to the championship, but Hull and Sunderland are teetering on the brink. Even Aston Villa and West Brom are not quite out of the dogfight, although our reporters are confident that the relegated clubs will come from the five teams currently at the foot of the table. Charlie Austin is hoping to fire QPR to safety, but will his goals be enough to save them? Can any of the bottom three climb to safety? Or will the clubs above them succumb to fiendishly difficult fixture lists? Sportsmail's reporters give their verdicts on the closest relegation run-in for years... Lee Clayton . Leicester, QPR and Sunderland. Can I add an IF? IF Danny Ings starts scoring regularly again. If not, Sunderland will stay up by the skin of their teeth and the bottom three go down, which should act as a warning to Bournemouth, Norwich, Watford, Middlesbrough and the rest involved in the Wacky Races at the top of the Championship. Sunderland's fans deserve better. So do Newcastle fans. But don't get me started on that.

Burnley to survive as they have made it through a nightmare sequence of fixtures with their spirit and desire intact. They can take points from any of their final six games - even though only two are at home and they have won only once away this season. Leicester's fixture list gives them a chance with five home games plus away fixtures at Burnley and Sunderland. There may be too much to do but they suddenly have a chance having found the winning formula and it may supply the required inspiration. Sunderland and Hull face the double whammy of flagging form and brutal fixtures and QPR are running out of games. Steve Bruce (left) and Dick Advocaat are feeling the strain as their teams slide towards relegation . With their improvement under Tim Sherwood, none of our reporters think Aston Villa will go down . Riath Al-Samarrai . Hull, Burnley and Leicester . Hull have a dreadful run-in and simply look awful. That's not to say QPR have been much better but at least against Chelsea they showed they are still fighting. When I saw Hull at Swansea earlier this month, they were spineless. Burnley have a reasonable run of fixtures but they and Leicester have been in the mess all season - I can't see why that would change in the next few weeks. Burnley have been in the bottom three for most of the season, and they'll need a big improvement to stay up . Rob Draper . Hull, Leicester and QPR . Hull's run-in is just awful whereas Burnley's looks manageable. At this stage of the season it's usually about momentum. Hull have lost theirs. QPR and Leicester have gained some but it looks too little, too late. QPR have gained a little bit of momentum under Chris Ramsey, but it is too little too late for them . Dominic King . QPR, Hull and Sunderland . This is a big call but I can see both Leicester and Burnley dragging themselves out of the mire. Whenever I've seen Leicester this season, they have competed until the last kick and the same goes for Burnley. They look ready to fight for their lives. Hull have a taxing run in and simply aren't playing well enough. Sunderland, meanwhile, have been wretched all season and, to this observer, look bereft of the unity and resilience you need to get out of such a hole. Leicester have always fought until the final whistle, and that will go for the relegation run-in as well . Sunderland have been abject all season and look bereft of ideas as they struggle to stay in the top flight . Chris Wheeler . Leicester, QPR and Hull . Burnley have a much easier run-in than QPR, Hull and Sunderland, and I’m backing Sean Dyche to pull off the great escape after being written off from the start. Leicester also have a decent set of fixtures – not to mention a game in hand – but I think they will drop out and Dick Advocaat will keep Sunderland up - just. Jermaine Defoe celebrates his goal against Newcastle, and he could do enough to keep Sunderland up . Mike Keegan . Hull, Sunderland and QPR . Hull's run-in looks horrendous with relegation a fitting reward for a side that has underperformed all season. Dick Advocaat is not the man to save Sunderland. Yes, they beat John Carver's Newcastle (who doesn't?) but normal service was resumed when Crystal Palace trounced them 4-1 on home turf. Final-day defeat at Leicester will condemn QPR and complete Nigel Pearson's great escape while Danny Ings will rediscover his shooting boots to hand Burnley the perfect parting gift and cap a fairytale year for the brilliant Sean Dyche. Sunderland boss Advocaat watches on as his side lose to Crystal Palace - he is not the man to save them . Leicester's final day game at home to QPR will be crucial as Nigel Pearson looks to keep his side up . Joe Bernstein . Sunderland, Burnley and QPR . I can't see Sunderland getting a single point from their remaining away games at Stoke, Everton, Arsenal and Chelsea. Burnley haven't turned draws into wins and QPR go to Leicester on the final day. It looks winner-takes all in that one. Leicester have five of their seven fixtures at home plus trips to Sunderland and Burnley. I think they can provide the 'miracle' and ensure one promoted team stays up. QPR and Leicester will battle it out for survival, but the London club will not have enough to stay up . Sam Cunningham . Leicester, Burnley and Hull . Hull's final run-in is the worst of any of the relegation-threatened clubs, facing Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United in four of their remaining six, and I believe they're doomed. Of the three already in the relegation places, I feel QPR showed against West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea they have what it takes to stay up helped by Charlie Austin's goals. Leicester and Burnley are not strong enough to beat the drop. Leicester have shown signs of pulling off a miracle, but do they have the quality to stay up this season? QPR have shown enough to suggest they will beat the drop, and Charlie Austin's goals can prove decisive . Sami Mokbel . Leicester, QPR and Hull . Leicester and QPR have shown an improvement in recent weeks, but I fear they've left themselves too much to do. Hull have got some awful fixtures ahead. They still have to play: Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. Their other two games are against Crystal Palace - who are flying under Alan Pardew - and fellow relegation scrappers Burnley. I'm not sure there's enough points in those games for Steve Bruce's side to escape. Hull City lack momentum and have the most difficult run-in of any of the sides left in the relegation scrap . Craig Hope . Burnley, Hull and Sunderland . Yeah, that's right, Leicester City and QPR both escape the drop. As outlandish as it once seemed, the pair now have a little bit of momentum - a lot of it in Leicester's case - and that cannot be said of Sunderland and Hull. QPR will beat both West Ham and Newcastle at home, while a draw at Leicester on the final day could prove enough to see them both to safety. Leicester also face Newcastle - and that is the biggest guarantee of three points as there is at the moment. Sunderland, meanwhile, simply are not capable of saving themselves and, with trips to Arsenal and Chelsea to sign off the season, their final home game with Leicester will determine their fate. Lose and they will probably be relegated with a points total in the region of 32. Hull have lost three on the spin and have a horrendous run-in during which they'll be lucky to win another game. As for Burnley, they have winnable matches but the goals have dried up and that could cost them dear. Sunderland are in danger of being brushed aside in the battle to avoid relegation, and look likely to go down .","Leicester, Burnley and QPR hoping to avoid going straight back down .

"Sebastien Pocognoli has risked the wrath of his manager Tony Pulis, after publicly stating his confusion at losing his place in the West Brom team. The Belgian defender was an important player under Alan Irvine but since he left the club, the left back has found his game time limited. Speaking to La Meuse, he admitted he couldn't get his head around the decisions being made. 'I do not understand. I have also got no explanation as to why I don't play. Sebastien Pocognoli (centre) says he's baffled by Tony Pulis' decision to drop him from the starting 11 . 'Even if my (left-back rival) is injured or suspended I don't get a chance. That's frustrating because I feel very happy in Birmingham and I have a good relationship with the fans.' Pocognoli insists that he doesn't want to be one of the those players to throw a strop but may be forced to consider his long-term future. He said: 'I will not cause trouble, because I am not that type, the end of the season is approaching and I am waiting for the club to tell me their plans. 'After I played 15 good games, I know that some clubs have followed me. It is too early to talk about that, but I want to stay in the Premier League. 'I have a good life here and at age 27 I think of everything. But I am also open to a new league.' It's been a turbulent season for West Brom but has improved since Pulis took over from Alan Irvine .","Since Tony Pulis took charge at West Brom, Pocognoli has found game time hard to come by and midfielder Chris Brunt ahead of him .

"Mark Hughes has revealed talks have opened over a contract extension for in-demand Asmir Begovic following Stoke's 2-1 win over Southampton. The Bosnian goalkeeper, who kept Stoke in the game during a one-sided first half at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday, sees his existing deal run out next year with Real Madrid known admirers. And speaking after second-half goals from Mame Diouf and substitute Charlie Adam saw his side roar back after Morgan Schneiderlin had given Ronald Koeman’s Southampton a deserved lead, manager Hughes added that he was hopeful of keeping Begovic at the club. Stoke City have opened talks over a contract extension for in-demand goalkeeper Asmir Begovic . Begovic is highly-rated and has attracted interest from several top clubs, including La Liga's Real Madrid .

Stoke midfielder Charlie Adam scores during the comeback win over Southampton in the Premier League . Jonathan Walters (left) congratulates fellow Stoke striker Mame Biram Diouf (right) after his goal on Saturday . ‘We want to be a team that’s consistently in the top ten,’ said a beaming Hughes whose side rose to ninth in the table. ‘To be able to do that you need key players in key areas of the field and obviously goalkeeper is a key position in any good team and Asmir has been exceptional for us for a long time now.’ Both Manchester clubs have watched the 27-year-old but Hughes thinks Stoke have a chance of persuading him to stay. The win over Southampton on Saturday was Stoke’s first over them since February 2008 when an own goal from Darren Powell and efforts from Ryan Shawcross and Mamady Sidibe secured a 3-2 triumph. ‘We’re talking and those talks are going to be concluded in the summer,’ he said. ‘Hopefully they are going to be concluded in our favour.’ Next up for Saints, who missed the chance to close the gap on Manchester City in fourth place to two points, is a home meeting with Tottenham - and the return to St Mary’s of former boss Mauricio Pochettino. Captain Jose Fonte believes it is a big match because of the race for Europe rather than the visit of the Argentine. ‘It’s because it’s Tottenham,’ said the centre-half. ‘They are close in the table and we want to finish above them. Obviously, there’s that added bit that Pochettino is coming back, but for us players it’s just another big game against a team that is next to us that we want to beat.’ Southampton defender Jose Fonte (left) competes for the ball with Diouf (right) at the Britannia Stadium .","Stoke have opened talks over a contract extension for Asmir Begovic .

"When even injuries are working in Leicester's favour, the other teams around the relegation zone should begin to worry. Leonardo Ulloa was not supposed to be starting this match, left out in favour of Andrej Kramaric. But when David Nugent suffered injury in the warm-up, Ulloa was sent on. Inside 15 minutes he scored a goal that provided the platform for a victory that looks increasingly like being part of a truly great escape. That familiar melody was hummed loudly by Leicester's fans at full-time, fuelled by Andy King's late second goal and the sight of their team moving off the bottom of the table for the first time since November.

Leonardo Ulloa gives Leicester the lead, scoring from Wes Morgan's knock down . One more goal would have taken them out of the relegation places instead of Hull, but much more like this and that will come. This is three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000. Manager Nigel Pearson has been here before. Leicester emerged for this game looking like, one imagines, the pack of dogs that Pearson once fought off with a stick while hiking in the Carpathian mountains. His side are finally bearing teeth at the end of an arduous season, two wins in succession providing genuine hope of a remarkable surge to safety. Shifting off the bottom for the first time since November was the carrot for this game should defeat be avoided. Pearson selected an attacking side, a 3-4-1-2 with genuine wingers in the wide roles. He sent on Ulloa for the injured Nugent and played Andrej Kramaric as No 10. Cambiasso (front) stretches to control the ball ahead of the oncoming Swansea forward Ki Sung-yueng (behind) at the King Power Stadium . Leicester hitman Leonoardo Ulloa (right) strikes the ball to score his side's opening goal against Swansea during the match on Saturday . The home side began with feral ferocity. Straight from kick-off Jamie Vardy drove at the Swansea defence only being halted at the last by Federico Fernandez. The tone was set. The lead Leicester craved was theirs in the 15th minute. Ulloa made the Premier League sit up and take notice at the start of the season with a flurry of goals, but his failure to maintain the momentum contributed largely to Leicester's decline. This was his first Premier League goal in four months, but what an important one. Following a corner the ball was recycled to Marcin Wasilewski, who launched a long ball from halfway that Ulloa flicked-on to Wes Morgan, who had stayed up. The centre-back fed it back to the Argentine who lashed home under the diving leg of Ashley Williams. The King Power Stadium erupted, and Ulloa ran to the dugout to Jon Sanders, the club's player liaison officer, and share a hug. Leicester are very much together at the crucial stage of the season, as this performance illustrated. Swansea were nothing like their fluid best, restricted to long shots easily held by Kasper Schmeichel. At half-time Wasilewski was forced off, with Richie De Laet coming on, and Leicester switched to four at the back. Their energy remained. Three minutes after the break Marc Albrighton fired a shot narrowly wide, and shortly after Kramaric sent a chance over following a breakaway. Schmeichel saved well from Jonjo Shelvey, was again from range, but it was Leicester unpicking Swansea's defence with greater frequency. In the 55th minute Vardy crossed to Ulloa, who sent his header onto the roof of the net while back-peddling. A minute later, Ulloa got free down right and centred, Vardy miscued and Kramaric ballooned a very good opening over. This has been a theme of Leicester's season, always positive but too often missing chances. It has previously proved costly. It would have done again in the 67th minute, but for a stunning save by Schmeichel. Nelson Oliveira ran clear and stayed on his feet when Robert Huth made a desperate lunge – referee Lee Probert could have awarded a penalty and possibly red in any case. Schmeichel came out in star jump fashion – like his dad Peter – and thwarted Oliveira's finish. Ulloa rushes over to supporters to celebrate a crucial goal in the club's bid to avoid relegation from the Premier League this season .

Schmeichel grasped the ball and blew out his cheeks moments later after saving another snap shot from Shelvey. Jefferson Montero than saw his shot deflect wide off Morgan when it could have gone anywhere. From then the game was Leicester's. Through Vardy, Albrighton and substitute Riyad Mahrez they possessed pace to counter at speed Swansea struggled to handle. In the 73rd minute Vardy led a two-on-one breakaway but over-hit his pass to Mahrez allowing Lukasz Fabianski time to dive and block. Vardy was again clear six minutes later through Danny Drinkwater's pass and fell under contact from Ashley Williams as he pushed the ball past the Swansea captain. Pearson was incensed but it would have been soft. Vardy sent another chance over, and Fabianski palmed wide a stinging shot by Mahrez. But a minute from time Leicester did seal the win. Esteban Cambiasso, superb all afternoon, fired a free-kick through Swansea's wall, Fabianski spilled the ball, and King applied the required tap-in. The noise was phenomenal. Leicester believe.

"Adam Rooney is determined to prevent a season of outstanding personal achievement from ending with a sting its tail. The prospect of watching Celtic celebrate title glory inside Pittodrie would, he admits, be a painful experience to bear. After sticking to the coat-tails of the champions for so long, this would be the most unwelcome denouement imaginable. Should the current eight-point gap between the teams remain intact, then Ronny Deila’s side will have the chance to clinch a fourth successive Premiership crown when they head to the north-east on May 10. Aberdeen striker Adam Rooney does not want to see Celtic win the league on their patch on May 11 . Rooney, though, expects Aberdeen to be fully motivated to prevent a green-and-white party from getting underway. ‘If they are going to win it they are going to win it,’ said the 27-year-old striker, who on Thursday made the shortlist for PFA Scotland Player of the Year. ‘Obviously, though, we wouldn’t like to see them celebrating on our patch because of the season we have had. We have pushed them close enough this year, so it wouldn’t be nice to watch that. ‘You don’t want to see teams celebrating. You want to be the ones celebrating, particularly at home. I wouldn’t like it for the fans so we just have to make sure that, on the day, we win the game.’ Somewhat ominously for Aberdeen, they have lost all three previous meetings with Celtic this season. A 4-0 reverse at Parkhead early last month killed off any realistic prospect of a first championship flag in 30 years being flown at Pittodrie. The points total Aberdeen have amassed proves that they have been every bit as good as Celtic against the other teams in the top flight. Celtic are eight points ahead of second place Abderdeen and could win the title when they face their nearest challengers on May 11 . But is it feasible for Derek McInnes’ outfit to take that final, most difficult, step and view winning the league as a realistic aim in the next year or two? ‘People were waiting to see how we got on this year in case we dropped back down again,’ said Rooney. ‘But because of the stability we have with lads tied up on contracts, and the way the gaffer goes about things, no-one was going to slack off. ‘Hopefully we can add some quality over the summer as well. I don’t think there will be massive numbers going in and out, but hopefully we can keep building. ‘If we can even be a few points closer again this time next year, and Celtic drop off, we could be there or thereabouts. ‘We are only eight points behind Celtic at this stage of the season when most teams would expect to be at least 30 points behind them. Rooney was nominated for the Scotland Player of the Year and has netted 27 times this season . ‘I don’t think we’ve lost to anyone other than Celtic in the league since October, which is such a great achievement. ‘It’s just down to the job the gaffer and Tony Docherty have done. They have brought a lot of quality into the squad. ‘We spent money on Kenny McLean from St Mirren, which shows the club is ambitious, and Graeme Shinnie is coming in the summer. ‘He was a young lad when I was at Inverness and he is a great signing for us. I thought he was brilliant in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Celtic last Sunday. He was by far one of the best players on the pitch, which is saying something when you consider the quality which was on show in that game.’ If Shinnie proves as good an addition as Rooney – signed from Oldham in January 2014 - then McInnes will be utterly delighted. The Irishman’s 27 goals this season have been a crucial component in the red results machine and even led Dons legend Willie Miller to claim he was up with Joe Harper and Duncan Shearer in terms of the finest Aberdeen strikers of recent decades. Rooney scored the winning goal for Aberdeen against Dundee United last Saturday . ‘He must have been drunk when he said that!’ laughed a self-effacing Rooney. ‘I think Barry Robson also compared me to Ally McCoist and he got stick for that. ‘It’s obviously nice to have good things said about you but I just want to try and keep it going until the end of the season. ‘Terry Butcher used to compare me to Ian Rush when I was at Inverness and I got stick for that, too. I think I’ve been compared to everyone apart from Gary Doherty, who is the only one I look like! ‘I’m scoring goals because the lads have created so my chances for me. My target is to get as many as possible and I’m only three away from 30 now, so it would be nice to get there. ‘I wasn’t aware until you told me that I’d only be the sixth player in Aberdeen’ s history to do it - so thanks for the pressure! But it would obviously be a great accolade to get. ‘Confidence has been high. I managed to get a few goals in the Europa League at the start of the season and it’s just gone from there. ‘The team have dominated a lot of games this season, so I’ve been lucky enough to be in the right place to get on the end of what has been created.’","Celtic are eight points clear of Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce believes filling your home ground is paramount to Premier League clubs - with the Hammers announcing their new season-ticket structure ahead of the move to the Olympic Stadium. Karren Brady, vice-chairman of West Ham, announced during the week that the club would be making significant cuts to their current pricing as the move is being offset against increased television revenue. The cheapest season ticket at Upton Park is £620 but there will be £289 seats on offer from the 2016-17 season - the club's first in the 54,000-seater Olympic Stadium. West Ham's season tickets will cost as little as £289 when the club move to the Olympic Stadium next year .

And Allardyce believes performing in front of a sold-out crowd is something that should not go unappreciated as the other 19 Premier League clubs are now being pushed to follow West Ham's lead. 'The most important thing at a football club is to fill the stadium,' he said. 'I think filling the stadium is the ultimate for the success of the team. Obviously it's not from a revenue base like it used to be.

"Andre Blackman hides his face outside Hammersmith Magistrates Court . A former Celtic star tried to dodge performing unpaid work for shoplifting from Harrods - after claiming it would disrupt his search for a new club. Andre Blackman, 24, who now plays for doomed Championship side Blackpool FC, stole a jacket worth more than £1,000 from the world famous store in Knightsbridge. Blackman, who has been told he is ‘surplus to requirements’ by Tangerines boss Lee Clark, described the offence as a ‘moment of madness.’ He was ordered to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work after Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court was told he fled from the shop with the £1,225 jacket. He was arrested shortly afterwards and the jacket was recovered. Blackman told Deputy District Judge Samantha Mace: ‘It was just a moment of madness. It was not something that I intended to do, or something I do regularly. ‘I’m just absolutely speechless.’ Blackman told the judge his attempts to find a new club might be hindered if he was forced to carry out community work. He said the travelling to different clubs would be the biggest problem. Explaining his situation, he said: ‘I have got my current agent looking around on my behalf and there have been a few clubs that might be interested. ‘And because we are closer to the end of the season they are just waiting to see whether they are going down or staying up.’ ‘Once I do work for a club I would have to come back to the court and say that something has come up.’ Judge Mace told Blackman, who temporarily resides in a hotel in Blackpool using the £125 living allowance he receives from the club, that he would be more than capable of carrying out unpaid work before the new season begins. Blackman has already played for 11 clubs in his short career. Blackpool defender Blackman has played just three Championship games for the Tangerines this season . Blackman has been told by Blackpool boss Lee Clark that he is surplus to requirements at Bloomfield Road . He played for Arsenal’s academy between 2001-06, and Tottenham Hotspur’s between 2006-07. Blackman signed his first professional contract with Bristol City in 2009, making his debut in a League Cup match against Brentford in August 2009, before playing for AFC Wimbledon, Celtic, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Plymouth Argyle, Dover, Maidenhead, and most recently Blackpool. He was awarded ‘Tackle of the Year’ at Celtic when he accidentally collided with manager Neil Lennon during a match, sending him crashing into the turf . Judge Mace told Blackman his offending was at the ‘lower end’ of the spectrum, and that 40 hours of unpaid work could be completed before September. She added that if the order really hinders him from finding a new club then he can apply to the court to be sentenced in another way. Judge Mace said ‘Because you haven’t been signed by a club just yet, you should be able to complete the hours before the new season, and if you really really can’t do it you can make an application to the court to deal with sentence in another way.’ The judge ordering him to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order and to pay £85 in costs. ‘As I have said, because the goods were of a high value, the fact you do have a similar conviction - albeit a long time ago - and the fact that you did try to run away from the shop before being apprehended by the police, this makes it serious enough to merit a community order. ‘In the present circumstances I do think it’s appropriate for such an order to be made. ‘It would be far more serious if you had not pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.’ Blackman, of Edymion Road, Brixton, southwest London, must complete his community service by April next year.","Andre Blackman fled from Harrods after stealing jacket from store .

Former Hoops striker Chris Sutton (pictured in 2005) has called for more accountability for officials . Insisting the officials should not escape scot free either, however, Sutton says Muir should be kept away from high-profile games if he's not up to the job. 'There's not a conspiracy theory or anything like that,' he insisted. 'It was just an absolute shocker. I just can't work out what he was thinking. 'It was just idiotic how he didn't see it. It wasn't a conspiracy, I just can't remember a decision that bad from someone standing so close. 'There is no way he could have thought that ball hit the player on the head, he must be an idiot not to see it. It's just ridiculous.' A goal ahead at the time, Celtic reacted to 'supporter pressure' by writing to the SFA seeking clarification on the failure of referee Steven McLean to award a penalty and send Meekings off. Sutton infamously triggered a huge row in 2003 when he accused Dunfermline of 'lying down' to Rangers to pip Celtic to the title on the final day. Insisting Sunday was a question of incompetence rather than integrity, however, he added: 'It's not a conspiracy, it's just a rubbish and inept decision. 'It shouldn't happen and it doesn't reflect well on the Scottish game if decisions like that are made. 'I don't know if maybe he (Muir) panicked, but he has a job to do and if he is not up to the job — which he clearly wasn't — then he shouldn't do it again. 'You can understand the frustration of the Celtic fans and players and the manager's frustration. 'I'm not saying that changes the perception of what Ronny Deila has done.

"Inverness have angrily vowed to fight an SFA bid to ban Josh Meekings from the Scottish Cup Final. Meekings was served with a retrospective notice of complaint by compliance officer Tony McGlennan after handling a goal-bound header from Celtic's Leigh Griffiths in Sunday's controversial semi-final.

Meekings will argue his case at an SFA tribunal tomorrow after Inverness vowed to 'vigorously defend' their player in a bid to clear him for the Final against Falkirk on May 30. 'We intend to vigorously defend our player and are taking legal advice on the issue,' said a club statement. 'We are extremely disappointed that this has arisen and the player himself is mentally shattered at the turn of events. 'Josh is keen to appear in person at the disciplinary hearing and we will most strongly support him by all means available.' Celtic had goalkeeper Craig Gordon sent off in Sunday's second half as their chances of a rare domestic Treble turned to dust. The decision to query the standard of officiating at the semi-final came after a huge supporter backlash, but prompted anger from fans of other clubs.

'For me that's your initial reaction, you're going to head the ball and your hand comes up. 'I'm honest enough to tell you it's one we got away with. But I don't think it was deliberate. 'I think Josh went to try to get his head on it and his hand comes up. 'The referee never saw it, play on, one we got away with and it was probably the bit of luck we needed.'

"Ronny Deila bemoaned the refereeing blunder which cost ten-man Celtic side a crack at a rare domestic treble. Virgil van Dijk's sublime 16th free-kick gave the Parkhead side a dream start to their Scottish Cup semi-final clash with Inverness. But the Parkhead side were denied a clear penalty and the chance to go 2-0 ahead before half-time when additional assistant Alan Muir failed to spot a goalline handball from Josh Meekings. Ronny Deila was angry at the referee's decision to now send off Josh Meekings and award his side a penalty . Celtic's anger was further fuelled when McLean - rightly - sent off Parkhead keeper Craig Gordon for clattering into Marley Watkins in 53 minutes, Greg Tansey equalising from the spot. A man down for 67 minutes the Scottish champions wilted in extra-time, succumbing to goals from Edward Ofore and David Raven, despite John Guidetti making it 2-2. In measured tones, Deila chose his reaction to the penalty furore carefully saying: 'I don't think I have to say much about that. 'I think everybody can see what's happening. The Inverness defender (6) handled Leigh Griffiths goal-bound header but none of the officials saw it . 'When they played with 11 v 11 we had good control of the game and produced good chances and enough to win the game. 'But, of course, with ten it gets more difficult and we have to run more. 'And, again, we got very tired.' Pinning the blame for the incident on the unsighted additional assistant Muir rather than referee MacLean the Norwegian added: 'We have five referees, maybe we need seven – I don't know. One on each post. The Celtic boss remonstrated with Steven McLean at half-time and was angry at the poor decision . 'He has one task. He has to look at something on the goalline. 'You can't blame the main referee for that.' Asked if it was a big, critical moment in the game he added: 'I don't think. Everybody knows that. 'The game is finished if we get it. 'That's a tough day. Hard to take of course. Inverness' players celebrate at the final whistle after reaching the Scottish Cup final after extra time . 'I think we fought very hard. When you don't get the result you want of course it's a blow for us.' The Meekings incident, the latest in a wretched season for Scottish referees, will reopen the debate surrounding television replays. 'This will not help anything today,' said Deila, dismissing the idea. 'It's very hard for me to discuss this. 'It's a big blow for the boys. I'm very disappointed. 'We had control, eleven v eleven and should have killed the game before. Virgil van Dijk (left) had given Celtic the lead and put his side in control before all the incidents kicked off . 'We didn't do it and put ourselves in very sad situation. 'But Inverness are a good football team. I also have to congratulate them. They have had a good season and if they get a title it will be even better, so that's very good.' Insisting he had no issues over the red card for Gordon which forced him to remove the dangerous James Forrest and put Lukasz Zaluska in goals Deila vowed to lift his shatteted players for Wednesday's trip to Dundee on league business. Currently leading Aberdeen by five points with a game in hand he insisted: 'We have to move on. We still have a lot to fight for. Craig Gordon (left) was rightly sent off by the referee for fouling Marley Watkins when he went through . 'The league title is still the most important thing. We have to get back on track. 'Good teams bounce back quickly. Now on Wednesday we have to be back on track, and that's what we're aiming for. 'Everybody is very disappointed today. But I have had disappointing moments before in football. It's about how you handle it and what you learn from it. We've done a lot of good things so far and if we win the league as well we'll have had a good season. So we have a lot to build on. 'We just have to move on.

"As a Rangers diehard who once saw Treble dreams evaporate in the wake of a refereeing error that favoured Celtic, John Brown takes a predictably wry view of the anguish emanating from Parkhead in recent days. In 1989, Brown was part of the Ibrox side which contested an Old Firm Scottish Cup final with two trophies already banked. He was involved in a touchline tussle with Roy Aitken that saw the Celtic skipper seize the ball and take a throw-in that should have gone the other way. Ten seconds later – following a defensive blunder from Gary Stevens – Joe Miller had fired home the only goal of the game. Rangers legend John Brown says Celtic have a case of 'sour grapes' about their recent Scottish Cup exit . Twenty six years on, Celtic have seen their own hopes of a clean sweep disappear amid intense controversy. They have written to the SFA seeking 'to understand' how the match officials failed to spot the hand Josh Meekings used to block a Leigh Griffiths shot in their semi-final defeat to Inverness. Brown views the whole furore as 'a bit of sour grapes' that speaks of the frustration within his old rivals. 'It's hard for officials given the pace of the game,' said Brown. 'Celtic have been frustrated because they have not managed to win a Treble and Rangers have not been in the league for a number of years. I'm sure if Rangers were in that position they would have won a Treble in that time, probably two or three...' The last comment was delivered with a grin. Brown could rant at refs with the best of them during his time in charge of Dundee, not least when Alan Muir was fooled by a Peter Pawlett dive and awarded Aberdeen a penalty that effectively relegated the Dens Park side. Muir was the extra official behind the goal on Sunday and has shared the brunt of Celtic fans' wrath with ref Steven McLean. 'It basically put us down that day but it was one of those things, a referee's interpretation,' reflected a more sanguine Brown on his own brush with Muir. 'It is crazy now. The boy Steven McLean is a right good referee. Results went against me when he was refereeing and I was at Dundee. But he is a good ref, an honest guy. If he had seen it he would have given the penalty. 'If decisions went against me at Dundee, I would say to him through frustration. But when I thought about it, he never did it intentionally. I don' t think any of the officials do. Inverness defender Josh Meekings blocks a goal-bound header with his hand but no penalty is given . 'It is impossible for the guy on the line to see it (Meekings' handball). You see the angle of the ref, there is a defender in front of him. It is that quick a reaction. You have to judge it on what you see and if you don't see it you can't give it.' And what of 1989? Despite the impact of that throw-in call, Brown still believes Rangers only had themselves to blame. 'Bob Valentine was the ref - that's why I've never sent any Valentine's cards,' he quipped. 'But Rangers were bad that day. Celtic weren't much better but we did not deserve to win it, we were poor. 'The throw-in should have gone to us, but fair play to big Roy, he grabbed the ball. The officials let him away with it and Celtic won the game, but these things happen don't they?'

"Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season - even though he may not be around to parade them. The interim Ibrox manager still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the current campaign after being lured back to his old club to kick-start their faltering promotion bid. So far, everything is going to plan with Gers second in the Scottish Championship table and destined for a semi-final play-off slot. Stuart McCall says he is already looking at transfer targets for next season, though he may not be at Rangers . But with 12 players out of contract, McCall knows the Light Blues will need to strengthen if they have any chance of keeping pace with rivals Celtic next season - if they go up - and is already piecing together a wish list of potential new arrivals. He said: 'I've been speaking to a lot of agents and putting things in place for if and when... Even if I'm not here, if I'm getting players put to me who would like to come to Rangers regardless of the manager, then we build a little portfolio of positions that we will be needing next year. 'It's not a case of us standing still and then thinking come June 1, 'Oh we need to get into action'. 'No, there are a lot of agents who come to us and we build a little dossier of players that as a staff, we think will be good for next season, regardless of what league we are in. 'It would be slightly naive [if we were not doing that]. If I'm in charge or not, I still want the club to do well and I will put my view across to the board on who I think should be coming into the club and who should be here.' McCall is compiling a dossier on targets as he looks to put the club in the best possible position . Rangers have operated a haphazard transfer policy since re-emerging from the embers of liquidation. The club's team of scouts were jettisoned under the disastrous Craig Whyte regime and former boss Ally McCoist was largely forced to turn to a list of former Ibrox servants he had personal knowledge of when trying to bolster his squad. But McCall revealed the club's new board are now starting the process of re-establishing their spying network - albeit on a smaller level than before. 'I think there has been discussions behind the scenes with different people,' said the former Motherwell boss. 'I don't think we are at the stage where we were 10 or 15 years ago where we were aiming to get into the Champions League and bringing players in for three and four million yet. 'I don't think Rangers will be at the stage yet next year where we need international scouts everywhere. Rangers have expanded their scouting network after a haphazard system over the past few years . 'But certainly a scouting network needs to be put in place. 'Having said that, I spoke to Craig Levein at Hearts and they do a lot of their scouting with [online service] Wyscout. When I brought Henrik Ojamaa in at Motherwell, that was after I'd seen a clip of him on YouTube. I sold him for £350,000 after signing him for nothing. That was great. 'So you can still do your own background work. Personally I would always like to see the player myself. I've only ever signed one player without watching him first and slightly regretted it. 'So yeah we need a scouting network but at this moment where Rangers are, not to the extent where we have scouts all over Europe.' McCall admitted he still does not know if he will rejoin Gordon Strachan's Scotland staff for the June 13 Euro 2016 qualifier with Ireland in Dublin. And he also confessed to uncertainties ahead of Saturday's match with Falkirk. McCall's side are still in line for promotion, sitting in the play-off positions in the Scottish Championship . Peter Houston's Bairns - five points behind fourth-placed Queen of the South with two games to play - need an unlikely series of results to make the play-offs but McCall says that raises more questions than answers. He said: 'Housty is a wily old fox who has done terrifically well in his career so I don't know what to expect. 'It will take a difficult set of results for them to get into the play-offs so I don't know if they will come here and think the pressure is off and play care free. 'They don't lose many goals so we may have to be patient through the 90 minutes. We have had a couple of decent results against them but they have capable players and we will need to be at our best.'","Rangers are currently second in the Scottish Championship .

"John Hartson was once on the end of a major Hampden injustice while playing for Celtic - but he cannot see any point in his old club writing to the Scottish Football Association over the latest controversy at the national stadium. Celtic issued a statement on Monday evening revealing they were 'seeking an understanding' of the failure to penalise Inverness defender Josh Meekings for stopping a goal-bound Leigh Griffiths header with his hand. Celtic were leading 1-0 at the time but went on to lose 3-2 and some fans have questioned how referee Steven McLean and additional assistant Alan Muir could have missed the infringement. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings . Kris Commons of Celtic appeals unsuccessfully for a penalty before Celtic crash out . John Hartson, pictured at golf charity event, has urged his former club to move on from the injustice . Hartson had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside while Celtic were 2-1 down in an Old Firm League Cup final and the Welshman went on to miss a last-minute penalty that could have sparked extra-time. But he refused to dwell on the match officials' error - and called on Celtic to move on from the latest setback rather than writing letters. 'I'm not sure what sort of purpose it's going to serve,' said Hartson as he launched a 'Know Your Balls' testicular cancer awareness drive at his charity's annual golf day at Mar Hall in Bishopton. 'It has happened before and will happen again. There's a lot of disappointment at Celtic and rightly so, it should have been a penalty. David Raven (2nd right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring the late winner in 3-2 victory . Celtic pair Aleksandar Tonev (left) and John Guidetti look dejected as their hopes of a domestic treble end . 'I think the referee just missed it. When you are questioning people's integrity and honesty, that can sometimes go a little overboard. The referee just missed a decision, I'm sure if he'd seen it he would have given it. 'It happened to me in 2003 when I scored a legitimate goal against Rangers at Hampden Park in a cup final. It was proven to be two yards onside and it got called offside. It was a big moment for me. 'I was disappointed for two days and I got over it, and I think Celtic will get over it. 'They feel they have a right to complain, and that's what they want to do, but I'm not too sure what they are going to gain by it.' Hartson believes Ronny Deila can still class his first season as Celtic manager a success if they go on to clinch the Scottish Premiership title - they can move eight points clear of Aberdeen by beating Dundee at Dens Park on Wednesday. 'I think they will never get a better opportunity to win the treble,' the former Wales striker said. 'They got the League Cup final in the bag and they could have played a Championship team (Falkirk) in the final. Celtic manager Ronny Deila has criticised an official's decisions during Scottish Cup defeat to Inverness . 'So it's a missed opportunity but I think if you had offered a chance to win a double to a young rookie manager who had not managed anywhere near this level, a lot of people didn't know who he was, I think he would have taken that. 'When he sits in the summer and has a moment to himself he will probably realise it has been a successful season, tinged with disappointment because he has not joined great managers like Jock Stein and Martin O'Neill.

"The Rangers board have held their first meeting with Mike Ashley since assuming control at Ibrox. Interim chairman Paul Murray and director John Gilligan held talks with Ashley and other members of the Sports Direct hierarchy on Wednesday. While no details of the discussions have been disclosed, supporters will hope it may represent an initial step towards finding an amicable way forward with the billionaire owner of Newcastle United. Controversial Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has secured an 8.92 stake in Rangers . Murray, Gilligan and Dave King ousted Ashley allies Derek Llambias and Barry Leach from the Ibrox board at an EGM on March 6 and have since spent time studying all the club's existing contracts and commercial arrangements. Sports Direct loaned the previous Rangers regime £5million in January, receiving security over various assets – including club trademarks – in return. They also have the right, yet to be exercised, to appoint two directors to the board. That deal also saw Ashley's firm take a 75 per cent grip of the Rangers Retail subsidiary, increasing their stranglehold over merchandising income. The new Ibrox board last month revealed they would not be drawing down the second £5 million available from Sports Direct, instead accepting a £1.5 million loan from the Three Bears consortium for short-term financing while they formulate a longer-term funding plan.

"Walter Smith says Ally McCoist deserves a chance to prove himself as a successful manager at a stable club. The Ibrox legend worked closely with McCoist and coach Kenny McDowall before the duo assumed the reins at Rangers during four years of unprecedented turmoil off and on the pitch. Charged with leading the club back to the Premiership from the bottom tier, McCoist finally resigned and was placed on gardening leave in December and is still earning £14,000 a week while his 12-month notice period runs down. Walter Smith says Ally McCoist deserves a chance to prove himself a successful manager at a stable club . McDowall, who reluctantly took over as caretaker boss before leaving in March to be replaced by Stuart McCall, is also awaiting a final severance deal which would free him up to work elsewhere. Yet despite leaving the club under a cloud, Smith insists that both men have something left to offer in football, and he blames boardroom turmoil under Craig Whyte, Charles Green and the Mike Ashley-Easdale Brothers axis for contributing towards an unmanageable situation. ‘I think they want an opportunity,’ said the former Rangers manager and chairman of his two former colleagues. ‘After working with them for a number of years and them getting the opportunity to go in and take over, which I got when Graeme (Souness) left, the boys were always hoping they would get the opportunity. ‘There was no guarantee of that, but they got it, and you have got to say that the circumstances they worked under were probably the poorest of any manager at any time in Rangers’ history. ‘People can make their own judgments of how a manager does a job. All I would say is that everyone has to have support. ‘I got the support of David Murray when I was manager at Rangers and he was a big help to me. They never had that help, they didn’t get any help. ‘Stuart (McCall) has come in at a time when everybody is looking a bit brighter for a change at Rangers. It is a good time for him to come in. Stuart McCall is now in charge of the Scottish Championship side and has impressed since taking over . ‘It certainly wasn’t a good time when Alistair took over. Craig Whyte came in and that coincided with Alistair, I felt, not getting a fair opportunity. ‘It is very difficult to judge him as a manager under the circumstances that he worked in. I certainly wouldn’t have liked to have worked under them anyway.’ The McCoist legacy has drawn unfavourable comments from supporters. Signings such as Dean Shiels, David Templeton and Ian Black arrived on wages which were barely justified by their performances in a light blue shirt. Some voiced doubts over McCoist’s tactical acumen while others asked why younger players weren’t given more of a chance to blossom in the lower leagues. Yet Smith argues that both McCoist and McDowall deserve to be remembered for what they did during his own highly successful second spell at Rangers, prior to the financial tsunami which plunged the club over a fiscal cliff. ‘I was the manager, Alistair was the assistant manager and Kenny was the coach and, for four and a half years when the club was well run, we did well,’ said the former Scotland boss. Smith believes Ally McCoist deserves a chance to prove himself a successful manager at a stable club . ‘I am not a miracle person, I couldn’t run Rangers Football Club on my own. The people that I worked with there did a terrific job. I know their strengths. Everyone has got strengths and weaknesses and I know theirs. ‘I read in the paper that Ally can’t manage. He had never managed a football club before, and neither had I when I took over. ‘Imagine when you have never managed a football club before, going into Rangers and being there for four years under the circumstances that they were in? ‘People say: “He will ask Walter Smith for advice” but I had never been in that circumstance before, so how could I give him any advice in terms of how Rangers were being run? It is an unfair judgement for people to make on him because of the circumstances. McCoist is Rangers record scorer but was axed as manager amid speculation surrounding the clubs future . ‘Alistair and Kenny would take a lot of the training, and I read that he (McDowall) couldn’t coach. Kenny McDowall is a terrific coach. He is excellent at his job and one of the most organised people I have ever worked with. Yet I hear all these assessments. ‘If you don’t get results, people make those assessments, but they are not correct. ‘For me, the main circumstance is why they didn’t work out under Alistair and Kenny, who didn’t want to be the manager. The circumstances weren’t right.’","Walter Smith believes Ally McCoist deserves another managerial job .

"Former Rangers defender John Brown insists Ally McCoist will be welcomed back to Ibrox 'with open arms.' The club's record scorer has not been spotted at his old stomping ground since his surprise appearance appeared at last month's general meeting to see the board which axed him as boss swept out of power. It was a fleeting visit as the 53-year-old crept into the ground just moments before shareholders gave Dave King's bid for power their blessing, before hurrying away afterwards. Ally McCoist will be welcome back to the club 'with open arms' according to club legend John Brown . McCoist was removed from the manager's office back in December as relations with the old board crumbled and has spent the four months since on garden leave. The terms of his contract mean the nine-in-a-row favourite cannot return until his 12-month notice period expires. But Brown insists King's team will never turn their back on a man who struck 355 goals in Light Blue - even if his tenure as manager ended in disappointment as Hearts romped towards the Scottish Championship title. The former Dundee manager, himself, was made an outcast under the old regime after branding former directors Sandy and James Easdales 'rats' but along with former skipper John Grieg, he has now joined King in the directors box for home matches. McCoist is Rangers record scorer but was axed as manager amid speculation surrounding the clubs future . Brown - helping to promote the Rangers First fans group - said: 'I know what Ally went through as manager. I worked under him when Craig Whyte was in charge. 'I knew the problems he had dealing with Whyte and things never improved after that. 'If you don't have the man at the top of the tree working with you then it is always going to be a hard shift. It proved to be that way and it took its toll on Ally. 'But the Rangers fans love Ally and I'm sure in time he will be welcomed back at the club with open arms. 'People can criticise the football played at the time but remember, he was dealing with the worst board in Rangers' history. To work under those circumstances must be difficult. 'Ally will be back in there at some stage and I know it will be sooner rather than later. 'He has got Rangers in his blood and is loved by the supporters for what he did during nine in a row. Whether they were critical over his term as manager or not, they remember what he gave to the club.' John Brown says that the fans love McCoist and he'd always be welcomed back at Ibrox . Brown was a long-term critic of former chief executive Charles Green and the men who followed him onto the board. But he has no issue with King becoming the club's new ruler. The Johannesburg-based businessman has delayed his coronation as chairman while he tries to prove to the Scottish Football Association he is fit and proper. But Brown said: 'Dave has got Rangers at heart. He's got money to put into the club - Rangers need that money. 'Whatever happens at the SFA happens. But I think Dave would be good for Rangers, especially with the guys he has brought with him such as the Three Bears and the money he will generate for the club. 'Dave has bought the shares and put his money up, so he should be given the opportunity to take up the chairmanship. Stuart McCall is now in charge of the Scottish Championship side and has impressed since taking over . 'The previous board took tens of millions of pounds out the club and I would like to see SFA think long and hard. 'Hopefully Dave will be sanctioned to go ahead and build Rangers back up to the club that I remember, capable of winning trophies.' One of the new board's first acts was to appoint Stuart McCall as interim boss until the end of the season. Brown believes his former Ibrox team-mate should keep the job full-time - but he does not think Rangers should even contemplate hanging around in the second-tier for another season if they can help it. He said: 'Stuart has done great and given himself a great opportunity of getting the job. I hope he gets it. 'Rangers are a massive club, the biggest in Scotland. They need Premiership football. They have been out of the top division for too long. 'The simple answer is that Rangers need to be back up there now. 'Rangers will challenge Celtic if they get back into the Premier League. 'There will be a big turnaround in players. Whether it's Stuart McCall or someone else, they will be able to attract players good enough to compete against Celtic in the next year to two years.'","Rangers legend John Brown insistent Ally McCoist can return to the club .

"Bacary Sagna could end the season trophyless and lower than Arsenal in the Premier League but the Manchester City defender insists he has no regrets about leaving the Emirates for the Etihad. Sagna's acrimonious departure from Arsenal when his contract expired at the end of last season left many Gunners fans dismayed at a perceived lack of loyalty from the defender. The France international has played only 16 times for City this season in an underwhelming campaign both for him and the Premier League holders, who are languishing in fourth. Bacary Sagna (right) insists he does not regret leaving Arsenal for Manchester City last summer . Sangna (right) has only made 16 appearances and City are fourth in the Premier League, with Arsenal second . Sagna departed Arsenal on the back of winning the FA Cup but faces a year without a trophy at City . But the 32-year-old Sagna says if he was faced with the decision again, he would make the same choice. 'I see a lot of comments from fans saying I should have stayed at Arsenal but if I had to do it again, if I had to come back and sign for City, I would have done it again,' Sagna told the Manchester Evening News. 'I'm happy because I came to the champions.' Sagna departed the Emirates on the back of an FA Cup triumph but arrived at City with the club having won the Premier League. A year later, Arsenal are gearing up to defend their trophy against Aston Villa in the final at Wembley but City's Premier League title will almost certainly be claimed by Chelsea. Sagna is philosophical about how City and Arsenal's seasons have unravelled. 'When I signed I just wanted to come, give the maximum, and give my best for the club then after, it’s life, no?' Sagna said. Sagna (left) said he would make the same decision again if he was faced with a similar choice . Sagna believes Manuel Pellegrini's City side will soon return to winning ways and end the season well . Sanga also brushed aside fears that City could be usurped from the Champions League qualifying places and believes Manuel Pellegrini's side will swiftly return to winning ways.

"Arsene Wenger insists his woeful record against Jose Mourinho will have no bearing on Arsenal's top-of-the-table clash with Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Wenger has failed to win in 12 games against Mourinho across the Portuguese coach's two spells at Stamford Bridge, drawing five and losing seven of their clashes. But the Arsenal manager says the past shared between the two managers on the touchline in Sunday's 4pm kick-off will be irrelevant as the Barclays Premier League's top two sides face off. Arsene Wenger has drawn five and lost seven of his 12 clashes with Jose Mourinho ahead of facing Chelsea . Wenger and Mourinho rowed on the touchline in October's 2-0 win for Chelsea in the reverse fixture . 'I think we have not always lost in 12 attempts. We have been close,' Wenger said. 'Having said that, the result on Sunday will just be down to the performance on the day. We are on a good run and we have an opportunity at home to beat them and we want to take it. 'We have a good run of form and good belief and solidarity. We have passed many tests recently when we were questioned. We have another test on Sunday that we want to pass. 'Chelsea's strengths are they have been very efficient on counter attacks and set-pieces as well. We have to nullify their strengths.' Asked about his frosty relationship with Mourinho, Wenger said: 'I do not want to talk about that. What is interesting for people is when the game starts at 4pm we have a great game. It is not about the relationship between the managers.' The managers of London's two biggest clubs have long had a frosty relationship in the opposing dugouts . Cesc Fabregas set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Arsenal are 10 points behind Chelsea but come into the game on the back of excellent form. Wenger said: 'Look, mathematically it will be possible, yes, but Chelsea has their future and the championship in their hands. We can get closer and we have an opportunity to do that at home and want to take it.' Wenger added: 'They have been very consistent until now. They have fewer losses than any team. The Premier League rewards consistency. On that front they gave been defensively very strong and consistent.' Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010 . Sunday's game marks the return of former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who will be wearing Chelsea blue at the Emirates for the first time. Fabregas left for Barcelona in 2011. Arsenal supporters are expected to give their former hero a hot reception after he joined their fierce rivals, but Wenger has asked for some respect for one of their best players of the last decade. 'I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday to be respected like he deserves,' he said. Asked if he regretted not signing Fabregas in the summer when he had the option to, Wenger added: 'The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. 'This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc’s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here. I believe I would rather it was the other way around.' Wenger is without Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mikel Arteta on Sunday, while Per Mertesacker is rated as '50-50' by his manager having not trained at all this week. Gunners fans welcome back Fabregas with Barcelona, but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time .","Arsenal face table-topping Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday .

"Mauricio Pochettino has blamed Tottenham's lunchtime lethargy this season on the Europa League campaign. Of 10 Barclays Premier League matches kicking off at 12.00, 12.45 or 1.30, Spurs have won two - against QPR last August and Arsenal in February - collecting nine points out of a possible 30. Six of the matches followed Europa League games on Thursday nights, and Spurs lost four of those and drew the other two. Harry Kane is pictured celebrating for Tottenham after scoring in their victory at Newcastle last week . Christian Eriksen is mobbed by his  team-mates after netting Tottenham's second goal at Newcastle . Pochettino, whose side play his former club Southampton at 12.45 at St Mary's on Saturday, said: 'Maybe this is a coincidence. Or maybe this is because we play Thursday around Europe and have no recovery. 'I don't know. It's difficult to understand why. Maybe it's because we have played Thursday night and spent a lot of energy.' Spurs have fared better in later kick-offs. 'Maybe three or four hours more of recovery is better,' Pochettino said. 'That can affect that.' The Argentine dismissed the prospect of goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who could return after missing three matches with a knee injury, seeking a move if Spurs miss out on the top four this term. 'Hugo wants to play the Champions League here for Tottenham and I think this is a rumour and nothing true,' added the Spurs boss, whose only definite absentee is Kyle Walker. 'Hugo is very happy here and wants to reach the Champions League with Tottenham. This is his dream.' Hugo Lloris will stay at Tottenham even if the club fail to qualify for the Champions League, says Pochettino . Pochettino is looking forward to returning to St Mary's with Spurs after leaving Southampton last summer. The 43-year-old headed a host of departures - including key players and the backroom staff - leaving successor Ronald Koeman to rebuild. 'We finished last season eighth in the table,' Pochettino said, recalling his time at Southampton. 'We played very well and it was the end the project of five years with Nicola Cortese and Markus Liebherr. 'We stabilised the club in the Premier League and top 10 and I'm very happy. It was good for Southampton because I love the people of Southampton, the players. 'Koeman has continued to develop the project, or a new project, and it's a fantastic job and he deserves the praise.' Pochettino is uncertain what reception to expect.

"Former Bayern Munich manager Ottmar Hitzfeld believes the German giants should replace Pep Guardiola with Borussia Monchengladbach boss Lucien Favre.

"Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola 'would not go to a club like Manchester City' and will see out his three-year contract with the German champions, club CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on Thursday. Guardiola, who joined in 2013 after winning 14 titles in four seasons at Barcelona and taking a year out, has been a top target for several European clubs. The Spaniard, who won the domestic double last season, has repeatedly been linked with a possible move to last season's Premier League champions Manchester City. Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola will see out his three-year contract, claims Karl-Heinz Rummenigge . Speculation intensified in the days after Bayern's 3-1 Champions League quarter-final, first-leg loss at Porto last week and the subsequent departure of their long-time team doctor, who said his medical team was blamed for the defeat. But their 6-1 demolition of the Portuguese outfit on Tuesday saw Bayern book a semi-final spot with Guardiola on track for a treble of titles in his second season. 'I know very well that he will be the coach here at least until June 30, 2016,' Rummenigge told Bild. Guardiola celebrates during Bayern's 6-1 Champions League quarter-final victory against Porto . He said contract extension talks would take place in the second half of the year, following the end of the season. 'The aim is to extend Guardiola's contract and I think we have very good chances that he remains the coach here beyond 2016.' Recent contact between Guardiola and former Barcelona colleague Txiki Begiristain, who is now City's sports director, was no reason for concern for Bayern, Rummenigge said. The Bayern players celebrates after reaching the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday night . 'I am not worried about that. This just proves the quality of the coach. I am also aware that Begiristain worked with Guardiola at Barcelona at some point. 'But I cannot imagine that Pep would go to a club like Manchester City.' Bayern could win the Bundesliga title this weekend and take on Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final before their Champions League semi-final next month.

"Four genuine European heavyweights remain in the Champions League, a quartet steeped in history and silverware. Between Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Juventus, the big-eared trophy has been lifted 21 times. Any of those clubs would be deserving finalists in the Olympiastadion in Berlin on June 6. But for tension, intrigue, and the potential for high drama, the match-up that most appeals has to be Real Madrid versus Barcelona. Javier Hernandez's late winner against Atletico Madrid sent Real Madrid into the Champions League semis . Neymar scored both goals in the second leg as Barcelona beat Paris Saint-Germain 5-1 on aggregate . Transporting El Clasico to east Germany would bring a defining chapter to a myriad narratives, raising Europe’s grandest derby to a level not seen amid years of ebb and flow between the two Spanish behemoths. We have seen plenty of tangles in recent years, notably the Champions League semi-final of 2011, and some may insist the unseemly battles when the pair faced off 12 times in 19 months a couple of years ago became too much. But never have they duelled in the continent's largest match. That would crystalise their competition. It would be a fascinating game. Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League trophy and second in a row with Real . Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left), Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) They have only met twice this season, both times in La Liga. Real Madrid won 3-1 at the Bernabeu before Christmas before Barcelona's 2-1 win at the Nou Camp last month, so the appetite is not sated this campaign. A deciding third bout at Europe’s main event would draw global crowds not witnessed before. Just think: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the pre-eminent practitioners of this era, head-to-head for the biggest club prize of all. The Preener v the Peruser, Portugal’s athletic might against Argentina’s diminutive delight, the current Ballon d’Or holder against the man who won four consecutively. Barcelona won 3-1 on aggregate when the sides met in the semi-finals of the 2011 Champions League . Gareth Bale scored the winner when Real Madrid beat Barcelona in the 2014 Spanish Cup final . Bale celebrates at the Mestalla after scoring a wonder goal that won the Spanish Cup for Barcelona . Pep Guardiola could come up against his former team Barcelona after guiding Bayern into the last four . Then there's the undercard fights for supremacy: Gareth Bale, the world’s most expensive signing on paper, vying with Neymar, the game’s costliest player when all told; Karim Benzema, that deadly Frenchman, versus Luis Suarez, the indefatigable Uruguayan (both tied on six Champions League goals this season, by the way). Both teams have a trident attack to strike fear into their opponents. Whose will triumph on the biggest stage? It is an intriguing question to pose. Then we have Carlo Ancelotti trying to save his job by going for his fourth European Cup as a manager, against Luis Enrique, who has weathered a storm in his debut season to break the record for number of club wins (42) in a head coach's first 50 games. As a player he won La Liga with both Real and Barca but never the Champions League. Messi and Ronaldo have had many duels, and could have another one this season in the Champions League . Pepe heads home during Real Madrid's 3-1 win over Barcelona in the Clasico at the Bernabeu in October . Suarez scored what proved to be the winner when Barcelona won the La Liga meeting in March . Pep Guardiola facing his old club, the place he delivered dream football and two European Cups, would be tantalising – be we can have that in the semi-final. He needs to visit the Nou Camp as an opposition manager. That would leave Real vs Juventus in the other last-four match. Two teams with plenty of shared history, not least the 1998 Champions League final when the Italian side’s Zinedine Zidane, now a Real coach, was denied by Predrag Mijatovic’s goal. Yes, Real vs Barca on a June evening in Berlin would capture imaginations and invite the world to watch. Mar 22, 2015 - La Liga, Barcelona 2-1 Real Madrid .

"Walter Smith is reluctant to predict a permanent end to hostilities. Two years since he stepped down as chairman of Rangers, the crackle of gunfire still reverberates in his ears. A declaration of peace in our time is premature. Dave King, the chairman-elect, has still to obtain the SFA clearance he needs for a seat in the boardroom. Details of how the club proposes to stabilise the finances have yet to come. And the Championship promotion play-offs threaten more landmines than the Somme. Yet before participating in the annual charity golf day of the John Hartson Foundation, the Rangers icon expressed hope that the worst is over. That Rangers can put down the circus tent and become a football club once more. (Left to right): Singer Steve McCrorie joins John Hartson and Walter Smith at a charity golf match . Former Rangers chairman and manager Smith hopes that the club can move on from its off-field dramas . 'I think it's a good thing for the club that it has settled down now and the EGM is out of the way and the people can get involved with running the football club,' said Smith. 'In the last three weeks there has been a lack of headlines and that's the first step forward for Rangers. 'The whole club faces a big, big period in its history. 'They have to get back to resembling Rangers Football Club. No club wins all the time and Rangers have had down periods before, even if this one is different. 'Everyone has to adjust to it. People on the outside, fans, everyone. 'There was a lack of trust before. It was simple. Now there isn't. 'They trust the people are there for Rangers — and that's a big start after three or four years of upset.' Smith exposed himself to the crossfire when he returned — against his instincts — as chairman. It is a decision he regrets and, despite the return to the club of familiar faces such as King and Paul Murray, he is 67 now and has no need to embroil himself in the grief or stress of it all a minute longer. Asked if he would offer help or assistance to the new regime, Smith said: 'I think they are unlikely to do that. I made my part quite clear — I don't think they will ask. There is a board there in place and they will make the decisions. 'I made mine when I left and I won't go back. 'They are not liable to ask me what course of action they will take. 'A lot of the decisions right now are financial and that's never been my department.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle United, scores agianst Dumbarton . Rangers' teenage striker Ryan Hardie scores his first goal agianst Dumbarton in the Scottish Championship . Hardie celebrates after scoring a brace during the Scottish Championship match against Dumbarton . Smith knows King from his second spell as manager. The South African businessman was a director of the oldco before administration and liquidation and, because he served on the board during the five years prior to an insolvency event, he breaches article 10 of the SFA rulebook. He may do so on two counts. As part of his settlement with the South African tax authorities, King agreed to pay £43.7million but was convicted of 41 breaches of section 75 of the SA Income Tax Act. In return for paying £210,000, he was spared 82 years in jail — two years on each count. The SFA are gathering evidence on this and until they pass judgment one way or the other, King has agreed to stay off the Rangers board. He doesn't have to be chairman or run the show to invest cash, but Smith believes it would be better if the two ran hand in hand. 'The courts seem to think he's OK,' said Smith on the issue. 'The SFA will give their own judgment on it. 'Dave has stepped in, so I don't see things changing in terms of how Rangers moves forward if he is officially or unofficially a part of it. 'It would obviously be better if he could be involved at the club — that would be better for everyone. 'I don't know all the background of what constitutes a fit-and- proper person. They have obviously got to show a bit of care with Rangers after what has gone on. I think that is what they are doing at the moment. 'I don't know what the outcome will be. I don't think it will make a massive difference to Rangers one way or the other. But the preferable aspect would be that he would be involved at the club.' Dumbarton's Garry Flemming (left) comes in with a strong challenge on Rangers' Darren McGregor (right) Rangers were never likely to be a quick fix. Promotion to the Premiership remains fraught with doubt and there are large question marks over who the manager will be next season and how much cash he may have to build a new squad. 'A few bad results and you get the sack — and someone comes in and performances are lifted,' Smith observed. 'That's what happened and it's a starting point for Rangers. 'They have to build on what they are trying to do. It's just a start and people have to remember it. 'But patience and Rangers don't really go hand in hand and never have done. There is more understanding. I won't say patience. 'That goes for all aspects of the club, on and off the pitch. It takes time to clear things off the pitch, but the pressure is always on to win regardless of off-field circumstances. 'There is an understanding of what needs to be done to take a step forward. 'Stuart McCall has been bold enough to take the job and he'll stand by his results over that period. 'It is going to take time. They are not going to jump into the Premiership and challenge Celtic right away. But that is where they should be playing. And, for Scottish football, that is where they should be playing as well.'

"Ask Manny Pacquiao why he believes boxing to be the greatest sport of all and there is no mention of the $120 million or more he will be paid for going toe-to-toe with Floyd Mayweather in the most lucrative fist fight in history. Rather, his mind goes back to when the PacMan was the PacKid, a 12-year-old urchin in the mud of the Philippines whose mother was eking out the food for the family. ‘Somebody told me and my friends some fights were being put on in the town,’ he recalls. ‘I did not know what boxing was but they said they you got a prize whatever the result. Two hundred pesos (two dollars) to win, a hundred to lose.’ Manny Pacquiao was the star attraction as he held an open workout in Los Angeles on Wednesday . Pacquiao was in good spirits as he showed off his skills for the gathered crowd at the Wild Card gym . Pacquiao addressed gathered media and talked about his upcoming May 2 fight with Floyd Mayweather . Pacquaio opened up about his motivation, his belief in God and journey to the top in boxing . Pacquaio works out in the ring in front of the world's media . Pacquiao does some pad work with trainer Freddie Roach . Pacquiao held an open training session at the Wild Card gym in Hollywood . The Filipino star works on his body shots with Roach . 'So we went and I won. I took the two dollars home and gave them to my mother so she could put more food on the table. But when she asked where I got the money I didn’t tell her it was for fighting. ‘We went back every Sunday and I kept winning the two dollars. Then my uncle came with a stack of videos and I watched Ali and Foreman and Holyfield and so many others.’ And so it began. ‘Boxing is the best sport because it teaches you about life,’ he says. ‘It taught me you will receive if you give back.’ It is a lesson he wants to pass on to Mayweather. ‘When this fight is finished I would like us to sit down quietly together to talk,’ says Pacquiao. ‘I want to speak to him about the Gospel of the Lord and how everything we get is a gift from God. How we are the stewards of this blessing and should use it for good.’ Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) do some padwork as the media gather to watch . Pacquiao showed off his impressive speed - which he will hope will trouble Mayweather . Pacquiao looked calm and content as he went through his stretching and warm-up routine . Pacquiao and Roach take a break from the workout as they prepare for the biggest fight of their lives . Twenty-four hours earlier the equivalent story told by Mayweather was of how he told those close to him that he would become the first boxer to earn more than a hundred million bucks in a night. And since he is reputed to spend his fortunes on fast cars, fast living and fast women, this may seem an unlikely post-fight reunion. But the PacMan smooths the way to the Money Man by saying: ‘Floyd deserves his money because he’s earned it. He has the right to use it his way. But I would like to tell him how good it feels to help people who need it, like giving them plots of land and the houses they build on them.’ Pacquiao’s generosity to his impoverished countrymen is as legendary as Mayweather’s excesses, although it should be stressed that Floyd Jnr is a charitable benefactor himself. But there is a difference, also, in their view of their craft. Mayweather admits that he has fallen out of love with boxing and regards it now as a business. Pacquiao says: ‘Boxing is still my passion. I do it to please the fans, to give them excitement in return for their support. Not for the money. I am not a materialist. Pacquiao started to warm-up in front of the gathered crowd after first speaking to the media (right) Pacquiao opened up about his journey from fighting in the Philippines to the richest boxing bout in history . Pacquiao says he wants to entertain the fans and has warned Mayweather that his killer instinct is back . ‘Now we have one of the biggest fights in history. But it’s not about how much we will be paid. Whether it’s two dollars or a hundred million dollars - it’s what you do with it.’ Mayweather suspects that Pacquiao’sl determination to give the fans their money’s worth – especially when they will be forking out huge amounts in Las Vegas on May to watch their Fight of the Century – may be his downfall. He describes Pacquiao as a reckless fighter, citing his shocking KO by Juan Manuel Marquez as proof. The PacMan responds: ‘We would be nothing without the fans and this fight would not be so big. So we should entertain them. Yes, sometimes there is a price to pay, but it is worth it.’ There is method to what Mayweather regards as madness. Floyd Jnr morphed into Mr Money by virtue of one of the most clever defences ever erected in the prize-ring. PacMan says: ‘Boxing is about punching.’ Pacquiao's trainer Roach was also much sought after at the Wild Card gym in Los Angeles . Roach had concerns that Pacquiao led too busy a lifestyle and it was previously affecting his performances . He would like to draw his rival as the best pound-for-pound boxer into an open fight: ‘If he comes to try to knock me out it would be good for me. We’ll see. ‘But whatever happens it should be a better fight than five years ago, when everyone says it should have happened. We are fully developed as fighters and the world is watching now.’ Mayweather keeps insisting it is ‘just another fight.’ Pacquiao says: ‘I’m excited. I love it. No, this fight will not define my career. That is done by all my accomplishments in becoming the only eight-division world champion. But winning this will be a big additional achievement for my legacy,’ He did bridle when Mayweather’s Money Team insinuated that he had risen through the weights with the help of chemical substances, which was why he challenged his opponent that if one of them tested positive for drugs that man should pay the other $5 million. It was an offer Mayweather refused. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum talks to the media ahead of the fight with Mayweather in May . But perhaps, naturally charming though he is and endlessly obliging to all and sundry, a little of that resentment is driving him on. His trainer Freddie Roach had been concerned that in rediscovering God and purifying his life-style he may have lost some of his bite – and hence the drop in knock-out ratio. Pacquiao says; ‘My determination to win has never been higher than for this fight. My killer instinct is back.’ At this very moment his pet Jack Russell terrier, also called PacMan and who accompanies him everywhere including the gym, barks. Loudly enough to be heard above the frenzied clamour of his master’s media day at Roach’s iconic Wild Card gym in West Hollywood. Pacquiao grins: ‘It’s nothing personal with Mayweather. We are just fighting for many things.’ Floyd Mayweather hit the pads with uncle Roger during a media workout at his Las Vegas gym on Tuesday . Mayweather revealed he is no longer enjoying his boxing and sees the sport more as a business now . Mayweather works to the body with co-trainer Nate Jones in front of a huge crowd at his gym . There is no re-match clause in the contract and Mayweather has expressed no appetite for there to be a second fight. But for Pacquiao one good reason would be for him to even up split of the gigantic purse. ‘I am not happy to have conceded 60-40 per cent to Floyd,’ he says. ‘Negotiating would be easier for the re-match. To make this happen we had to give him everything he wanted. If there is a next time it would be a different deal. ‘Not for me. For my people. I cannot see anyone going hungry and not help them.’ Once again, his mind is taking him back 24 years to the Philippines and those two-dollar fights.","Manny Pacquiao held a media workout at the famous Wild Card Gym .

"Floyd Mayweather is down to within three-and-a-half pounds of the welterweight limit with more than three weeks still to go before he meets Manny Pacquiao in the Fight of the Century. Mayweather was photographed taking the scales for the WBC’s mandatory weight check 30 days before a world title fight. The boxers are required to weigh no more than 10 per cent in excess of the 147 lb welter limit. Floyd Mayweather is down to within three-and-a-half pounds of the welterweight limit ahead of mega-fight . The electronic machine showed Mayweather at 150.5 lbs. There was a modicum of surplus fat at the sides of his waist but he looks well on track with his conditioning. Pacquiao is also understood to be comfortably within the 30-day stipulation. The checks are designed to prevent boxers draining off too much poundage at the last minute, which increases the risk of brain damage through fluid loss. Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month . Both men will weigh-in again seven days before the fight, when they must be within five per cent of the welterweight limit. Earlier on Wednesday Mayweather took to his Instagram account to show that rest and recovery is just has important as his tough training regime. Mayweather, who is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak against the Filipino fighter, posted a video of himself receiving a SubZero recovery cool down in Las Vegas. The cold sauna, known as a Cryotherapy Chamber, is used to help rejuvenate the body after a heavy workout. A session at -200 degrees usually lasts 1-3 minutes and helps speed up muscle recovery as well as decrease inflammation and muscle soreness after exercise. The pair will go head-to-head in a $300million mega-fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 .","Floyd Mayweather is closing in on welterweight limit, WBC checks show .

"Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for.

There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'","Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather meet in Las Vegas on May 2 in 'The Fight of the Century'

"Floyd Mayweather Jnr recalls the reaction of his friends on the day he set himself up as an independent boxing business and told them: 'The time will come when I make a hundred million dollars in one night.' He says: 'They told me I was crazy.' That was when he broke away from Bob Arum, who is the promoter of the other combatant in the richest fight of all time. Manny Pacquiao will also earn more than $100million in Las Vegas on May 2. But Mayweather takes special pride in being his own boss as they break the boxing bank.

Mayweather boxing camp coordinator DeJuan Blake helps his cousin do neck exercises as he works out . As the master of his own destiny, the man who calls himself Money dictated when this mega-mega-fight between the two best boxers on the planet would happen. 'Five years too late,' cry the critics. 'It's all in the timing,' smiles Floyd. Five years ago they would have split $60m at most. Five years ago only the boxing fraternity would have been paying attention. Five years ago we would have pitched up at his gym when we liked. Now Mayweather will bank upwards of $180m, Pacquiao $120m. Now the whole wide world is waiting their collision with bated breath. On this frantic Tuesday, heavy security guarded the Mayweather Boxing Club for his media day. Cameras from more than 30 television stations, scores of journalists and his usual crew of friends and admirers await and eventually witness a nominal workout in that overcrowded, overheated room. Ironically, given that the human threat to his unbeaten record is from Manila, the location is in a mini-Chinatown. Does Floyd eat Filipino? There are Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese cafes... but no restaurants specialising in Philippines food. Cutman Rafael Garcia puts tape over the eyes and mouth of an image of Pacquiao on the wall .

Mayweather is flanked by his team as his hands are wrapped before the workout on Tuesday . Mayweather switches to the bag as he shows off the skills he believes will be enough to beat Pacquiao . Floyd Mayweather suspects Manny Pacquiao has a neurosis about being the smaller man, which leads him to wear lifts in the heel of his shoes when they stand face to face. Asked if he thought Pacquiao had been bothered by anything at their fight-launch stare-down, Mayweather said: 'He's been surprised to see me so much bigger and taller. And I know he wears little lifts in his shoes.' The tale of the tape measures Mayweather standing 5ft 8in, Pacquiao 5ft 6½ in. Mayweather arrived, somewhat on the late side, in his new, state-of-the-art, very expensive Mercedes Party Bus. He was preceded into the parking lot by his latest girlfriend driving an even costlier white Rolls Bentley coupe. The rest of the super-charged fleet stayed home in the mansion's garage. Floyd was followed to work by an LAPD police car. Only this time they were not chasing the man who has had his run-ins with the law. They were guarding one of the most important assets of the city of Las Vegas, which stands to profit by billions in big fight week. All in the timing. 'This thing just grows and grows,' says Mayweather. 'We now have one of the biggest fights ever in boxing history. And its not only about the money. 'One fight won't define my legacy. What about the 47 I've already won? 'It's an important fight. It wraps everything together – the money and my boxing. 'But if one fight defined everything this would be the only one I'd have needed.' And after this, he says, there will be only one more. Because it no longer amuses him like it did. 'I'm pretty much done with all this,' he tells a few of us summoned into a pocket in the middle of a crowd of people and cameras huge enough to do justice to a royal wedding. 'It's not fun like it was back then,' he explains. 'It's business now. I don't really enjoy it any longer.' He promises to fulfil the sixth and last fight of his mega-millions Showtime pay-per-view contract: 'Final one at the MGM Grand in September.'

Mayweather took time to speak to the media at one of the few such events before fight week in Las Vegas . Mayweather speaks to the media with the giant figure of Pacquiao looming in the background . Why always the MGM Grand Garden? He grins, shakes a right wrist wrapped in a glittering diamond and gold bracelet. It reminds him of the first time tickets for a fight of his there sold out inside six minutes and he happened to mention he had noticed a bejewelled watch in a shop window at one of the MGM hotels. 'They just went and got it as a gift for me,' he says. 'Ran to about $400,000.' He's come a long way from the drug-strewn, gangland streets of Grand Rapids, Michigan where he grew up in poverty. But much as those baubles are stamped with the hallmarks of his journey to wealth and fame, Mayweather knows it was a human quality which made it possible. 'Loyalty,' he says. 'Loyalty is the heartbeat of boxing. Whenever I need something the MGM get it for me. When I fight one of the biggest fights of all time, I take it to the MGM Grand Garden.' The clamour around him never stops but there have been heavily hyped events like this before which have turned into anti-climax for the public. Will this one be worth the money, at $10,000 for a ringside seat rising to more than $200,000 on the black market, at virtually $100 per pay-per-view buy here in America? It's all in the timing: 'Our names are way bigger than five years ago. You have the two best in the world fighting each other, at the pinnacle of their careers. And our styles should work. It'll be exciting.' Mayweather warms up by doing sit ups before he works out in front of the media . Having arrived late for his own workout, Mayweather worked up a sweat with his trainers . Mayweather laughs with David Hasselhoff, who was among the celebrities to attend the workout . American rapper Lil' Kim also stopped by the gym to watch Mayweather perform his workout . Hayley Roberts and Hasselhoff arrive at the gym in Las Vegas to see Mayweather put through his paces . Not that Mayweather is exactly jumping around in frenzied expectation: 'I'm not excited. This is another fight for me. Yeah it's big but basically it's no different from all the others. Once we get in that ring it's a level playing field. 'At my age (38) I'm over getting nervous about an opponent. I'm past getting wound up. What I have to do is get in that ring and be myself. Be the best Floyd Mayweather.' That, he is sure, will be enough to win. The fight sells itself. But he carries a quiet air of confidence. There is much speculation about Pacquiao storming his fabled defence but he says: 'We'll see. I know I can make adjustments to any fighter. Whatever he does, I can assess and make changes if I have to. 'I'm calm, smooth, calculated and thinking five steps ahead of any opponent. But can he adjust? He's a reckless fighter. We saw that when he got knocked out by (Juan Manuel) Marquez.' All in the timing? Mayweather is grateful that Pacquiao has survived long enough to play his part in what is fast approaching a half-billion dollar extravaganza. 'If I fought as reckless as Manny,' he says. 'I wouldn't be here today. I'd be beaten up, worn out. I've controlled my fights.' Mayweather works the heavy bag with just over two weeks to go before he steps into the ring with Pacquiao . Mayweather throws a right hook as he continues to show off his skills on the pads with his uncle . Mayweather throws an uppercut as dozens of cameras are trained on the superstar from the ring apron . Mayweather takes a break from his workout in the heat of his Las Vegas gym . Mayweather wipes away the sweat as he is put through his paces on a warm day in Sin City . Pacquiao has also fought more often so by that assessment it is fortunate for him, Mayweather and their bankers that he is two years the younger. Mayweather pauses and adds: 'If I hadn't made that decision to be my own boss I wouldn't be where I will be in the Grand Garden on May 2.' Wherever he goes in his adopted home town, be it a booming casino, a heaving night club or his favourite fast food joint Fatburger on the Vegas Strip, Mr Money brews up a storm. One created by the nature of the desert blows into the marquee in which we are talking. Chairs and tables fly. As most of the group run for cover Mayweather plays pretend scared, then strolls into his gym. It seems nothing frightens this man who arrived for work this day in a convoy of ludicrously expensive vehicles. Not a Nevada sand storm. Not Typhoon PacMan blowing in from the Philippines.","Floyd Mayweather held media workout at his gym - but turned up late .

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) The Clarets have scored just 14 goals in 15 Premier League home games this season. Spurs have kept just one clean sheet in their last 13 Premier League away matches. This will be the fourth meeting between these two sides this season after Spurs won their home league fixture and also won at home in the replay after a draw at Turf Moor in the FA Cup. Burnley have only won six of their last 28 Premier League home matches (W6 D10 L12), but Spurs were one of their victims in a 4-2 win in May 2010. Tottenham haven’t lost back to back Premier League away games since March 2014. Tottenham and Burnley have already clashed at Turf Moor this season, with the clubs drawing 1-1 in the FA Cup.

"Manchester City have already met Jurgen Klopp to assess him for the manager’s job – but it was back in 2013 when they were seeking a replacement for Roberto Mancini. Txiki Begiristain, City’s director of football met the Borussia Dortmund manager and concluded that he was not the right fit for City – and the club went on to appoint Manuel Pellegrini. Begiristain’s meeting and rejection of Klopp back in 2013 adds weight to the growing evidence that Klopp will not get the Manchester City job even though the Borussia Dortmund manager quit this week, fuelling a wave of speculation about which Premier League clubs might want to appoint him this summer. Manchester City have already met Jurgen Klopp to assess him for the manager’s job – but it was back in 2013 . The Dortmund boss will leave the club at the end of this season, with suggestions he could take over at City . Pellegrini’s position is clearly vulnerable given City’s failures this year on all fronts – in the Champions League, which was the principal target, the Premier League and the domestic cups. However, there is an insistence at the club that it should be not be automatically assumed that Pellegrini will be dismissed as, unlike when Mancini went, the club is running smoothly off the pitch without the internal tensions and disagreements which characterised Mancini’s last days. There will be the usual end-of-season review of the manager’s performance but this would take place every season, whatever success or not had been achieved. Pellegrini will clearly have to answer difficult questions about the team’s under performance, especially as they have sunk to fourth place and run the risk of being overhauled by Liverpool for the Champions League. However, Begiristain would also expect to answer questions about the recruitment of players last summer such as Eliaquim Mangala for £35million and Fernando for £13m, neither of whom has made an impact. On the plus side for Pellegrini, his style of play is seen as compatible with the type of club Begiristain and his colleague, chief executive Ferran Soriano, are attempting to create. City opted for Manuel Pellegrini after holding talks with both the Chilean and Klopp two years ago . Roberto Mancini left the Etihad Stadium in 2013 after failing to defend his Premier League crown . Director of football Txiki Begiristain will have questions to answer after signing Eliaquim Mangala (left) Both are former executives at Barcelona, where possession football and a strong academy were integral to the Catalan club and are now central to their vision City. Klopp’s counter attacking football does not fit their philosophy and there was also a sense that his exuberant personality would not be the type of manager for which City were looking in 2013. However, despite the club’s reassurances about Pellegrini, it is clear that his position will be under threat if not this summer then certainly next year, when Pep Guardiola’s three-year deal with Bayern runs out. If City do decide to make the change this summer, Rafa Benitez will be avaible when he leaves Napoli, where is challenging for a Champions League place, the Europa League and the Coppa Italia, and would be a strong candidate. But Guardiola clearly remains the favourite to take over when he has finished at Bayern. Begiristain was central in Guardiola’s appointment to Barcelona in 2008, a move which was considered a huge risk at the time but which paid extraordinary dividends as Barca won two Champions League trophies, three La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey twice under Guardiola. Begiristain’s faith in Guardiola when his only previous experience was with the Barcelona B team is why Patrick Vieira, City’s academy manager, has become a contender to take over should Pellegrini leave.","Manuel Pellegrini's job at Manchester City is precarious .

"Jurgen Klopp rejected the overtures of West Ham United after handing in his notice at Borussia Dortmund. No matter, it was worth a try. Now on to the next one. If Rafael Benitez wants to return to English football after leaving Napoli maybe he can be persuaded to take over a project that includes a move to the iconic Olympic Stadium in a year's time. West Ham need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture. Sam Allardyce isn't that man. He had his chance and did not take it. Allardyce has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club, but the momentum of his season changed on Boxing Day when he left his best players out of the starting line-up at Chelsea, and lost.

Allardyce (left, pictured behind Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini) has not been up to scratch . Click here to read chief sports writer Martin Samuel's brilliant column on Jack Grealish . The folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the Christmas period was exposed as West Ham then played two home fixtures, losing to Arsenal and drawing with West Brom. If West Ham had maintained their form going into the Chelsea game — 31 points from 17 matches — they would now be fifth in the league. Had their form since that day been played out through the season — 12 points from 16 games — they would be bottom. Allardyce's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival, but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football. If a new manager is being considered, it is understandable. West Ham must go to the Olympic Stadium with more on their minds than survival.

"As the countdown continues to Floyd Mayweather's mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2, The Money Man's daughter Iyanna Mayweather has shared her thoughts about life in training with her champion father. Mayweather vs Pacquiao will generate revenue upwards of $300 million in what is being billed as the most lucrative bout in boxing history and, ahead of the May showdown, Iyanna Mayweather offered some insight into her dad's intense training regime. 'When I watch my dad train, it's inspiring to me,' she said. Iyanna Mayweather has been spending time in her father Floyd's training camp . Iyanna watches on as her champion dad gets through another gruelling training session . Iyanna says she is amazed by her dad's work ethic in the gym and is amazed by his jump rump skills .

"Jurgen Klopp would be perfect for Arsenal but the club should keep faith with Arsene Wenger, according to Gunners legend Nigel Winterburn. Klopp is on the radar of a number of top clubs after announcing that he will leave Dortmund at the end of the season. The 47-year-old has long been linked with taking over from Wenger, but the Frenchman has two years left on his contract.

"Borussia Dortmund have moved swiftly to secure Thomas Tuchel as the successor to Jurgen Klopp, after he announced he was bringing the curtain down on his seven-year stay at the club this week. Klopp is a popular character across football but has endured a difficult season at Dortmund, with the club embroiled in a relegation battle for much of the campaign before a minor resurgence in form led them into the top half of the Bundesliga. Four days after Klopp announced he believes he has taken the club as far as he can and is seeking pastures new, Dortmund have revealed Tomas Tuchel will take over in July on a three-year deal. Thomas Tuchel (left) will replace Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp at the start of July . Klopp revealed on Wednesday he was leaving Dortmund at the end of the season after seven years . TUCHEL TREADS A SIMILAR PATH TO KLOPP . Like Klopp, the 41-year-old Tuchel carved a name for himself at German club Mainz. A year into Klopp's tenure at Dortmund, Tuchel took over at the age of 36 and surpassed the achievements of his Dortmund predecessor, taking the club to two Europa League qualifications and their highest ever Bundesliga position of 5th. Tuchel is currently seeing out the final year of his Mainz contract through a year-long break from the game . Both Tuchel (left) and Klopp have been manager of Mainz before going on to Dortmund . Upon the resolution of last season, where Mainz qualified for Europe, Tuchel announced his surprise decision to step away from his duties as manager after four years at the club. But he is still contracted to the team and when the final year of his agreement expires he will bring his year-long break from football to a close by stepping up and taking the reigns at the Westfalenstadion on July 1. HOW DOES HE PLAY? Tuchel has a reputation as a cunning tactician, who enjoys attacking football and coerces the best from his players on the coaching field. In an interview with Bundesliga.com in March this year, he defined the style he looks to enforce in his teams. 'I prefer certain qualities, an active playing style, bold defending and pacy play in attack,' Tuchel said. 'There’s definitely a style that’s been attributed to me, that we brought to the table at Mainz.' GUARDIOLA ADMIRATION . In the same interview, Tuchel commended the work and achievements of Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola, the man he will now look to lock horns with as Dortmund manager. Tuchel has spoken of his admiration of Pep Guardiola's management of Barcelona and Lionel Messi . Tuchel praised Guardiola's management of Lionel Messi during his time at Barcelona and lauded his renowned meticulous approach. 'Outstanding, schematic use of the ball, brilliant individuals like Lionel Messi and top stars putting in the grittiest, most diligent defensive efforts I've ever seen,' Tuchel gushed of Pep's Barca. 'I learned everything about the game - especially during Guardiola's time at Barcelona.' TUCHEL LINKED WITH NEWCASTLE . The German manager was strongly linked with Newcastle in January after the Premier League club tried to establish their plan following the departure of Alan Pardew to Crystal Palace. But no move ever materialised, most likely because of the delicate nature of the deal that is still in place with Mainz. Tuchel admitted that Spanish and English football is of interest to him but he wanted to return to management in Germany. HERMANN BADSTUBER AN INFLUENCE . Tuchel lists Hermann Badstuber, a youth coach at Stuttgart and the father of Bayern Munich defender Holger Badstuber, as his biggest influence as a coach. In an interview with Spox.com in September 2009, six months after Badstuber's death from cancer, Tuchel revealed how much he had shaped his coaching philosophy. Tuchel has a reputation for enforcing an attacking approach to his team's style of play . Tuchel was linked with the manager vacancy at Newcastle United shortly after Alan Pardew left . 'I barely know any coach who brings so much knowledge in itself and at the same time allows as much lateral thinking and constantly questions,' Tuchel said. 'He worked diligently and thereby remained modest. He  very, very much influenced me professionally and personally.' Tuchel and Badstuber crossed paths at Stuttgart, where they worked training youth sides, following Tuchel's retirement as a player at SSV Ulm due to a persistent knee injury when he was 24.","Thomas Tuchel has signed a three-year deal to replace Jurgen Klopp .

Leaving the basketball court, Bolt posed for selfies, took his own video and even ran a 20-metre race on the track with several young girls. A few kids at the complex's small football field climbed a chain link fence to have a look.

"If the general election were confined to voting by football fans, it looks like Labour might win by a landslide. Red is the overwhelming colour across the Football League in terms of the party that governs clubs' constituencies. The Conservatives trail some way behind, while the Liberal Democrats have only seven clubs in constituencies where they hold power. So if  May's vote goes the same way as the one in 2010, Labour would leave their rivals trailing in this alternative election. The Football League's political colours, based on the party holding each club's constituency . Ed Miliband (left) can claim that 18 of the 20 Premier League clubs are in Labour consituencies; but Prime Minister David Cameron may be concerned at the Conservatives' lack of Blues in the top flight . Football has long been hailed as the game the working man enjoys watching from the terraces . Overall, Ed Miliband’s party has MPs in constituencies housing 55 of the 92 clubs in England’s top four divisions. David Cameron’s Tories have 29. Only one club falls into independent hands: Bradford West, which holds Valley Parade, voted Respect leader George Galloway as their MP in a 2012 by-election. At the top table, 18 of the 20 Premier League grounds are in constituencies held by Labour. Only Chelsea, who voted Tory, fittingly blue, and Burnley, where Lib Dems hold sway, are any different. The research, undertaken by Philip Cowley, Professor of Parliamentary Government at Nottingham University, suggests football remains the working man’s game, so long as Labour is the working man’s party. Both Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Arsenal are all located in solid Labour seats. Kate Green, MP for Stretford and Urmston holding Old Trafford, has nearly a 9,000 majority, while Lucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, the constituency housing the Etihad Stadium, has around a 10,000 majority. Liverpool Walton, encompassing Anfield, is represented by Steve Rotherham, who gained 20,000 more votes than anyone else at the 2010 general election. Steve Rotheram MP (left), of Liverpool Walton, the constituency that contains Liverpool and Raheem Sterling . Chelsea are one of just two Premier League clubs whose constituencies do not fall under Labour control. Greg Hands (right), Conservative MP for Hammersmith and Fulham, is the only Tory MP in a top-flight team's area . Kate Green (left), MP for Stretford and Urmston, which holds Manchester United's Old Trafford ground, where Wayne Rooney is captain of the Premier League's biggest and most successful football club . Five years ago Jeremy Corbyn won Islington North, where the Emirates Stadium is located, with a majority of 12,400. Chelsea and Fulham, holding both Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, voted in Tory Greg Hands with a 16,700 majority. Birmingham Ladywood is the only other constituency home to two clubs, both Birmingham City and Aston Villa. The residents voted Labour by a 10,000 majority in 2010. Alexis Sanchez (left) is the brightest star at Arsenal. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn is the MP for Islington North . Lucy Powell (left), Labour MP for Manchester Central, can boast that Manchester City is in her constituency . Labour dominate urban areas, so their supremacy on football terms is to be expected. The Tories, with their traditional rural support, are not the natural choice of many living near grounds. Villa fan Cameron’s Whitney seat does not include Oxford United’s Kassam Stadium, for example. That is Labour. Nick Clegg’s Sheffield Hallam does not incorporate Wednesday or United either. They are Labour. Miliband is MP for Doncaster North, but the Keepmoat Stadium falls in Doncaster Central, a Labour stronghold nevertheless.","Premier League clubs are overwhelmingly in Labour constituencies .

"Faithless’ dance anthem ‘Insomnia’ booms out seconds before games at Fulham, and it’s rather apt for Kit Symons. His sleepless nights must be becoming all the more frequent as these haunting weeks go by. Down rained the boos yet again from a disgruntled bunch of supporters who deserve so much more than this; far more than a team lacking identity and direction. Those fans will quite rightly point to the fact their side were out-played for large parts against Rotherham, a club with a far inferior budget and experience at this level. They are losing faith in their manager, even though Fulham should retain their Championship status from here. Ross McCormack (left) pokes home the equaliser but Fulham were unable to push on for the winner . That they came away with a point was down to poor finishing from the Yorkshire visitors, nothing more. Ross McCormack came to the rescue after Matt Derbyshire’s early opener to spare blushes. Fulham just want this wretched campaign over. ‘First half we were awful,’ Symons said. ‘Second half was a huge improvement to a bit better than awful. We’re limping closer. ‘The sooner we get the points needed the sooner I’ll start sleeping in an evening.’ That spoke volumes. Kit Symons (centre) admitted his side were second best and says the club need to rebuild in the summer . ‘It is slow and it’s painful. We need to rebuild in the summer. It’s an anxious period - people are concerned. The players did show good character to come from behind.’ Steve Evans’ team still await their fate after being charged for fielding an ineligible player, Farrend Rawson, during the win against Brighton earlier this month. Should the Football League follow the precedent set with AFC Wimbledon last year, the Millers will find themselves lumped with a three-point deduction. When that judgement is to be made remains unclear - although it almost certainly will come before the final day on May 2 - meaning the relegation dogfight could go to the wire, with resurgent Millwall enjoying a game in hand. Rotherham knew points must be won here, and set about bossing proceedings from the very first minute. Matt Derbyshire (centre) pokes home the opener after four minutes to put Steve Evans' side in the lead . Fulham XI: Bettinelli, Richards, Turner, Burn, Husband, Parker, Guthrie, Tunnicliffe (Hoogland - 54), Ruiz, McCormack, Smith . Subs not used: Kiraly, Stafylidis, Hutchinson, Woodrow, Rodallega, Kavanagh . Goals: McCormack 67 . Booked: Guthrie, Burn, Turner . Rotherham XI: Martinez, Hunt, Morgan, Broadfoot, Lafferty; Smallwood, Arnason, Frecklington, Pringle; Ward, Derbyshire . Subs not used: Collin, Wilson, Wood, Hammill, Bowery, Milsom, Green . Goals: Derbyshire 4 . Booked: Broadfoot . Referee: Andy Davies . How it came to pass that Matt Derbyshire might’ve put the visitors three goals up inside the first four minutes will mystify Symons. Eventually the former Olympiacos striker settled for one, the simplicity galling for a club who were facing Tottenham this time a year ago. Firstly Derbyshire clipped wide inside the six-yard box before the long legs of Dan Burn prevented him from tapping home seconds later. But Fulham fell asleep from Ben Pringle’s corner to present Derbyshire with a third opportunity and he wasn’t to miss, stabbing in from close range to signal the Craven Cottage dissenters to find their voice. Matt Smith’s header was cleared off the line in an instant reply, but Symons’ side looked shot, as they had been here against Brentford and Wigan previously. And they allowed Derbyshire in again, this time Burn misreading a high ball, but he was thwarted by Marcus Bettinelli. Danny Ward squandered a glorious chance from 12 yards, skewing a shot wide as Fulham continued to be carved open. Bryan Ruiz (10) is denied a goal by the on-rush Arsenal loanee Emiliano Martinez of Rotherham . Fulham's remaining  fixtures: Blackpool (A), Middlesbrough (H),Norwich (A) Rotherham's remaining fixtures: Norwich (H), Reading (H), Leeds (A) Kirk Broadfoot was guilty of missing a superb chance from another corner and the central defender later struck a post. Saying they could have scored five before the break isn’t hyperbolic. 'They could've been out of sight,' admitted Symons. Bryan Ruiz spurned a good opportunity for the hosts, McCormack then failing to stretch far enough to covert at the back post. Every stray pass was met with groans, each overhit cross with sighs. Many are resigned to these turgid displays, but more than a small section just will not accept it. Symons was bailed out by McCormack though, who got on the end of Scott Parker’s pass to poke in a 67th-minute equaliser. It was a rare moment of quality, but edges them closer to safety. Matt Smith (centre) was unable to continue his good goalscoring form for the Cottagers . ‘The goal is a blatant handball by McCormack,’ Rotherham assistant Paul Raynor fumed. ‘We dominated possession and created a number of opportunities.’ ‘You hope something’s going to fall for us. One thing that can never be labelled against our team is a lot of character and desire. That’s the minimum we expect. We’re enjoying the challenge and had a difficult week. A good word to use is defiance.’ Symons added: ‘I’ve seen the goal again and there’s probably an element of doubt, but I’d expect them to have a moan about it.’ The goal gave the whole place a lift, Smith unfortunate not to win a penalty after Craig Morgan’s shove and substitute Tim Hoogland thumped a header over when unmarked at the back post. Oddly, one point may have been three but that would’ve merely masked glaring deficiencies. For all the talk of difficulties, staying in the division is the only thing that matters.

"Tiger Woods will be wondering if he can ever catch a break after suffering a bizarre injury on the ninth hole at the Masters on Sunday. At five-under-par on his second shot on the ninth, Woods found himself 470 yards from the hole with the ball nestled snugly into the pine straw that surrounds the beautifully groomed fairway. However following through on his swing the four-time Masters champion drilled his club into a tree root, causing the 39-year-old to drop his club and give out a painful yell.

The four-time Masters champion managed to shake off the injury to finish the competition at 5-under-par . But the American, who ended the round on a 1-over-par 73, claimed he popped a ligament in his right wrist back into place  so he could go on to complete his first tournament of 2015. 'It hurts; it definitely hurts,' Woods said. 'I didn't know there was a tree root there. I drilled the club straight into it. It didn't move, but my body kept moving. 'There's a little joint that popped out, and I was able to somehow put it back in, which didn't feel very good. 21-year-old Jordan Spieth (centre) celebrates his first Masters victory with his girlfriend on Sunday .

"Manager Steve Evans has revealed Rotherham will find out whether they will be deducted points for fielding an ineligible player before the weekend. The Millers were sanctioned by the Football League last week as they played Derby defender Farrend Rawson in their 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday after his youth loan had expired and the paperwork over an extension was not dealt with correctly. They have had to endure a nervy wait to discover their fate after the league said a disciplinary panel would hear the case at 'the earliest opportunity', while also indicating that the club will be open to the 'full range of punishments', which includes a potential points deduction. Rotherham manager Steve Evans beleives a decision is imminent on a possible points deduction for his side . On loan Derby defender Farrend Rawson (third right) played in the 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday . The three-man panel is finally set to meet on Thursday, with Evans expecting news of his club's fate in the next 24 hours . 'It's going to happen very soon,' the Scot, whose side host Norwich on Saturday, said. 'It's not my job to talk when it is and when it's not, it will be soon enough. 'I've been told this morning that we hope it will be concluded by the time we arrive here on Saturday, whether that's today or tomorrow I am not 100 per cent sure.' The Millers have vowed to fight the charge, hiring top QC Jim Sturman to defend them, but a three-point deduction is thought to be the likeliest punishment should they be found guilty. But Evans insists he does not know the strength of his club's defence and has not been involved. Rotherham drew 1-1 with Fulham on Wednesday night, leaving them four points above the relegation zone . 'I am not involved in the case, all I know is the chairman that has spent many hours heading the football club on this with a legal representative, I've not been involved in any of the meetings because it is not my department,' he added. 'I have almost been kept at a distance. 'You have to accept there's been an error. Certainly, knowing people inside this football club, no one means to make an error. 'I don't want to cast judgement on people who make genuine mistakes. I have made enough of them.

"Paris Saint-Germain's then sports director Leonardo declared the club were ready for tougher competitions in Europe two years ago but Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final exit suggests they need more time to reach the top. PSG were knocked out 5-1 on aggregate by Barcelona despite Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti returning to the Ligue One side but coach Laurent Blanc was not really shocked. 'Those who follow Barcelona know the patience required to win the Champions League. You need the means, but also some patience,' Blanc said after the 2-0 defeat at the Nou Camp, which followed last week's 3-1 humbling at the Parc des Princes. Laurent Blanc looks on as his Paris Saint-Germain side were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate by Barcelona . 'The first qualified for the semi-finals are Barca and Bayern Munich. Paris will certainly be there one day but you have to understand we need time,' he said after PSG's third successive quarter-final exit in the tournament. Once again, Sweden striker Ibrahimovic failed to shine in a big game in which his attacking partner Edinson Cavani, despite his limitations, seemed more involved. PSG saw off Chelsea in the previous round but that was more of a one-tie thing, with Thiago Silva and David Luiz scoring after Ibrahimovic had been sent off in the second leg. Luiz was below-par in the last two games, being at fault on four of the five goals PSG conceded against Barca, but PSG's problems are collective, conceded midfielder Blaise Matuidi. Blaise Matuidi says that PSG are still not ready to win the Champions League and still have work to do . David Luiz was given a torrid time over the two legs and was at fault for four of Barcelona's goals . 'Barcelona are an institution, a club who have been at the top level for a long time, like Real Madrid or Bayern Munich,' the France international said. 'We have been around for five years only.' PSG were bought in 2011 by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), who invested massively in the club hoping to win Europe's premium club competition. While they never look threatened in the Group stage, PSG have been failing against top-notch opposition. 'Let's be realistic, they were better than us. They will probably win the Champions League,' Ibrahimovic admitted. Star men Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) and Marco Verratti were unable to influence the game in PSG's favour . 'As far as we are concerned, it is not possible to reach that goal on short term. We have made several big steps and we were eliminated by a superb team. 'Let's not lie to ourselves, it's just reality.' PSG will now focus on winning the Ligue 1 title for the third consecutive season -- a goal more suited to their capacities -- with a possible treble on the cards as they won the League Cup and will play the French Cup final on May 30. They are second in the standings behind Olympique Lyonnais on goal difference but have a game in hand.","PSG planned to be Europe's top side after major investments in the club .

"Swansea manager Garry Monk insists Newcastle's players will not be affected by any supporters' protests at St James' Park on Saturday. The Magpies have lost their last six Barclays Premier League games under caretaker manager John Carver and more demonstrations are planned for the visit of Swansea after a significantly smaller crowd than usual saw last weekend's 3-1 home defeat to Tottenham. Campaign organisers protesting over Mike Ashley's ownership have said they will support anyone who wishes to boycott once again and have asked fans to stand up on 34 minutes inside St James' Park on Saturday - to reflect the £34million the club left in the bank during the last financial year rather than investing in the squad. Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon . At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs . Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having £34million in the bank . But Monk claims the backdrop to the game will have no bearing on the actual 90 minutes, saying: 'As a player there's nothing you can do about that - you have to concentrate on your football. 'No player goes out on the pitch without the intention of giving his best and I'm sure all the Newcastle fans will be thinking that. 'They'll want to put on a display and do well in front of their crowd and bounce back from recent results, and as a player you are there to perform.' The supporters' group have asked fans to stand in the 34th minute of Saturday's  match against Swansea . Carver was handed the Newcastle reins until the end of the season after Alan Pardew quit the club in late December to become Crystal Palace boss. And Monk sees similarities between himself and Carver as he became Swansea manager in February 2014 with the Welsh outfit involved in a relegation battle at the time. 'I was in that position at the end of last season, although maybe it's a little bit different because John's been a coach for a number of years and has got that experience,' said Monk, whose side have equalled Swansea's best ever Premier League points total with five games still remaining. Fans boycotting the Spurs match hold banners demanding the resignation of Ashley as Newcastle director . 'But in terms of taking over at a difficult moment for the club and trying to get results straight away, it's similar. 'The times I've met him, he's a fantastic guy with a lot of experience, he speaks well and is pushing his players to get the best. That's in his character, and you see that in his interviews. 'I have sympathy for him in a way because as a manager you have to get results, but I'm sure he is giving 100 per cent and putting all his knowledge and experience into it.' Newcastle supporters have also been asked to take part in peaceful protests outside Sports Direct stores . Swansea are unbeaten on their three Premier League visits to Newcastle, winning twice and drawing once, and secured their top-flight status last season by winning 2-1 at St James' Park towards the end of April. 'We've done well there over the years and it's a great place to go and play your football,' Monk said. 'You're in the game to play in those big stadiums and our players are used to those arenas now as they are established Premier League players. 'Hopefully we can use the crowd against the team if we perform well, but the idea is to focus on ourselves and put our best football on the pitch.'

"England lock Joe Launchbury is hopeful of making his comeback in Wasps' Aviva Premiership clash with Leicester on May 9 as the final stage of his rehabilitation enters 'crunch time'. Launchbury has been sidelined since October because of a nerve problem caused by a bulging disc in his neck, but is close to regaining full fitness with the showdown against the Tigers pencilled in for his return. If the 24-year-old is given the all-clear to face the Tigers in a match that could be crucial to Wasps' play-off prospects, it will be his debut at the club's new home at the Ricoh Arena. Wasps lock Joe Launchbury is hopeful of making his comeback against Leicester Tigers on May 9 . 'I'm approaching six months out of the game, so it's been a long time. Now I'm approaching sort of the crunch time of the rehab.' Launchbury said. 'I'm building towards full contact training. A long injury, especially to the neck, is a gradual process to go through and you need to jump through a few hoops in terms of contact. 'Each stage I've taken on so far I've passed, so I'm really happy with where I am and hopefully over the next few weeks we can really ramp things up. 'I'm starting to feel really good and hopefully I'll hit my straps when I come back. 'It's always been hard to nail down a time to come back but given where I am now, I'm really setting my sights on Leicester at home in a few weeks' time. 'We're targeting that game, but it will only happen if everyone around me is 100 per cent sure that that's the right decision and my neck is in the best place it can be.' Launchbury (left) has been out since October due to a nerve problem caused by a bulging disc in his neck . Launchbury's absence has spanned nine missed Tests for England, comprising of the entire autumn schedule and the recent RBS 6 Nations. The Red Rose have missed his athleticism, work over the ball and tackle-count and if fit he is a certainty to make their World Cup squad with the global showpiece on home soil fuelling his determination to make a full recovery. 'There is an element of pressure - I really want to turn up to the training camps with a green ticket to my name as a fit player,' he said. 'I think that will be important heading into what's going to be a long and tough pre-season camp. 'I want to remind people what I can do on a pitch. Six months is a long time so hopefully I can get back out there and play well. The 24-year-old's potential return vs Leicester would be his debut at the club's new home at the Ricoh Arena . 'The World Cup has been the biggest carrot throughout this injury. It's been a long time, but I've had that every day in the back of my mind that I'm desperate to be there. 'Not many players get a chance to play in a home World Cup and hopefully I can get back fit and find the same form I had before my injury.' The lengthy lay-off has not come without its benefits, however, with Launchbury able to spend more time at home following the birth of his daughter Blythe. 'Within two weeks of having my operation it was the birth of my first child, so in that sense it's been brilliant to spend some time at home and really help my partner,' he said. 'It's been a great stage in my life for that and it's been great to be there for it.'

"Fact. Whether he's your coach, manager or interim, Rafa Benitez wins trophies. The Spaniard's name is being uttered once again across the boardrooms of Europe this morning. His Napoli side's 4-1 demolition of Wolfsburg in the Europa League quarter final last night gave that ominous feeling that silverware is once again within his grasp. He may be demanding, occasionally abrasive and often expensive but ultimately Benitez gets results. Since 2002, Benitez has won 12 trophies with Valencia, Liverpool, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Napoli. Napoli manager Rafael Benitez saw his side beat Wolfsburg 4-1 in the Europa League . Gonzalo Higuain and Benitez celebrate after beating Wolfsburg in Germany . The 55-year-old is out of contract this summer and it makes him a man in demand. Manchester City, Paris St Germain and Real Madrid are all considering changes as are West Ham and Newcastle. While Steve McClaren is destined for the role at St James', Benitez will take stock of what offers arrive on his doorstep. His ideal is to return to England and his comfortable Wirral home overlooking the River Dee where his family, wife Montse and beloved daughters Claudia and Agata, are settled. The reality is, here, jobs of the calibre Benitez wants are scarce and the opportunities could come with a caveat. Manchester City, should they dispense with Manuel Pellegrini, ultimately want Pep Guardiola; his contract at Bayern makes that difficult though and Patrick Vieira's inexperience leaves them with a dilemma. Should they try Benitez? It goes against certain principles, Txiki Begiristain wants a fluid attacking style to bring glory and Benitez is seen as pragmatic yet tactically very astute. Yet, Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United may not have danced through City's midfield so easily in recent weeks had he been in charge. Benitez has won the UEFA Cup/Europa League twice with Valencia and Chelsea . Preparation is everything to him, almost laborious. His players are given briefings, tailored dvds, weak points to work on or to attack. His pointers are not negative, they're smart. When Chelsea beat Benfica in the Europa League final of 2013, Juan Mata revealed how Benitez had told them to target the back post where Benfica goalkeeper Artur was vulnerable. They won with a far post header from Branislav Ivanovic. Ironically, Benitez has been viewed as wreckless in Italy this season for not setting his team with greater emphasis on defence. They have lost to Roma and Lazio but dominated. It prompted under-pressure president Aurelio De Laurentiis to demand his players be locked away in a training camp. Film producer De Laurentiis does love a drama. Giving players a cuddle has never been Benitez's forte, nor saying that he loves them but he does give them a platform to improve. Benitez famously guided Liverpool to the Champions League in 2005 . Benitez won the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006 on penalties against West Ham . Javier Mascherano was told exactly where and how he would play as he and Xabi Alonso brought the best out of Steven Gerrard, Juan Mata excelled at Chelsea, David Luiz grew and Jose Callejon has transformed from an £8m Real Madrid squad player to one now valued at £20m by Napoli. He's a man who would certainly have a plan for messrs Silva, Aguero and Toure. West Ham could offer the project he craves should Sam Allardyce move on. A rich football tradition, new stadium; if the finance is right, Benitez would embrace it. Benitez loves a project and would relish being an underdog biting at the coat tails of the Premier League's elite. He was sold on one at Napoli. At first it worked, the squad was competitive and challenged for Serie A but last summer they didn't invest as heavily as their rivals and the squad has been stretched. It may sound familiar to Liverpool fans but he still looks like delivering Napoli's first European semi final for 25 years and Champions League qualification remains in sight. Benitez got the best out of Juan Mata during his time at Chelsea . Jose Callejon has been transformed from a squad player at Real Madrid to a star at Napoli under Benitez . Life has not been easy at Napoli but for now he will endeavour to finish on a high. The Wolfsburg performance is a timely reminder of what he can put in place though he can't help but demand more. 'We put in great games against Roma and Lazio, yet played worse against Fiorentina and won 3-0,' said Benitez. 'We played against the second best team in the Bundesliga and these players deserve credit. We still lack experience to control the match and not concede goals. We work on tactics, but can still improve. What I do not like is hearing people say the players are unprofessional or undisciplined.' Sam Allardyce's future at West Ham is uncertain as is Manuel Pellegrini's at Man City and Benitez could be considered by both clubs should they be in the need for a new manager . Asked about his future he emphasised the need for change should he stay in Italy. 'I haven’t decided anything. It’s not hard for me to work with Napoli, but I have to understand the final objective, the planning, the investment in a training centre and stadium,' he said. 'If we go forward, then we’ll see. The president has invested and worked hard in these years, but now we have to see what the plans are before deciding if we’ll continue together.' For Benitez the door is once again ajar and invitations are welcome.","Rafa Benitez has won 12 trophies with Valencia, Liverpool, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Napoli since 2002 .

"Yaya Toure wants to meet with Manchester City to thrash out his future, according to his controversial agent. Toure's days at the Etihad Stadium may be numbered, with City prepared to listen to offers for the 31-year-old and the player himself admitting he is open to new challenges. Now the Ivory Coast international's agent Dimitri Seluk has revealed that he wants to talk to City about the way forward. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has hinted that he is open to leaving Manchester City this summer . Toure is challenged by West Ham's Mark Noble during City's 2-0 win at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon . Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini wants to be reunited with Toure next season after managing him at City . 'We have had different offers for Yaya but we must speak to Manchester City,' Seluk said. 'People think he will stay because of money but we don't care about money. If Man City don't want him - no problem. 'I want someone to say that they want Yaya to stay at Manchester City. Yaya is a legend at the club. All the supporters like him, he's helped them make history.' Despite Seluk's claims, the fact that Toure earns more than £1m a month at City could yet put a spanner in the works of a potential transfer to a club like Inter Milan in Italy.

"Jack Wilshere can be the future of Arsenal’s midfield, but his injury record could turn him into another Abou Diaby, fears club legend Ray Parlour. Wilshere was on the bench against Reading at Wembley on Saturday after five months out through injury. And Parlour believes that the 23-year-old’s fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential. Jack Wilshere, on the bench next to Theo Walcott and Mathieu Flamini, for Arsenal's match against Reading . Wilshere, the England international, is pictured in training for Arsenal earlier this month . ‘I think he’s the future of the club,’ said Parlour. ‘I think if he stays fit, he’s a quality player, there’s no doubt about that. ‘The way he goes past players, the way he links up with people, I definitely think he’s got a big role to play. ‘But again, the big question mark is can he stay fit? Look at Abou Diaby. Diaby’s a terrific player. But look at him, the injuries the last few years. ‘The big burning question is can Wilshere have a full season without being injured for a long period, like he hasn’t had for the last three or four seasons.’ The 23-year-old pictured in action for Arsenal's Under-21s against Reading at the Emirates earlier in April . Wilshere is at the heart of a core of players at the Emirates which has now reached the FA Cup final for the second year in a row, and are approaching maturity as a group. And although the Premier League title may be out of their reach, Parlour believes that Arsene Wenger’s squad, with the right additions, could be ready to finally push for top honours again. ‘What I like about the squad is that they’ve got good youngsters - Oxlade-Chamberlain, Chambers and Bellerin - coming through, but the main nucleus of players are a good age,' added Parlour, talking at the Carlsberg People’s Pundit final. ‘They’re not too old, they’re in their prime now, they’ve got the experience. So those sort of players, people like Ozil, Ramsey, Sanchez, Wilshere if he’s fit, they’ve got that nucleus. Ray Parlour, who won three championships with Arsenal, has backed Wilshere to be the future of the club . ‘It’ll need a couple of big signings, but if they can get them, I’m sure they’ll be a lot closer to Chelsea next season in the Premier League, and in the Champions League they can go the extra couple of rounds and get to the final,' said Parlour, at the Boot Camp stage of The People's Pundit, championed by Carlsberg – the Official Beer of the England team and the Premier League. After months of scouring the country, The People's Pundit has narrowed down its search to five football fans in with a chance of winning their big break on talkSPORT on the last day of the Barclays Premier League season. Those five – a call centre worker, a personal trainer, a sales director, a production runner, and a furniture upholsterer – were put through their paces under the famous Wembley arch by punditry legends Jeff Stelling, Mark Saggers and Ray Parlour in the final race to see who will become The People's Pundit. Parlour, who won three FA Cups under Arsene Wenger, was also full of praise of the Gunners' FA Cup final opponents Aston Villa, and their boss Tim Sherwood. The former Tottenham boss – who grew up an Arsenal fan – has steered Villa away from the relegation dogfight and into their first Cup final for 15 years, and Parlour backed him to be named manager of the season if he triumphs at Wembley. Parlour won the FA Cup under Arsene Wenger three times, including in 2002 when he scored a stunning goal . Frenchman Diaby's promising career has been hit by a host of injuries . ‘I played with him at England, he always a great lad, always had a good football brain on him, and he’s certainly delivering the goods at the moment,’ said Parlour. ‘He’s certainly got something going for him, and I’d be amazed if Villa do go down, with the momentum they’ve got. ‘If he can keep the club up and lead them next season in the Premier League, and if he can win the FA Cup as well, it’s a great season. If they can come fourth from bottom this season, and win the cup, he’s got to be near enough for manager of the year.’ The Carlsberg Fan Squad is all about making football better for fans. That's why If Carlsberg did pundits, they'd probably be fans just like you.

"On Wednesday, Sportsmail revealed for the first time how popular each Premier League club is around the globe according to Twitter followers. Arsenal came out on top globally with 5.68million followers ahead of Chelsea (5.49m) and Manchester United (4.87m). But one country was missing: China – where the government outlaws Twitter as they seek to keep control of information and the media. Manchester United have over eight million followers on Weibo, almost double that of Twitter . Manchester City also have over eight million Weibo followers compared to 2.4million on Twitter . Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao are third on the list of clubs in the world with most Weibo followers . In Twitter’s place is a microblogging site called Weibo which has an incredible 27.2m Premier League fans – just one million short of the total number of Premier League fans on the whole of Twitter worldwide. So, do Chinese fans follow the same patterns at the rest of the world? Well it is a story of one city in China, with the Manchester clubs accumulating 17,193,721 followers. United have 8,872,812 Weibo followers compared with 4,870,000 on Twitter, while City have 8,320,909 compared with just 2,420,000. Barcelona have 5.4million followers on Weibo, the fourth most of any club in the world . Arsenal have 3.6million followers on Weibo compared to 5.6 million on Twitter . United’s support in China is no surprise as they have solid support across Asia on Twitter, but City punch well above their weight in China compared with the rest of the continent. Somewhat surprisingly Tottenham are the only other club Premier League club to have more followers in China than on Twitter – 1,367,140 compared with 1,090,000. Elsewhere, Everton’s support is very much in the infancy with just 527 of the 275m Weibo users following Roberto Martinez’s side. Of the 10 Premier League clubs active on Weibo, six – United, City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham, feature in the top 20 most followed clubs in China. The Manchester clubs are first and second, with Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao – managed by Fabio Cannavaro – third and Barcelona fourth. Chelsea are 11th on the list of clubs with most followers on the Chinese microblogging site . Liverpool have 2.3million followers on Chinese site Weibo compared to 4.2million on Twitter . Bayern Munich are 13th, Real Madrid are way down in 18th – with 81,303 less followers than Tottenham – and Paris Saint Germain in 20th. And such is the popularity of the Premier League, Michael Owen has a staggering 3,074,148 followers on the site - which would put him 10th in the top 20 clubs list. With the popularity of football rapidly increasingly in China – in December 2014 the China’s President made football compulsory for children and added it to the national curriculum – expect Premier League clubs to intensify their effort to grab a slice of this lucrative market. SportQuake provided the data and their founder Matt House said: 'With its thrilling brand of football, the Premier League delivers mass engagement for fans in markets all over the world. We can say with confidence that more Premier League teams will be active on Weibo next season. 'As always, football and the Premier League is leading the way with new technologies, but we expect follower figures on both Twitter and Weibo to balance out to reflect fan bases as the platforms mature.'","Man United and Man City have over 8million followers each on Weibo .

"Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez says he is 'very proud' to have joined the north London club and has been impressed by the quality of his team-mates. 'I am not saying this just because it's my obligation to do it as a club player. Every Arsenal player has amazing quality,' he told the Gunners' official website before adding, 'I want to win many titles here.' The Chilean forward has enjoyed a fine debut season in English football since joining from Barcelona last summer, netting 22 goals in all competitions so far and being nominated for the PFA Player of the Year award. Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez has enjoyed a fine debut season in English football, scoring 22 goals so far . The Chilean forward, who signed from Barcelona last summer, has been nominated for PFA Player of the Year . Sanchez has singled out fellow attacker Santi Cazorla for particular praise, labelling the Spaniard a 'spectacular player.' He went on, 'You never know whether he will kick the ball with his right or left foot. Also, he moves with short but quick strides, which is a remarkable trademark too. 'Although I knew about his quality, playing alongside makes him makes me very happy. Arsenal are currently second in the Premier League table with 66 points from 32 games, 10 points behind the pace of leaders Chelsea, whom they face next. While the Blues admittedly hold the advantage, the title race is not over yet and Arsenal could mount a late charge.

"Patrice Evra believes Juventus called upon quintessential Italian traits in securing their route to the Champions League semi-finals, describing the Sere A side's defeat of Monaco as  'ugly'. Massimiliano Allegri's team secured a 0-0 draw at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday night, meaning they progressed 1-0 on aggregate, after  Arturo Vidal's second-half penalty proved the difference in Turin last week. Evra withstood a few nervous moments as Juventus sat back and allowed the French side to dictate the play, but after helping the Italians reach their first Champions League semi-final since 2002-03, the former Manchester United full back claimed that Ligue 1's elite clubs could learn from a more combative style of play. Patrice Evra prevents Monaco's Yannick Ferreira Carrasco from delivering a cross at the Stade Louis II . Evra is put under pressure by Monaco's Geoffrey Kondogbia during Wednesday night's quarter-final clash . 'I'm not scientist but for Paris Saint-Germain to lose to a big club like Barcelona and Monaco to lose to an experienced team like Juventus, but I think that in France we're okay being the country that finishes second,' the French defender told beIN Sports after the game. 'We'll have to take the next step, to have a different mentality. You have to respect the opponent but be more aggressive on the pitch. 'I think the French teams sometimes doubt themselves. They play some beautiful games but when it comes down to it, do not go through. 'We must give a nod to Monaco, who deserved more tonight. But, from our point of view, we never really doubted ourselves. 'We played the Italian way - it's solid, it's ugly, but it works. I am happy and at the same time a little sad for Monaco. It was strange to return to Stade Louis II, where I spent many happy years.' Injury meant Paul Pogba sat out the Monaco clash and he is likely to miss the Champions League semi-finals . Meanwhile, Evra's has urged compatriot Paul Pogba not to be tempted into a swift comeback from injury, after the 22-year-old was ruled out of action for 50 days when he injured a hamstring in the last-16 victory over Borussia Dortmund. 'He's hungry but he has an injury that requires attention,' the left-back added. 'He must not rush his return and instead have faith in the medical staff. He must only return if he's 100 per cent.'","French full back says Juve played 'the Italian way' on his return to Monaco .

"Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis will miss three to four weeks with a hamstring injury. Gomis came off in the early stages of last weekend's 1-1 Barclays Premier League home draw with Everton and scans have now revealed the full extent of the damage. The Frenchman will miss league trips to Leicester and Newcastle and the home game with Stoke but hopes to return for the visit to Arsenal on May 11. 'Scans this week revealed a grade two hamstring strain which will keep the French international sidelined for around three to four weeks,' said a statement on the official Swansea website. Swansea's Bafetimbi Gomis unleashes a dangerous shot but only manages to injure his hamstring . Gomis's injury, a grade two hamstring strain, will keep him off the pitch for three to four weeks . Gomis' injury has come at the worst possible time as he was finding his best form in a Swansea shirt after a difficult first season at the Liberty Stadium. The 29-year-old spent the first half of the campaign in Wilfried Bony's shadow and appeared to be agitating for a move until the Ivorian was sold to Manchester City in January for an initial £25million fee. But Gomis, who joined from Lyon on a free transfer last summer, has since settled at Swansea and had scored four goals in seven games before being injured against Everton. Loan signing Nelson Oliveira and Marvin Emnes will compete to fill Gomis' spot at Leicester on Saturday.

"The semi-final line-up for the Champions League has been confirmed and, although there may be no English involvement, four European giants are just three games from being crowned champions of the continent in Berlin on June 6. With Real Madrid and Juventus winning on Wednesday to join Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the last four, this season's competition is one of the toughest to call in recent memory. We asked our team of reporters who they think will win this season's Champions League. SAMI MOKBEL - Barcelona . Momentum is key at this point in the season and Barcelona are in overdrive. Their early-season woes are a distant memory and Luis Enrique is finally getting his point across. Lionel Messi remains phenomenal and a certain Luis Suarez is hitting top gear just at the right time. Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left) , Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) NEIL ASHTON - Bayern Munich . They overcame their blip (the rip in the seam of Pep's trousers) to power their way beyond Porto in the second leg of the quarter-final and remind everyone just how good they are. They have much to prove after last season's disappointment but they are a phenomenal team. I expect them to draw Barcelona in the semi-final. Bayern Munich produced a stunning display in the second leg to beat Porto in the quarter-finals . JOE BERNSTEIN - Barcelona . Bayern and Barcelona are both better teams than Juventus or Real Madrid and to separate them is nigh on impossible. But given the backroom strife at Bayern, particularly over Arjen Robben's injury, I'd narrowly go for Messi and Barcelona ending their four-year Champions League 'drought'. DOMINIC KING - Barcelona . To think at the start of the season, after Real Madrid pummelled them in the first Clasico, that we thought the beginning of the end had started. Now they look majestic once more and the front three of Messi, Neymar and Suarez gives them an edge over all their rivals. Hopefully it will be a straight shootout between them and Bayern Munich in Berlin. This is the best Champions League semi-final line-up ever and we might get the spectacular final to go with it. LEE CLAYTON - Juventus . Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Gianluigi Buffon -  experience, goals and know-how. Tevez isn't Messi (or Cristiano Ronaldo), Pogba isn't Thomas Muller and Buffon isn't Manuel Neuer: Yes, they are ugly bugs on a catwalk of super powers, but they CAN win this. After all, Denmark and Greece both won the Euros. Juventus celebrate their 1-0 aggregate victory over Monaco in the last eight of the Champions League . Juventus striker Carlos Tevez leads the scoring in Serie A this season with 18 goals . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - Barcelona . Since it's been established that we don't live in a post-Messi (48 goals in 49 starts) world I can't bring myself to bet against him. Would love to see them in a final against Bayern Munich. CHRIS WHEELER - Bayern Munich . After that crushing 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the semi-finals a year ago, and the shock of suffering a 3-1 first-leg loss to Porto in this season’s quarters, expect the real Bayern to stand up and deliver another Champions League triumph for Guardiola. Is it written in the stars that Barcelona will be standing in his way? LAURIE WHITWELL - Barcelona . The front three of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar are beginning to click to devastating effect and the magical allure of Barcelona is returning. It would be some turnaround from the disputes and disappointments of early season, but this is a team full of players who know how to win the trophy. Neymar scored both goals in Barcelona's 2-0 second-leg victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the Nou Camp . LAURA WILLIAMSON - Real Madrid . They might be depleted by injuries but experience and pedigree count in this competition and, as we saw against Atletico Madrid, you can never count against the 10-time winners. Or, indeed, a certain Ronaldo. Javier Hernandez's 88th-minute winner saw Real Madrid edge past their local rivals Atletico Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League title and a second in a row with Real Madrid . ROB DRAPER - Bayern Munich . Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben are on the way back, Pep  has a point to prove and the team have the memory of that awful semi-final against Real Madrid last year to drive them on. As long as they don't take their foot off the gas having already won the Bundesliga, they'll make good the disappointment of last year. Robert Lewandowski celebrates one of five first-half goals Bayern Munich scored against Porto on Tuesday . JACK GAUGHAN - Barcelona . I'm tempted to say Bayern Munich but they've got similar buckling deficiencies to the Barcelona we've seen recently. By contrast, the Catalans have found their misplaced defensive steel, have a coach whose win percentage eclipses all to precede him and - well - possess Messi. And Neymar. And Suarez. SAM CUNNINGHAM - Bayern Munich . I would back Guardiola to outwit any of the remaining managers in the tournament with the players at his disposal. Some were writing Bayern Munich off after their 3-1 first-leg defeat by Porto and look how that went. Everyone talks about Messi and Ronaldo, but the collective force of Bayern players is frightening. OLIVER TODD - Barcelona . After a difficult start to the season they've hit form at the right time. Enrique has found a way to get the front three of Messi,  Suarez and Neymar to fire and even if you can keep two of them quiet - as Paris Saint-Germain did on Tuesday - the other will make you pay.","Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Real Madrid make up last four .

"Hillsborough investigators have launched an appeal to track down  fans who tended to the wounded as they lay dying on the pitch at the 1989 disaster. Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy have been released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal  is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner’s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed. The Home Secretary Theresa May launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year. Investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal released today . While the images are 26 years old, investigators believe they may help track down key witnesses. Above, a man in a dark coloured jacket (left) and another in a beige jacket and grey hooded sweatshirt (right) who police believe may be able to help . Another of the fans in a distinctive white and red hat and a man seen tending to one of the wounded as they lay helpless on the football pitch (right) A man in a light denim jacket with long brown hair (left) is another person investigators believe may be able to help. Right, another person pictured in the appeal who was stuck behind the enclosure where fans were crushed . Another fan pictured in the appeal. Anyone with information about those pictured is urged to contact Operation Resolve officers . While officers said it was 'unusual' to carry out such appeals as today's while legal proceedings are active they invited anyone who recognised the people photographed to make contact. 'I have a team of highly trained staff in place who will deal with witnesses sensitively as we understand how difficult some people will find this,' added Mr Stoddart. 'The Operation Resolve website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance. 'It is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason I urge people to remember the warning issued by the Coroner at the start of the fresh inquests, which he reiterated in February 2014. 'I also urge people to consider the advisory notice issued by the Attorney General’s office on 10 March 2014. 'It is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the Hillsborough disaster on social media and forums.' Among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in Warrington are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time. The inquest continues. Ninety-six people were killed in the 1989 disaster (above). The conclusions of previous inquests were thrown out in 2012 with the Home Office launching a fresh probe .

"Fresh from his Masters triumph, Jordan Spieth made a visit to the observation deck of the Empire State Building on Monday, and of course the Augusta record-equalling champion was still proudly sporting his green jacket. Spieth broke several scoring records on the way to his four-stroke victory, including equalling the   18-under total set by Tiger Woods in 1997 and becoming the championship's second-youngest winner of all time. And the magnitude of his achievement still didn't seem to have sunk in yet as Spieth took in the press attention which included his trip to the top of the 25th-tallest completed skyscraper in the world which was lit up in green and yellow later in the evening. Fresh from his Masters triumph, Jordan Spieth visited to the observation deck of the Empire State Building . The Augusta record-equalling champion was still proudly sporting his green jacket as he snapped a selfie . 'It's all run together. It all happened quickly,' Spieth said. 'Sometimes it feels like a long time ago. And sometimes it feels like yesterday. All in all, it's really cool.' It was the disappointment of last year that ultimately carried him to a four-shot victory Sunday. He watched Bubba Watson celebrate another Masters title, and all the perks and celebrity that came with it. He knew that could have been him. 'So you get reminded of it all the time, because when you're Masters champion, it's a different legacy,' Spieth said. 'And so that definitely left me hungry. And then also, having a chance to win the last couple of week and not pulling it off.' He was runner-up in the Texas Open and lost in a playoff at the Houston Open before arriving at Augusta. The world's media were keen to get even more footage of the Augusta champion after his big weekend . It was the disappointment of last year that ultimately carried Spieth to victory and the legacy he craved . 'So the combination of the two allowed me to keep my head down, not worry about anyone else in the field except myself and to play a golf course that is my favorite course in the world,' he said. The par-5 eighth hole is where it all started to go wrong last year. He had a two-shot lead and made bogey to Watson's birdie. On the ninth hole, Spieth's shot came up a fraction short and tumbled down the front of the green and back into the fairway, leading to another bogey. Watson birdied and suddenly was two shots ahead, and Spieth didn't have the power or the putting to catch up. This year was different. His lead down to three shots, Spieth made a simple birdie on the eighth hole. This time, his approach on the ninth was fraction long enough to land on the ridge and stay put. He made par, and Justin Rose had a three-putt bogey to fall five shots behind. He was runner-up in the Texas Open and lost in a playoff at the Houston Open before arriving at Augusta . Bubba Watson presents Spieth  with the green jacket after his 18-under total secured him the victory . There was only one shaky moment after that. Spieth was four shots ahead and looking at a two-shot swing on the 16th when Rose had 15 feet for birdie and Spieth faced an 8-foot putt for par. Rose missed. Spieth made. He was on his way. 'It was probably one of the best putts he hit all day,' Rose said. It's tempting to declare Spieth as golf's next big star after such a performance and the elite company he joins. In the last century, only four players have three PGA Tour titles that include a major before turning 22 - Spieth, Woods, Tom Creavy and Gene Sarazen. He was the first wire-to-wire winner at Augusta in 39 years. He already is No 2 in the world, and he still has work to do to reach Rory McIlroy at No 1. Justin Rose praised Spieth's put on the 16th that he missed to set him on his way as 'one of the best' Golf is craving a rivalry, and this has all the trappings of one, especially because the world ranking has never had No 1 and No 2 both 25 or younger. It's worth waiting to see if other young players emerge the rest of the year in the majors, such as Jason Day or even Hideki Matsuyama, who finished fifth. But that Friday at Augusta, when Spieth shot 66 and built a five-shot lead, felt a lot like Friday at Congressional when McIlroy began to bury the U.S. Open field in 2011. 'He's way more mature than I was at 21, and a hell of a golfer and a great person as well,' McIlroy said. Rory McIlroy is currently world No 1 and while Spieth is far behind at No 2, golf is craving a top rivalry . McIlroy was not ready to think about a rivalry, even though he stated his goal very clearly that he wants to be No 1. This was a big step, but it was only a step. 'He's got four majors,' Spieth said of McIlroy. 'That's something I can still only dream about.' If history is any indication, the kid is a quick study. And he seems to be in a hurry to get where he's going.","Jordan Spieth won the Masters at Augusta in record fashion on Sunday .

"Jordan Henderson insists he couldn’t be happier after completing the formalities of signing his new long-term contract. The 24-year-old Liverpool midfielder put pen to paper on Thursday morning on a deal worth more than £100,000 per week that will keep him at Anfield until the summer of 2020. Henderson’s current terms had 12 months to run but leaving Merseyside was never an option. Henderson is the latest big name in Brendan Rodgers’ squad to commit his future to the club – deals for Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge were completed earlier in the campaign. Jordan Henderson is 'over the moon' after signing a new long-term contract with Liverpool . The club's vice captain puts pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at Liverpool until 2020 . Henderson seen in training for Liverpool at Melwood on Thursday afternoon . Henderson shakes hands with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during training at Melwood . Liverpool, who are expected to confirm that Jordon Ibe has signed a similar long-term extension before the end of the week, have been in negotiations since the start of the season with Henderson’s advisers. He has not let the talks distract his focus and  has been one of Liverpool’s most consistent players, producing 13 assists and seven goals from midfield and, significantly, being promoted to the role of vice captain. Rodgers will consider Henderson for the role of club captain after Steven Gerrard moves to LA Galaxy at the end of the campaign but, for now, the England international is delighted to have agreed terms on a contract that will take him through the peak years of his career. ‘I’m over the moon that it’s all done just so I can concentrate on the future and what needs to be done now, said Henderson, who arrived from Sunderland in a £16million deal in June 2011, when Kenny Dalglish was manager. Jordan Henderson, in action against Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday, has agreed a new Liverpool deal . Henderson has enjoyed a strong campaign and could be handed the armband when Steven Gerrard leaves . Asked if there was ever a point when he thought negotiations might not reach a successful conclusion, Henderson replied: ‘Not really, no. For me it was just a case of leaving it to the club and my agent to sort it out. ‘I always said that I wanted to stay at Liverpool and there was no other club that I would go to. I wanted to commit my future and it was just a matter of time for my agent and the club to sort it out. Thankfully today it’s done.' Henderson is keen to add to his trophy cabinet after winning just one trophy since sealing a move to Liverpool in 2011. 'Hopefully we've got many years ahead of winning trophies,' Henderson told liverpoolfc.com. 'I'm the same as every other player, I want to be playing at the highest level - in the Champions League, winning trophies and being very successful. 'I had good conversations with the manager about the future of the football club and it was very bright, I was very pleased with what I was hearing. 'I want to be a big part of that and hopefully I can. 'I feel there's a lot of potential, but we need to start turning that potential into winning things. I've got a good feeling that we can do that.' Henderson arrived from Sunderland in a £16million deal in June 2011, when Kenny Dalglish was manager . The Liverpool midfielder shoots during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa . Rodgers added: 'Jordan is a brilliant professional and his dedication to his career and football in general makes him a role model to all young players. 'He has faced adversity in his time at Liverpool, but his improvement, growth and development is entirely down to his own hunger, commitment and willingness to learn and be better. 'The fact he has made such a long-term commitment to Liverpool is a sign of his belief in what we are looking to do here. He will have a crucial role to play as we look to take this side forward and look to add success to the progress we have made.

"Under pressure Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola has revealed that 'only the treble is enough' for his team as they attempt to overturn their 3-1 deficit against Porto in the Champions League. Bayern host the Portuguese side on Tuesday and Guardiola is confident the Bundesliga leaders will emerge victorious. 'I am completely convinced that my players will take their chances,' Guardiola said. 'I know which club I am at and know that (league) champions and cup winners is not enough. Only the treble is enough.' Pep Guardiola is targeting winning  three trophies with Bayern Munich this season .

Bayern remain on course for three trophies, leading the Bundesliga by 12 points and will meet Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final. The Bavarians won the treble under then coach Jupp Heynckes in 2013, just before Guardiola took over. The current Bayern boss also won the treble with Barcelona in 2009, when they became the first Spanish club to win the domestic league and cup as well as the Champions League in the same season. Ahead of the visit of Porto, Guardiola said on Monday that France winger Franck Ribery is highly unlikely to recover from an ankle injury in time to feature for Bayern. Ribery has been out for more than a month and Guardiola said it was more likely the player would miss the second leg of the quarter-final in Munich as the Germans look to recover from a stunning 3-1 defeat in Portugal last week. 'I do not think that Franck can play,' Guardiola told reporters. 'I will speak with the our doctor but my feeling is that he can't make it.' Guardiola's hopes of turning the tie around have been hampered by a string of injury absences, including to key players Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Javi Martinez and Medhi Benatia. Bastian Schweinsteiger is also fighting to get fit in time for the game and Guardiola said the Germany captain would train with the team late on Monday for the first time.

The Spaniard, who wore a T-shirt made by the family of an Argentine journalist killed in a car crash at last year's World Cup, said his team would try everything to overturn the first leg deficit despite the injury problems. 'It makes no sense to be on the pitch if you don't want to turn it around. We want to turn it around,' he said.","Porto beat Bayern Munich 3-1 in Champions League quarter-final first leg .

"Real Madrid's Champions League victory over city rivals Atletico on Wednesday night marked the eighth match Gareth Bale has not started this season... and Real have won every single one.

Bale's time on the sidelines has coincided with huge matches against Barcelona, two Champions League ties with Liverpool (in which he entered the fray as a 62nd-minute substitute at the Bernabeu), and Wednesday night's European quarter-final against Atletico... but it seems the rest of the Real squad are just fine without him. In the first half of the season, Bale suffered a buttock muscle injury while on international duty with Wales, and he missed La Liga matches against Levante (5-0 win), Barcelona (3-1 win), Granada (4-0 win) and a 3-0 Champions League victory against Liverpool. He was in contention for the return leg against Liverpool at the Bernabeu, but did not start the match, instead coming on as a second-half substitute. Real were 1-0 up when he came on, and the score remained the same until the final whistle. In December, Madrid were already leading 4-1 against third-tier side Cornella in their Copa del Rey tie heading into the second leg, and Carlo Ancelotti opted to rest some of his biggest names. Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Sergio Ramos and Bale were all among the stars watching on from the sidelines as Los Blancos recorded a comfortable 5-0 win. That's six games without Bale in the starting line-up, and six wins for Real. Moving into 2015, Bale played a major role in the team's start to the year, scoring 12 goals between his return to the side against Celta Vigo and his omission against Eibar on April 11. Bale was sidelined for Real's 3-1 win over Barcelona, in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a penalty . Karim Benzema scored in a 3-0 win against Liverpool at Anfield in October... Bale was injured for the game . Ancelotti stated in the build-up to the match that he had decided to rest the Welshman, while the team went on to win 3-0 against their struggling opposition. Bale again returned the side for two matches, a goalless draw against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League and a win against Malaga in La Liga, but suffered a calf injury in the early stages of the latter domestic clash. Instead of taking to the field in the crucial European match on Wednesday night, Bale was resigned to watching the match from home, where he tweeted his support of the team. Javier Hernandez's goal against Atletico ensured Real have won all of their eight matches without Bale . The Welshman took to Facebook on Wednesday to wish Real Madrid good luck against city rivals Atletico . Javier Hernandez's late goal ensured another victory for Ancelotti's men, taking their Bale-less record to eight wins, no draws and no losses. With the Welshman, Real have a 69 per cent win record, far from disastrous, recording 29 wins, four draws and nine losses. But the stats without him will surely give ammunition to those unhappy with their £86million man.","Gareth Bale has not started eight of Real Madrid's matches this season .

"It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway, . But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night . Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback . Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern . Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto . Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova . And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League .","Thiago Alcantara scored Bayern Munich's first goal in 6-1 win over Porto .

"Southampton are the club punching heaviest above their weight in the Premier League in terms of performance compared with wages paid to players while Chelsea are also over-achieving, latest figures have revealed. Saints are only ranked 16th in the top flight in terms of their wage bill - £55.2million - and yet are currently seventh in the Premier League. Chelsea are 10 points clear at the top of the table but are only the third-highest payers with a wage bill of £192.7million behind Manchester United (£215.8m) and Manchester City (£205m). Bottom-club Burnley's wage bill is just £21.5m including £6m in promotion bonuses, one-tenth the size of United's. Despite being seventh in the league, Southampton have the fourth lowest wage bill based on last season . Third-placed Manchester United have have the highest wage bill at £215.8m, based on last season's figures . Chelsea are 10 points clear at the top of the table but are only the third-highest wage payers with £192.7m . Chris Ramsey's QPR side salary bill was almost twice what the club earned in total last season . The biggest under-achievers are QPR, with a £75.3million wage bill even from a season when they were in the Championship making them the eighth-highest payers - yet they are down at 19th in the Premier League table. QPR's salary bill was almost twice what the club earned in total last season. The wages costs and profits or losses of all top-flight clubs for 2013-14 have now been confirmed via annual accounts posted at Companies House and overall there is a close correlation between total salary bill and league position, with the current top four in the Premier League also the four biggest payers. How the Premier League table currently stands . The combined accounts of the 20 clubs shows over overall turnover rose to £3.07billion from £2.3billion in 2012/13 with wages increasing too but at a slower rate and totalling £1.84billion compared with £1.59billion. The latest figure shows salaries account for 59.9 per cent of turnover compared with 71.7 per cent for the same 20 clubs a year before. The increase in income is mainly down to the Premier League's lucrative television deal that came into effect for the first time last season. The cash injection has led to six clubs who were in the red in 2012/13 now being in the black. Apart from those clubs who were promoted from the Championship last season, only Manchester City, Aston Villa and Sunderland ended the 2013/14 season having made a financial loss. Premier League director of communications Dan Johnson said the clubs' decision two years ago to introduce spending controls had also contributed to a positive financial outlook . Johnson said: 'There are two reasons for this. The first is increasing revenues and the second is the financial criteria the clubs have voted in two seasons ago which put financial sustainability at the heart of how they want to go forward.' The measures introduced by the clubs capped the amount they could use television money to pay for player costs. It also put a long-term limit on a club's overall losses. The figures also show Sunderland are the ninth-highest payers but are 16th in the table. Burnley have the lowest wage bill with £21.5m based on the financial figures from last season .","Seventh-placed Southampton's wage bill for last season was £55.2million .

"Keeping David de Gea at the club would be the biggest signing Manchester United could make this summer, says Phil Neville. The Spanish keeper has impressed for Louis van Gaal's side this season and has heavily been linked with a move to Real Madrid, who are looking for a long-term replacement for Iker Casillas. United have been linked with their own big-money moves for the likes of Gareth Bale and Mats Hummels, but Neville believes the club must concentrate on keeping De Gea at Old Trafford. David de Gea met Man United fans earlier in the week as part of a day organised by the club's foundation . De Gea punches the ball away during Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . 'The biggest thing is David De Gea, and keeping him at the football club,' Neville told the Manchester Evening News. 'From when he first came, to how he is now, I don’t think I’ve seen a player develop and improve as quickly as him. 'I saw with Cristiano (Ronaldo), I saw the development in terms of his performance, his size, his stature and his physique. 'He’s winning football games on his own. Last minutes saves against Everton, Hull, Arsenal away - there’s seven or eight occasions where he has won United games which just shows you that he is world-class.'","David de Gea has been integral to Man United's success this season .

"Manchester United have put forward an opening £21.5million offer for Dortmund captain Mats Hummels, according to German newspaper Bild. The Germans value their captain at £35million but in United's favour he has had a relatively poor season occasionally clashing with supporters when results went against them earlier this season. Dortmund are keen to bring in Sami Khedira from Real Madrid as their new captain amid a summer of big changes following Jurgen Klopp's announcement that he will leave the club at the end of the season. Manchester United are reported to have put in a £21.5m bid for Dortmund defender Mats Hummels (left) Hummels (left) struggled early in the season for Dortmund and United hope to use that to their advantage . German paper Bild have reported the bid has been placed but Sportsmail understands the offer hasn't gone in yet. German World Cup winner Hummels is under contract with Dortmund until 2017 but earlier in the season admitted he would like to play abroad at some point in his career. He told Kicker: 'Some days I think I would definitely like to move abroad but then, other days, I think I don't fancy it at all,' he said when asked of United's interest. 'Basically, I think moving abroad would be good for my professional and personal well-being. Eventually, I'd like to leave the Bundesliga. 'I have had many conversations with the leaders of Dortmund, where I know I am a big part of the team, but I am yet to make a decision about my future.

"Radamel Falcao could still sign permanently for Manchester United after it emerged that chief executive Ed Woodward held talks with Monaco on Sunday over the striker’s future. Falcao, who has scored just four times for United since his season-long loan move from Monaco, drew another blank at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea on Saturday evening. But Woodward told Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev last Sunday that they would make a decision on the right to sign him permanently at the end of the season. Manchester United could sign Radamel Falcao permanently after holding talks with Monaco on Sunday . The striker has endured a frustrating season on loan at Man United and has managed just four league goals . Vasilyev said: ‘I saw the Manchester United people last Sunday and they have not yet decided if they would exercise the option.. ‘It’s not his best season, but they kept the opportunity to make a decision at the end of the season.’ Although it seems highly unlikely that United will keep the Colombian striker, Falcao has been given hope of a second chance under Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Under the terms of the original loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the forward, but it has since emerged that Monaco are willing to negotiate on the transfer fee after a disappointing season at United. Vasilyev added: ‘We are not in any other negotiations, even if big clubs are interested. The decision is with Manchester, then we will discuss with the player what he wants. I would like to have more visibility.’ Falcao missed last summer’s World Cup in Brazil following a knee injury and it is thought he rushed his recovery in an attempt to play in the tournament for Colombia. Under the terms of the loan United would have to pay £43.5m for the striker but Monaco are willing to negotiate . Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward spoke with Monaco president Vasim Vasilyev on Sunday . Vasilyev added: ‘He had mishaps in Monaco. He had problems with the coach Claudio Ranieri, there was a lack of understanding. ‘He was also seriously injured and missed the World Cup. In late August, he came to tell us that he wanted to play at a higher level.” Ranieri has since been replaced by Leonardo Jardim and he has backed Falcao to rediscover his goalscoring form after a frustrating season at United. Jardim, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Juventus in the Stade Louis II, is preparing for his return at the end of the season. Jardim, speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Juventus, is confident Falcao can get back to his best . The Portuguese coach said: ‘He’s not had a great season that is true, but I’m sure he can come back to the levels he was at in the past - that much I’m convinced about. ‘It’s not a question for me, but for the players, I’ve only worked with him for a month.’ Monaco lost the first leg last week in the Juventus Stadium to a controversial penalty and face Massimiliano Allegri’s team in the second leg.","Manchester United could still sign Radamel Falcao permanently .

"Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici has taken to Twitter to apologise for his crucial gaffe in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final defeat to Arsenal.
