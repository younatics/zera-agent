"Chelsea moved another step closer to securing the Premier League title, after Cesc Fabregas scored an 87 minute winner at Loftus Road, to condemn Queens Park Rangers to a devastating defeat. Jose Mourinho's side struggled to get into their rhythm and had Thibaut Courtois to thank, following a series of impressive saves to deny Charlie Austin and Matt Phillips. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Queens Park Rangers . Rob Green - His dreadful kick led to Chelsea's late winner. Not a moment he'll want to remember in hurry. 5.5 . Mauricio Isla - Tasked with taming the interchanging Hazard and Willian and kept at his task admirably. 6.5 . Steven Caulker - Alongside Onuoha, the defender dealt with Drogba's threat excellently. 7 . Nedum Onuoha - Strong display from the versatile defender, who now looks at home at centre-back. 7 . Nedum Onuoha (15) performed well at the back for QPR and kept Didier Drogba quiet throughout . Clint Hill - Showed tremendous desire at left-back and did well to combat both Willian and Hazard. 7 . Matt Phillips - Has shone in recent weeks for Rangers and caused Chelsea problems with his pace. 6.5 . Joey Barton - Hurried and hassled Chelsea's midfield. Typical energy from the controversial midfielder. 6.5 . Joey Barton (centre) put in a good shift for the home side and made life difficult for Chelsea's midfield . Matt Phillips (right) came close to scoring for QPR but his shot was brilliantly saved by Courtois . Sandro - Put a real shift in for Rangers and showed moments of quality, too. Denied a goal by Courtois' brilliance. 6.5 . Karl Henry - His defensive instincts were vital as QPR tried to stem Chelsea's attacking flow. 6.5 . Bobby Zamora - No wondergoal this week, but his experience was just as important in this west London derby. 6.5 . Charlie Austin - Caused Chelsea problems with his clever movement and went close on a couple of occasions. 6.5 . Subs . Niko Kranjcar 6 (for Sandro 81) Junior Hoilett 5.5 (for Zamora 83); Richard Dunne (for Isla 90) Chris Ramsey - 6.5 . Charlie Austin (left) nearly scored a spectacular effort in the first half but the Chelsea keeper denied him . Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois - The busier of the two keepers; produced a brilliant save in the second to deny Phillips. 7.5 . Branislav Ivanovic - Looked comfortable for much of the afternoon as opponent Henry showed little attacking intent. 6.5 . Gary Cahill - Stood up to the physical battle with Austin and Zamora with minimal fuss. 6.5 . The Belgian goalkeeper was Chelsea's stand-out performer with a number of crucial saves . John Terry - An unpopular figure at Loftus Road, but stood firm under hostilities from the home crowd. 7 . Cesar Azpilicueta - The left-back was kept busy by Phillips down QPR's right, but emerged with plenty credit. 7 . Ramires - Had little impact in midfield and was hauled off by Mourinho early in the second half. 5 . Nemanja Matic - Has had far better afternoons but, as ever, offered a solid-enough shield to his back-four. 6 . Cesar Azpilicueta (left) kept QPR's dangerous attackers quiet and was good going forward to join the attack . Cesc Fabregas - The masked midfielder was off-key all afternoon before popping up with the winner. 6.5 . Willian - Tireless as ever down both Chelsea flanks, but couldn't help his side break down resolute Rangers. 6.5 . Eden Hazard - A quieter than usual afternoon for the Belgian, but still provided a telling contribution for the winner. 6 . Didier Drogba - Handed a rare start with Remy and Costa missing through injury, but had little impact on proceedings. 6 . Subs: . Oscar 6 (for Ramires, 56); Juan Cuadrado 5.5 (for Willian 80); Kurt Zouma (for Fabregas) Jose Mourinho - 6.5 . Man of the Match: Courtois . Cesc Fabregas (right) slotted home the winner after good work from Eden Hazard and Oscar . Hazard (right) had a fairly quiet afternoon but provided the assist for Fabregas to win the clash .","Thibaut Courtois was superb in Chelsea's goal with a number of key saves .

"Stuart McCall expects Shane Ferguson to be fit and ready to aid Rangers’ play-off push towards the Premiership. The Northern Ireland international finally joined up with his Ibrox team-mates this week, more than two months after he was one of five Newcastle players sent north on loan to the Championship side. Ferguson has not played since his country’s 2-0 European qualifier win over Greece in Athens in October and the 23-year-old’s knee injury had been expected to keep him out for the season. Rangers manager Stuart McCall takes a training session at Murray Park on Tuesday morning . But McCall revealed: ‘Shane’s been out for five months but the good thing about him is his mental state. I spoke to him on Monday and I was really impressed. Do I get the impression he is he is here to play? Yes, definitely. ‘I liked the way he was talking, he wants to get straight into it. He’s a naturally fit lad and he seems really focused too, so that was pleasing. ‘He trained really hard on Monday and on Tuesday and he’s on his way to a quick recovery, which would be positive news for us. ‘If our Under-20 game (against Dundee United on Tuesday) had not been on astro turf, he might have got an hour under his belt. ‘But if you’ve been out that long you’re going to need four to six weeks to get back on track. So he certainly won’t be ready in the next two weeks but hopefully he will play his part in the back end of the season.” Newcastle United loanee Shane Ferguson takes part in the training session . Rangers were controversially loaned players from Newcastle in January, when St James’ Park and Sports Direct supremo Mike Ashley was still calling the shots in the Ibrox boardroom ahead of the Dave King-led takeover. Then-manager Kenny McDowall sensationally revealed he had been ordered to play all five when fit. But with Rangers believed not to have carried out medicals, Kevin Mbabu and Ferguson have not featured through injury and fitness, while Gael Bigirimana is believed to have a blood disorder. Defender Remie Street went off injured after 44 minutes of his debut and has not been seen since, . Only Slovenian Haris Vuckic has been a success, scoring six goals in his last seven games. But McCall now hopes he can call on a player who impressed last summer in friendlies for Northern Ireland against Chile and Uruguay. ‘I’ve spoken to a couple of lads like Dean Shiels, who know Shane from Northern Ireland, and it’s all positive,’ said McCall. ‘I also spoke to Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill about him. He’s filled in at left-back for them but probably his best position is one up on the left. He’s certainly a good crosser of the ball, he’s shown that in the sessions we have done. Ferguson (right) finally joined up with the Rangers squad in Glasgow this week . ‘I went through his Wikipedia last night and I think he’s played 23 games for Newcastle in the Premier and 30 for Birmingham. You don’t play that number unless you’ve got something about you.’ Rangers must pay Newcastle an extra £500,000 over and above wages for the loan players if they go up through the play-offs but McCall would be delighted if that happens. ‘It was a surprise to everyone when the news about that came out, because it’s quite a lot of money, especially when only one of the (loan players) is playing,’ said McCall. ‘But if it was me - and it’s not because it’s not my money - I’d love to give Newcastle £500,000 because that means we have got promotion.’ Defender Darren McGregor echoed his manager’s views and insisted that promotion was all that mattered after what has been a roller-coaster season. Rangers defender Darren McGregor trains as the club look to claim promotion to the Scottish Premiership . ‘A lot of fans would accept it has been a bad year and all the boys will hold their hands up and say it has not been good enough,’ said the 29-year-old. ‘But if we do get promoted, it would be seen as a successful season. I know that’s quite hard to comprehend but from where we were a couple of months ago, to actually get up would be good. ‘Winning the league would have been great but the aim was always to get promotion. And the way the season has panned out for us, it will now need to be through the play offs.’ Hibs and Rangers are currently locked on 61 points, with Wednesday's match at Livingston representing the Ibrox side’s game in hand. The Easter Road club have a better goal difference of +2 but McGregor is happy that Rangers remain in control of their destiny with Dumbarton away and Falkirk at Ibrox their remaining two matches after their visit to the Energy Assets Arena on Wednsday. Rangers players prepare for the trip to bottom-of-the-table Livingston on Wednesday night . ‘We know our goal difference is short at the moment, but we also know if we keep winning game it’s in our hands to finish second,’ said McGregor. ‘If we beat Livingston, we are three points clear. ‘We want to finish second because that would give us one week more preparation for the play-offs. So we want to win every game until the end of the season. ‘We’ve shown a glimmer of what we are capable of lately and we need to bottle that and take it to Livvy.’","Newcastle  loanee Shan Ferguson finally joined up with Rangers this week .

"Rangers insist that their fans have no cause for alarm over badges and other trademarks being registered with Sports Direct — as they will return to the club when a £5million loan is repaid. The Ibrox board last week launched a probe into claims Mike Ashley’s firm had taken ownership of intellectual property, including the club’s famous crests. However, they are satisfied the position stems solely from the security attached to the loan from Sports Direct, accepted by the former regime in January. ‘It has been widely reported that the trademarks, the iconic symbols of our club, are now in the possession of Sports Direct,’ said a club statement. ‘Although the trademarks are registered in Sports Direct’s name, the position is not as alarming as it may first appear. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is a divisive figure north and south of the border . ‘Rangers remain the rightful and legal owners of their trademarks and interim chairman Paul Murray has clarified this position with Sports Direct. Both parties will come together within the next two weeks for talks. ‘Confusion over ownership arose last week when it was noticed on a Government Intellectual Property site that they appeared to be the possessions of Sports Direct but this was as a consequence of the loan facility entered into by the previous board. In return for the loan, Sports Direct took security over all Rangers assets — but not Ibrox — including intellectual property owned by the club. ‘In England, it is possible to secure such rights by a fixed charge, but in Scotland, the equivalent of an English fixed charge can only be granted over heritable property — land and buildings. The Rangers board have reassured fans that the club still owns trademarks and the badge . ‘Accordingly, a practice has developed of lenders taking absolute transfers subject to a back-letter setting out that the transfer is in security and the property will be returned when the facility has been repaid. This is a common device adopted by most of the UK banks and lenders. ‘Rangers supporters can be reassured that Sports Direct fully accept that all of the IP rights registered in their name will be returned to the club when the loan facility of £5million is repaid.’ Kenny Miller wears the club's famous badge on his shirt as he gestures during an outing for Rangers .","The Ibrox board last week launched a probe into claims Mike Ashley’s firm had taken ownership of intellectual property .

"Rangers boss Stuart McCall hopes injured Newcastle winger Shane Ferguson could play a surprise role in the club's play-off bid. The Northern Ireland capped midfielder was sent north by the Magpies as part of a five-man package on the final day of the January transfer window. But Gers missed the fact he was carrying a long-term knee injury when they failed to carry out a medical. Stuart McCall confident Shane Ferguson can play a vital role in Rangers push for promotion to the SPL . Ferguson, 23, only checked in to the club's Murray Park training base on Monday after he was finally given the green light to resume action. Now McCall has revealed the Derry-born wide man could make his Gers bow as the Ibrox side look to climb back to the Premiership through the play-offs. The Light Blues boss said: 'I was really pleased yesterday when I saw him training. When you have been out for so long with a knee ligament injury, it's not just the physical aspect but the mental one. 'But he was really positive. I've had a wee chat with him and he's desperate to get involved. 'He's a wee bit away from match fitness and won't be ready to play in the next week or two because he's been out too long. The on-loan Newcastle United wide man has been out injured since he joined the club but is back training . 'But he is mentally in the right place, as in he is here to help, and he could be a welcome addition for the back end of the season.' The deal which saw Ferguson, Haris Vuckic, Gael Bigirimana, Kevin Mbabu and Remie Streete swap St James' Park for Ibrox has proved controversial. So far, only Vuckic has played regularly. Street picked up an injury on his debut against Raith and has not been seen since, while the other three arrived packing injury and fitness issues. But there was another sting in the tail for the frustrated Gers faithful when they learned the deal included a clause which meant their club would have to give Newcastle owner Mike Ashley a £500,000 cheque if they won promotion. McCall, though, joked he would be happy to hand over the cash if it meant he had succeeded in reclaiming Gers' top-flight slot. He said: 'It was a surprise to everyone when the news about that came out, because it's quite a lot of money, especially when only one of them is playing. 'But if it was me - and it's not because it's not my money - I'd love to give Newcastle £500,000 because that means we have got promotion.' Having made 23 appearances for his parent club, Ferguson will be a welcome addition to the squad . Ashley's standing in Govan took another pounding last week too when it emerged the club's iconic trademarks and badges had been registered on a government website in the name of his Sports Direct firm. The billionaire tycoon loaned the previous regime running the club £5million in January and took security over a number of Rangers assets - including the logos - in return. The new Rangers board have now probed the affair and reassured fans they still remain the rightful owner of the badges - but the row had worried some fans Ashley may now scupper any potential deal for Vuckic out of spite. The Slovenian has been the sole positive from Rangers' relationship with the Newcastle owner after scoring seven goals in just 12 games since moving north. But McCall is hopeful there will be no further repercussions, saying: 'From what I read from Paul Murray, they are going to have a meeting with Sports Direct in the near future. I'm sure there will be some good talks come out of that. Haris Vuckic (left) is only success story from the other loanee's, scoring seven goals in 12 appearances . 'Haris has another year left on his Newcastle contract. For the here and now he is trying to get us promotion. He is still a Newcastle player but I don't think (the badge row) would have any bearing on (any potential Rangers bid). 'I don't think there has been any great falling out with the club and Newcastle whatsoever.' Gers bounced back from last week's 3-0 defeat to Queen of the South by sticking four goals past Raith on Sunday. They now face basement boys Livingston on Wednesday but McCall expects another difficult match at the Energy Assets Arena. He said: 'I genuinely think this could be one of the toughest games we've got left. 'I saw them win last week at home to Falkirk and you can tell they are a team that has got everything to play for. We have got to match their desire and hopefully our quality will take over.'","Stuart McCall revealed Shane Ferguson still has a role to play for Rangers .

"Thibaut Courtois has achieved a lot in a relatively short time, but the Chelsea goalkeeper is not resting on his laurels with the Premier League title in his sights. The 22-year-old has established himself as one of the world's best goalkeepers in recent years, impressing first for Genk, then Atletico Madrid and Jose Mourinho's side. Courtois' fine performances have helped bring with it collective success, with the Blues' recent Capital One Cup triumph making this a fifth straight trophy-winning season for the goalkeeper. Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois celebrates after Cesc Fabregas handed them the lead at QPR . The Belgian keeper produced an excellent performance as Chelsea moved closer to the title at Loftus Road . Courtois helped Chelsea to the League Cup earlier in the season and now wants to win the Premier League . Chelsea sit seven points clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League table . 2014-2015 (Chelsea) League Cup . 2013-2014 (Atletico Madrid) La Liga . 2012-2013 (Atletico Madrid) Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cup . 2011-2012 (Atletico Madrid) UEFA Europa League . 2010-2011 (Genk) Belgian Pro League . The Wembley victory was good, he says, but having been substitute it would understandably be surpassed should Chelsea get over the line in the Premier League. 'Last season, I was part of a team who lost the Champions League in the last minute, so that's something I still want to win, and to be able to play for a Premier League title every season is also a big motivation,' Courtois told the club magazine. 'To win a European Championship or a World Cup with Belgium is another goal. 'But, it is true, when I was a young kid I dreamed of playing in finals and it's nice to have won the Europa League and Super Cup, and won a final against Real Madrid, but hopefully I can achieve much more now. 'Every year I've won one trophy, so it's nice we won the one at Wembley. 'But, of course, the Premier League would be much bigger so hopefully we can add that this season.' Courtois won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Europa League during his three seasons at Atletico Madrid . His first season with Chelsea in the Premier League has been a success on the whole . There have been some embarrassing moments, such as being lobbed by Charlie Adam this month . Courtois joined Chelsea in 2011 but this is his first campaign with the club, having spent the past three seasons on loan at Atletico. The Belgium international has displaced club great Petr Cech as number one and, despite a few recent slip-ups, proved his worth with a wonderful display in Sunday's 1-0 win at QPR. 'As a goalkeeper, you might only have to make one or two saves a game - but sometimes really important ones - so, of course, it's nice that people see it and recognise it,' Courtois said. 'The concentration as a goalkeeper needs to be very high. We work on the focus in training and it's good because, in big teams, one save maybe in minute 88 can be decisive, so it's very important.'","Belgian is determined to lift the Premier League trophy for Chelsea .

"Arsenal should target Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech if he leaves Stamford Bridge at the end of the season, insists Carlo Cudicini. Cech has made just five Barclays Premier League appearances this season as Thibaut Courtois remains manager Jose Mourinho's first-choice goalkeeper. But Cudicini feels the 32-year-old Czech Republic international would be a good fit under Arsene Wenger instead of Wojciech Szczesny at Arsenal. Petr Cech, in action for Czech Republic against Latvia last week, is poised to leave Chelsea in the summer . Cech, who joined Chelsea in 2004, has made just five Premier League appearances this season . Chelsea want at least £10million for Cech, and they would have to sell to a direct rival for the goalkeeper to end up at the Emirates. Prompted on TalkSport by Ray Parlour who said Arsenal 'have to get' Cech, Cudicini added: 'I agree. 'Arsenal have had a few problems with goalkeepers after [David] Seaman and [Jens] Lehmann. 'Szczesny is still struggling to impose himself as number one, so if a goalkeeper like Petr Cech is available in the summer, obviously he should be a big target for Arsenal.' Cech revealed last week he does not want to spend another season as understudy to Courtois.

"Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc admitted that Barcelona were superior to his side 'in virtually every department' as he saw his team slump to a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of the quarter-final at the Parc des Princes. An early strike from Neymar and second-half brace from Luis Suarez sealed victory for Barcelona and placed the Catalan outfit into a commanding position ahead of the return at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. Blanc admitted his side felt the absence of the suspended Marco Verratti and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, while PSG were also unable to start with David Luiz and saw Thiago Silva hobble off in the early stages. Luis Suarez eases past David Luiz en route to scoring his second goal of the Champions League tie . Gerard Pique leads the celebrations after Barcelona secured a 3-1 victory in Paris on Wednesday night . 'I'm not going to make excuses about us being depleted,' said Blanc. 'I'm not doing that. We put a team out there, but we were dominated by Barcelona. 'It's only six days until the second leg, with a league game in between, so it's a 'short week' for people to recover. I think Barcelona were fitter than us. We had players who weren't at 100 per cent, and also a lot of absentees, but that should have been a motivation for us. We never controlled the ball well enough, and Barca were better than us in virtually every department. 'We will have the suspended players back next week, and that is an incentive. We'll try and put on a better show than we did tonight. They were better than us tonight and scored three goals. We'll try and show a different PSG at Barcelona next week. Hopefully we will achieve a different result.' Laurent Blanc made no excuses for his side as they now face elimination from the Champions League . David Luiz, who started the game from the substitutes' bench, endured a night to forget in the French capital . In the end, the Frenchman was relieved to escape only 3-1 down. 'It didn't end up as bad as it might have done, but the players are very disappointed with the way it went,' he said. 'We gave the impression we gave Barcelona the kind of game they wanted to pay. They made life difficult for us on the counter-attack and have players who can be very dangerous.' Barcelona manager Luis Enrique was delighted with his side's showing and reserved special praise for Suarez. 'Suarez is special in his own way,' Enrique said, 'Look at the goals he scored for Ajax and Liverpool. He is very strong and finishes so well. But it wasn't just about Luis Suarez tonight. We were superb in defence, midfield and attack.'","Barcelona have one foot in last four after beating Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 .

"It seems that scoring stunning volleys in Tyne-Wear derbies is not the limit of Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe's limits as he shows off his impressive keepy up skills with a tennis ball. Fresh from his heroics on Sunday when he struck a brilliant volley to earn his side victory against Newcastle at the Stadium of Light, Defoe was the first player to take part in Sunderland's keepy up challenge. The former Tottenham forward set an impressive score of 76 for his team-mates to beat before taking the second part of the challenge - keepy ups with a Creme Egg. Tyne-Wear derby hero Jermain Defoe takes on the Sunderland keepy up challenge . The former Tottenham and West Ham striker is the first Sunderland player to take the challenge . Defoe eventually sets an impressive score of 76 for his team-mates to attempt to beat . Defoe was unable to replicate the high score achieved with the tennis ball but managed to post a respectable-looking nine with the Easter treat. Defoe was overcome with emotion in the wake of his brilliant blast, and admits the joy it brought to a sold-out Stadium of Light was too much to take in. 'I have said many times that I missed the Premier League and it's because of games like this,' he said. 'Games like this are why I came back. Being at a club like this, they just love football. I was told before that if I come here and work hard and score goals, they won't ask for anything more. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe celebrates after scoring a stunning volley against Newcastle . Defoe's superb first-half strike was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby . Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was completely helpless as Defoe's shot found its way into the top corner . 'And I just love scoring goals, the fans deserved it. It's been really difficult for them in the last few weeks but they always turn out. 'It was the whole occasion really that got to me. It was great to be the person that made so many people happy. I was just thinking, ""Why me?"". 'As the whistle went for half-time and as I was walking down the tunnel I thought, ""I'm crying and I'm on the telly"", but I didn't care. For the fans and everyone it was just a special day.' The 32-year-old not only wrote his name into Sunderland folklore with his derby winner at the weekend but boosted Dick Advocaat's side survival hopes. The North East club moved three points clear of the relegation zone with seven games to play as the Dutch manager earned his first win since taking charge.","Jermain Defoe was the first Sunderland player to take part in the challenge .

"Luke Shaw has conceded his debut season at Manchester United has been a frustrating one and admits he doesn't know what he would do if he scored against boyhood club Chelsea on Saturday. Shaw joined United last summer in a £31.5million transfer from Southampton after an impressive campaign on the south coast, which resulted in him playing for England at the World Cup. However, injuries have plagued the 19-year-old's start to life at Old Trafford with the defender picking up his latest fitness setback during United's 2-1 FA Cup sixth-round exit at home to Arsenal last month. Luke Shaw admits he has endured a 'frustrating' debut season at Manchester United giving himself a 'C-' The 19-year-old's campaign has been beset by injuries since joining from Southampton last summer . Shaw (second left) is back  training with United after missing their last five Premier League games . In total, Shaw has only made 17 appearances in all competitions - a figure he admits is less than satisfactory. “It’s been a frustrating one because of the injuries I’ve picked up but I’m loving it,' he told Match of the Day magazine in an exclusive interview. 'If I was to write a school report on my first season here I’d give myself a C-. You don’t realise just how big Man United is until you’re actually here – it’s frightening! It is the biggest club around.' Despite an injury-plagued beginning under Louis van Gaal, when fit Shaw describes himself as 'lucky' to be playing alongside players such as captain Wayne Rooney and record-signing Angel di Maria. Shaw (right) has made only made 17 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils at present . Shaw last appearance for United came in their 2-1 FA Cup sixth round exit at home to Arsenal last month . Shaw was speaking exclusively to Match of the Day magazine - on sale between April 14-20 . 'I’m playing with the likes of Wayne Rooney, [Angel] Di Maria, [Radamel] Falcao and it’s weird because my friends always talk about them, saying how good they are and I’m just thinking “Wow, I play with them!” I’m probably one of the luckiest 19-year-olds to be alive,' he added. Shaw missed United's 4-2 demolition of Manchester City on Sunday as he continues to recover from the injury picked up on FA Cup duty against Arsenal. United's No 3 was back in training prior to the Manchester derby as the Red Devils moved four points clear of their rivals in third place in the Premier League. Van Gaal's men are now looking to record their seventh league win in a row when they travel to table-toppers Chelsea on Saturday evening. And Shaw, who grew up supporting Chelsea, is hoping to play a part in that fixture - adding that it is his favourite away ground to play at. 'I used to watch Chelsea every week. It was really good when I got to play at Stamford Bridge, I would say that’s my favourite away stadium to go to. Chelsea is one of the first games I look for when the new fixtures come out.

"Stoke midfielder Charlie Adam was left with mixed emotions after scoring the best goal of his career only to end up a loser at Stamford Bridge. Adam netted one of the most memorable goals in Premier League history as he lobbed Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois from 66 yards on the stroke of half-time. That levelled the scores up at 1-1, but Adam's wonder strike would end up counting for nothing as Chelsea snatched a second-half winner to leave Stoke nursing a third successive league loss.

Thibaut Courtois watches on as he is unable to stop Adam's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1-1 . Stoke ended up losing 2-1 at Stamford Bridge as Loic Remy (left) scored the winner for Chelsea . And while Adam was understandably proud of his 'incredible' goal, the Scotland international admits the main thing for him is how the team get on and he was quick to turn his focus to next weekend's clash with West Ham. Asked if it was the greatest goal of his career, Adam said on Stoke Player: 'Of course. It's an incredible strike, it's a nice goal to score but the important thing for us is winning the game. 'It's three on the bounce we've lost now, which is bad, but hopefully we can improve on that next week against West Ham.

West Ham are currently ninth in the standings, one spot ahead of Stoke, but both teams have 42 points. Adam added: 'It's going to be a tough game. They're in and around us as well.

"A once in a lifetime shot, they said, but it appears Charlie Adam has done it before. The Stoke midfielder has been the talk of football this Easter weekend after his incredible 66-yard goal against Chelsea. Adam's sweetly struck left-footed strike gave goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois absolutely no chance. Scroll down to watch video of Charlie Adam scoring from the halfway line in 2009 .

Adam knocks the ball out in front of him before spotting the goalkeeper of his line and shooting . The Stanley keeper tries desperately to stop the ball as it sails towards the goal .

And that is not the first time the Scot has had a goalkeeper frantically back-pedalling before picking the ball out of his own net. Back in 2009, Adam scored a similar effort for Blackpool reserves against Accrington Stanley. He was in the opposition half this time though was out wide before hitting an effort that draws similarities with David Beckham's famous goal against Wimbledon in 1996. The stage, it has to be said, was far smaller too, though it's easy to see why Adam backed himself at Stamford Bridge on this evidence.","Charlie Adam scored brilliant long range goal against Chelsea on Saturday .

"Charlie Adam stunned the Premier League with a goal from his own half in Stoke's clash with Chelsea on Saturday evening. Here is a look back at some of the finest examples of the genre. Charlie Adam struck a stunning goal from inside his own half against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . Thibaut Courtois was left helpless also his Chelsea side eventually went on to win 2-1 . DAVID BECKHAM . The midfielder would go on to be a world-renowned, generational talent - but was only an emerging figure when, on the first day of the 1996-97 season, he spotted Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan off his line and arced the ball perfectly over him and into the net to round off a 3-0 win. David Beckham struck from inside his own half for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996 . Beckham celebrated the final goal in 3-0 win for United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season . JONE SAMUELSEN . An even greater rarity - a headed goal from a player in his own half. Samuelsen's Odd Grenland side were leading 2-1, Tromso's goalkeeper Andre Hansen was up for a corner and the ball was cleared towards Odd's centre forward. Defender Steffen Hagen nodded the ball away from him and just back across the halfway line, where Samuelsen met it with a powerful header which carried at least 30 yards and bounced into the unguarded net. Local police measured the goal at 58.13 metres, earning Samuelsen a spot in the Guinness Book of Records for the longest headed goal. XABI ALONSO . The Spanish midfielder actually achieved the feat twice in 2006 while with Liverpool - and once with each foot, for good measure. The left-footed effort was into an empty net, with Luton keeper Marlon Beresford up for a corner in injury time of an FA Cup tie the Reds won 5-3, but he then launched a flat lob over Newcastle keeper Steve Harper from the edge of the centre circle inside his own half in the Premier League. Xabi Alonso celebrates scoring from his own half for Liverpool against Newcastle in 2006 . Steve Harper was helplessly beaten in the Newcastle goal by the Spanish midfielder's superb effort . STEFAN ISHIZAKI . The Elfsborg forward was out on the right sideline, a couple of yards inside his own half, when Orebro keeper Tomer Chencinski's clearance dropped to him. Ishizaki simply swung a first-time right foot volley at the ball, which bounced once in the middle of the penalty area before finding the top corner perfectly. MAYNOR FIGUEROA . The then-Wigan defender displayed great quick thinking against Stoke in 2009 when his side were awarded a free-kick near the halfway line. Robert Huth fouled Scott Sinclair and, with most of the players napping, Figueroa ran straight on to the stationary ball to blaze a shot over Thomas Sorensen and in. Wigan Athletic's Maynor Figueroa (second left) struck from behind halfway against Stoke in 2009 . MORITZ STOPPELKAMP . Again, the Hannover goalkeeper was up for a free-kick, but that should not detract from Paderborn midfielder Stoppelkamp's achievement as the ball was cleared to him on the edge of his own penalty area and he simply controlled it on his chest, turned and volleyed the ball into the net from a scarcely believable 83 yards to make it 2-0. Moritz Stoppelkamp of Paderborn (centre) celebrates his stunning goal against Hanover in September 2014 . CHARLIE ADAM . The Stoke man has previous for this kind of behaviour, having showcased the skill during two loan spells from Rangers earlier in his career. An effort for Blackpool's reserves was just inside the Accrington half, but one for Ross County against St Mirren in 2007 was just about on the line - close enough to give him the benefit of the doubt, in any case.

"Charlie Adam looked up, noticed Thibaut Courtois was off his line, and thought: ‘Why not?’ Why not, indeed. The Stoke City midfielder was 66 yards from goal but had the audacity to score what will surely be crowned the Barclays Premier League’s strike of the season. David Beckham did it against Wimbledon in August 1996, as did Wayne Rooney against West Ham last March. There was Xabi Alonso in 2006 and Maynor Figueroa three years later, too. Charlie Adam (centre) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois watches on as he is unable to stop Adam's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1-1 . Yet this was different. It was not a hit and hope. It was not a lob. This was a direct shot from deep inside Adam’s own half which fooled one of the world’s greatest goalkeepers — and Adam meant it. Sportmail’s Jamie Redknapp agreed. ‘This is better than Beckham, more audacious than Rooney’s last season, This is one of the best strikes we’ve ever seen. It’s an absolutely incredible piece of play by Charlie Adam. ‘You categorise goals as great individual efforts or team goals, but that was a piece of genius. To even try it is brilliant.’ Even by the standards those at Stamford Bridge are used to seeing week in, week out, this was special. Particularly because it came from an unexpected source, from a ‘bloke who looks like a bus driver’, as former English cricket captain Freddie Flintoff colourfully put it. Nineteen years ago, when Beckham introduced himself to the world with his goal from the halfway line, he did so wearing the wrong footwear. The Manchester United great beat Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan wearing custom-made boots embroidered with ‘Charlie’ on the tongue — adidas sending Beckham a pair which were actually intended for Rangers attacking midfielder Charlie Miller. Adam (second left) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game . David Beckham struck from inside his own half for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996 . Beckham celebrated the final goal in 3-0 win for United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season . Chelsea became the second team to score 100 penalties in the Premier League. Liverpool were the first and have now scored 102. Miller never got his boots as they were retired, turned into a museum piece, having helped Beckham towards his first of 115 England caps less than three weeks later against Moldova. From one Scottish Charlie to another, Adam plans to frame his boots and shirt from Stamford Bridge, but this goal is unlikely to be the making of the former Rangers, Blackpool and Liverpool midfielder as it was for Beckham. Yet in the four seconds it took for the ball to go from boot to net, Adam disproved the theory that sequels are never better than the original. ‘The manager kept saying to me, “come in the middle of the pitch”, to try to get on the ball,’ Adam said. ‘I’m not a winger, I’m not a wide left midfielder, I don’t have the pace to go in behind so I’ve seen an opening, I’ve seen the goalie off his line and I thought, “why not do it at a place like Chelsea?” 'I’ve seen the goalie back-pedalling and I was praying it would go in. I’ll remember it for the rest of my career.’ From Spain’s Marca to Italy’s La Gazzetta dello Sport, the goal has been admired worldwide. One man who does not want to see it again, however, is Jose Mourinho. It left a black mark against a win which moved them seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, yet even the Chelsea manager can admire a wonder-goal when one comes along, as much as it hurts to admit it. Even Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had to admit that Adam's goal was a strike of the highest quality . Adam (right) celebrates with his Stoke City team-mates after scoring at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . ‘It was a fantastic goal, every player in the world would like to score a goal like that,’ Mourinho said. ‘Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi to all these brilliant players. Not all of them did score that goal in their careers.’ Maradona, Messi, and Adam. Unlike the Argentinian greats, he is known more for his heavy tackling, as Gareth Bale found out when he suffered ankle ligament damage in May 2011. Yet this was straight from the Pele playbook. Stoke had not managed a single shot on target with half-time minutes away and there seemed no danger as Adam picked up the ball 10 yards inside his own half. Courtois mistakenly thought the same. Yet this is nothing new from Adam. He did it for Blackpool reserves previously, and Ross County, too. Asked if it is something he thinks about using regularly during a game, Adam said: ‘Every time.’ Midway through this interview, Chelsea striker Didier Drogba interrupts. ‘Why?’ he asks Adam in mock indignation. ‘Tell me why?’ To which Adam replies: ‘I watch your videos.’ Indeed there are compilations of goals just as outrageous on YouTube and, on Saturday, Adam rightly earned his place in history among them.","Charlie Adam scored remarkable goal in defeat to league leaders .

"Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will persist with struggling midfield trio Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar as he refuses to shuffle his squad so late in the season. Mourinho had to answer questions about his three midfielders after the hard-fought 2-1 home win over Stoke. Asked whether Oscar is struggling, as he was substituted at half-time, Mourinho said: ‘No, I don’t think he had a bad performance, I just think he was not good enough, which is a huge difference. Oscar tries a flick that doesn't come off during a disappointing display against Stoke on Saturday . Jose Mourinho insists he will stick by his players despite the three midfielders' decline in form recently . Cesc Fabregas runs with the ball, but the assists have dried up for the Spanish international in recent weeks . ‘For me football is not just mathematics. When some people write that Fabregas drops his level because the number of assists are not the same, the number of assists are probably not the same because the player that he assists does not score.’ ‘Matic, he was suspended, and after the suspension he was injured celebrating in the final, so he went back and he was not in the best condition. ‘I always think stability is very important in a team, and it’s not in April that you are going to make important changes.’ Eden Hazard was Chelsea's best player, scoring a penalty before Charlie Adam stunned the hosts with an equaliser from his own half. Loic Remy sealed the points, after Hazard laid the chance on a plate for him, and kept the Blues in command at the top of the table. Oscar was withdrawn at half time but his manager insisted he was not struggling and will bounce back . Nemanja Matic holds off a tackle in midfield, but even the defensive midfielder has been short of his best .","Cesc Fabregas has not been at his best since turn of the year .

"Manchester United have been bolstered by the news that Robin van Persie has declared himself fit ahead of Sunday's derby against Manchester City. Van Persie has missed Manchester United's last six games following an ankle injury he suffered in their 2-1 defeat at Swansea on February 21. In his absence the Red Devils have won all five of their subsequent Premier League matches, with their only blip coming in a FA Cup sixth round exit at home to Arsenal last month. Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for the Manchester derby after missing United's last six games . The 31-year-old arrived for United training on Friday ahead of Sunday's home clash at Old Trafford . Prior to his injury, Van Persie (left) was a regular in United boss Louis van Gaal's starting line-up . In his absence though United have won their last five league matches, climbing up to third in the table . With the return of the 31-year-old it poses the question of where he will fit in Louis van Gaal's now settled 4-3-3 formation and how does he fare against fellow forwards Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson. Based on his goalscoring stats in the Premier League this season, Van Persie has provided an attacking threat once more for the Old Trafford outfit. The Holland international has scored 10 goals in 24 appearances and 1,993 minutes of top flight football so far. Only Rooney has fared better - netting 12 times in 27 games and 2,383 minutes of action. In comparison Falcao's stats make for a poor reading of four goals in 20 games and 1,032 minutes with young forward Wilson's strike against QPR in January his only one to date this season in 12 matches and 331 minutes of football. Van Persie (third left) has scored 10 goals in 24 league appearances and 1,993 minutes so far this season . Wayne Rooney (centre) scored a stunning half-volley as United beat Aston Villa 3-1 on March 4 . That strike (left) moved the United captain to two goals clear of Van Persie . In addition Van Persie's overall attacking contribution won't have been overlooked by Van Gaal - a man who pays attention to the smallest of details. Van Persie's stats are also favourable in comparison to his fellow strikers in terms of creating chances for others. While he sits sits behind Rooney and Falcao (both four) in terms of assists with two, United's No 20 has provided the second most amount of chances among Van Gaal's forwards with 24. Only Rooney has more with 40, while Falcao has 14 and Wilson providing just the one opportunity. Despite his favourable personal stats though, as a team United have performed better without Van Persie. In his 24 matches played this season, the Red Devils have only won 50 per cent of those - with eight draws and four defeats. Radamel Falcao has scored four goals in 20 games and 1,032 minutes of action for the club this season . James Wilson (right) only goal for the Red Devils this campaign came in a 2-0 win at QPR in January . Furthermore United have only averaged 1.8 points per game with the side scoring 1.7 goals per match and conceding one. In contrast, Van Gaal's side have been triumphant in six of their seven matches without Van Persie with an improved win percentage at 85.70. In his absence to United have averaged 2.6 points per game, scoring two goals and conceding 0.6 per match. Van Gaal has been reluctant to change the starting XI that has fashioned wins against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa in their last three matches - meaning club record signing Angel Di Maria has been forced to sit on the bench. On current form, the phrase 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it,' is an applicable one to the Red Devils' starting XI as they look to cement a top four finish. For Van Persie, that looks likes playing second fiddle to Rooney as the club's lone striker for now.

"Luis Suarez is quickly establishing himself in Barcelona folklore after impressing since his £75million move from Liverpool and the striker has revealed that years prior, he found himself sneaking into the Nou Camp. Speaking to Spanish radio station COPE, the forward spoke candidly about Real Madrid's interest in signing him and opened up about the infamous bite on Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. Suarez revealed that during a visit to his future club, he sneaked into the Nou Camp with his wife Sofia for a photo opportunity. Luis Suarez (9) has revealed that he once sneaked his way into the Nou Camp for a photograph . He said: 'It was not the first time that I came to Barcelona, it was the second. I went past the official store and saw it, but I did not go in because I didn't have money to buy anything. 'I was already going with Sofía and I remember that I saw an open door and I told her: 'Let's go'. 'You're crazy'. 'Come, just one photo'. 'No, no'. 'Yes, yes, yes. I'm going to go in'. I went in through the door that was open, she followed me and we started to run. 'We stood on the stairs and took a photo with all of the stadium behind us. I still haven't found the photo. Then we ran, and we were nervous. It was the only time that I had entered. My father-in-law managed to enter another time to see Argentina-Catalunya, on December 27.' The Uruguayan lit up the 'El Clasico' last month, where he scored the winner to send his side top of La Liga but he could have been playing for the opposition, if he'd not decided to move to Catalonia. The Uruguayan has been in fine form for Barcelona following his move and is becoming a fan's favourite . The forward admitted that Real Madrid were 'very' interested in signing him but he only wanted Barca . Talk of a move to the Spanish capital had been rife during his years at Liverpool but Suarez revealed that there was only one club which caught his eye. He said: 'Madrid were very interested in me, but my dream was always Barcelona. When I heard the name of Barca, I did not hesitate at any moment.' Arguably Suarez's most famous, yet controversial moment, when he bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and being banned for four-months. 'The bite on Chiellini was the worst moment of my career,' he said. 'I let myself down, my country, my wife and my children. The bites were partly my fault and partly [due to] the provocation of Ivanovic and Chiellini. Now they continue provoking me, but now I go or speak well. I am more intelligent.' Suarez admits that the bite was the worst moment of his career as he received a four-month playing ban .

"Mario Balotelli hit back at those criticising his absence for Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final win over Blackburn Rovers due to illness by attempting to prove he had a high temperature. Robbie Savage branded Balotelli 'pathetic' for missing the game, four days after he withdrew himself from the Liverpool squad  for their trip to Arsenal following a 'slight knock' suffered in training. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers revealed the £16million striker travelled with the squad to Blackburn, but that he felt too ill to take part after staying over in the hotel with his team-mates. Mario Balotelli responded to Robbie Savage's labelling of the Liverpool striker as 'pathetic' Balotelli was not included in the Liverpool squad to face Arsenal or Blackburn Rovers this week . Brendan Rodgers revealed Balotelli withdrew himself from the squad on Saturday and fell ill on Wednesday . Liverpool scraped through to a Wembley date with Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals thanks to Philippe Coutinho's strike. With 20 minutes remaining at Ewood Park, the Brazilian fired the ball across goal and past Rovers keeper Simon Eastwood. Click here to read Ian Ladyman's report . BT Sport pundit and former Blackburn midfielder Savage said: 'Pathetic isn't it? You're going to miss an FA Cup quarter-final? 'I don't know how unwell he is, but to miss an FA Cup quarter-final when you're feeling a bit ill? Nonsense. I would have to be really, really ill to miss that game.' Balotelli responded by posting a photograph of himself on Instagram, holding a thermometer reading 38.7 Celsius — 1.7C above 'normal' body temperature. Philippe Coutinho fires home the winner to send Liverpool into the FA Cup semi-final against Reading . Coutinho celebrates with his team-mates as Liverpool keep their dreams of winning a trophy alive . Mario Balotelli reported a temperature of 38.7C (101.66F) which is indeed above the normal body temperature of 37C (99.5F). The Liverpool striker may also have felt hot, sweaty, thirsty, very uncomfortable and slightly hungry. He may also have felt tired. Should body temperature reach 40C (104F), the person will be dehydrated and may suffer from vomiting and dizziness. With the snap, Balotelli wrote: 'Nothing stop me to watch my team winning. At least this time you know the real reason I am out. Miss the pitch so much #unluckyseason #YNWA #illbeback [sic].' Rodgers planned to use Balotelli for the FA Cup tie, but  admitted it was at the final moment his misfiring striker became unavailable. 'Mario travelled with us. He trained well, [but] fell ill last night,' Rodgers said ahead of the match which ended 1-0 to Liverpool. 'He stayed overnight with us in the hotel, [but] woke up still not feeling great. The doctors' advice was to send him back.' Balotelli's absence follows the Italian missing last Saturday's 4-1 defeat by Arsenal. The striker did not travel to the Emirates for the crunch clash after sustaining a hamstring injury in training on Friday. Rodgers said at the time: 'He trained on Friday afternoon with the team and he took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed himself not able to travel. 'I'm not a medic. He felt it was too sore to travel. The medical staff have looked at it. It was just something that he himself didn't feel comfortable enough to travel.' But Balotelli was reportedly later spotted with a group of friends at a private table at Manchester nightclub One Central Street. BT Sport pundit Savage feels it shows Balotelli's lack of determination to be absent for the FA Cup tie .","Mario Balotelli missed Liverpool's 4-1 defeat against Arsenal on Saturday .

"The thermometer reading Mario Balotelli shared on social media to prove he was too ill to play against Blackburn on Wednesday night will make no difference to Brendan Rodgers. Liverpool’s manager had already gone cold on the Italian, concluding some time ago that he has no future at Anfield. Rodgers will admit he ignored the warnings about Balotelli. He knew Jose Mourinho considered him ‘unmanageable’ and he listened to the anecdotal evidence he received from the members of his staff who had encountered the troublesome striker during their time at Manchester City. But Rodgers rather hoped Balotelli might be maturing with age, and he made the mistake of thinking he could succeed where others had failed in actually getting through to him. Mario Balotelli has no future at Liverpool after manager Brendan Rodgers lost patience with the striker . Rodgers will admit he ignored the warning signs but had hoped Balotelli was maturing as he got older . Balotelli shared an image of a thermometer reading to prove he was too ill to play against Blackburn . Liverpool’s manager was desperate too, of course. Attempts to recruit other strikers, in particular Alexis Sanchez, had proved unsuccessful last summer and he was concerned that Rickie Lambert would not provide ample cover in a Champions League season if Daniel Sturridge suffered further injury problems. He was right to worry about Sturridge’s physical fragility but wrong, he would probably now concede, to spend £16million on Balotelli. For three hours in his office at Melwood he attempted to lessen the risk before asking his employers to part with the money. He spoke both to Balotelli and his agent, explaining what was expected of every Liverpool player and sharing his philosophy on the power of the collective. Over the years his C.O.R.E principles speech – Commitment. Ownership. Responsibilities. Excellence – had worked with players. He would use a flip-chart to deliver his lecture on the standards he demands and, for the most part, players had responded accordingly. But not Balotelli. Not the player who already had a reputation for having no respect for authority, for his considerable talent or for the clubs he represents. Liverpool missed out on Alexis Sanchez last summer and instead paid £16m to sign Balotelli from AC Milan . Balotelli has endured a torrid time at Anfield and has managed to score just once in the Premier League . Rodgers is saddened by the fact Italy international Balotelli appears to have no respect for Liverpool . Crystal Palace (A) Lost 3-1, November 23, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries . Ludogorets (A) Drew 2-2, November 26, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries . Stoke (H) Won 1-0, November 29, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries .

Basle (H) Drew 1-1, December 9, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries . Bournemouth (A) Won 3-1, December 17, 2014 Reason: Groin injury . Arsenal (H) Drew 2-2, December 21, 2014 Reason: One-match ban . Leicester (H) Drew 2-2, January 1, 2015 Reason: Not selected . Aston Villa (A) Won 2-0, January 17, 2015 Reason: Illness . Chelsea (H) Drew 1-1, Januray 20, 2015 Reason: Illness . Bolton (H) Drew 0-0, January 24, 2015 Reason: Not selected . West Ham (H) Won 2-0, January 31, 2015 Reason: Not selected .

Arsenal (A) Lost 4-1, April 4, 2015 Reason: Knee injury . Blackburn (A) Won 1-0, April 8, 2015 Reason: Illness . Rodgers is saddened by the fact that Balotelli appears to have no respect for Liverpool, and no apparent willingness to even follow the simplest instructions. In Sturridge’s absence Rodgers told Balotelli he needed a striker who would ‘press’ at the point of Liverpool’s attack; who would play high up the field and in so doing set the pattern of Liverpool’s play. Balotelli, much to his manager’s frustration, just wouldn’t do it, in the misguided belief that he knew better. On the training field there have been similar issues; a situation that has offended team-mates who do buy into Rodgers’ methods and want to build on the success they enjoyed last season. So there will be no second chance for Balotelli at Liverpool next season; no opportunity to redeem himself. Rodgers is continuing to use him when absolutely necessary but he is at the very top of a list of players he will be putting up for sale this summer. He has to get him out and put what money he can recover for him to better use, if only to improve morale in a dressing room that probably lost patience with the guy before even he did. Liverpool players are offended Balotelli has not followed simple instructions from his manager this season .","Mario Balotelli missed Liverpool's clash at Blackburn due to illness .

"Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva is relishing the prospect of a long-awaited Wembley appearance after injury robbed him of the chance three years ago. The Reds made three trips to the national stadium in 2012 after winning the League Cup and losing the FA Cup to Chelsea, but the Brazil international missed all of them with a serious knee injury sustained in the previous November. But having played his part in the 1-0 quarter-final win at Blackburn, Lucas is hoping to get his chance in the last-four encounter with Aston Villa on April 19. Lucas Leiva (right) celebrates with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after getting to the FA Cup semi-final . Lucas (left) challenges Markus Olsson as Liverpool beat Blackburn 1-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final replay . Lucas can play his first game at Wembley in a Liverpool shirt when they meet Aston Villa in the semi-final . 'Unfortunately I got an injury before we got to Wembley so I missed [the chance to play there],' he said. 'Hopefully I'll be fit and be able to play at Wembley. I've never played there, so it will be a very good experience and after many years here, to have that chance is amazing. 'I think everyone could see how hard we worked. We knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions, but I think we did well and we are so happy to get to Wembley and hopefully get to the final.' Victory over Blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain Steven Gerrard, who departs for Los Angeles Galaxy, the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final. However, the midfielder was suspended for the tie at Ewood Park and it was Lucas's compatriot Philippe Coutinho who made the difference with a 70th-minute strike, having scored a brilliant last-minute winner in a fourth-round replay at Bolton. Coutinho has arguably been Liverpool's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury. 'I have known him for a very long time and I know what he's capable of doing,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'He's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience, but he's already right there with the top players.' Another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against Rovers and even stopped opposite number Simon Eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the Rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time. The Belgium international has overcome his early-season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of Liverpool's defensive frailties. He admits victory over Blackburn was important after back-to-back Premier League defeats put a huge dent in their Champions League aspirations. 'After the result against Arsenal there wasn't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on Wednesday,' Mignolet said. 'So we had to recover well, put the focus to Blackburn and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do. 'I think the lads and the team responded really well, did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do, and we managed to get the result we wanted. 'We needed to bounce back after two disappointing results against Manchester United and Arsenal and we did that. 'We gave something back to the fans, who have got something to look forward to now as well with a trip to Wembley.

"There looked to be so much bend on Leo Messi’s shot on the half hour at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night that if there had been no net to stop the ball it would kept on curling until it ended up back at the great man’s feet. The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted.

The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike . Barcelona talisman Messi wheels away after opening the scoring  at the Nou Camp during a 4-0 victory over Almeria . Suarez followed Messi's lead by scoring a similar left-footed strike to double the Catalans lead with the first of his two goals . Barcelona defender Marc Bartra stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes . Barcelona (4-3-3): Bravo; Alves, Bartra, Mascherano, Adriano; Sergi Roberto, Xavi, Rakitic; Messi, Suarez, Pedro. Subs: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Rafinha, Neymar . Booked: Mascherano . Scorer: Messi 33', Suarez 55', Bartra 75', Suarez 90' Almeria (4-2-3-1): Julian; Ximo Navarro, Marin, Trujillo, Casado; Partey, Corona; Wellington Silva (Soriano), Espinosa (Mane), Edgar (Zongo); Bifouma. Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta’s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes.

Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury. If they don’t do you with the magic of Messi and Suarez then they do you from a dead ball. Almeria had succumbed to all three threats.

"Dani Alves posted a picture of himself with his trousers down on his Instagram account on Thursday. With one message coming out of the player’s camp and a very different one emerging from the Nou Camp it’s difficult to know who feels they have been left exposed by who. We take a look at the contract wrangle and ask: could he really end up at Manchester United? Dani Alves, out of contract at the end of the campaign, is pictured training for Barcelona on Friday . His contract runs out on June 30 why has it come to this? Barcelona had never planned to keep Alves beyond this season. He’s served them brilliantly but he will be 32 next month and on  £85,000-a-week he is one of their top earning defenders along with Gerard Pique. What they were not counting on is their own incompetence in finding a replacement for him and the FIFA transfer ban that stops them buying anyone this summer. So now they want him to stay? They do, but very much on their terms. The club are letting it be known they have offered him a two-year deal with an option of a third year depending on the number of games played in the second year. Alves’ camp say it’s actually a one-year deal to be renewed for a second year, and then a third year, only if he plays a certain number of matches. The new contract also comes with incentives. If he wins things then he will end up earning the same money but his basic earnings before bonuses would drop. Barcelona defender Alves has been sounded out by Manchester United over a move to Old Trafford . And there are other clubs who will gladly take him? After weeks of rumours that the suitors were queuing around the Nou Camp to sign him up it now seems that one big club has offered him a three-year deal with none of the strings, sub-clauses and trap-doors as the Barca deal. And that club is Manchester United? United are the prime suspects with PSG out of the running. But Alves' camp say now is not the time to name the club. You sound doubtful… . Only in as much as if Manchester United had really offered him a three-year deal would he still be haggling with Barcelona? Surely a Premier League swansong at Old Trafford is the perfect way to round off what has been a remarkable career with the Spanish giants – winning four leagues, three cups and two Champions League titles. Perhaps he just really wants to stay in Barcelona? The children he has with ex-wife Dinorah Santa Ana (who is now his agent) live in the city and after 13 years in Spain he is reluctant to leave. He is hoping Barcelona, desperate because they can't sign players, make him a better offer. Dinorah Santa Ana, Alves ex-wife and now his agent, addressed the media earlier this week . But if he does end up at United will he be a success? It’s easy to look at the gold shoes, the denim waistcoats and the polka dot ties and just see an eccentric extrovert who plays football in his part-time. That does a tremendous injustice to easily the most gifted and successful right-back of his generation. He remains super-fit and if there is slightly less energy to get up and down the pitch as there once was perhaps that wouldn’t be a bad thing – Louis van Gaal is hardly going to want him flying forward Barcelona style at every possibility. He remains very watchable and has a tenacity and speed of recovery that means he never has been the defensive liability some have depicted. The Brazil international is hopeful Barcelona make him an improved offer so he can stay at the Nou Camp . You make it sound as though Barcelona would be foolish to let him leave... In view of the fact that if they allow him to walk away they will end up having to play Douglas at right back then that may well be the case. The strange summer signing from Sao Paolo who cost £4m and has started one game looks completely out of his depth. Put it this way – the manager Luis Enrique wants Alves to stay.","Dani Alves is out of contract at Barcelona at the end of the season .

"Amir Khan believes Kell Brook has called him out so that he can have the 'one big payday' which has so far eluded him during his 10-and-a-half year career. Brook, who defeated Jo Jo Dan to retain his IBF welterweight title last month, immediately challenged Khan in a post-fight interview but the Bolton-born boxer has instead agreed a bout on May 30, with his opponent yet to be confirmed. Khan has reiterated his intention to take on Brook within the next 12 months, although he insists that the undefeated 28-year-old only wants the fight because of the money it will earn him. Amir Khan (left), pictured during his last fight against Devon Alexander, has blasted Kell Brook's motives . Brook (right) shakes hands with British Superbike champion Shane Byrne at Donington Park on Tuesday . In an interview with iFL TV, Khan said: 'He's only faced one decent opponent in his whole career, so he has no room to talk. It seems to me that he's just calling me out for that one big payday. 'If he keeps going on like this, that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day, he's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that I can't fight then because of Ramadan. 'And he's putting down my opponents, who are still better opponents than his opponents, like Jo Jo Dan, who should be called No No Dan, to be honest with you, because end of day, he's not done anything in his career.' Khan had announced a fight with Chris Algieri next month but he has now backtracked on that, claiming that there are 'some more options on the table'. Khan has now denied that he will face Chris Algieri next month, claiming there are 'some more options' Chris Algieri lost every round to Manny Pacquiao when he took on the Filipino star last November . Brook is desperate to fight Khan but his fellow Brit rejected the chance to face him at Wembley in June . A £5million clash with Brook at Wembley on June 13 was also an option but Khan rejected the offer as he will not fight during Ramadan because of his Islamic faith. He added: 'Like I said, this Algieri fight, if it happens, it's making me a lot of money; money that Kell Brook's not seen. That's why he's probably dying. Amir's making millions when he's not even seen his first million. 'There's classes in boxing. There's fighters in boxing who are the A-class fighters, the likes of Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather, who talk about and mention and say they know who Amir Khan is. 'When it comes to Kell Brook, who knows Kell Brook in America? Which fighter, apart from Shawn Porter, knows Kell Brook? Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao don't know who Kell Brook is, so I don't know what he's going on about trying to say he's a big name. 'Kell Brook's going on like he's the next guy to fight Mayweather when he's not even a big ticket seller. He might be big in his own backyard in Sheffield, but other than Sheffield, no-one knows him. Brook is hoping to fight Khan within the next 12 months as he looks to extend his unbeaten streak . Khan claims that Brook is not even a big name in the UK and is not able to face the world's biggest names . 'The way he's tried to come across to the US public is like he's a super-big name in the UK. He's not a big name in the UK.' And Khan insists that he is not avoiding Brook, even though the fight will be of greater benefit to the Sheffield-born star. 'Look, do I need the fight against Kell Brook?,' said Khan. 'I make a lot of money regardless if I fight Kell Brook. 'I will make a lot of money in this sport and I've made a lot of money in this sport of boxing. Kell Brook needs me to make that big money. 'Without me, he'll never make that big money unless he goes out and fights the top guys like Pacquiao, Mayweather, and Marquez, but I can't see him fighting those guys because he's always scared to get beat by them and lose his title.'","Amir Khan has rejected a £5million fight with Kell Brook in June .

"John Carver admits Newcastle United need to look at the 'DNA' of their dressing-room this summer. The Magpies were beaten for the fifth successive time in Tyne-Wear derbies during Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Sunderland. Head coach Carver says the club's hierarchy have already spoken about addressing their shortcomings during the close-season, and concedes that character is one issue they have to consider.

'We've had different managers but the same group of players (keep getting beat). There aren't many Ws (wins) next to their names. 'It's something we need to look at. We struggle when we have to compete. We have talked about addressing that in the summer. 'We are going to invest in the summer so there will be new players around to take us forward.'

Newcastle players look dejected following Sunday's 1-0 defeat to rivals Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . And he added: 'A lot of people in the dressing-room know they didn't perform and didn't do themselves justice. 'I brought them in on Monday when they were meant to be off, I wasn't accepting that. 'Monday was one of my darkest days. It just was not good enough. 'You can do all your preparation you want but it doesn't matter if you don't perform on a Saturday. I don't want training-ground players.' Carver admits he was embarrassed by the performance against Sunderland as Newcastle failed to show . United are nine points clear of the relegation zone and travel to Liverpool on Monday. Carver, though, is taking nothing for granted with regards survival. 'There is only nine points in it,' he said. 'That could be six points if we get nothing at Liverpool. We need points. I'm not interested in how we play, we just need points. 'We have a seven-game season now. These next seven games could define the players. There are a few in there who are out of contract.'","Newcastle lost 1-0 to rivals Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Sunday .

"Sevilla coach Unai Emery is one of the more eccentric characters in La Liga but the Andalusian club's success this season suggests there is plenty of method in the Basque-born 43-year-old's apparent madness. Prowling the touchline during games, Emery's frantic arm gestures, wild eyes and bellowed commands clearly inspire his players rather than distract them. Sevilla are fifth in La Liga ahead of the visit of leaders Barcelona on Saturday. Sevilla coach Unai Emery has guided the club to fifth in the La Liga table ahead of the visit of Barcelona . Emery is one of the most animated coaches in La Liga and is often seen gesturing on the touchline . 'Since he arrived there has been a clear upwards trend,' midfielder Vicente Iborra said of Emery, who joined Sevilla in January 2013, on the club's radio station on Wednesday. 'Those who know him know that he lives for football and for his club, with all the responsibility that brings. 'And the important thing is that it rubs off on us. Having a coach and training staff like that is to be valued, it's not easy and we have to, and will, make the most of it.' Jose Antonio Reyes (centre) is congratulated after scoring the winner in Monday's victory over Levante . Emery roars with delight as his Sevilla side claimed a 2-1 victory at the Ciutat de Valencia Stadium . After a run of five straight victories they are well placed to secure at least a berth in the Europa League, the competition they won last season and are still alive in this term. They may even pip Atletico Madrid and Valencia to a Champions League berth. Barca lead on 74 points with eight games left, with Real Madrid, who play at Eibar on Saturday, second on 70 and Atletico, who are away at Malaga, third on 65. Valencia and Sevilla each have 61 points in fourth and fifth, although Valencia have played one game fewer and have an away match at Athletic Bilbao later on Thursday before hosting city rivals Levante on Monday. Emery took over at Sevilla in  2013 and has overseen a 'clear upwards trend', according to Vicente Iborra . Barcelona, pictured celebrating during the 4-0 win over Almeria, travel to Sevilla on Saturday . Barca, Real and Atletico all play on Saturday as they are in Champions League action next week. Barca play their quarter-final, first leg at Paris St Germain on Wednesday and Atletico host Real in a repeat of last season's final the previous day. Sevilla play their Europa League quarter-final, first leg at home to Zenit St Petersburg on Thursday. At the other end of the La Liga table, Almeria host Granada in an all-Andalusian relegation battle on Saturday, before fellow strugglers Cordoba and Elche meet on Sunday. Cordoba avoided equalling the La Liga record for the most consecutive defeats of 11 thanks to Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Deportivo La Coruna but remain five points adrift of Granada at the bottom and appear doomed for the drop.","Unai Emery's Sevilla take on Barcelona in La Liga on Saturday .

"Fergal O'Brien is daring to dream what might be at Aintree on Saturday as he insists last year's fourth Alvarado is going into the race in better shape this time around. The 10-year-old gelding has run only once this season, finishing fifth at Doncaster in February. But Limerick-born O'Brien, 42, believes that is preferable a preferable situation to 12 months ago when Alvarado went into the race not having run since pulling up at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Fergal O'Brien says that Alvarado is in better shape going into this weekend's Grand National at Aintree . That is showing in his contender's demeanour of Paul Moloney's at home, O'Brien said. The trainer added: 'I think we are in a better position. He is very straightforward in that if he is eating well and you can get him in the field he is pretty well in himself. 'I actually think we are a bit further on than we were last year.' O'Brien spent 18 years working for trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies, 16 of them as Head Lad. During that time, he helped prepare two National winners in Earth Summit and Bindaree but, with duties back at base, last year was the first time he had ever been at Aintree on National day. Alvarado, pictured here at Cheltenham in 2013, has run only once this season back in February at Doncaster . O'Brien added: 'I said all along if Alvarado jumped the first couple of fences and enjoyed it he would run well. He has an awful lot of ability, although you don't always get it from him. He is not ungenuine but because he is quirky.'

"Rory McIlroy’s official coronation will come at Augusta National on Sunday if he wins the Masters to complete the career Grand Slam and consign the Tiger Woods era to the history books. The king is dead; long live the king. Long to reign over us. Or should that be rain over us? The heavy downpours that drenched Augusta on Tuesday would have been greeted by groans from soaked patrons and photographers hoping for snaps of glamourous WAGs. But Northern Ireland’s world No 1 would be forgiven if he had grinned from ear to ear. That’s because each of McIlroy’s four major victories so far has come on courses which have been subjected to heavy rain at some point during the week. Wet conditions hand McIlroy a massive advantage: his huge hitting with sky-high ball flight means he can still fly his ball miles. Shorter hitters or those with low ball flight, meanwhile, will have no roll on the wet fairways and will be hitting their approach shots from miles back. Rory McIlroy shields himself from the rain on Tuesday - but a wet course will play into his hands . Augusta National looks at its finest in the sun, but the world No 1 has won all of his four majors after rain . And that is no good at Augusta, where precise approaches are vital to the most strategically demanding greens in major championship golf. Last year’s trio of Fred Couples (66-1 for 20th), Miguel Angel Jimenez (150-1 for 4th) and Bernhard Langer (400-1 for 8th) will be tough to match that this time round, but here goes… . Patrick Reed (40-1) – Brash, proud of it and born to show off on the biggest stage. Only his second Masters but played Augusta National many times as a college student. Tiger Woods (45-1) – OK, so no-one knows which Woods will turn up, but this could be one of the all-time cheeky punts. Practice form and rededication to the game are promising signs. Paul Casey (70-1) – Back to near his best after finally getting fully fit and committing to play full time in the US. Fifth-best on the PGA Tour in par-five scoring – crucial at Augusta. Since the work done to ‘Tiger-proof’ the course in the noughties, the home of the year’s first major has become a bomber’s course. Bubba Watson, with two wins in three years, Adam Scott and Angel Cabrera are all big-hitting recent champions, but examine the list of leaderboards in recent years and you’ll find them dominated by players whose favourite club in the bag is driver. Mother Nature looks set to smile on McIlroy again this week with heavy rain forecast, particularly on Friday and Saturday. If that happens, the number of players who can win reduces dramatically. Three-time champion Phil Mickelson (28-1) and England’s former US Open winner Justin Rose (45-1) are tempting at their prices, but neither have hit their top form this year, so would be backed based on gut feeling rather than cold hard facts. The likes of Jordan Spieth (10-1), Zach Johnson (100-1), Ian Poulter (80-1) and Jamie Donaldson (125-1) have the brains and skill sets to get the job done. Woods (45-1) must be included in that group too, despite having no form, providing the chipping yips do not strike again. But they will all have to be at the very top of their games for the entire week to compete with the boom-boom brigade. Bubba Watson's power has taken him to two Masters victories, but his last title defence ended badly . Tiger Woods has the skill set to succeed for a fourth time at Augusta, but he must answer big questions . McIlroy (6-1) heads that pack, closely followed by Watson (11-1). Australia’s Jason Day (14-1) and Adam Scott (20-1), and Sweden’s Henrik Stenson (22-1) are joined by American gunslingers Dustin Johnson (16-1) and Jimmy Walker (22-1) as the big hitters who have shown best form so far this year. The Masters, played on the modern-day Augusta, is the one major of the year where a formula for a winner can be identified: long driving + strong early season form + course experience + the week of their lives = green jacket. Brooks Koepka (5-1) – it’s always tough to know how a player with no experience of Augusta will take to the place, but this monster-hitter looks to have the perfect game. The 24-year-old American globetrotter has won the Phoenix Open to the Turkish Airlines Open in the last six months. Scott, the 2011 champion, has made a late switch back to his long putter, which does not bode well. Stenson has been battling the flu, which either rules him out or makes him more dangerous, depending on whether you believe the old adage: ‘beware the wounded golfer’. But what makes Day, Johnson and Walker so appealing is that each has claimed at least one big win already this year on courses that favour big hitters. Day (Torrey Pines), Walker (Pebble Beach) and Johnson (Doral) have shown they possess the perfect mix of long driving, precise iron control and dead-eyed putting under the heat of competition. That is the perfect recipe for a Masters champion. Their only problem is that McIlroy has used it to taste success on four occasions in majors, and Watson two, while they are all still waiting to dine at the top table. Jason Day has a brilliant record at Augusta and the final step left for the Australian to take is victory . Dustin Johnson's colossal power means he has the weapon most needed to conquer Augusta . Jimmy Walker chips onto the second green during practice, and could be set for a big week . But the pressure is mounting on McIlroy as he bids for golfing immortality. Watson, meanwhile, could only finish 50th in defence of his title two years ago and could be rusty after a month off. And given he finished second on his Masters debut in 2011, third two years later and 10th 12 months ago despite battling a broken thumb, Sunday could be a perfect Day for Australia and the man who has long looked to be golf’s next major champion. Course: Augusta National Golf Club, par 72, 7435 yards. Defending champion: Bubba Watson (11-1) Bookies’ favourite: Rory McIlroy (6-1) Best Bets: .

McIlroy is desperate to win at Augusta this week and add the Masters, which is the only major he is yet to win, to his trophy collection and will get down to the serious business on Thursday. Victory at the Augusta National will mean a third major title in a row for the Northern Irishman, who shot a one-under-par round in the Par-3 Contest after winning The Open and the USPGA Championship at the back end of 2014. Woods, meanwhile, had declined to participate in the mini-tournament, which he has previously called 'distracting',since 2004. But Woods gave his fans a treat by joining in with the event for the first time in 11 years, with his daughter, Sam, 7, and his son, Charlie, 6, keeping him company. His playing partners were old pals Steve Stricker and Fred Couples. Sam Snead won the first Par 3 Contest in 1960, two years after the course was completed. A record five holes-in-one were made in the 2002 event, when Japan's Toshi Izawa made back-to-back aces on holes five and six. Players often invite their wives or children to caddie for them. Reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson, who was also a winner at Augusta in 2012, was joined by his wife Angie and son Caleb for the Par-3 Contest. Watson played with his American compatriot Rickie Fowler, who had girlfriend Alexis Randock as his caddy. But this is the competition nobody wants to win. Nobody has ever won the Wednesday warm-up and the Masters in the same week, leading many to remark on the 'curse' of the Par-3 Contest. Those who have recently discovered to their fate that these twin feats are seemingly unachievable include Padriag Harrington, winner of the Par 3 Contest in 2003 and 2004, former Open champion Louis Oosthuizen (2010) and former world No 1 Luke Donald, who claimed the prize in 2011 but remains majorless.

"Hibs, Hearts and Rangers united in condemnation of the SPFL's decision to move the Ibrox club's final game of the Championship season back 24 hours. In a move designed to accommodate broadcasters, Rangers will face champions Hearts at Tynecastle on May 3 — 24 hours after Hibs and promotion rivals Falkirk and Queen of the South play. Adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for Stuart McCall's side, Easter Road chief executive Leanne Dempster and Hearts chairwoman Ann Budge have lodged formal complaints with the league. In a staggering misjudgment of the public mood, however, the SPFL issued a statement expressing surprise at the fuss before Rangers boss McCall compounded their woe by revealing he also backed Hibs' stance. Hibernian are upset that Rangers' final game of the season has been pushed back for TV purposes . Ramping up the pressure on SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster, Hibs counterpart Leanne Dempster said: 'In previous seasons, the League has ensured that all of the final round fixtures are played at the same time. 'I have been in contact with the SPFL following its announcement that one final-round fixture would kick off after all the other results are known. 'I have reminded them in very clear terms that — as organisers of the competition — the responsibility for protecting its unimpeachable sporting integrity lies with them.' On a day when the relationship between broadcasters and Scottish football came under unprecedented scrutiny, Hearts majority shareholder Budge backed up her city rivals. In a statement, Budge also queried the 'sporting integrity' of Rangers playing 24 hours after their rivals given they are engaged in a dogfight with Hibs for second place. 'This has been done following selection of the game for a live TV broadcast,' she said. 'While we all knew that this was likely to be a strong candidate for televising and that the time might well change, we did not for one minute think that at this late stage, it would be moved to the Sunday, especially given our belief that all Championship games would require to be played at the same time. 'On learning of the change, I immediately attempted to contact the SPFL and objected in strong terms to the proposed late change to this fixture on the grounds of it having a total disregard for the interests of supporters of both clubs and an apparent disregard for sporting integrity. Rangers will play Hearts at Tynecastle in their final game of the season on May 3 . 'Being given 17 days' notice of this change is extremely disruptive and potentially very expensive for the fans, the sponsors and indeed the club. Overseas supporters have been in touch to advise that they will lose substantial amounts on travel; others have advised of lost earnings, holiday problems, etc. 'None of this is good for any of us and on behalf of the club, I can only apologise. 'When it also became apparent to us that our fixture was the only game to be moved, we were equally alarmed as rightly or wrongly, this casts a shadow over the sporting integrity of the Championship. 'While it may not be enshrined in the newly-merged rulebook of the SPFL, it is protocol the football world over for fixtures such as the last day of the Championship to be played simultaneously. 'To move only one, (or even two or four) out of 5 fixtures would seem to be leaving our game wide open to unsavoury accusations. 'I will be sending in a formal complaint to the SPFL in relation to this appallingly late decision. It is no wonder that clubs are finding it harder and harder to gain support from their fans when their interests can be so blatantly disregarded, especially at such short notice. 'I am advised that this complaint will likely have no impact on the original decision but nevertheless, I want our supporters to know that we have taken all and any action that we could have and I will further comment on the situation once we have been updated by the League.' Responding to the criticism, however, the SPFL rushed out a statement saying it was 'unreasonable' to expect all Championship games to kick off simultaneously. 'In response to recent criticisms of the Championship fixture scheduling for the weekend 2/3 May, we'd like to clarify some specific points. On this weekend, the Hearts v Rangers match is scheduled for Sunday 3 May to be broadcast on television and it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise. This is a key game in the Championship season and will inevitably attract huge interest from fans around the world. Hearts are already promoted from the Championship, but they too condemned the fixture change . 'It is unreasonable to expect all Championship fixtures that weekend to move to the Sunday when a number of them will be unaffected by the Hearts v Rangers tie. However, as a result of this fixture, all Championship clubs have been invited to submit a request should they wish to move games to the Sunday. 'To date, we have had no request from Hibernian FC to move its fixture to the Sunday at the time of writing (8.45pm, Wednesday 15 April). 'We also note speculation that Police Scotland expressed concern to the SPFL about the scheduling of the Hearts v Rangers match. However, Police Scotland confirmed to us that there were no security issues with the scheduling of all Championship fixtures that weekend. 'Whilst we regret any inconvenience to supporters caused by rescheduled fixtures, the circumstances surrounding the matches on the weekend of 2/3 May are in no way unusual.' After his side drew with Livingston last night, however, Ibrox manager McCall gave his view, saying: 'First and foremost, we've not asked for the game to be changed. Hibs are complaining about it and rightly so. I'd be doing exactly the same. I think every game on the last day of the season should be played at the same time. 'But we've told by the TV, I believe, that it may be the case that the other games are moved to the Sunday. I honestly don't know. It's nothing to do with us. We've not asked for that, but if I was in Hibs' position then, yes, I would be annoyed as well. Of course. 'I was happy to play on the Saturday. We've not tried to gain any advantage - we've been told when to play. TV controls a lot of things. If the game definitely has to go ahead on the Sunday then can we all then move to the Sunday. I'd be happy with that. I would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time. It would be only right.'","Rangers' final game of the season against Hearts pushed back 24 hours .

"Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta . McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club . At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy . McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round . To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club . Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.","One Direction star Niall Horan will caddie for Rory McIlroy on Wednesday .

"Tiger Woods was genial. Tiger Woods was charm personified. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world. You can grin your way through life as the 111th best golfer in the world. No pressure. No big whoop. Judging by some of the stuff said and written about Woods in the build-up to his 20th Masters, it will be an achievement if he makes the cut. Very respected names have close to begged him not to compete. Woods doesn’t see it like that at all. He’s in it to win it. And it’s in those little moments that the old Tiger — some would argue the real Tiger — breaks cover again. Tiger Woods was all smiles as he played a practice around ahead of his 20th appearance at the Masters . The former best player in the world arrives at Augusta ranked a lowly 111th in the game . Woods name appears on the Masters' tournament winner's board four times; 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005 . It was all smiles and wise-cracks as Woods sat before the assembled press on Tuesday. Questions that would once have been greeted with terse disregard were warmly expanded upon. Memory lane was tripped down, the elder statesman played. He even referred to some of the correspondents in the room as his friends. And then he was asked where a win this week, from one ranking place lower than Tomohiro Kondo of Japan, at a point in his career when it was wondered whether he would be seen on the golf course as a competing professional again, would rank in his career achievements. And up leapt old Tiger. He didn’t answer this one with a short, evocative speech or a ready quip. He shut it down, old school. One sentence, no messing, no prospect of elaboration. Woods has insisted that he would not enter a tournament unless he thought he had a chance of winning it . The 39-year-old looks towards the ground after hitting a shot during practice on Monday . Woods smiles as he talks with his traditional practice partner Mark O'Meara (left) at Augusta . ‘It would be my 15th major,’ said Woods. The temperature in the room dropped by several degrees. Brevity replaced levity. The questioner, gamely, tried again with a slight rephrase. ‘Long way to go before that,’ Woods replied. ‘Lot of work to do.’ He smiled. The chill passed. And, of course, that is exactly what it would be. Just his 15th major, if it signalled a true return to form. And on to the next one. World No 4 Jordan Spieth was in ninth grade — 14 years old — when Woods won his last major in 2008. But if he could win a fifth Masters he would be back in the game. And no more Mr Nice Guy, one feels. From 111th in the world, Woods has time to take the scenic route in conversation. Back to where he was, back to contending, he would be all business again. Not entirely like before, of course, because he could never go back to before — but not many of the guys who are genuinely fancied to be wearing the green jacket on Sunday night practised as Woods did, with partner and kids in tow. Woods gets a hug from his children,  Charlie and Sam, who will carry his bag for the par three tournament . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn leads the pair around the course to watch their father practice . Ski champion Vonn has a chat with tournament favourite Rory McIlroy during practice . As Woods putted, Lindsey Vonn, a world champion skier, clutched Charlie and Sam and chatted to a passing Rory McIlroy. The contrast was clear. McIlroy, whose easy manner and charisma require no effort, is not here to smell the azaleas. He is the world’s best golfer, on the brink of a third consecutive major in what would be a personal Grand Slam — only the sixth in the world to do it. He has a lot at stake. Woods is on bonus time. In January, he shot an 82, 11-over-par, at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, his worst round in close to 13 years. A week later, he walked off at Torrey Pines after 11 holes citing back problems. His partner that day, Chris DiMarco, thought it was more out of embarrassment. ‘He wasn’t doing anything good,’ he said. Woods then took an indefinite break from golf, with claims he had the chipping yips. On Monday he admitted being stuck between two release patterns, which amounts to the same thing. When he spoke of his journey to this point of return, it was clear he regards it as the second — maybe third, considering the events of 2009 — phase of his career. Woods shot the worst round of his professional career, an 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open . Woods speaks to the world's media after withdrawing from the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open . The 14 major winner stands at the tee as the Augusta course is mowed ahead of this year's tournament . ‘People would never understand how much work I put in to come back and do this again,’ he said. ‘I worked my ass off, that’s the easiest way to describe it. I worked hard. Sun up to sun down. When the kids were in school, I’d be doing it. When they went to sleep, still doing it. ‘The way I saw it, if I started when the sun came up I’d be a better player when it set. Getting better incrementally. It would come in flashes. It would come for 10 minutes and then I’d lose it for an hour. Then I’d get it back. Gradually, it flipped. I’d have it for an hour, lose it for 10 minutes. And then it was just there. There were some frustrating moments, but I had to stick with it. There were times when clubs flew, when a few suddenly slipped out of my hand — and travelled some good distances. ‘But we kept working, shot by shot, hour by hour. It was slow and steady, just taking little bits of progression. I had to hammer it out, make sure it was engrained. I just had to get through it.’ Woods smiles after winning his last major in a play-off with Rocco Mediate at the 2008 US Open . The all conquering American celebrates winning the Masters after sinking a play-off putt in 2005 . Nick Faldo slips the green jacket on Woods after he won his first major at the 1997 Masters . And now he’s through it. And America waits. For while nobody expects the player one better than Hennie Otto of South Africa to beat among the most competitive Masters fields in the modern era, that doesn’t mean there is not a desperate yearning for the impossible to happen. It doesn’t help that the man in Woods’s place is not Bubba Watson, or Rickie Fowler, or any of the other star spangled pretenders, but a 25-year-old from Belfast who plays for the wrong team when the Ryder Cup is on. America likes Rory, but it loves Tiger. His victories once caused a spike in Wall Street’s Monday morning figures, and golf’s television numbers have not recovered from his spell in recovery. So the positive lines in Woods’s Masters preparation are lapped up and thrown out as a potential feelgood hit of the summer. That’s why Woods is still, against all logic, asked about winning here. Why he plays the game, and talks about winning right back at them. ‘I prepare to win and expect to go and do that,’ he said. ‘I’ve come close in the last 10 years. Half of the tournaments since 2005 I had a chance on the back nine. I just didn’t get it done. For whatever reason, I didn’t seize the opportunity.’ The former champion has spoken of practicing his game from dawn until dusk to hone his swing . Woods latest comeback has sparked a tidal wave of interest from American supporters and beyond . The room seemed pleased with the answer. Woods was asked what, at 39, remained his greatest motivation. ‘Winning,’ deadpanned old Tiger, suddenly solemn. And then he smiled. ‘I like it,’ he said, before disappearing through a side door. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world and entirely at ease with that. For now.","Tiger Woods begins his 20th Masters ranked a lowly 111th in the world .

"Ben Flower has been urged to be 'a bit more aggressive' when the prop sensationally sent off in last year's grand final returns for Wigan in Thursday's Super League derby with Warrington. The 28-year-old Welsh international forward on Tuesday completed his six-month ban for twice punching Lance Hohaia in the opening moments of October's Grand-Final at Old Trafford. Flower stunned the 76,000 crowd with his attack on the St Helens half-back and, after becoming the first player to be sent off in a Grand Final, was handed the second heaviest suspension in the history of Super League. Ben Flower's sickening blow on St Helens' Lance Hohaia in the Super League final that got him a six-month ban . Flower, here walking off after being shown a grand final red card, will return on Thursday against Warrington . Wigan coach Shaun Wane says he wants Flower back 'a bit more aggressive and a bit stronger and a bit fitter' St Helens possibly needed something out of the ordinary to help end an eight-year spell without a Grand Final title. Ben Flower’s two brutal punches on Lance Hohaia, which led to the dismissal of the Wigan prop inside two minutes, fit that description. CLICK HERE to read Martha Kelner's full Super League Grand Final report . Wigan coach Shaun Wane told a news conference at the DW Stadium on Tuesday that he will throw Flower straight back in, almost certainly from the bench, and expects him to be just as physical. 'I hope he's a bit more aggressive and a bit stronger and a bit fitter,' Wane said of Flower, who underwent knee surgery during his enforced lay-off. 'He's without a doubt one of the best front rowers in the comp and that's we want. We need a Ben Flower in our team. He's dynamic, just what I like, he runs the ball hard and he's uncompromising. He's perfect for me. Flower falls on Hohaia after first punching the New Zealand international to the ground . Referee Phil Bentham was given no choice but to make Flower the first player sent off in a grand final . 'I'll be telling him to go as hard as he can, run as hard as you can, hit as hard as you can and just carry on from where you left off because bear in mind in the play-off games last year he was one of the best. I want him back to that form as quickly as possible.' Flower, who was fined 50 per cent of his wages during his ban and has been coaching local juniors as part of the punishment handed out by his club, is ready to 'rip in', according to Wane. 'He's in a very, very good state of mind,' the coach said. 'He's very strong and he's trained really well. I can't wait to put him in. I'm really looking forward to it. I've been itching for this game to come and he'll get a chance. 'He just wants to get back to what he's paid to do, playing rugby and being one of the best middles in the competition. 'He's had a long pre-season and he's dying to rip in.' Flower's second punch (left) became the focal point of the all-in brawl which broke out in the first three minutes . A bloodied Hohaia is helped from the field - he received a one-match ban for the forearm that sparked the fight . Wane says Flower is in a 'very good state of mind' after a long enforced pre-season .

"Brazilian teams are on alert because of a dengue fever outbreak that has already affected some of the country's top clubs. Three players were diagnosed with the mosquito-borne disease this week, including Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero. Players have been forced to use insect repellent during practice sessions and clubs have asked health officials to check their training centres for mosquito breeding sites. Brazilian football clubs have been put on alert after a dengue fever outbreak . In addition to Guerrero, Palmeiras reserve goalkeeper Aranha and young Santos striker Leo Cittadini also have been diagnosed with the disease and won't be able to help their teams in the final stages of the Sao Paulo state championship this month. 'We have to find a way to stay away from this little mosquito,' Palmeiras midfielder Arouca said. Guerrero, Corinthians' top striker, will also miss his team's last two games in the group stage of the Copa Libertadores, Latin America's top club tournament. The Peruvian has been hospitalized since Saturday and there is no word on when he will be released. Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero is one of three players that have already been diagnosed . The players affected will need about two weeks to fully recover from the disease, which causes extreme joint pain and headaches. There is no cure, but is rarely fatal. Cases of dengue fever have increased significantly across Brazil this year, with most of them reported in Sao Paulo state. Brazil's health ministry said there have been more than 460,000 cases of the disease in the country in 2015, which accounts for almost 5,000 cases a day. More than 130 people have died so far this year, the ministry said. Corinthians midfielder Renato Augusto said some players have been practicing with pants and long sleeves to try to avoid the mosquitoes. 'We are afraid, of course,' he said. 'It turns out it's not only the defenders we have to worry about these days.' Guerrero, who used to play for Bayern Munich, in action for Corinthians in a Copa Libertadores match . Another Corinthians player, defender Rodrigo Sam, was hospitalized for two weeks after getting the disease earlier this year. Health officials inspected Corinthians' training center this week and said there were no signs of breeding sites for mosquitoes carrying dengue. The popular Brazilian club said the players were likely infected while away from the team's premises. Still, doctor Ivan Grava said players would continue to use insect repellent and, when possible, the team would not practice during times mosquitoes were more likely to appear. Another top Brazilian club affected by dengue fever this year was Sao Paulo. One of the team's doctors had the disease, and players recently expressed their concern about having to play a match in a city where the disease had spread quickly.","Brazilian teams are on alert because of a dengue fever outbreak .

"Buoyant after their strong domestic performance last week, Paris St Germain will look to overcome the absence of key players including striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Barcelona. PSG beat Ligue 1 bitter rivals Olympique de Marseille 3-2, thrashed St Etienne 4-1 in the French Cup semi-finals, and won the League Cup final 4-0 against Bastia on Saturday. Even if they will be without the suspended Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti and the injured David Luiz, PSG believe they are peaking. Paris Saint-Germain will be without the suspended Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti against Barcelona . 'Do I feel a new momentum? It's been the case for a while. We worked physically (during the winter break) and today, in money time, we're good,' said coach Laurent Blanc. 'We are gaining momentum while last year at the same time we were on the way down.' Both teams have been meeting regularly recently in the Champions League, with PSG beating Barca 3-2 at home in a Group F game this season before losing 3-1 at the Camp Nou. The Ligue 1 Champions will also have to cope without the injured David Luiz against the La Liga giants . Barca had reached the semi-finals in 2013 by eliminating PSG on away goals, drawing 1-1 at home after a 2-2 stalemate in Paris. 'The quarter-final tie is going to be very different from the group stage. There is a lot more at stake and in football no game is ever the same,' former Barca and PSG winger Ludovic Giuly said. Barca's 2-2 draw at Sevilla in La Liga on Saturday, when they threw away a 2-0 lead, prompted renewed concerns about their defensive frailty, with both the concedded goals down to mistakes from the Barca rearguard. Goalkeeper Claudio Bravo made an uncharacteristic handling error to let in Ever Banega's long-range strike before halftime and centre back Gerard Pique's loss of possession in midfield led to the Andalusian club's late equaliser. Brazilian right back Dani Alves is suspended for the Champions League clash with the Ligue 1 outfit . The stalemate in Sevilla meant Barca's lead over second-placed Real Madrid at the top of La Liga was cut to two points but they remain on course to repeat the 2009 historic treble of Champions League and Spanish league and Cup. Barca's Brazil right back Dani Alves is suspended for Wednesday's game, with Adriano or Martin Montoya likely to replace him in the starting lineup. Pique, however, is unfazed as Barca would once again bank on their formidable attacking trio. 'I've never before seen a relationship like the one between Luis (Suarez), Ney (Neymar) and Leo (Messi). We're talking about three of the best players in the world,' he said. The second leg will be played at the Camp Nou on April 21.","PSG take on Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-final first leg .

"Veteran Leeds prop Kylie Leuluai is facing the prospect of another six weeks on the sidelines after being told he needs shoulder surgery. The 37-year-old New Zealander has not played since the Super League leaders' only defeat at Warrington a month ago but coach Brian McDermott says his injury has now been properly diagnosed.

Kylie Leuluai faces another six weeks out of action for the Leeds Rhinos after being told he needs surgery . 'He will be out for anything from between four to six weeks.' McDermott had feared Leuluai could be out for three months if he needed a bicep operation. 'It's great news,' McDermott added. 'He has still got an important role to play with us. 'I think we've missed him over Easter, not just the extra body, but some of the direct carries he gives you.'","Kylie Leuluai needs surgery on his shoulder .

"Manchester United will offer Robin van Persie £5million to quit the club this summer. The 31-year-old striker has 14 months left on his £250,000-a-week contract at Old Trafford, but United officials are understood to be willing to pay the remaining half of a £10m loyalty bonus — agreed when he signed from Arsenal in 2012 — to free up wages for another striker. Italian giants Juventus and Inter Milan have both been linked with a summer move and United bosses are willing to take a cut-price fee, as they realise Van Persie will have to take a pay cut to join a Serie A side.

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers vowed not to give up on Champions League qualification after a convincing 2-0 win over Newcastle. The Reds moved within four points of the Barclays Premier League top four after goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen saw off the struggling Magpies at Anfield. With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener . Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news. 'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning. 'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.' Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead . Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created. Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half. Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield. Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf . 'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.' The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle. Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however. Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City . He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball . Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough. 'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'","Liverpool beat Newcastle 2-0 in the Premier League on Monday night .

"Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has no immediate plans to retire and said it would be a waste to quit now when he feels he is still in top form. 'A player stops when he feels that he is no longer what he was before on the pitch,' Buffon, 37, told reporters after Juventus beat Monaco 1-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday. 'Looking at it objectively, that is not my case. I will continue to keep playing as long as I am doing well, otherwise it would be a waste. Why bid farewell to football if you are playing well?' Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon says he is not thinking about retiring because he is still playing well . The Italy international produced a solid display to stop Monaco from scoring an away goal on Tuesday night . The Juventus captain celebrates after his side recorded a 1-0 win in the first leg of the quarter-final . 'At the first sign of slipping, I would be the first to bow out. I think one should stop playing when goes onto the field and you see that you are no longer the same person,' he added. Buffon, who has helped Juventus win three successive Serie A titles and is still Italy's first-choice goalkeeper, made three important saves to deny Monaco an away goal in Tuesday's game. Buffon joined Juventus from Parma in 2001, and stayed with them even after they were demoted to Serie B following the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal in 2006, the same year he helped Italy win the World Cup.","Juventus keeper Gianluigi Buffon says he has no plans to retire soon .

"Andy Murray arrived back in Britain on Monday restored as world No 3 in the new rankings — but set aside thoughts of that to focus on his wedding in Dunblane this weekend. And despite his recent tournament finishes getting him back near the top of the game, the 27-year-old Scot confirmed it will be a down-to-earth guest list when he marries fiancée Kim Sears in his hometown on Saturday. There are believed to be well over 100 people attending, but star spotters will find celebrities in short supply as the couple focus on celebrating with family and genuine friends.

Murray plays a forehand against Djokovic  in the final during the Miami Open  at Crandon Park Tennis Center . ‘There’ll be no celebrities as such, I don’t have any celebrity friends so it wasn’t something that was planned,’ said Murray, before he flew back after his Miami Open final defeat to runaway world No 1 Novak Djokovic on Sunday. The one possible exception is comedian James Corden, although he is busy working in America. There will be quite a few friends prominent in British tennis — aside from anything Kim’s father Nigel has been one of the country’s leading coaches — but with the Monte Carlo Open beginning next Monday the bigger international names were always going to be otherwise engaged. Murray and Djokovic pose for a photograph prior to the mens final during the Miami Open . Djokovic holds the winners trophy after defeating Murray in the final of the Miami Open . In fact the only non-British player likely to attend is Jean-Julien Rojer, a doubles specialist from the Dutch Antilles who has a base in Miami. ‘Jules lives there and I spend quite a lot of time with him. Tim (Henman) will be coming. James Ward, Jamie Delgado (longstanding British player and coach). ‘We invited Kyle Edmund but he can’t make it because he’s playing,’ said Murray, who confirmed the couple will not cash in on photography rights to any magazines. Other tennis guests include coach Amelie Mauresmo, former assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and two of his three best men, brother Jamie and former Davis Cup player Ross Hutchins. The third is Carlos Mier, a friend from his days at the Barcelona tennis academy he attended. Kim Sears fiancee of Murray  watches him in action against Djokovic in the fierce Miami sun . ‘Everyone who we’re close to, people we’ve spent a lot of time with in the past and people that we see ourselves spending time with in the future. That’s how we came up with the list,’ said Murray. Rather than asking for wedding gifts, the couple have requested that guests make a donation to charities they support such as UNICEF and the World Wildlife Fund. ‘I’m going to go up to Scotland early and spend time with my family for a couple of days. I’m not going to hit any balls this week. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I’m sure a few things will come up. World No 3 Murray is set to marry his fiancee Sears in Dunblane next Saturday . ‘Kim has pretty much controlled most of the important things and I’ve tried to help when she’s asked. I haven’t been overly involved but there’s things I enjoy doing, I did all the food and cake tasting which I actually loved.’ There will not be any honeymoon until later in the year. In the middle of next week Murray will head to Barcelona to train with incoming assistant coach, former Swedish player Jonas Bjorkman, before resuming his tournament schedule the week after that in Munich.

"If there’s one thing that stops a boiled egg from being the perfect food - it's the hassle of peeling it. More often than not the process will leave you with fragments of shell in your fingers, on the kitchen counter and sometimes even in your food. But one canny YouTube user, MicahMedia, has uploaded a video demonstrating the simplest and swiftest way to peel a hardboiled egg - using a glass of water. Scroll down for video . The hard-boiled egg is placed in a glass (left) before it is filled quarter of the way with tap water (right) He pops the hardboiled egg into a small tumbler glass before filling it a quarter of the way with water. He then places his hand over the top of the glass, completely covering it. His next move is to vigorously shake the glass from left to right. He keeps the glass in the sink so that the water doesn’t spill. After approximately ten seconds of shaking, the YouTuber lifts his hand to show the egg, which now has a cracked shell. He simply puts his hand in the glass and in a matter of miliseconds, lifts up the shell of the egg which has been loosened from the egg.

"Ronald Koeman's message to his Southampton players is a clear one: Forget about the others, focus on yourselves and start scoring goals. The Saints' stellar season has stuttered in recent weeks, largely due to their impotence in front of goal. In their last 10 league matches they've scored just seven times, resulting in a haul of 14 points from a potential 30. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman wants his team to rediscover their scoring form to make Europe . Southampton striker Graziano Pelle (centre) has struggled to reproduce his form from the start of the season . Pelle's struggles in front of goal could see him removed from the side to play Hull on Saturday . Still, though, the south coast side are punching well above their weight and sit seventh in the Premier League with 53 points from their 31 outings -- one point behind Tottenham Hotspur in sixth and Liverpool in fifth. European football is the goal and, starting with Hull City on Saturday, Saints have seven matches to chase that dream. 'You have to look at yourself and to do your best,' Koeman said on Thursday. 'You have to have the ambition, spirit and quality. 'We have a little bit more difficulty in creating enough chances to score and we have to work on that. Now the situation at the moment is that we are fighting for fifth, sixth and seventh position in the table and that's still very good. 'We have a home game now and if you want to finish up in the table you have to win games like this.' Saints have failed to score in five of their last nine league matches, and Koeman could be poised to recall Senegalese striker Sadio Mane to the starting 11.

Hull are scrapping for their top-flight lives and will be tough to break down.

"John Carver says he would walk away from Newcastle United if the club’s hierarchy had not given him assurances of serious summer investment. Supporters are threatening to boycott the next home match against Spurs in protest at Mike Ashley’s running of the club and a perceived lack of ambition. Newcastle have lost the last five Tyne-Wear derbies and, in the wake of Sunday’ s 1-0 defeat at Sunderland, the owner, head coach and players have come in for strong criticism. John Carver would walk away from Newcastle  if the club’s hierarchy had not given him reassurances .

And I’m telling you now, if I was sitting here and I thought they were giving me lip service I would say “thanks very much, I’m off - I’m walking away from this”. ‘If I didn’t have enough belief in what they were trying to do and the promises that they’ve said about the summer, then I would. But I’m not because I know what they’re saying to me is right. They’ve said that we need to bring players into this football club, first of all to boost the size of the squad, but also to improve the quality, to take us on. ‘We can’t stand still because other clubs are not standing still and they know that. We have to go with them. And if we don’t, you get left behind.' He added: ‘We’ve had different managers but the same group of players (keep getting beat in derbies). There is something in the DNA.

"Just over a decade ago Gianfranco Zola was voted the greatest Chelsea player of all time in a poll of the club's supporters. This may seem a little premature, but as Eden Hazard prepares for to make his 100th Barclays Premier League appearance for Chelsea at QPR on Sunday, the little magician could have a rival in years to come. Hazard is some player, one of the elite in English football with those dazzling runs and the sparkling feet that can open up the best defences in the league. Eden Hazard has developed into one of the world's best players after flourishing at Chelsea . Hazard has proven himself as a goalscorer and a creator of chances during his time with Chelsea . Hazard celebrates scoring against Hull earlier this season as Chelsea march towards the Premier League title . This season he has been imperious, full of movement and flexibility as Chelsea close in on a double of Capital One Cup and Premier League in Jose Mourinho's second season back at Stamford Bridge. After Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain in February at the Parc des Princes, Mourinho demanded more protection from referees for Hazard. Chelsea's dancing winger is a marked man. The PFA young player of the year had been fouled nine times, with Laurent Blanc's team taking it in turns to nobble the Chelsea No 10 in the first leg of their Champions League second round tie. He has scored some special goals, 17 so far with another nine assists, as Mourinho's team close in on a fourth Premier League title in the Abramovich era. On Sunday, April 26 the PFA players' player of the year award could be his, joining a list of winners that includes Luis Suarez, Gareth Bale, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry and his Chelsea team-mate John Terry in recent times. He has grown to love English football, adapting to the demands of the Premier League and the numerous managers he has already played for since his move from Lille in 2012. Roberto Di Matteo was still Chelsea's manager when Hazard tweeted that he was joining 'this season's Champions League winner' ahead of his £32million move from France. He made an impressive start in the Premier League, assisting the opening goal for Chelsea in the 2-0 victory at Wigan and winning the penalty for Frank Lampard to convert at the DW Stadium. Hazard joined Chelsea from Lille for £32million in 2012 after the Blues beat a host to clubs to his signature . Hazard was involved in a controversial incident at Swansea when he kicked the ball as it lay under the ball boy . Hazard was sent off after the ball-boy incident as Chelsea were beaten in the Capital One Cup semi-final . Hazard, his wife Natasha and their kids enjoy some off time at Disneyland Paris . Di Matteo loved him as a player and he went through a notable dip in form when the European Cup-winning coach was fired after the 4-1 defeat against Juventus in the Champions League. A few months later he was sent off when he infamously wrestled with a ball-boy during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final defeat against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. He finished the season with a Europa League medal after Chelsea's victory over Benfica the Amsterdam ArenA, but it is the arrival of Mourinho that has transformed his game. Last season there was a period of frustration among Chelsea's first team players because they shared the view of the coach that they had signed a world class talent. Despite his ability he was often one of the first to leave after training, heading home to his family - wife Natasha and their two young children, after a quick shower and lunch with his team-mates. Slowly he has bought into dressing room culture. There is a ruthless streak about him these days and Mourinho, to his credit, drew it out of him after meeting Hazard's father, along with his lawyer, after Belgium's disappointing World Cup in Brazil. Hazard has grown in stature since he was handed Juan Mata's old No 10 shirt, requesting the jersey after the winger left for Manchester United in January 2014. The No 10 shirt is also the number of his hero Zinedine Zidane, the player a young Hazard idolised when he was making his way through Belgian football before his move to Lille. In recent times he has been encouraged to drift across the front three positions, interchanging with Oscar (in the centre) and Willian (on the right) when it takes his fancy. Hazard helped Chelsea win the Europa League under Rafa Benitez when they beat Benfica in the final . Hazard, pictured alongside Luis Suarez, was named the PFA Young Player of the Year last season . Hazard added a second trophy to his Chelsea collection this season when the Blues won the Capital One Cup . Jose Mourinho transformed Hazard's game after he suffered a dip following the departure of Roberto Di Matteo . Mourinho poses with Hazard after he was named Chelsea's Player of the Year last season . He is the focal point of Chelsea's attack, a willing outlet with a first touch that you can melt when he takes it on the instep of his right boot. He has been scoring goals again, adding to his tally this season in recent weeks with strikes for club and country as the season hurtles towards the finish line. At 24 he is maturing nicely, a humble man who impressed Chelsea's hierarchy during the complex negotiations over a new contract towards the end of last year. He has never been responsible for the glut of stories linking him with a move back to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain and he consistently told the club that he was willing to remain at Stamford Bridge. Hazard's contract talks were reminiscent of Gary Neville at Manchester United, leaving it with the club to determine the terms on his new five-year contract. Chelsea settled on £200,000 a week. To those who know him, he speaks of trophies and a hunger to be remembered as a player who contributed to one of the most successful periods in Chelsea's history. Given time, he could even be remembered as the very best. Hazard recently signed a bumper new five-year deal at Chelsea worth £200,000 a week . In Hazard, Gianfranco Zola may soon have a rival as Chelsea's greatest ever player .","Eden Hazard will make his 100th league appearance for Chelsea on Sunday .

"The records just keep tumbling for Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid. After his strike against Rayo Vallecano, the Portuguese forward now has 300 goals for Los Blancos, despite having played in Madrid for only six seasons, amassing 288 appearances. He has well and truly made his name as a legend at the Santiago Bernabeu, only trailing Raul and Alfredo di Stefano in the club standings. Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 300 goals for Real Madrid in just six years with the La Liga giants . The Portuguese forward is catching Raul's (l) club record and is just seven goals shy of Alfredo di Stefano (r) Ronaldo heads home his 300th goal for the club - against Rayo Vallecano at the Vallecas Stadium in Madrid . 323 - Raul . 308 - Alfredo di Stefano . 300 - Cristiano Ronaldo . 289 - Carlos Santillana . 242 - Ferenc Puskas . Ronaldo has scored 206 with his right foot, 52 with his left, even managing 41 with his head. 46 of his goals at Real have been outside the box, many of them screamers. After claiming two FIFA Ballon d'Or awards during his time in Spain, as well as glory in La Liga and the Champions League, many would be running out of motivation, scratching around for more records to break. But Ronaldo, 30, doesn't only have the status of Raul or Di Stefano to look up to, but also Barcelona rival Lionel Messi, who is younger, and seemingly still improving. But there are other poachers that have formed their goalscoring reputation at one club, including a Portugal legend and an Everton hero who the former Manchester United man could draw inspiration from. Ronaldo celebrates after scoring his first goal (vs Deportivo in 2009, above), and his most recent (below) THE TOP 10 ONE-CLUB SCORERS OF ALL TIME . 10) Dixie Dean, Everton (1925-37) 383 . Dean is the widely regarded as greatest player to have been born on Merseyside, and scored 60 goals in one league season in 1927/28. Impressed? He achieved that record after fracturing his skull and jaw in a motorcycling accident. Former Everton striker Dixie Dean is widely regarded as the greatest striker ever born on Merseyside . 9) Willy van der Kuijlen, PSV (1964-81) 394 . When his career started in Eindhoven, part of Der Kuijlen's motivation was to work at Phillips. He ended up with almost 400 goals, and was still only capped 22 times by the Dutch national side. Willy van der Kuijlen of PSV runs with the ball in the UEFA Cup match against Bastia in 1978 . 8) Lionel Messi, Barcelona (2004-present) 398* . Staggeringly, this Argentine forward is only 27. As the star of a mightily impressive Barelona team, expect Messi to climb up this list considerably over the next 10 years. Lionel Messi is closing in on the 400 mark with Barcelona and should rapidly rise up the scoring charts . 7) Zico, Flamengo (1971-83 and 1985-89) 401 . An attacking midfielder in the top 10? Often called the 'White Pele', Zico encapsulated a fine generation of Brazilian football, and impressed with his club side in his homeland. Over two spells with Flamengo, it's no wonder he was given a prestigious nickname. Zico of Flamengo takes on Liverpool's (l-r) Ray Kennedy, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen in a friendly . 6) Eusebio, Benfica (1960-75) 474 . Eusebio helped Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies, as well as four European Cup finals. Not just a poacher, Eusebio had it all and the Mozambique-born player was a Portuguese football legend. Eusebio lead Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies with a staggering amount of goals . 5) Uwe Seeler, Hamburg (1953-72) 507 . Up there with Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer as a German great, Seeker was not a giant but a very strong player with fantastic shooting and heading abilities. His tally probably proves that. Uwe Seeler scored over 500 goals for Hamburg and is up there with Franz Beckenbauer as a German great . 4) Jimmy McGrory, Celtic (1922-37) 522 . Regarded as the Hoops' finest ever player, McGrory netted 55 hat-tricks for the club and went on to rewrite the football record books with his unbelievable scoring feats. 3) Josef Bican, Slavia Prague (1937-48) 534 . Slavia were one of the biggest clubs in the pre-war era, led by a striker from a poor family, brought up in Austria. He fled to Czechoslovakia during the second world war, and certainly made his mark. 2) Gerd Muller, Bayern Munich (1964-79) 573 . Muller scored an incredible 85 goals in a single season as Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title in 1972, and was the league's top scorer on seven occasions. Muller spent 13 campaigns with the Bavarian giants and with his goalscoring record, it's no wonder to see him near the top of the charts. Gerd Muller (centre) scored 85 goals in one league season with Bayern Munich and netted 573 in total . 1) Pele, Santos (1956-74) 1088 . Though his official record stands at 643 goals for Brazilian side Santos, and the 1088 includes strikes against a military XI, Pele tops the charts. Is he the best player of all-time, too? Pele unofficially scored 1088 goals for Santos and is widely regarded as the best player of all-time . PS... who are these Premier League sides' all-time top scorers? ARSENAL . 228 - Thierry Henry (1999-2007 and 2012) 185 - Ian Wright (1991-98) 178 - Cliff Bastin (1929-47) Thierry Henry enjoyed a prolific eight-year spell with Arsenal and is the club's all-time top goalscorer . CHELSEA . 211 - Frank Lampard (2001-14) 202 - Bobby Tambling (1959-70) 193 - Kerry Dixon (1983-92) EVERTON . 383 - Dixie Dean (1925-37) 159 - Graeme Sharp (1980-91) 138 - Bob Latchford (1974-81) LIVERPOOL . 346 - Ian Rush (1980-87 and 1988-96) 286 - Roger Hunt (1958-69) 241 - Gordon Hodgson (1925-36) Ian Rush netted 346 times over two spells with Liverpool and is streaks ahead of anyone else in the charts . MANCHESTER CITY . 178 - Eric Brook (1928-39) 166 - Tommy Johnson (1920-30) 153 - Colin Bell (1966-1979) MANCHESTER UNITED . 249 - Sir Bobby Charlton (1956-73) 237 - Denis Law (1962-73) 230* Wayne Rooney (2004-present) Wayne Rooney is just 19 goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton at Manchester United after his recent strike . NEWCASTLE . 206 - Alan Shearer (1996-2006) 200 - Jackie Milburn (1946-57) 153 - Len White (1953-62) Alan Shearer scored 206 goals for Newcastle, while Vic Watson managed 326 for West Ham United . TOTTENHAM . 266 - Jimmy Greaves (1961-70) 208 - Bobby Smith (1955-64) 174 - Martin Chivers (1968-76) WEST HAM . 326 -  Vic Watson (1920-35) 252 - Geoff Hurst (1959-72) 166 - John Dick (1953–63) 166 - Jimmy Ruffell (1921-37)","Cristiano Ronaldo scored 300th goal for Real Madrid on Wednesday night .

"Alan Pardew says Sunderland should be more concerned about his in-form Crystal Palace side than his past as Newcastle manager this Saturday. Palace beat Manchester City on Monday night and have ambitions of finishing in the Barclays Premier League's top 10 this season. Pardew was the first Newcastle boss to suffer four successive defeats to Sunderland, who last weekend won a fifth Tyne-Wear derby in a row, but is now only thinking about Palace. 'We're going there in great form. The stadium will be wary of us, the 11 players on the pitch,' Pardew said. Glenn Murray (second from right) celebrates with his  team-mates after scoring against Manchester City . Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew thinks Sunderland fans should concentrate on his in-form side . 'Irrespective of my reception, it's about the 11 players on the pitch and Sunderland fans know that we're in really good form. 'The group is on a high. We have a different type of game this Saturday and we need to make the adjustment quickly.' Pardew arrived at Selhurst Park in January with top-flight survival the target. Performances and results have surpassed expectations, but Pardew insists the Eagles must stick to the characteristics which have seen them soar to 11th place in the table. 'It is now about trying to keep our professionalism and keep on the process of what's been winning us games,' Pardew added. 'We haven't set an outcome target, in terms of points we're going to get, but we have talked about the standards that we've set and that we need to maintain those. 'If we maintain them, then our position might surprise a few. Jason Puncheon celebrates after scoring Palace's winning goal in their 2-1 victory against champions City . Jermain Defoe scores a stunning winner for Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle . 'We're three points away from the top 10 so of course it is (a realistic target).' Pardew believes Palace players will be viewed in a more favourable light when it comes to international honours. He said: 'All our players are going to be looked at in a kinder manner, or through a different lens to how they've been looked at - and so they should be. 'Our form is as good as the top three or four clubs in the country and therefore they should receive the plaudits for what they're doing. That would be only what they deserve.' Mile Jedinak could come straight in after his four-game suspension as midfielder Joe Ledley is a doubt with a hip injury. Pardew added: 'Joe Ledley's got a slight strain and we'll have to monitor that. 'He's been exceptional since I've been here, so we'll give him every opportunity to play.' Pardew, after four years as Newcastle boss, knows Sunderland well and was not surprised the Black Cats turned to former Rangers and Holland boss Dick Advocaat. 'I think it was a great move for them to have someone of his experience at this time and he's proving that,' Pardew added. 'It's fair to say they've gone a little bit more direct, a little bit more positive. 'They have some good players and it's always a difficult place to go. 'I don't think we're under an illusions. It's a team coming off the back of a great victory (beating Newcastle 1-0) and they will be buoyed for our game.","Crystal Palace face Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Saturday .

"Stoke City manager Mark Hughes plans to make the Britannia Stadium pitch bigger to suit his side's passing style of play. The Potters' current playing surface is the joint smallest in the Premier League - along with QPR's Loftus Road and Tottenham's White Hart Lane - but Hughes is keen to extend its current 100m x 66m parameter. The Premier League wish to standardise pitch sizes at 105m x 68m. Ten clubs currently meet the regulation size.

Stoke have enjoyed an impressive season under Hughes and play much less direct than past Potters sides . Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle all currently comply with the regulations and have pitch sizes of 105m x 68m. However, exceptions are allowed 'if it is impossible to comply with rule K21 due to the ground's construction.' Everton, Liverpool and Chelsea are three of the ten clubs who do not currently comply with the regulated size. Queens Park Rangers' Loftus Road pitch is the smallest pitch in the Premier League this season . Tottenham's White Hart Lane is also one of the smallest pitches in the top-flight with parameters of 100m x67m . Former Stoke boss Tony Pulis insisted on using the minimum measurements allowed when the Potters were promoted to the Premier League back in 2008 in order to contain the opposition. The smaller pitch also benefited former midfielder Rory Delap, whose launched throws into the area led to a number of Stoke goals during the club's formative years in the top-flight. Back in 2011, Stoke were actually forced to extend the width and length of the pitch after qualifying for the Europa League. However, Hughes has completely overhauled the club's playing philosophy since taking over the Britannia Stadium hotseat in 2013 - the club are much less direct now -  and is set to expand the pitch by at least 15ft for next season.

"Having won Premier League, Serie A and La Liga titles, as well as two Champions Leagues, Jose Mourinho has coached a whole host of world class stars during his 15-year career as a manager. Here, Sportsmail picks Mourinho's best ever XI. Jose Mourinho has won 21 major trophies during his career as a coach and his picked his ultimate XI . Goalkeeper - Petr Cech . His signature in the summer of 2004 coincided with Mourinho's arrival in west London, and the Czech stopper has become a Chelsea stalwart. Currently out of the team due to Thibaut Courtois' emergence, and his manager will reportedly let him leave Stamford Bridge. Petr Cech has formed himself a legendary reputation at Chelsea during 11 years at the club . Sergio Ramos - Right back . A stalwart for 10 years in Real Madrid's defence, Sergio Ramos was a key part of Mourinho's title-winning side in 2011-2. Sergio Ramos has been a star at the back for Real Madrid for 10 years . John Terry - Centre back . The Chelsea captain seemingly keeps getting better under Mourinho, with major lapses in form only usually occurring when the 52-year-old isn't in charge. John Terry has captained Chelsea whenever Mourinho has been in charge at the club . Centre back - Lucio . The Brazilian beast was one of the fiercest defenders of the past decade, winning everything in the game at club and international level. And he was superb for Mourinho during their Treble-winning time together at Inter in 2010. Lucio was one of the best central defenders of the past decade, especially during his time at Inter . Left back - Ashley Cole . A England's greatest left back of a generation, he may not have played under Mourinho for too long, but he was still undoubtedly one of the top performers for the Blues under the Portuguese. Ashley Cole played under Mourinho during both of his stints at Stamford Bridge . Centre midfield - Michael Essien . There was a stage during Michael Essien's peak where he was one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and the world. Even when he declined in later years, Mourinho still saw fit to bring him to Real Madrid. Midfielder Michael Essien in action during his time playing for Chelsea . Centre midfield - Frank Lampard . Another one of Mourinho's stalwarts, was a key man with goals from midfield during a dominant first spell in charge for the Portuguese boss at Chelsea. He may have let him go last summer, but Jose obviously still loves Lampard. Frank Lampard and Jose Mourinho embrace after victory in the Champions League against Barcelona in 2005 . Left wing - Eden Hazard . They've had their run-ins in the past, but it's clear Mourinho hasn't had many more talented players than this Belgian winger, who is firing the Blues towards the title. Hazard recently signed a new long-term deal so is clearly happy under this boss. Eden Hazard is the youngest member in this side and is firing Chelsea towards the Premier League title . Attacking midfield - Wesley Sneijder . Under Mourinho, Sneijder emerged as one of the best attacking midfielders in the world. The Dutchman was superb as Inter stormed to the Treble in 2010, and it's fair to say he hasn't looked like the same player since they split. Wesley Sneijder playing for Inter Milan, he was a star for Mourinho during their Treble winning campaign . Right wing - Cristiano Ronaldo . What more can you say? Ronaldo recently scored his 300th goal for Real Madrid, and flourished while working with the 'Special One' at the Bernabeu. The Portuguese duo certainly get on. Cristiano Ronaldo enjoyed his time working with his Portuguese compatriot at the Bernabeu . Striker - Didier Drogba . Mourinho recently described Drogba as his best buy at any club, so it's no surprise to see the Ivorian make the list. He arrived in England as a petulant forward with a lot to prove, and is now a Chelsea legend in his second spell at the club. Mourinho recently admitted Drogba was his best ever buy so it's no surprise to see him as the striker .

Such was influence, his dry one-liners and impeccable delivery - including one simple word 'marvellous' - were adopted as part of the Australian lexicon. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. At the time of his death, Benaud had witnessed - as both player and commentator - well over 500 Test matches. Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. Warne also thanked Benaud for the support he gave to him as a young cricketer. 'Richie, you were loved by everyone, not just the cricket family, you were the godfather of cricket and you will be missed by all.' Australian Test captain Michael Clarke said Benaud was a gentleman who played cricket in the right spirit. 'He was a great player and a great captain; a wonderful leader of men and he continued that off the field,' Clarke told the Nine Network. 'Our country has lost a national treasure,' Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said in a statement on Friday. 'After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous or more influential than Richie Benaud.' 'He loved winning. He helped the Australian team have the attitude where they wanted to win. He played the game the right way. 'There's no doubt he's certainly going to be missed.'

Former Prime Minister John Howard greeted Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground back in 2001 . Benaud and ex-Hampshire cricket captain and TV presenter Richie Benaud pictured here at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff during the first England v Australia Test match in 2009 . 'There would hardly be an Australian over the last 40 years who hasn't listened to Richie Benaud,' he told ABC radio on Friday. 'He certainly will be very, very much missed.' Benaud had anchored the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades. 'Richie Benaud's passing has robbed us not only of a national treasure but a lovely man,' Nine Network CEO David Gyngell said in a statement.

Benaud was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets yet was as much renowned for his captaincy - he never lost a Test series as Australian captain. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer.

Penrith-born Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964 . 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap... because Keith Miller never wore a cap, ' Benaud said at the time. 'If I knew, when I was at school and playing in my early cricket days, the problems that would have come if I didn't do something about protection of the head and using sunscreens and all sorts of things like that, I'd have played it differently. 'It's one of those things in life: you live and learn as you go along.' Benaud did, however, manage to voice a touching tribute to Phillip Hughes, who died when struck by a bouncer last November, which was screened before Australia's Test series against India last December. Hundreds of admirers dressed up as the legendary commentator during the Sydney Ashes Test of 2014 when Benaud lay in hospital with complications from a serious car accident some months earlier .

As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. His Australian record Test tally of 248 wickets has since been overtaken by many, most notably fellow legspinner Shane Warne, whose career tally of 708 was unimaginable in Benaud's day. Benaud scored three Test centuries and once hit 11 sixes in a first class innings. Shane Warne penned a heartfelt tribute to Richie Benaud on social media on Friday . As captain he led Australia to four consecutive series victories, beginning with a 4-0 demolition of Peter May's 1958-59 tourists (Benaud took 31 wickets in the five tests).

"Adi Viveash's Chelsea U19s side stormed into the UEFA Youth League final following a 4-0 mauling of Roma in the semis. After a tense and goalless first-half, midfielder Charlie Colckett's deflected shot gave Chelsea the lead. Striker Dominic Solanke then scored a brace, before substitute Tammy Abraham wrapped up the win with a tap in on 83 minutes. Chelsea will now face Shakhtar Donetsk's U19s team in the final.

Chelsea's Isaiah Brown (left) tussle for the ball with Roma's Silvio Anocic (right) in the box . Roma had initially defended strongly, but capitulated after the break. Chelsea made two changes from the side that started the quarter-final victory over Atletico Madrid last month, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Charly Musonda coming into the line-up. Andreas Christensen, who started in midfield against Atletico, was paired with Jake Clarke-Salter at centre-back, while Ola Aina and Jay DaSilva occupied the full-back positions. Loftus-Cheek was partnered in midfield by Colkett and Musonda, with the latter operating in the hole behind the front-three of Solanke, Jeremie Boga and captain Izzy Brown.

The first came at the end of a driving run from Brown, which saw the ball bounce kindly into the path of Colkett for him to wrong-foot the goalkeeper with an awkward shot. A second goal followed from Christensen's excellent long ball forward, met by the run of Solanke who rounded the rushing keeper to fire into an empty net. After Boga had an attempt spilled by the keeper, Solanke was on hand to poach his second and Chelsea's third. Solanke has now netted 11 goals in this year's Youth League and is the competition's leading scorer. The rout was completed when Abraham, on from the bench, converted Kasey Palmer's cross.

And now, Rita Ora - who is only 24 and has already made the transition from a Kosovan-born fledgling singer to one of the globe's most successful stars - has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range. For her latest collaboration with adidas Originals, Rita has taken the brand's classics and put her own bold spin on them. The result? A collection that is as daring and vibrant as the designer herself. Scroll down for video . Rita Ora has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range, so FEMAIL caught up with the global star to find out her influences and plans for the future . Speaking to FEMAIL about the inspiration behind her new range, which is emblazoned with graphic dragon prints and lands on May 1, Rita said: 'The Dragon print is all about my love of travel and soaking up different cultures. The print itself is inspired by Asian culture and one of its most recognisable symbols. 'I’ve contrasted that with the fit, basketball style cuts, which were inspired by American culture. My White Smoke pack is about the body-mind-soul connection, about taking a moment for reflection. The graphic comes from the visual smoke creates when burning incense.' The talented star, who also recently unveiled a beauty range for Rimmel, couldn't be happier with the final result. She said: 'I love being able to go into design meetings with all these crazy ideas and then be able to create a product that hasn’t existed before. From the initial stages to seeing my fans wearing the clothes and shoes - it’s been an amazing experience.'

Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises there’s 'a little something for everyone'. 'Each one of my packs has a different cut and style to it,' she explained. 'I’m more of a tomboy myself but I also love to get dressed up and wear a big dress, so my designs embody that contrast. 'I’m always about wearing what looks and feels good to you, not about following trends. So I try to create clothing that fits that, allowing the person wearing it to make it their own however it fits their own personal style.' Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises the range, pictured, offers 'a little something for everyone' Citing Marilyn Monroe as her ultimate postergirl, Rita explains that her style has evolved as a result of her transatlantic career. 'I’ve always loved that London street style, but I’ve started to fuse it with a more American style the more time I’ve spent here,' she said. 'But UK or US, I’ve always been a sneakerhead. Adidas has always been a staple in my closet, so it was a natural fit for me to collaborate with them, I’m just grateful they wanted to work with me!'.

As well as conquering the fashion world, the humble star has been busy making music, starring in Fifty Shades Of Grey and spending time with her beau, Ricky Hilfiger. So does she ever have a day off and what does she get up to? 'Whenever I have a day off, I spend the day in my bed, watching movies, in my pyjamas, eating takeaway,' she revealed. 'I guess it’s probably fortunate that I don’t have too many days off, but I always like to take full advantage of any down time I can get.' Thanks to her countless projects and array of starry friends, it seems that The Voice coach is taking over the world.  'Aw, thank you!,' she replied. 'It’s great to be able to give a try to so many different things. 'I’m just starting to get more into the Hollywood movie world, so I’d love to continue down that path. But music has always and will always be my main love and passion. 'In five years' time, hopefully I will still be creating music and being able to live my dreams surrounded with the people I love.

"College basketball player Lauren Hill lost her battle with cancer on Friday morning, aged just 19. The Indiana native, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. Instead, she played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. But as her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where she passed away on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Loss: Lauren Hill, who is pictured playing for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati in November, died in hospital on Friday - aged just 19 - after a brave battle with a rare form of brain cancer . Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition, and on November 2, she realized her dream of playing for the school. She scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance . Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December . Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati . At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. Fighter: The NCAA moved the school's first game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets . Heroic: Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school . 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' her coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling.","Hill was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer when she was 18 and by last September, she was told she would not live past December .

"Jonathan Trott has admitted that he thought his England career was over after he reached 'breaking point' in Brisbane and was forced to quit the last Ashes tour. Trott was forced to head home to an uncertain future after his ordeal at the hands of Mitchell Johnson in the first Ashes Test but has battled back to be on the brink of making his 50th Test appearance against West Indies on Monday. 'To be brutally honest I didn't know if I'd be able to come back here and I didn't know if I was going to be selected but I had to get my head down and push my case forward and that's all I could do. I'm really glad to be here,' said a relaxed Trott before England headed to Antigua on Friday. Jonathan Trott is set to make his 50th Test appearance for England against the West Indies on Monday . 'There's excitement. It's something I wanted again but I didn't know if things would go my way again and I'd have this opportunity. I'm very pleased and happy to be here. There's a good bunch of guys here but on a personal note this is just the start of something I want to keep doing and earn my place back.' Trott looks certain to adopt a new role as opener alongside Alastair Cook at the start of a series England cannot afford to lose after battling back in county cricket with Warwickshire and then as captain of the Lions. 'That's all I've done so far. I went back to Warwickshire and earned my place in their side and then went on a Lions tour and I think I had to do that for myself and for everyone around me. It's important to have the mentality of coming here and trying to earn a spot in the starting XI. That's my goal. 'The guys have been really good. The team's changed a bit so there are guys I haven't played with and a few guys I played on the Lions tour with which is great. It was nice to go on that tour and see the players coming through there. To captain the Lions and go away with them was quite an eye opener and I really enjoyed it. It's good to see those guys putting their case forward.' Trott leaves the field following his dismissal during a warm-up match in St Kitts on Thursday . Trott believes that his Brisbane breakdown was the culmination of problems that were eventually successfully diagnosed as situational anxiety when he began working with renowned sports psychologist Steve Peters. 'It wasn't so much Brisbane it was more of a lead up to it. The whole months leading up to it, even in England, were really tough and Brisbane was the culmination, a breaking point if you like, and it was interesting to step back and look at the things that have happened since. You hope it's something you will never have to go through but it makes you a stronger person. It was a real challenge to be here but the challenge starts now. It's about building relationships again. It was Andy Flower who said in Brisbane that Trott had suffered from a 'stress related' condition for the bulk of his career. Is he still suffering? 'Its interesting, you speak to guys I've played with and they say ""I've probably gone through something similar to you."" But it wasn't at the sort of level where they were exposed and they were managing to hide it or bury it and got away with it. Trott plays a shot during England's game against a Nevis Invitational XI on Monday . 'Cricket is virtually 12 months a year so if something builds up and is not kept in check it can overtake everything. With time and hard work and the right people around me I've managed to get it right and I'm back performing. I've had a few obstacles to overcome and get through and I've been put under pressure quite a bit to get back to this position. 'I've been tested on and off the field and had to go through the ringer to get here. So, yes I feel really confident I can cope and do really well. Everything is in place to start performing again and hopefully contribute to getting the England side back to a successful state and doing really well. Opening will be totally different for him but England's middle order is secure after a successful summer against India. 'Yes it's okay,' Trott explained. 'It's an in to the team and I have to adjust. I hadn't really batted at No 3 before I batted there for England so I had to adjust to that and did that for a few years and really enjoyed it. It's always nice to bat with Alastair if I get the opportunity and he will be a familiar face if I go out there with him. There's experience round the team so if I can add to that and contribute it would be really great. 'It's worked out really well. I had to go back to county cricket and do the hard yards to earn selection just as I did when I first played county cricket. I've always thought that was the route I had to take. I had to go back and prove my case for selection. Not just putting up my hand and saying 'I want to play now.' Other guys have come in and done well so I had to go back and push my case. Trott looks sure to open with Alastair Cook (left) in the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday . Then I had to go on the Lions tour. I remember Andy phoning me at the end of the season and at first I said ""okay can I think about it"" but then after a couple of weeks without playing it sounded like a good idea. You realise that six months is quite a long time without cricket in the life of a county player! It was the next obvious step to pushing my case to being here today. 'I'm really glad I did it and a lot of credit goes to the Lions. As a youngster the two tours I did with them helped my cricket and again now it's been a case of the Lions helping me make the step up. I'm really pleased with how it's gone.' Trott believes his issues came from putting too high expectations on himself. 'I think it was the culmination of playing a lot of cricket and having an imbalanced perspective of what I needed to do to succeed. I set myself unrealistically high expectations that I couldn't achieve. It just started building and I couldn't see the wood from the trees. You get into a situation where the expectations are almost inhuman. Trott is set for his first Test appearance since his Ashes turmoil against Mitchell Johnson 18 months ago . 'I wouldn't say my expectations have changed. I still have high expectations of myself but in different areas now. It's just realising what's important and having a balanced life. This game and the amount of time you spend on it can be all-encompassing so it's good to have a balanced view and I'm a big believer in that now. I went too far.' Trott is adamant that his selection here does not represent a gamble for England. 'I don't think so,' he added. 'Whenever you select someone there's an element of risk. Nobody really knows I suppose but I feel great and it feels pretty similar to when I was first picked. It's really exciting.' And he has no qualms about facing Australia and a certain Mitchell Johnson again this summer. 'I've faced them before,' he smiled.

"James McClean's reaction said it all. As Scott Carson's long, hopeful punt downfield floated harmlessly out of play, the talented winger spun in disgust, shook his head and threw open his arms. Wigan are better than this, and they know it. They were 2-1 down at that point, two moments of genius from Ross McCormack and Matt Smith the difference. They rallied to come away from Fulham with a point - it was a night in which new manager Gary Caldwell certainly saw enough to build on - but all at the club know their stay in the Championship is unlikely to be extended beyond May. It is an infuriating situation, the damage inflicted by an ultimately doomed appointment of Malky Mackay incurable this season.

Booked: Burn, Kavanagh . Scorers: McCormack 4, Smith 35 . WIGAN (4-1-4-1): Carson, Boyce (McCann 70), Maguire, Pearce, Bong, Kvist, Perch, Pennant (Murphy 84), McClean, Kim Bo-kyung, Fortune (Waghorn 57) Subs not used: Mckay, Ojo, Barnett, Al Habsi . Scorers: Pennant 22, Pearce 69 . Referee: Mick Russell . Attendance: 15,994 . Caldwell must hope he has the character to build next year if they do fail to perform the improbable and remain in this division. Seven points is now the difference, Wigan having played at least a game more than their rivals with just four games to play. Their band of supporters in one corner of Craven Cottage recognise this is not the fault of Caldwell and are actually excited about what the future may hold. No Malky, no problem. But as McClean's annoyance indicates, they are all too aware that this impending relegation should not have been allowed to happen. The frustration is that their squad is more than capable of challenging under the right guidance, but probably won't have the opportunity to do so. Wigan showed guts and dug in for Caldwell, whose more patient style in possession was referenced by the Latics' official Twitter account midway through this. It felt like a sly dig to his predecessor. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . And to come from behind twice shows qualities they just did not possess under Mackay. Caldwell, a rugged central defender, will be unhappy with the ease with which McCormack opened the scoring after just four minutes; Harry Maguire's header was a poor one, straight into the path of Sean Kavanagh, who fed the Scot and he was afforded the time to pick a spot and curl beyond Scott Carson. In a game lacking genuine chances, there were then two moments of real class. Firstly Jermaine Pennant levelled for Wigan, bending a wicked 25-yard free-kick away from the despairing Marcus Bettinelli. He ran the full length of the pitch to celebrate in front of the travelling hundreds. Wigan utility player James Perch (left) jumps for the ball and is challenged by Fulham's Sean Kavanagh (right) But anything the winger could do, lanky Smith would match. Fulham's target man - again in too much space - looked up from the same distance and marvellously clipped over Carson to net just his third goal for the club since a summer move from Leeds. Those flashes from the front two rather masked what was a disjointed display by the Cottagers, still smarting from their derby humiliation against Brentford last week. Fans were furious at Kit Symons' lack of tactical imagination, further compounded when Jason Pearce gambled at the back post to equalise for the visitors in the 69th minute. Smith had been taken off six minutes previously to a chorus of boos and chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' rained down on Symons. The same when McCormack was hooked for defender Kostas Stafylidis. Much like against Brentford, Fulham's paying customers did not shirk away from telling him exactly what they thought. These are testing times for Symons, whose relationship with the fans is at its lowest ebb since he took over earlier this season. How he must've prayed Scott Parker didn't fluff his lines in stoppage time. Compare that to Wigan who, even though they will almost definitely join Blackpool in League One, are pulling in the same direction. Their new chairman David Sharpe, grandson of Dave Whelan, spoke of a long-term vision on appointing Caldwell on Tuesday, and that is something which has galvanised the place. Had Pennant's late header not been superbly blocked by Dan Burn, the talk might have been of an unlikeliest of survival miracles.

"Arsene Wenger has challenged his squad to put any dreams of a late charge for the Barclays Premier League to bed and focus instead on the cold reality of winning at Burnley on Saturday. Arsenal head to Turf Moor in search of what would be an eighth straight league victory, following on from last weekend's 4-1 triumph over Liverpool. Despite their superb run, which has seen confidence grow after some 15 wins in the last 17 through all competitions, the title remains Chelsea's to lose, as the leaders currently hold a seven-point advantage and also a match in hand. Nacho Monreal, Theo Walcott, Hector Bellerin and Olivier Giroud appear in good spirits during training . Mesut Ozil shares a joke with Monreal at Arsenal's training HQ while Alexis Sanchez has his shorts rolled up . Santi Cazorla is set to make his 100th Premier League appearance while Abou Diaby is back from injury . While some Gunners fans may have allowed themselves a little bit of fantasy football results over the run-in, which will see Chelsea come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26 and also play both Manchester United and Liverpool, Wenger remains very much focused on the job in hand. 'I have enough experience to know that I have to live with reality and reality is points and the next game,' he said. 'The dreams are for everybody - we all have dreams at night, but when I wake up in the morning I have to come here and make sure we give everything to win the next game.' Wenger continued: 'Chelsea have a difficult schedule, we have a difficult schedule, but what we can only do is master our own schedule. 'What we want is to go as high as we can until the end of the season, give our best and we are also in the semi-final of the FA Cup. 'So we are at an important moment of the Premier League season and it is a period where you show your quality by focusing on the next game and maintain the quality. 'Of course we want to continue to progress and improve - we can learn from victory as well and everything was not perfect in our last game.' Mathieu Flamini, Ozil and Sanchez are pictured at Arsenal's London Colney base on Friday . Laurent Koscielny is put through his paces on Friday as he bids to return to full fitness . Jack Wilshere hasn't played since November but is in line to feature at Burnley on Saturday evening . Arsenal's injury problems look to have finally eased, with midfielders Mikel Arteta, Jack Wilshere and Abou Diaby all having stepped up their rehabilitation from injury, along with full-back Mathieu Debuchy. England international Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, though, continues to be hampered by an inflamed groin, while centre-half Laurent Koscielny will face a fitness test on his thigh problem ahead of Saturday's match. Burnley continue to scrap at the other end of the table, currently second bottom, but only two points from safety. With Manchester City having gone down 1-0 at Turf Moor last month and Tottenham then held to a goalless draw, Wenger is not taking the trip to Lancashire lightly. He said: 'You shouldn't look at the table because they started slowly, but recently they have played very well against all the big teams in the league and are quite efficient at home. 'You have to be at their level of physical performance, because they will be there. 'On the rest, you want to produce the quality of performance that is expected from us on the technical side, but you have first to fight with them physically, that's for sure. 'We have to make sure we produce the expected performance on the commitment, on the focus and on the quality of our game.'","Arsenal face Burnley at Turf Moor as they bid to keep pressure on Chelsea .

"The Philadelphia Office of Transportation aims to get the city's pedestrians off their phones by sending a man in bubble wrap out to spread their safety message to the people. A video from the office features characters in 'safety suits' including Bubbleman, a 'Fashionista' wrapped in the poppable material and a young man in flashing lights. The campaigners are seen talking to residents about the dangers of not looking up from one's phone, including the fact that 37 people died from being hit by cars last year. While other safety programs are directed at keeping motorists from hitting and killing pedestrians, the City of Brotherly Love's is focused on those walking around the city. Scroll down for video . A video from the Philadelphia Office of Transportation shows characters such as Bubbleman talking to residents about the dangers of phone usage while walking around the city . A character called the Fashionista (center, in bubble wrap) said 'jaywalking is the new catwalking' as part of a snarky reminder to pedestrians to be aware of their surroundings . It is aimed at 18 to 25-year-olds who the campaign says are most likely to be hit by cars while on their phones. More than 40 per cent of drivers who hit pedestrians and 30 per cent of the 1,800 pedestrians that are hit are 18 to 34, Mayor's office planner Ema Yamamoto said, according to Plan Philly. The snarky video's Safety Suiter characters say they 'can't think of any other way to not get hit by a car' besides wearing their ridiculous costumes. Another character, the Fashionista, says that 'jaywalking is the new catwalking'. A 'Tech guy' in a helmet with flashing lights on his body also gave information to residents, including that 37 pedestrians died last year . The SafetySuiters (played by different actors) are part of a campaign to drive down pedestrian deaths among young people, based around a series of slogans including 'It's road safety, not rocket science' Large signs in Philadelphia that say 'Pick Your Head Up'  are also part of the bid to end phone use, which is thought to contribute to five people being hit per day. The campaign, which has more slogans such as  'It's road safety, not rocket science' and 'jaywalking can lead to not walking', also includes signs meant for drivers on its website. One says 'Cars have bumpers, people don't'. Some have criticized the Philadelphia campaign for focuses too much on pedestrians and blaming them for getting hit by cars. Twitter user JonasMcivitas called the ads 'tone deaf'. 'Certainly everybody is responsible for paying attention to their surroundings. But a car can kill people. Drivers should be a million times more the focus of this campaign because a driver bears the responsibility for not killing people,' local planner Victoria Harris said. Some have found Philadelphia's safety slogans such as 'jaywalking can lead to notwalking' to be 'tone deaf' Some pedestrian advocates and urban planners have criticized certain safety education efforts for placing blame on those who are hit by cars. Above, a campaign in Montgomery County, Maryland . The pedestrian safety coordinator for Montgomery County said that the graphic campaign was to help humanize pedestrian victims of accidents . Yamamoto said that the new campaign was simply explaining good behavior for smartphone users, who 'need to be aware of their surroundings'. Backlash against the campaign follows a similarly controversial public education effort in Montgomery County, Maryland, outside of Washington DC. Posters with tire marks over young people's faces were seen as blaming them for their own deaths, though the pedestrian safety coordinator told WTOP that the Street Smart campaign was an attempt to humanize victims. New York City's Vision Zero campaign against accidents, which has included speed limit reductions, focuses on drivers. The metropolis saw 132 pedestrians die last year, the lowest number on record, according to the New York Times.","Road safety video stars walk streets in bizarre 'safety suit' costumes .

"Vincent Kompany has emerged as an injury doubt for the Manchester derby. City boss Manuel Pellegrini revealed that the Belgium centre-half will be assessed on Saturday, 24 hours ahead of Sunday's clash at Old Trafford.

Sergio Aguero leaps up in the air in front of Bacary Sagna to win a header during training . However, he did admit: 'We will see what happens in August.' City captain Kompany, 29 on Friday, would be a huge loss despite his patchy form this season. He played 90 minutes in Monday's 2-1 loss against Crystal Palace but picked up a hamstring injury at Selhurst Park and Pellegrini said he is doubtful for the match against Louis van Gaal's men. 'Kompany we will assess tomorrow,' he said. 'He worked the whole week the normal way. I always say the same. We are always better with Kompany but if he cannot play we have a squad.' If Kompany is deemed unfit City could be facing a defensive crisis with Dedryck Boyata also injured. That would leave Pellegrini with a pairing of the ageing Martin Demichelis and the inconsistent Eliaquim Mangala. Vincent Kompany is an injury doubt for Manchester City's clash against Manchester United on Sunday . City captain and central defender Kompany played 90 minutes as City lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace on Monday . City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists he does not fear for his job, despite his team dropping into fourth . City are in fourth place, a point behind United, after losing three of their last five Premier League matches and taking 18 points from 36 since the turn of the year. Some have speculated that Pellegrini could face the sack at the end of the season. When asked if he was worried about his future he said: 'I don't think so. I am not talking about my future because it's not important. I'm just thinking about the game against Manchester United.' However, he added: 'You never know what will happen in August. if you ask me I am not afraid because I think we are in a bad moment . 'We are not a disaster, we are not a mess. We are doing a lot of things well.' City, who will also be without strike pair Stevan Jovetic (muscle injury) and Wilfried Bony (ankle and knee), will be going for five straight derby wins for the first time in their history against third-placed United who are a point in front. But Pellegrini refused to say that they were now the biggest club in Manchester. Eliaquim Mangala (left) could be set to replace Kompany in the team to take on United on Sunday . Strikers Stevan Jovetic (left) and Wilfried Bony are already out of the Manchester derby through injury . 'I don't like to compare,' he said. 'Our target is not to compare but to improve in our project. Pellegrini added that his men were still using a certain ex-United manager as motivation. 'United dominated the league for so many years, but one time Sir Alex Ferguson said the neighbours are disturbing them a little bit more, so I say that's double motivation for us,' he said.","Vincent Kompany to be assessed 24 hours before Old Trafford clash .

"Harry Redknapp has claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his resignation as QPR manager, describing the situation as 'a bit of a soap opera'. The 68-year-old blamed knee problems for his decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers in February. However, Redknapp told BBC Sport's Football Focus there was more to his decision than health problems. Ex-QPR boss Harry Redknapp has described the club as 'like a bit of a soap opera' after quitting in February . Striker Charlie Austin celebrates after scoring in QPR's 3-3 draw with Aston Villa on Tuesday night . He said: 'I always thought I had everyone pulling with me and suddenly I felt some were and some weren't. I didn't know who was on my side at the end and who wasn't. 'Behind the scenes, I always thought there were one or two people with their own agendas. 'There was always talk about Tim Sherwood coming in. It was like a bit of a soap opera. 'QPR was in the paper every day. I've been at lots of other clubs, big clubs as well, where you didn't get that. That got on my nerves. That was the big problem for me. 'As soon as we lost a few games, it would begin. I always thought there was someone mischievous causing it. I'd never had that before at any club I'd been at. Redknapp was aware of constant talk of Tim Sherwood replacing him at Loftus Road earlier in the season . Former West Ham boss Redknapp believes he would have helped QPR avoid relegation . 'I didn't see the teams below us getting the same sort of headlines every other week. It wore me down a little bit.' Redknapp left the team second from bottom of the table and they are now two points from safety under the leadership of Chris Ramsey. However, Redknapp, who also claimed he did not fall out with chairman Tony Fernandes because of the club's lack of business in the January transfer window, added: 'I felt I'd have kept them up.'","Harry Redknapp resigned from his role as QPR manager in early February .

"Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey has revealed he will have no problem shaking John Terry’s hand in light of the racist comments the former England captain directed at former Rs defender Anton Ferdinand four years ago. Terry, who will line up against Ramsey’s side, was banned for four games and fined £220,000 for the remarks made in October 2011 during Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat at Loftus Road. But Ramsey, the Premier League’s only black manager, thinks the issue has been dealt with. ‘Ultimately, John Terry is a player of Chelsea. I am a manager of QPR. As a man, as a person, I would shake his hand,’ Ramsey said. ‘I don’t know what his feelings are towards me. As long as there wasn’t anything on the field that was unprofessional by him, I would shake his hand. Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey speaks to the media on Friday ahead of the Chelsea match . Chelsea captain John Terry controls the ball during last weekend's Premier League match against Stoke . Ramsey arrives for Friday's pre-match press conference as QPR prepare to host Chelsea at Loftus Road . ‘The whole episode for British society sat uncomfortably. It’s not something we want to highlight in football. It happened and it’s being dealt with. We have to move on. And hopefully everyone has learned something from it.’ Ramsey revealed that Rio Ferdinand, who labelled Terry an idiot for the abuse aimed at his brother, won’t be fit in time for a reunion with the Chelsea skipper this weekend. But the 52-year-old suspects his player’s one-time England colleague will be on the receiving end of a hostile welcome from the home fans on his return the scene of the unsavoury incident. 'Rio has unfortunately got an injury, he’s had a knock, and it’s recurring, he keeps trying to train,' Ramsey continued. 'He will train this morning. He’s something we miss immensely. We miss his leadership qualities on the pitch. Unfortunately, he won't be involved in the game. ‘Fans are fans, aren’t they? (Terry’s return) is a subject that brings up a lot of different emotions. So it would be odd to think that there isn’t going to be an extra feeling towards that situation.’ QPR defender Anton Ferdinand avoids shaking hands with Terry before a league match in September 2012 .

"Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale will be rested for Saturday's La Liga game at home to Eibar, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Friday, meaning the Welshman joins suspended midfielders Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez on the sidelines. Ancelotti said he had not made a final decision on who would come into his starting lineup for the game at the Bernabeu, when second-placed Real will look to close the gap on leaders Barcelona, who play at Sevilla later on Saturday, to one point. Asier Illarramendi and Isco will probably play alongside Luka Modric in midfield, with Jese joining Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema up front. Gareth Bale (centre) is being rested by Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti for the Eibar clash . The Real Madrid boss is to give young players Jese and Asier Illarramendi a game on Saturday . 'All I can say is that Illarra and Jese have a very good chance of playing,' Ancelotti told a news conference. Real at least have Ronaldo available after the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) rescinded a yellow card the Portugal forward was shown in Wednesday's 2-0 win at Rayo Vallecano which would have carried a one-match suspension. Ronaldo is the La Liga's top scorer this season with 37 goals, four ahead of Barcelona's Argentina forward Lionel Messi. Cristiano Ronaldo will play and hopes to add to his already 37 goals in La Liga, the league's highest . Karim Benzema (R) and Alvaro Arbeloa in action during a training session at Valdebebas training ground . Ancelotti said Ronaldo's Portugal team mate Pepe, a centre back, would be available both for Saturday and Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at Atletico Madrid after a short injury layoff. Germany midfielder Sami Khedira and Portugal left back Fabio Coentrao have back and knee problems respectively and will not be in the squad for the Eibar game. The modest Basque club are playing in Spain's top flight for the first time this season but a recent poor run has left them in 14th with eight games left, in danger of dropping straight back down to the second division. Pepe (centre) is back in contention for Real's clash with Eibar and Atletico Madrid to play after an injury .

"Arsenal are the form team in Europe at present, winning 10 games out of their last 11, including seven in a row. Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley . Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track . For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track . Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture. Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina selected a rap song from his home country - J Balvin's 'Tranquila' Theo Walcott opted for a 1996 summer jam - LL Cool J's laid back R&B song 'Loungin''","Arsenal face Burnley in evening fixture at Turf Moor on Saturday .

"Chelsea captain John Terry has revealed his picks for the PFA Player and Team of the Year with Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho getting his nod as the Premier League's finest. Although the former England captain has not been on the losing side to Liverpool in three games this season, Terry has obviously been impressed by the young Brazilian's skills - despite him only scoring four league goals. Less surprising is Terry's choice of Tottenham scoring sensation Harry Kane as Young Player of the Year- with the 21-year-old's rise from obscurity to scoring 19 league goals for Spurs making him almost certain to  take home the award. Chelsea captain John Terry revealed his PFA Team of the Year on Instagram . The Blues legend named Phillipe Coutinho as his Player of the Year and Harry Kane as his Young Player . Liverpool's Brazilian playmaker, scoring the winner in the FA Cup, has hit form in second half of the season . Keeper: David de Gea . Defenders: Ryan Bertrand, Jose Fonte, Laurent Koscielny, Nathanial Clyne . Midfielders: Philippe Coutinho, Raheem Sterling, Juan Mata, Sadio mane . Strikers: Harry Kane, Sergio Aguero . As a defender, Terry has acknowledged Southampton's miserly record this season by including no less than three of their backline - Jose Fonte, Nathaniel Clyne and former Chelsea full-back Ryan Bertrand who left Stamford Bridge for St Mary's in the summer. Manchester United's outstanding keeper David de Gea and Arsenal centre-back Laurent Koscielny complete Terry's defence. In midfield, Coutinho is joined by Raheem Sterling, Sadio Mane and another player former Blue Juan Mata who has endured a difficult time under Louis van Gaal before making his mark at Old Trafford. Despite not finding the net in his last five league games, Sergio Aguero takes his place alongside Kane in Terry's attack in a classic 'big man/small man' combination. Kane has scored 19 league goals, although he was mistakenly named best player by Youssouf Mulumbu . Former Chelsea stars Juan Mata (left) and Ryan Bertrand (right) were also named in Terry's XI . Meanwhile, West Brom midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu was left red-faced after posting his own PFA Team of the Year selections on Twitter - only to realise he had got his Players of the Year mixed up.

"Diego Costa will miss four weeks with a hamstring injury, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has confirmed. The Spain striker aggravated a hamstring problem in last weekend's win over Stoke. Costa was already certain to miss the games against Queens Park Rangers and Manchester United but had hoped to return in time for the clash against Arsenal on April 26. Diego Costa (centre) has been ruled out for up to the next four weeks after injuring his hamstring vs Stoke . Costa limped off just 11 minutes into his return from injury in Chelsea's 2-1 win over Stoke City on Saturday . The 26-year-old (right) lays on the Stamford Bridge turf in a heap after damaging his hamstring again . But Mourinho says Costa will be fit enough to face the final four games of the season, starting with the clash against Crystal Palace on May 3. 'Only Diego is injured, everybody else is fine and ready,' Mourinho said during the club's pre-match press conference on Friday. '[John Obi] Mikel is ready. [Cesc] Fabregas with a mask, but ready too. No problems. 'We have eight matches to play, if he [Costa] plays four it's normal,' Mourinho said. 'If he plays three it's a little bit below what I'm expecting. If he plays five it's more than I'm expecting.' Costa has a history of hamstring problems but Mourinho is refusing to let his focus shift from Sunday's game at Loftus Road. Asked whether he was concerned about the former Atletico Madrid forward's latest injury, the Chelsea boss said: 'Not concerned. I'm concerned about the match on Sunday.

"Chelsea are on course to becoming the most dominant title-winners in Premier League history as they prepare to break the record of most days at the summit of the table in a single season. Jose Mourinho's side have led the way since beating Everton 6-3 at Goodison Park on August 30, after Tottenham had led the table following the first two rounds of games. The Blues have  been top for  230 days as of Friday April 10, although they did share the lead with Manchester City for nine days in January after a statistical quirk saw the two sides exactly level on points, goal difference and goals scored.

Man Utd 2012/13 -191 . *current campaign . The current record for days at the top belongs to Manchester United, when Sir Alex Ferguson's side led the way for 262 days during the 1993/94 season. But Chelsea can beat that record by 12 days should they stay top between now and the end of the season. Chelsea came close under Mourinho in 2005/06 when they topped the table for 257 days, while Man Utd were at the summit for 250 and 241 days in 2006/07 and 2000/01 respectively. The only side in the top 10 of the list that didn't go on to win the title were Newcastle, who led the way for 212 days in 1995/96 before famously imploding under Kevin Keegan. Chelsea currently lead the Premier League table by seven points, with a game in hand on the rest of their title rivals. Their next three games could prove defining as they prepare to face local rivals QPR at Loftus Road, Manchester United at home and second-placed Arsenal away.

"Niki Lauda’s red cap stood out like a beacon on the dull, grey tarmac of the biggest, most soulless paddock in all Formula One. The three-time world champion is colourful, candid and carefree. When your face is the charred remains of having nearly burned to death at the wheel of a Ferrari, why not throw caution to the wind or, in Shanghai’s case, the smog? Lauda, now chairman of Mercedes F1, aimed his first verbal grenade at his driver Nico Rosberg, who moments earlier had stood in front of him rotating his shoulders and about to play keepie-uppie to warm up for Friday's second practice session for the Chinese Grand Prix. Niki Lauda aimed a first verbal grenade at his driver Nico Rosberg ahead of the race in Shanghai . Mercedes AMG Petronas driver Rosberg is pushed back into his garage during the second practice session . Rosberg ended that session, as he did the first, behind Lewis Hamilton (below), his in-the-groove world champion team-mate who also markedly outperformed the German in the first two races, in Australia and Malaysia. Of course, not long after these words reach your breakfast tables in the shires, Rosberg may buck up and take pole, but it would be something of a surprise, not least to Lauda, if he did. ‘Yes, Nico is definitely a little bit behind Lewis,’ said the Austrian. ‘He has to sort himself out. It is not anything I can talk to him about. I don’t know why — he is not driving as well as he was. He will know what he has to do, and he must do it himself.’ Rosberg  looks on in the paddock after practice for the Chinese Formula One Grand Prix in Shanghai . Rosberg  drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit . Rosberg is supremely professional. There is no lack of effort on his part. It is more that his confidence seems to have been shaken, whereas it was so strong in the early and mid parts of last season. Then Hamilton put down the hammer, changing the dynamic for both men. At least Rosberg is not the watching neutral’s only hope of a contest breaking out this season, after Ferrari shocked everyone by winning a fortnight ago. Nobody was ever more pleased to see Sebastian Vettel wagging his finger in celebration than fans whose own digits were poised over the television remotes’ off-switches, so jaundiced were they by the prospect of Mercedes’ seemingly endless hegemony.

Rosberg drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit . As Bernie Ecclestone joked, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff could have the legend, ‘The man who killed Formula One’, engraved on his tombstone. Lauda, a long-time friend of Ecclestone, has no time for sentiment. ‘Even if Ferrari winning makes Bernie happy, I will still be upset,’ he said. ‘The priority for me and Toto and Paddy (Lowe, the technical director) is to try to win every bloody race. It is our mission. Sebastian Vettel  looks on from the team garage during practice for the China Formula One Grand Prix . Vettel  drives during practice for the Formula One Grand Prix of China at Shanghai International Circuit . ‘I don’t care about the politics or what is good for Vettel or Ferrari. It is not my responsibility to make the sport more interesting. My worry for us is that Ferrari won so early in the season. ‘That gives them a lot of momentum. For an Italian team, momentum can be very important. ‘The Italians are emotional and it works best for them when they have a blend of English, Germans and Italians. They have that now (James Allison, a British engineer is their technical director). Vettel is a four-time world champion and so is someone to look up to. They have a combination of everything.’ Most observers thought Ferrari’s win in Malaysia might be a one-off created by the absurdly hot weather. But the evidence from practice is that the Scuderia may also be contenders in the considerably cooler Shanghai climate. Even though they appear not to be as quick over one lap, they look strong, possibly stronger than Mercedes, on a long run. Ferrari's German driver Vettel is pushed back to his garage after stopping at the pit lane exit in Shanghai .

"Gary Neville has claimed a star player will always choose Manchester City last if they have a straight choice between the big clubs in the Premier League. The former Manchester United defender believes his former club, Chelsea and Arsenal would be a preferable option now for a big star looking to switch to the Premier League. Neville wrote in his Telegraph column that should a player such as Paul Pogba or Mats Hummels decide on a move to England, they are unlikely to select the Etihad as their destination - now that Manuel Pellegrini's side have been reined in by Financial Fair Play. Gary Neville believes Manchester City would now struggle to attract top players thanks to financial restrictions . Players such as Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels (left) and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba would prefer to go to one of Manchester City's Premier League rivals, according to Neville . Neville believes Manchester City need to be bold and take on UEFA's FFP regulations . 'Unless City are bold and decide to take on Uefa’s Financial Fair Play regulations, they will find it difficult to compete with United, Chelsea and Arsenal for the players I believe could make the difference in next season’s title race,' said Neville. 'If any of the top four is able to add Gareth Bale, Morgan Schneiderlin and/or Paul Pogba and Mats Hummels to their squad this summer, they would instantly become front-runners to win the Premier League next year. 'There will be an intense fight between all of the top four clubs to secure the best players, but if that battle takes place on an even playing field, I don’t see how City can come out on top. 'The landscape has changed since City were able to blow everybody out of the water by paying big fees and big wages to sign the likes of Carlos Tevez, Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri.'

'When United were faced with the Doomsday scenario of being out of the Champions League last summer, they had to blitz the market to sign the likes of Angel di Maria, simply because they had to throw money at the problem they found themselves in.

"Louis van Gaal's bold recruitment drive appears to be gathering momentum after it emerged that Ilkay Gundogan expects to complete a £15million move to Old Trafford at the end of the season. Despite already re-shaping Manchester United's fortunes and guiding them to third in the Barclays Premier League, ahead of the derby with City, Van Gaal is pressing ahead with plans for more big name signings this summer. Sportsmail revealed last week that Germany centre Mats Hummels has indicated he's finally ready to become a United player, and it now seems it will be as part of a £50m-plus Borussia Dortmund double after Gundogan also gave Van Gaal the go-ahead to bid for his services. Ilkay Gundogan (right) anchors Dortmund's midfield and could be brought in to protect United's defence . Mats Hummels (left) looks likely to join Manchester United this summer to strengthen their porous rearguard . Hummels and Gundogan are likely to be lining up in red for United next year if Van Gaal gets his way . United are believed to have responded to the signal from the Germany midfielder and are confident of agreeing a fee with Dortmund. Both players have been on United's radar for some time, and both have privately let it be known they feel the time has arrived for a fresh start. Dortmund bosses are resigned to Gundogan following Hummels out of the door after the midfield anchorman flatly refused to renew a £100,000-a-week contract that runs out next year and evidently made little secret of his wish to join United. At the age of 26, Hummels (right) has made 39 appearances for Germany and won the World Cup last year . Van Gaal is set to be handed a £150m transfer kitty to further strengthen United in his second year at the club . A powerful figure at the base of Dortmund's midfield, Gundogan might normally have cost a sizeable chunk of Van Gaal's £150m summer budget but could be prised away for as little as £15m, given the time left on his contract. Dortmund will ask for around £36m for Hummels.","Gundogan expects to complete a £15m move to Old Trafford in summer .

"Going to any major sporting event these days is a pricey affair. There’s the cost of the ticket, getting to the venue and the all important souvenirs. That’s not to mention keeping fed and watered all day. But it seems patrons at the Masters can get themselves a decent meal for a reasonable price. You can get a taste of the south with a Bar-B-Que or Classic Chicken sandwich for $3 — which is about £2.05. The Masters is one few sporting events which offers food at reasonable prices for its punters . Shot of the day . Lee Westwood nearly got off to the perfect start with a stunning shot at the par-five second. After a perfect tee shot, he pinged a fairway wood 280 yards onto the green. It trickled towards the hole and looked to be heading in for an albatross, but it lipped out at the last moment. It was a high point for Westwood, though, who then made five bogeys in his next nine holes. New practice routine Padraig? Padraig Harrington has enjoyed a resurgence of form in recent months and the secret of his success could be down to his unusual practice technique. The Irishman was spotted on the driving range at Augusta with a rubber band wrapped around his knees and standing well away from the ball (1). He then takes a run-up at the ball (2), not dissimilar to that of Happy Gilmore — a character from a comedy film whose own run-up technique would see him regularly drive the ball more than 400 yards. Harrington’s might not travel quite as far, but the drill obviously helps him keep his form and balance nicely (3). Gary's still a player . At 79, and with a career grand slam behind him, you might forgive Gary Player for putting his feet up. But the South African is fit as a flea. After joining Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer as an honorary starter, he tweeted: . Time for a Texas takeover?

"Jose Mourinho insists Eden Hazard is in a one-horse race to scoop the player of the season award. The Chelsea forward has been outstanding this season and will be a leading contender to claim both the PFA and Football Writers' awards next month. The Belgian will face stiff competition, namely from Tottenham's Harry Kane, but Mourinho claims anyone who tips a player other than Hazard is merely making mischief.

Mourinho insists that Hazard will be able to fend off competition from the likes of Spurs' Harry Kane (centre) 'It shouldn't even be a debate,' said Mourinho. 'If somebody throws other names on the table, it's because he wants to sell papers, get more clicks or throw some sand into people's eyes, because this player is by far the best player in the season.' Hazard is likely to feature at Queens Park Rangers on Saturday but Diego Costa will miss four weeks after aggravating a hamstring injury against Burnley last weekend. It means the striker will miss clashes with Manchester United and Arsenal. Mourinho is prepared to risk the availability of Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic — both one booking away from a two-match ban — for the matches against Chelsea's rivals, saying: 'We try not to get a yellow card during the match, to play football. We know (the risks), but the game is a three-point game.' Meanwhile, Chelsea defender Wallace — on loan at Vitesse Arnhem — has been arrested on suspicion of an offence in a nightclub. The Dutch club refused to comment on the nature of the alleged offence, but a police spokesman was quoted by local media stating it was 'sexual'. Wallace was later released without charge.

"How good to welcome Padraig Harrington back to Augusta after a year’s absence, complete with his weird and wonderful practice-ground routines.

METH ON THE RISE . Headline writers everywhere will be keeping fingers crossed that golf continues to prove an addiction for the highly rated US Public Links champion Byron Meth, who opened with a 74 on his Masters debut. As for the golfing scribes, we’re just waiting for the blessed day when he meets a lovely girl called Crystal. Byron Meth makes a chip shot on the second hole as the American amateur continues to impress at Augusta . PAR FOUR PROBLEMS . The stats from a brilliant day one made fascinating reading. The par fives are the scoring holes and lived up to their billing since all of them had a scoring average under the regulation mark. The par fours, though, are where you hang on. Half had a scoring average of 4.2 or higher, with the 11th yielding just three birdies all day. TAKING POETIC LICENSE .

"Justin Rose might just have made the most important pencil mark of his entire career to put himself in contention at Augusta this weekend. The 2013 US Open champion ended the day on seven under, sharing third place and is one of a handful of players hanging on to the coat tails of runaway leader Jordan Spieth. But it took a neat bit of psychology to rescue his round after a disastrous start as he tried to build on his opening-day 67. Rose bogeyed three of the first four holes, finding himself playing from the trees as he recovered from wayward tee shots. And that was where the magic pencil line came to his rescue. He revealed: ‘I was feeling really uncomfortable with my game, so I drew a line on my scorecard at that point, like you draw a line in the sand. Justin Rose battled back from a nightmare start and is in contention at Augusta . Rose tees off at the 18th as he now sits joint third, seven shots behind runaway leader Jordan Spieth . Rose flips his club after hitting from a trap on the 13th during a decent round for the Englishman . ‘I told myself to move on and take one shot at a time. I made a great birdie at the 5th and that rallied me, and after that I played with the same rhythm as the first day.’ The dramatic transformation was then followed by a spectacular back nine with birdies at both par threes, putting tee shots to within a few feet of the hole both times. And 34-year-old Rose believes the change of fortune can continue into the weekend. He said: ‘I’m starting seven back and Jordan has played beautifully so far, but we all know a lot can happen. There’s magic out there on this course and it’s up to me to make something special happen.’ Maybe Ian Poulter could borrow Rose’s pencil after a disappointing day in which his putter couldn’t get going. He was par for the round after bogeying the 18th and sits at one over for the tournament. He said on Twitter: ‘Really disappointed. It’s simply unacceptable and disgraceful putting — 34 putts for level par is pathetic.’ Earlier, 19-year-old Scot Bradley Neil had a tough day, shooting a 79 and finishing 13 over. He has ben tipped for big things by Rory McILroy but admitted: ‘I’d prepared well for this, but it shows my game is not good enough yet,’ he admitted. ‘I need to work hard on it if I want to get back here.’","Rose put himself in contention, ending the second day on seven under .

"Kevin Pietersen is being urged to make the England selectors' lives difficult after his barnstorming start to the summer. England's exiled record run-scorer made 170 off 149 balls against MCC Universities Oxford at The Parks on Sunday, at the start of Surrey's three-day fixture. Former England captains Alec Stewart, Pietersen's boss as Surrey director of cricket, and Nasser Hussain have since both had their say on the 34-year-old's chances of a return to the Test arena. Kevin Pietersen in action for Surrey on day two of the three-day match against Oxford MCCU . Pietersen (centre) pictured with his Surrey team-mates at The Parks on Monday . Stewart is hoping Pietersen can further his quest when Surrey face Glamorgan in their first LV= County Championship fixture next week - while Hussain insists England's selectors need to clarify with a 'very public decision' once and for all whether the controversial South Africa-born batsman has any prospects of playing for his adopted country again. Pietersen's impressive return to long-form cricket 14 months after his England sacking was timely, on the eve of the first Test against the West Indies which began 4,000 miles away in Antigua on Monday. Stewart said: 'Anyone who scores runs will ask questions of the selectors. 'Kevin shouldn't look any further than the next innings, whether it's here or down at Cardiff. 'If he strings hundreds together - and the reason we signed him is because we want him to score hundreds, double-hundreds, help us win games and be successful - it will be interesting to see where it may lead to. 'No one has got any idea whether Kevin Pietersen will play for England again. 'The only people that know that are those who are currently picking the England side. 'At the moment he's not being considered, because he hasn't played red ball cricket for the last 14 months.' Pietersen chills out against the fence as Oxford MCCU bat on Monday . Alec Stewart (right) believes that Pietersen could make it difficult for the England selectors . Hussain is impressed that Pietersen has already proved he is serious about a recall, and he is adamant the England and Wales Cricket Board must 'watch out' for him. 'He could easily go off and get his IPL contract and play over there,' Hussain said on Sky Sports 2. 'He's decided to give it another go... people say 'Oh, 170 against Oxford - it was only Oxford'. 'But as a player who has played 100 Test matches to turn up at The Parks and smash 170 shows how determined he is - so I'd watch out, if I was a selector.' Hussain senses Pietersen will not be easily deterred, unless England spell out that they do not want him. 'This is not a lad that's going to go away, and the ECB need to make a decision on Kevin Pietersen - make a very public decision on him, whether he is available for selection or not,' he said. 'I know the chairman elect, Colin Graves, has said that he is. 'But it needs to come from the selectors.' Pietersen believes last week's departure of Paul Downton - the ECB managing director who described him as 'disengaged' - has offered him an England 'lifeline' even as he approaches the veteran stage of his record-breaking career. Stewart, who played for England until the age of 40, added: 'Whether you're 18 or 38, if you're good enough, then I believe you take the age factor out of the occasion. 'If you're performing, surely you've got to be warranting a place in the team.' Pietersen made 170 runs off 149 balls during his stint with the bat in Oxford on Sunday . Pietersen fielding on Monday afternoon as the 34-year-old makes his county cricket return . He hopes Pietersen can boost Surrey's championship promotion prospects, and was encouraged by his comeback. 'It was a very good innings,' Stewart added. 'He had to get used to playing red ball cricket again - lining it up, letting it go - and then he showed what a quality batsman he is, which we all know but we just haven't seen it because he's only played 20-over cricket. 'We've signed Kevin because he's a top-class player. 'Will he play for England? We don't know. All we're going to do is enjoy having Kevin around, scoring as many runs as he can. 'Next game, next innings, is the next most important one.' Pietersen had a quieter second day back in his whites. He fielded at mid-off and slip as Surrey's hosts dug in after resuming on 28 for four. Jack McIver top-scored with 83, hitting 11 fours and a six, in the students' 224 all out. Chris Tremlett, another England Test player, took five for 30. Surrey reshuffled their batting order in the second innings, and Pietersen was left to watch on as they reached 182 for three - Zafar Ansari making 53 towards a lead of 378 entering Tuesday's final day.","Kevin Pietersen made 170 runs of 149 balls for Surrey in Oxford on Sunday .

It was at this very venue that Blackpool boss Lee Clark pulled off a great escape on the final day of last season at the helm of Birmingham, who scored in the third minute of stoppage time to prevent relegation into the third tier, but this time he was on the wrong end of some late drama. In recent weeks Clark had publicly accepted the Seasiders, who remain 16 points from safety, were doomed but Rotherham's defeat to Blues 24 hours earlier meant they kicked off knowing they would not be relegated at the Macron Stadium. That may have instilled a freedom to Clark's troops and the home crowd were stunned into silence by Jacobs' early opener. He collected a long, direct ball down the right, turned on the afterburners to accelerate away from Josh Vela and Paddy McCarthy and lashed beyond Ben Amos in the Bolton goal. Things could have been worse for the shell-shocked hosts too as Peter Clarke headed straight at Amos and an unmarked Andrea Orlandi glanced over from six yards. Clark's men continued to ask questions, with Jose Miguel Cubero's rising effort deflected narrowly away from the top corner of Amos' net. Bolton Wanderers' Josh Vela and Blackpool's Jamie O'Hara (right) vie for the ball . Tangerines stopper Joe Lewis made a couple of smart stops to deny winger Liam Feeney and centre-back McCarthy but there was a malaise about Bolton's play which Neil Lennon had been so keen to avoid pre-match. In the second half, Amos failed to clear a corner and Clarke leant back and skewed his effort over the top before Jacobs cut in from the left flank and bent a brilliant effort just wide. Lewis had been largely untroubled apart from a routine save from Tom Walker but he was stranded at the other end of his goal when Adam Le Fondre cut the ball across for an onrushing Barry Bannan, who somehow placed his side-footed strike against the outside of the post. Lennon had started with just one striker but introduced three off the bench by bringing on Heskey, Craig Davies and Gudjohnsen. The hosts' chance looked to have gone when Lewis stopped McCarthy's header and O'Hara scrambled Mills' try off the line but there was still time for a dramatic finale. Heskey looked certain to nod Bannan's back-post cross in but when he could not connect, the ball came back out to Danns, whose volley was helped in by Gudjohnsen on the line, with Blackpool fuming about an offside flag which never came.","Substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen scores equaliser for Bolton in stoppage time .

"Oxford women made history on Saturday with a 12th boat race victory in 16 years on a landmark day for the sport. For the first time in 88 years the women’s race was staged on the famous Tideway course that for so long had been the sole preserve of the men. Hot favourites Oxford romped to victory by six and a half lengths against Cambridge, as the women struck a telling blow for sporting equality in racing the same championship course on the same day as the men. Ansastaia Chitty lifts the trophy aloft after Oxford won the boat race, easing past Cambridge on the Thames . On the day the Oxford sides shared the race route for the first time, they also shared the exact same winning margin, with the men going on to triumph in their race shortly afterwards. Oxford women’s president Anastasia Chitty hailed the victory as a special moment for her crew, but also for rowing and sporting equality overall. ‘It’s an amazing moment,’ Chitty told BBC Sport. ‘To pull something off like that is amazing. ‘To row on the same stage as the men, there were so many women before us who have never had this opportunity and it’s extremely humbling. We started moving away early on and kept ourselves ahead.’ The Oxford crew celebrate their win over Cambridge after dominating the race from start to finish . As the most decorated Olympic athlete ever to race in either boat race, Oxford stroke Caryn Davies underlined the quality on display in the women’s contest. The 32-year-old US Olympics team star boasts silver at Athens and gold medals at Beijing and London in the women’s eight — and now a boat race victory to boot. ‘I think that’s harder, I’ve got to be honest,’ Davies told BBC Sport when asked how the boat race compared to Olympic competition. The Oxford women's crew power to their win in the first women's boat race on the river Thames . ‘There was almost three times as long to suffer. But there’s always less suffering when you win! I’m just proud and honoured to have such attention. It shows how excited people are and I’m so glad we can be role models to young women everywhere.’ Oxford women finished in 19 minutes 45 seconds — 19 seconds ahead of Cambridge. Davies added: ‘I could just hear so many people cheering along the banks and it didn’t matter it they were cheering for Oxford or Cambridge. Just that they turned out was really great for us.’ After Oxford’s women breezed to victory, their male counterparts made it a Dark Blue double with victory in the 161st men’s race by an identical six and a half lengths. President Constantine Louloudis claimed a fourth and final boat race victory, completing a clean sweep only interrupted by claiming bronze with Team GB’s men’s eight at London 2012. The dark blues made a fast start and dominated the race against their Cambridge counterparts . Louloudis hailed the victory — Oxford’s 11th in the last 15 years — and admitted he felt far more pressure than before, despite his three previous wins. ‘I felt much more pressure this year, especially as I was leaving the guys,’ Louloudis told BBC Sport. ‘There were some pretty dark moments going in but I’m so pleased for the guys. We just stuck to our plan and executed a great race. ‘This was a fantastic performance. It is a relief to win as we were firm favourites. ‘Rio remains the long-term goal but this race was so important for me and all of us.’ They were true to form, surging ahead from the start. Despite being quickly pegged back, they powered ahead during the middle section to dominate the race, finishing in 17 minutes 34 seconds — winning by 19 seconds as Oxford’s women had before them. Crew member Michael DiSanto added: ‘We knew what we needed to do and we wanted to go down as one of the best Oxford crews ever.’ Louloudis lauded the achievements of the women’s boat on such a landmark occasion. ‘This was an historic day and there is no reason not to be optimistic for the sport going forward,’ he said. The Cambridge crew kept going to the end but they were outclassed, eventually losing by over six lengths .","Oxford won their 12th women's boat race in 16 years .

"Glowing tributes were paid yesterday to cricketing legend Richie Benaud, after his death at 84 from skin cancer. At Lord’s, MCC flags were lowered, and the Australian government offered a state funeral for the man who never lost a Test series as his country’s captain, then became a commentator. David Cameron said he had ‘grown up listening to Richie Benaud’s wonderful cricket commentary’, while his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott called it ‘a sad day for Australia’. Retiring as a player in 1964, Benaud’s masterful analysis was universally revered. Here, we reproduce a tribute paid by the Mail’s brilliant sports columnist IAN WOOLDRIDGE — which he wrote in 2005 after coverage of live international cricket in England switched from terrestrial to satellite TV, depriving cricket fans of Benaud’s voice . . . Richie Benaud in the commentary box at the Oval for the final test of the 2005 Ashes. Thereafter international cricket fans in England lost his genius when live game switched from terrestrial to satellite TV . So it is farewell, then, to the Master of Measured Words. Richie Benaud will not be returning to England next summer to sustain his pre-eminence as cricket’s finest commentator. That is not merely my judgment. A recent poll by The Wisden Cricketer magazine attracted an astonishing 12,000 votes. Precisely 10,128 of them nominated Benaud as the best. Fortunately, he does not leave us without a word or several of advice to those who seek to emulate his success, particularly retired players whose agents deem them instantly equipped to pick up a microphone and irritate us with an effluent of Tower of Babel verbiage. He does so in a valedictory book which is an encyclopaedia of broadcasting wisdom. He names no names. He is too polite for that. Nor is there a hint of the tetchiness that occasionally afflicts icons in their pensionable years. At 74, Benaud is still as fit as a flea, the result of a lifestyle as measured as his commentating. Yes, there are rare occasions when he will let down his hair with the rest of us, but when serious business is afoot he will rise from an increasingly raucous dinner party, check his watch that it is exactly 10pm and announce: ‘Thank you very much. We’re off.’ At sunrise next morning, he and Daphne, his elegant and unfailingly supportive English wife, will be striding out on their three-mile constitutional. Benaud representing Australia in 1961. He led his country as captain in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series . He is meticulous in all things. On TV commentary days, even Daphne is not allowed to iron his shirts. He presses them himself. He is a food faddist, preparing his Test match lunch boxes at home to be certain of what he is eating. Once, he took a week-long course in Italy to learn how to cook pasta to perfection. His desks at his homes in London, South of France and Sydney are polished plateaux of precision, his reference-book shelves indexed for instant reach. It is this unrelenting self-discipline, instilled by a schoolmaster and great club cricketer father and a lovely mother — there is a gorgeous picture of her celebrating her 100th birthday with Richie and his Test cricketer brother John in the book — that launched him into his dual career life. The first, of course, was in cricket, where to haul oneself from school, to club, to State, the Australian team and then its captaincy was a classic climb. Benaud led his country in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series. Such was his cunning as a wrist-spinner that his batsmanship was often overlooked. In fact, he became the first, in an era when far fewer Tests were played, to scale the double of 200 wickets and 2,000 runs. But what next? All of seven years before he retired from cricket, Benaud wondered if there could be a distant future in the communication industry. There was little doubt about that since he had been a young crime reporter on a Sydney newspaper, where sub-editors ruthlessly deleted from his copy any flowery phrases which he thought rather good but were irrelevant to the story. It was an important lesson. Then a curious opportunity, which couldn’t happen in today’s schedules, presented itself. At the end of Australia’s 1956 tour to England, all their players were given three weeks off to enjoy such fleshpots of relaxation as they could discover in the British Isles. Australian captain Richie Benaud takes on the MCC in the first innings at Brisbane on December 5, 1958 . Benaud proceeded otherwise. At his own expense he moved from the Kensington Palace Hotel into a cramped lower ground room in the RAC club in Pall Mall and took a BBC television training course, alongside directors, commentators, even audiences, to learn how television worked. He trailed Peter O’Sullevan at Newbury and he studied the commentating techniques of Henry Longhurst on golf and Dan Maskell on tennis. All three had their idiosyncrasies, but one thing they had in common. O’Sullevan, voice rising to overdrive at the climax of a horse race, was circumspect about collateral chatter, just as Longhurst and ‘Oh I say’ Maskell knew the value of golden silence. Indeed, one of Longhurst’s silences was so long that his director asked over the private intercom: ‘Excuse me, Henry, but are you still alive?’ Benaud now says: ‘I didn’t know if I had a future in broadcasting. If I hadn’t done that BBC course my life would have been very different, even though I had to wait for seven years for my chance. ‘The key feature it taught me was the economy of words. Never insult the viewers by telling them what they have seen perfectly clearly themselves. Only add to it if you had something pertinent to say.’ Benaud rings the bell on the pavilion balcony on the second day of the second test between England and Australia at Lord's during the 2009 Ashes . These days if only. Has he ever made a bloomer? Of course, like all of us, he has. On one celebrated occasion, handing over from a Test match for a news update from Moira Stuart, he called her Moira Shearer, the celebrated ballerina who had starred in an acclaimed film. When Moira Stuart handed back he said: ‘Thanks, Moira, our newsreader wearing Red Shoes.’ Many, who had not heard his initial blunder, wondered what on earth he was on about. ‘At the time,’ he recalls, ‘I thought it was a pretty clever remark, but many tuning in at that moment had no idea what it meant. It taught me never to be such a smart-arse again.’ Laconic, economic, massively instructive and with a dry impartial wit about whoever is getting the upper hand in a Test match, I wonder if we shall ever hear his like again on television? Many are called and surprisingly many are given the opportunity behind the microphone. Very few have served the slogging apprenticeship that makes a master cricket commentator.","International cricket fans in England lost legend's voice after 2005 Ashes .

"Alec Stewart is intrigued to hear more about the newly-created role of England cricket director. The Surrey director of cricket insisted his focus is on his role at The Oval and he is yet to speak to anyone at the England and Wales Cricket Board about the position, which is to be introduced following the departure of Paul Downton as managing director. Stewart's fellow former England captains Andrew Strauss and Michael Vaughan have also been linked to the job. Alec Stewart admitted he has had no contact with the ECB over the  role of England cricket director . The England head coach, Peter Moores, would report to the cricket director, but Stewart is among the potential candidates awaiting full clarity of the responsibilities of the position. Vaughan and Strauss, too, have expressed a wish to learn the details of the job specification, which could come when incoming chairman Colin Graves starts work next month alongside new chief executive Tom Harrison. 'Until anyone sees the job spec - whether it's Vaughan, myself, Straussy, whoever it may be - you can't comment,' Stewart told Press Association. Stewart, who played 133 Tests and 170 ODIs for England, is in the frame to replace the axed Paul Downton . 'All I've said is I've done everything that's ever been asked of me as an England player and if England thought that I would be the right type of person for that role, whatever that role may be, then you'd be stupid not to look at it. 'I'm under contract here. (The) ECB would have to seek permission to speak to me via Surrey. 'This is a great job that I'm thoroughly enjoying here. I seriously think we're going to be going places over the next few years. That's what I'm concentrating on. Michael Vaughan is also among the leading candidates to take up the newly-created role with England . 'I can't underestimate what a great job this is. But you always want to be aware of other things that are going on.' Asked if he had had any informal or preliminary discussions with the ECB hierarchy, Stewart added: 'None whatsoever. My focus is very much here and if somebody from the ECB rings me I'll take their phone call or meet them, but that hasn't happened.'","Alec Stewart would like to hear more about the England team vacancy .

"Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Arsenal's Santi Cazorla are set to reach a Premier League milestone this weekend when they each make their 100th appearance. Both players have been hugely influential since they moved to London in the summer of 2012, but who has been the most exciting import to watch? Here, Sportsmail's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action. Eden Hazard (L) and Santi Cazorla are both set to make their 100th Premier League appearance this weekend . Lee Clayton . Cazorla has wonderful balance. So does Hazard. Cazorla scores important goals. So does Hazard. Cazorla is two-footed. So is Hazard. Cazorla dances past opponents. So does Hazard. So, while there is not a lot to choose between them and Hazard is likely to get the most picks in this article, I am going for Cazorla. It's a personal choice. He is a wonderful footballer. I have paid to watch them both (and I will pay to watch them both again), but the little Spanish magician edges it for me. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla, pictured in action against Burnley, has been an influential part of Arsenal's midfield this season . Ian Ladyman . I remember when Manchester City baulked at paying Hazard's wages when the Belgian was up for grabs in 2012. Back then City thought the young forward had a rather high opinion of his own worth for a player who was yet to play in a major European league. In the early days of his time at Chelsea, it looked as though City may have been right. He showed flashes of brilliance but also looked rather too easy to push off the ball. Roll forward to 2015, however, and the 24-year-old has developed in to one of the most important players in the Barclays Premier League. Brave, strong and ambitious, Hazard plays on the front foot and with only one thought in this mind. Rather like Cristiano Ronaldo, he has also developed in to the type of player ever defender hates, simply because he gets back up every time he is knocked to the ground. He would get in every team in the Premier League and is one of the reasons Chelsea will win the title this season. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge . Dominic King . It has to be Hazard. I saw him play for Lille twice in the season before he joined Chelsea – once against St Etienne, the other was what proved to be his final appearance against Nancy. He scored two in the first match, a hat-trick the latter and played a different game to those around him. He hasn't disappointed since arriving here and I love the nonchalance with which he takes a penalty, his low centre of gravity and the way he can bamboozle defenders. If there is such a thing as £32million bargain, it is Hazard. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March . Nick Harris . Now this is a tricky one because while Eden Hazard will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation, he'll also miss a penalty and make you groan. Whereas the older Cazorla, less flashy but no less of a technical master, is to my mind more of a fulcrum, more important relatively to the sum of Arsenal's parts than Hazard is to Chelsea. You'll gasp at Hazard but Cazorla's wow factor is richer. That's not to dismiss either: both are brilliant footballers, contributing goals, assists and flair. Any neutral would bite your hand off to have either playing in your team. Forced to pick though, it's Cazorla, for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games. Exhibit A would be Manchester City 0 Arsenal 2 in January; goal, assist, all-round brilliance, against a big team, at an important time. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla scores from the penalty spot in Arsena's 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January . Riath Al-Samarrai . Eden Hazard for me. Cazorla is an utter delight, a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two-footed player I've seen. Put him in a tight space and then you see what makes him rare among the best. But Hazard is the top player in the Premier League, in my opinion. This is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals (36 in 99 in the Premier League for Chelsea). He can beat a man and, better still, you sense he likes doing it. Technically, his passing and shooting are excellent and he also has a mind capable of sussing out the shapes and systems in front of him. That intelligence, more specifically his speed of thought, is probably what makes separates the good from the brilliant. A complete player who doesn't yet seem to have the complete ego. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard gets away from Manchester City duo Fernando (left) and Martin Demichelis at Stamford Bridge . Laurie Whitwell . Has to be Hazard for me. The way he carries the ball through ever tightening spaces and emerges the other side is a joy. Like one of those Indiana Jones impossible escapes from a sliding door or rolling boulder. And his penalties are mesmeric. I could watch them again and again not working out how he does it. VERDICT: HAZARD . Belgium international Hazard scores a header past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian at Upton Park . Sami Mokbel . Both are marvellous players, but I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. When he first arrived in England I remember, whilst sitting in the Upton Park press box, trying to work out whether he was left or right footed. He was wonderful that day as Arsenal cruised to a 3-1 win; it was one of the most complete performances I've seen live. In truth, I've still got no idea whether he's left or right footed. He's that natural on either. Hazard is a phenomenon, but aesthetically no on can touch Cazorla in the Premier League. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla grins after scoring Arsenal's fourth goal against Aston Villa at the Emirates in February . Jack Gaughan . From a purely artistic sense, Santi Cazorla is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire Premier League. But Eden Hazard provides moments to really stick in the memory. He glides past opponents effortlessly and regularly chips in with important goals - plenty of them stunning in their execution. Worth the ticket alone. The one blot from Cazorla's point of view is that his genius can be fleeting. VERDICT: HAZARD . Sam Cunningham . Jose Mourinho has told him to add more goals to his game to move on a par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and, three years younger than the Argentine and six than the Portuguese, he is not far from doing that. I've watched Hazard countless times at Stamford Bridge this season and he makes the game seem like an art form with his movement, dribbling and passing. Cazorla can excite at times, but he is nowhere near consistently reaching Hazard's level. For me there is no contest between the pair. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard tucks home yet another penalty during Chelsea 2-1 win against Stoke City last weekend . Craig Hope . I would far rather have Hazard in my team, but I can't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under Jose Mourinho. Efficient, technically brilliant, effective and hard-working he most certainly is - and he will be crowned PFA Player of the Year - but he is no longer the daring dribbler of whom we heard so much about during his teenage years in France. He is, though, arguably a better player for Mourinho's influence. Cazorla, meanwhile, would never thrive under Mourinho, there is too much of Juan Mata about him. But there is no doubt he is thrilling to watch on his day - it's just a shame those days aren't as frequent as they should be for a player of his calibre. VERDICT: HAZARD . RESULT: HAZARD 7-3 CAZORLA . Hazard has been voted as a more exciting player than Cazorla in Sportsmail's survey .","Chelsea star Eden Hazard is set to make his 100th top-flight appearance .

"Nico Rosberg has accused his own Mercedes team of putting him ‘under pressure’ during qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix. Rosberg will start Sunday's race behind team-mate Lewis Hamilton after he missed out on pole by just 0.042secs in Shanghai.

Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs . The German was the final driver out of the pit-lane during qualifying meaning he had to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked to start his final shot at usurping Hamilton before the chequered flag fell. ‘We need to look at that,’ said Rosberg. ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but still even the mindset that I had to speed up. It is very annoying.’ Rosberg improved his time, but still fell agonisingly short of Hamilton’s best lap. The momentum is with the Briton this year and Rosberg cut a grumpy figure in the paddock after qualifying. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for tomorrow's race in Shanghai . The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season . Nevertheless, he remains confident he can prevent Hamilton from claiming his fourth victory in Shanghai on Sunday. ‘There are a few opportunities [to pass Hamilton],’ Rosberg, who was speaking to Sky Sports, said. ‘There is the start, there is strategy and then there is tyre degradation. Tyre degradation is going to be big issue because we are going to take the tyres to the limit so there is going to be lots of opportunities.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China .","Nico Rosberg was the last driver out of the pit-lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked ahead of his final shot at pole .

"Police have found video of an unconscious girl being gang raped on a Florida beach in broad daylight during Spring Break.

Troy University students Delone' Martistee, 22, and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, have been suspended from college while they are detained for questioning, WSFA reports. Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen branded the video the 'most disgusting, sickening thing'. According to McKeithen, one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. He told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped.

"Arsenal moved further clear of the two Manchester clubs in second place, and kept the pressure up on leaders Chelsea, as they held on to beat a spirited Burnley at Turf Moor. Arsene Wenger's side were far from their best, but Aaron Ramsey's early goal put them ahead and Burnley, for all their endeavour, didn't create too many clear-cut chances. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Burnley . Tom Heaton: Saved well from Ozil in the build-up to Arsenal’s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear. 7 . Kieran Trippier: Forced Ospina into a good save with a curling free-kick and delivered well from corners. 6 . Jason Shackell: At fault for Arsenal’s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply. 5.5 . Michael Duff: The 37-year-old did a good job of keeping Giroud under wraps and provided a threat from corners. 6.5 . Ben Mee: Made a superb block to deny Ramsey a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from Ozil. 7 . Ben Mee was booked in the first half for a blatant block on Aaron Ramsey, but responded well . Michael Duff goes up to challenge Arsenal's in-form striker Olivier Giroud during the hard-fought encounter . George Boyd: Full of running as ever but failed to trouble Arsenal when in possession of the ball. 6 . Scott Arfield: Another full of industry and almost provided an assist for Ings with a clever lob. 6 . David Jones: Brought calmness and quality to Burnley’s midfield but could not find a killer pass. 6.5 . Ashley Barnes: Wide left is not his favoured position but put Bellerin under pressure with and intense work ethic. 6 . Danny Ings: Starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from Arfield’s chip into the box. 6 . Sam Vokes: Saw an early chance go begging when he fired at Ospina from close range. 6 . Subs: Taylor (for David Jones) 90 . George Boyd, who missed a great chance for Burnley on the half-volley, tackles Francis Coquelin . Scott Arfield tries to get to grips with Mesut Ozil as Burnley worked exceptionally hard against Arsenal . Arsenal . David Ospina: Was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny Vokes and Trippier. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Faded after a bright start. Pinned back by Barnes’ aggressive closing down. Nutmegged by Mee. 6 . Laurent Koscielny: Kept a close eye on Danny Ings and restricted the Burnley top-scorer to just one chance. 7 . Per Mertesacker: Given a good, physical battle by Vokes and just about came out on top. 7 . Hector Bellerin is chopped down by Ashley Barnes as Burnley targeted the young Spanish full back . Laurent Koscielny suffered a few difficult moments as Arsenal sought to continue their excellent form . Nacho Monreal: Made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for Ings. 6 . Francis Coquelin: Has developed into a key member of Arsenal’s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 . Mesut Ozil: Less effective than he was against Liverpool, with only flashes of brilliance. 6 . Aaron Ramsey: Applied the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the Gunners noses in front. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey fires home to put Arsenal ahead despite several Burnley defenders' best efforts . Santi Cazorla: Left his shooting boots in north London. The Spaniard whipped a free-kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left-foot volley over the bar. 6 . Alexis Sanchez: Saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but Burnley coped well to nullify the Chilean’s threat. 6 . Olivier Giroud: Marked out of the game by Burnley’s centre-backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced. 5 . Subs: Welbeck for Giroud (81), Chambers for Sanchez (90) Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 . Alexis Sanchez appeals for a free kick in a game where Burnley's tough tackling caused him some problems . Olivier Giroud holds the ball up, but couldn't add to his six-game goalscoring run at Turf Moor .","Francis Coquelin superb in protecting Arsenal back four at Turf Moor .

"As well as keeping alive hopes of an unlikely charge to the Premier League title, victory for Arsenal at Turf Moor on Saturday will also ensure Arsene Wenger's men claim the longest winning streak in the top-flight this season. The Gunners have won seven straight games since defeat against fierce rivals Tottenham at White Hart Lane on February 7, a run of form which has moved them to second place in the table. Now just seven points behind leaders Chelsea, Arsenal have a chance to surpass Manchester City's equally impressive run of seven victories in a row this season when they take on relegation-threatened Burnley in Saturday's late kick-off.

City earned maximum points from seven games prior to throwing away a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw at home to the Clarets on December 28. With Burnley battling for survival, the Gunners will be wary of a similarly damaging result when they take on Sean Dyche's spirited team in front of the Sky Sports cameras. But if they do manage to take three points from Turf Moor, Arsenal will still be on target to match their best ever winning streak in the Premier League era by the time the season is over. The Gunners hold the record for the most consecutive wins, having come out on top in 14 successive games between February and August in 2002. That run, which was also overseen by Wenger, helped Arsenal beat Liverpool and Manchester United to the 2001-02 title before a draw at West Ham in the second game of the following season ended the streak. United sit second on the list, having put together a 12-game winning run under Sir Alex Ferguson between March and August 2000. Their storming end to the 1999-00 campaign ensured the Red Devils comfortably won their sixth Premier League title, with second-placed Arsenal finishing a massive 18 points behind them. Chelsea's longest winning streak stands at 11 games between April and September in 2009 as interim boss Guus Hiddink and his successor, Carlo Ancelotti, helped the Blues hit top form. Liverpool put together their best run of form last season as they stormed towards their first Premier League title before faltering in two of their final three games. Aided by the goals of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, Brendan Rodgers' side also managed 11 straight wins between February and April before losing 2-0 at home to Chelsea. Manchester City were just one victory away from equalling their best run of eight straight wins earlier this season but they couldn't quite manage to repeat the feat they managed between December 2013 and January 2014. The Gunners hold the record for the most consecutive victories - winning 14 games to clinch the title in 2002 . Manchester United's winning streak of 12 games helped Sir Alex Ferguson's men to the title in 1999-00 . Chelsea striker Demba Ba slides the ball home at Anfield to end Liverpool's 11-game winning run last season . Everton also put together their best ever run in the Premier League last season, earning seven wins on the bounce between March and April last year as they tried and failed to break into the top four. Newcastle won seven straight games in 1996, while Tottenham managed one less in the last three months of 2011. Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Southampton, Sunderland and West Ham all have a best winning run of five games in the Premier League era, with Hull, Leicester, Stoke, Swansea and West Brom all managing four victories in succession. Struggling QPR could do with repeating the three-match winning steak they put together in March 1995, while Burnley's two consecutive victories last November remains their most impressive run.","Arsenal are looking for their eighth victory in succession against Burnley .

"If anyone can be relied upon to crack a smile in the sometimes overly straight-faced world of professional football, it is lofty Stoke striker Peter Crouch. That is, until somebody tries to imitate his now trademark goal celebrations. Speaking on Sky's Soccer AM, the 34-year-old front man gave an in-depth analysis on where it all went 'horribly wrong' for Potters team-mate Charlie Adam following his wonder strike against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last Saturday. Charlie Adam (second right) celebrates his stunning goal against Chelsea with his Stoke team-mates . Peter Crouch was at hand to give his verdict on Adam's dancing skills on Sky's Soccer AM chat show . Crouch originally brought the robot celebration into prominence for England against Jamaica in 2006 . And Crouch was a more than qualified judge for the verdict, as it was his famed robot celebration from England's 6-0 against Jamaica ahead of the 2006 World Cup that got the revival treatment from his Potters pal. After appearing on the long-running football chat show the previous weekend, Adam was asked by hosts Helen Chamberlain and Max Rushden to 'do the robot' if he netted against Jose Mourinho's Premier League high-flyers. After smashing home Stoke's equaliser from 65-yards over the head of Blues goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the former Liverpool midfielder ran to the touchline to greet Crouch, who started on the bench during the 2-1 loss for Mark Hughes' men. The former England striker even went as far as to highlight where Adam was going wrong . The former Liverpool and Tottenham striker was less than impressed with Adam's efforts to imitate him . 'Obviously we're all in agreement it's a fantastic strike from Charlie Adam,' Crouch admitted. Less impressed with his post-strike antics, Crouch's critique on his Britannia Stadium colleague pulled no punches. 'He goes into the celebration far too quickly. No warm up.' 'As you can see he's not got his arm in the 90 degree angle that a robot should start. 'The arms, the shoulders are all coming over in the wrong direction and he just needs to needs to be a bit looser.' 'It's a real shame, because obviously he's got genuine intent and love for the robot, but he's just got a lot of it wrong.' We'll look forward to seeing Crouch show us all how it's done when he's next on the score sheet. Adam (centre) re-enacted Crouch's celebration after letting fly from inside his own half against Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois was not out of position, but he couldn't do anything about Adam's sublime strike .

"Derby head coach Steve McClaren pointed an accusing finger at his own team after they let 10-man Watford battle back to grab a 2-2 draw at the iPro Stadium. The result leaves Derby without a win in seven games and six points off the top two but McClaren admitted his players only had themselves to blame for the latest setback. Derby had been in control until Matej Vydra fired them ahead in the 23rd minute after Cyrus Christie lost the ball out on the right but a mistake by Ben Watson just before half-time changed the game.

Tom Ince put Johnny Russell in and Marco Motta's wild challenge saw him red-carded before Darren Bent coolly drove the penalty into the top right corner. When Ince burst into the box and turned one way and then the other before bending the ball low past Heurelho Gomes in the 57th minute, it looked bleak for Watford but they hit back when Adlene Guedioura cleverly played in Odion Ighalo to beat Lee Grant from 12 yards in the 75th minute. Bent was denied by the legs of Gomes two minutes later and the keeper leapt to tip over a Richard Keogh header in the final seconds of stoppage time but McClaren knew a great chance had already slipped away. 'We are 2-1 up and I think the plan is going great and then we stopped,' he said. 'We started to get negative and think the game was won and that's the disappointment. 'We have to be ruthless, we have to go for the third and fourth and kill teams off but we played as if it was the last two minutes of the game and just tried to keep the ball and they were never going to accept that. 'It's very frustrating for everyone but we only have ourselves to blame for not taking advantage and not winning that game and getting back in the race. 'I said at half-time we need three goals to win this game, we got the second and I thought we would go on but we didn't go on. There's anger and frustration but we've got six games to go and we can't feel sorry for ourselves. 'We've got to react and use the anger and make sure on Monday that we are more ruthless because the performances are still good but we are conceding bad goals.'

He said: 'I am proud because we believed we could change the situation, which is good news with six games in front of us. 'We must be brave and believe in our possibilities. I am always confident in my team because if the players play with confidence, they believe they are a good team and can change the situation in the second half. 'In my opinion (Motta's foul) was not enough for a sending-off but the referee has another opinion and that's it.

"Patrick Bamford enhanced Middlesbrough’s automatic promotion bid by equalling the club’s record goal return of the modern era. Bamford, the on-loan Chelsea forward, struck his 15th of the campaign, to match the tally of Colombian Hamilton Ricard during the 1998-99 Premier League season. No one has scored more in the 16 intervening years. His deflected 20th-minute effort was enough to earn victory over relegation-threatened Wigan, who now have just six matches to avert the prospect of playing League One football just two years after shocking Manchester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford, on loan from Chelsea, scores the opening goal via a deflection . Bamford celebrates his 17th goal of the season, the fourth that he has scored in his last four games . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Woodgate, Gibson, Friend, Clayton, Leadbitter, Reach, Bamford, Adomah, Vossen. Subs: Tiendalli, Amorebieta, Garcia, Tomlin, Ripley, Whitehead, Forshaw. Wigan: Al Habsi, Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong, Pennant, Perch, Kim, McClean, Clarke, Murphy. Subs: Carson, McCann, Ojo, Barnett, Fortune, Waghorn, Kvist Jorgensen. Referee: Stuart Attwell . Despite being five points adrift of safety, the Lancashire club arrived with an impressive away record, having taken 21 of their 35 points away from the DW Stadium and winning their last four games on the road. However, no second-tier side have taken more points on their own turf than Middlesbrough and Bamford made it nine victories in 10 attempts at the Riverside. It was from a classic counter-attack that Aitor Karanka’s team took the lead. A Wigan free-kick invoked panic in the home penalty area as Dimi Konstantopoulos dropped a high ball at the feet of Leon Clarke, whose instinctive prod goalwards then fortuitously struck the Middlesbrough goalkeeper. But Boro seized on the loose ball and within seconds they had scored. Adam Clayton’s pass utilised Albert Adomah’s pace and Boro were lucky when Jelle Vossen’s heavy touch from a right-wing cross set up Bamford. He curled his shot goalward from 20 yards and a slight deflection off Wigan defender Jason Pearce took it beyond the grasp of his goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi. Jonathan Woodgate plays the ball out of defence as Middlesbrough looked in control for long periods . Albert Adomah gets dow the outside of Josh Murphy  as Middlesbrough continued their promotion push . Despite Bamford stealing the limelight, however, Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka praised the effort of his team. ‘It was a very important win and performance, especially second half. The most important thing is to win the games, to rest well and to think about Monday’s game,’ said Karanka. ‘Everything is going to be tighter. Everyone is playing for something. Wigan were playing to stay up and I think in all games someone has something to play for, so every game will be difficult. ‘Everyone was tired after Bournemouth and there were a lot of games in February and March. Now after the break our heads are fresh and we have four games in the next two weeks. ‘We have experienced players and a lot of games coming up now, Monday and Saturday. There are six games to go and we need all of the players. ‘Patrick scored the goal but there were other players who contributed all around the field.’ Bamford is mobbed by his team-mates after the goal that sent Boro back to the top of the league . Malky Mackay's side remain adrift in the relegation zone after a third defeat in their last five games . Wigan pressed hard for an equaliser after the break and it took a strong right hand from Konstantopoulos to keep out substitute Marc-Antoine Fortune’s effort just after the hour. ‘I’m really disappointed that we didn’t get something out of the game,’ said Wigan manager Malky Mackay. ‘We deserved something. ‘Especially in the second half we went toe to toe with Middlesbrough, one of the best teams in the division, and I am disappointed for my players for the courage they showed.’ Adam Clayton brings down James Perch, but Wigan never really threatened to take the points off their hosts . Things got particularly nervy in injury time when Wigan — with four up front — were camped deep in home territory. Boro had their own chances to seal a more comfortable win but Adomah volleyed wide at the climax of a stunning team move and substitute Lee Tomlin, who coame on for Vossen in the 67th minute, failed to get sufficient contact on a close-range effort seconds after entering the action. Tomlin wasted another opportunity deep into injury time when he slalomed his way down the field on a breakaway but his shot came off the heel of covering defender Harry Maguire. But all Boro cared about was the three points.","Patrick Bamford puts Middlesbrough ahead after 20 minutes .

"Leeds midfielder Rudi Austin was sent off in the first half as Blackburn warmed up for Wednesday's home FA Cup quarter-final replay against Liverpool with a 3-0 win. Austin saw red in the 39th minute for elbowing Ben Marshall off the ball and though Leeds resisted strongly until just after the hour mark, second-half goals by Tom Cairney, Jordan Rhodes and Jay Spearing settled the match . Rovers extended their unbeaten away run to six matches while Leeds' five-game undefeated sequence came to an end. Blackburn players celebrate after scoring the third in their 3-0 victory over Leeds United . Tom Cairney (right) opened the scoring for Blackburn Rovers against Leeds United at Elland Road . Leeds: Silvestri, Wootton (Antenucci 66'), Bellusci, Bamba, Berardi (Cooper 66'), Austin, Murphy, Byram, Mowatt, Charlie Taylor, Morison (Sharp 86') Subs not used:  Stuart Taylor, Dawson, Doukara, Philips . Booked: Antenucci, Murphy, Charlie Taylor . Sent off: Austin . Blackburn: Raya, Henley (Paul Taylor 59'), Baptiste, Kilgallon, Olsson, Cairney, Spearing, Williamson, Marshall, Rhodes, Gestede (Brown 64' (O'Sullivan 81')) Subs not used:  Spurr,   Lenihan, Steele, Evans . Booked: Henley, Taylor . Goals: Cairney 62' Rhodes 69' Spearing 80' Referee: Gary Sutton . Attendance: 25,293 . Austin, back in the Leeds side after a five-match absence, was shown a straight red card after referee Gary Sutton was called over by a linesman who had spotted the offence on former Stoke and Leicester winger Marshall in the right corner. Leeds fans voiced their wholehearted backing for head coach Neil Redfearn and his sacked assistant Steve Thompson. Loud chants of 'there's only one Neil Redfearn' and 'there's only one Steve Thompson' rang out around the ground soon after the start. Just two days earlier, Redfearn angrily said he was considering his future after Thompson was mysteriously suspended for the remainder of the season and told his contract would not be renewed. Thompson was informed of his suspension by Leeds' football director Nicola Salerno, who is believed to be considering his own position. Blackburn, who had 19-year-old Spanish keeper David Raya on debut, withstood early pressure before almost taking a 13th-minute lead when Rhodes shot against the bar and Marshall fired the rebound into the side-netting. Jordan Rhodes nets the second for Blackburn Rovers against Leeds United . Rhodes then produced a neat turn but shot over from eight yards and when Austin had Leeds' best chance so far, he nodded Charlie Taylor's cross over the bar before leaving Leeds to battle on with 10 men. Raya had been largely untested on his debut, his only first-half save keeping out Sam Byram's acute angled shot, but Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri had to pull off a desperate stop from Rudy Gestede at point-blank range in the 49th minute. Rovers had struggled to make their numerical advantage count as Leeds employed tight marking, with strikers Rhodes and Gestede starved of clear-cut opportunities, but two goals in a seven-minute spell turned the game Rovers' way. The breakthrough arrived in the 62nd minute. Lee Williamson's long pass down the right found Gestede who gave Giuseppe Bellusci the slip before Cairney shot powerfully past Silvestri. Gestede limped off to be replaced by Chris Brown in the 64th minute and a minute later Marshall's long-distance shot smacked against a post. Leeds were rocking and they conceded again in the 69th minute. Cairney picked out Brown, whose accurate cross left the unmarked Rhodes the simple task of heading home for his 17th goal of the season. Fans hold up Never Forgotten posters in memory of Leeds fans Chris Loftus and Kevin Speight . Then, in the 80th minute, Bellusci allowed Spearing time and room to drill in the third.","Blackburn secure easy win over 10-man Leeds United at Elland Road .

"Kenny Jackett has told his Wolves players they must maintain their focus and follow up victory over Nottingham Forest with another over Leeds United on Monday. The Wolves boss believes it is now just the top eight in the Sky Bet Championship who are fighting it out for the play-off places, with their 2-1 success at the City Ground all but ending the Reds' chances of making a late push. Wolves were fired on by a goal just 30 seconds into the second half from Benik Afobe, followed by a Bakary Sako penalty in the 72nd minute. Dexter Blackstock pulled one back for Forest four minutes into injury time, but it was too little, too late. Bakary Sako celebrates after scoring Wolves' second goal in a 2-1 win at Nottingham Forest on Good Friday . Manager Kenny Jackett has told his side that they need to keep their focus to maintain a promotion push . And Jackett does not want Wolves to let their promotion push slip away now, saying: We just need to keep winning our games and not worry about other sides. It looks like the top eight will be involved now, although I don't know if Forest will have an opinion on that. 'We have to follow this win up with another against Leeds now, there will be a big crowd at Molineux and we have to focus on that now. 'The mood is very determined, there is good focus among the players and we are keen to keep improving.' Jackett was particularly delighted for Afobe, who he had previously taken on loan at Millwall, saying: 'He is repaying our faith but we worked together at Millwall and I am delighted to have him permanently now. He was ready for a permanent home. Dougie Freedman believes the difference between the two sides was a simple composure in front of goal . 'I'm delighted to have won. I felt that Forest put us under a lot of pressure in the first 20 minutes, a lot of energy, the crowd were right behind them. We defended well in that period, very well. Then we came through it and started to look a threat ourselves. 'Then just after half time, Afobe's scored a fantastic goal that, in a tight game, has put our noses in front. After that we were very professional, we got the second goal, we needed it and it was a good overall performance.' Forest boss Dougie Freedman says the difference between the two sides was simple composure in front of goal. Wolves striker Afobe (centre) is mobbed by his team-mates after putting them ahead in the second half . 'The difference was that they took their chances when they came along. There was not a lot in it, they just took their chances when they came their way,' he said. 'When they scored just after half time, our team talk went out the window. But you have to take your chances against the top sides and we had plenty of them. 'The ability to take chances is what cost us in the end. They took theirs and we did not make the most of ours. Afobe made the difference, because he took his goal superbly. 'We had opportunities to win the game, we had sustained pressure on their goal. But we did not have the cutting edge we needed.'","Wolves beat Nottingham Forest to continue their push towards the playoff places and all but end their opposition's chances of promotion .

"A southern Iowa chiropractor accused of accepting sex as payment for his services and performing exorcisms on patients has surrendered his state license. The Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report Wednesday detailing charges against Charles Manuel, of Lamoni. Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on HealthGrades.com . The agreement requires that Manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to Manuel's home from the Des Moines Register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A Lamoni address listed on the Yelp page for Manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street. While Maneul has received just three patient survey responses on HealthGrades.com, those responses were quite positive.

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has branded the obsession with Jurgen Klopp's next move as a 'ridiculous circus'. Klopp confirmed on Wednesday that his intention was to leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season after seven years in which the club won two Bundesliga titles and reached the Champions League final. It sparked a frenzy of speculation about whether the charismatic 47-year-old might be destined for the Barclays Premier League with Arsenal or Manchester City, where manager Manuel Pellegrini is feeling the heat after a poor run of form. Jurgen Klopp announced on Wednesday that he would be leaving Borussia Dortmund this summer . Klopp takes training for the first time since revealing he would be ending his stay with the German side . Arsene Wenger branded the 'circus' surrounding Klopp's departure as 'ridiculous' 'I'm not an agency to place managers,' said Wenger, when asked about Klopp's announcement. 'I like every manager and respect, everybody. I find that circus a bit ridiculous. 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund. Dortmund is a massive club and will survive, they have the ability to keep their best players. They have a big history linked with great results and great achievements so I don't think that will stop for Dortmund.' Wenger was clearly irritated that some might consider Klopp a contender for his job when the Arsenal manager has two years left on a contract signed last summer and no desire to step away at a time when his side is making clear progress. 'I have already answered this question,' he replied curtly, when asked if Klopp might be a good fit for the job at the Emirates Stadium, one day in the future, but was willing to share his thoughts on the key factors for a foreign coach to be successful in England. 'Try to get your ideas through and adapt as well to the local culture, and respect it,' said Wenger, who is preparing for an FA Cup semi-final against Reading on Saturday. It would be his ninth major trophy in more than 18 years at Arsenal.

"In his day job, he is well versed at telling his sidekick Watson just how 'elementary' things can be. But Benedict Cumberbatch found the shoe was very much on the other foot when he tried his hand at table tennis yesterday. The Sherlock star was challenged to a game by Chinese ping pong legend Deng Yaping while hosting the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai, it was reported by People's Daily Online. But despite using a wooden spoon to give the actor a fighting chance, Deng still won the match. Here's how it's done, detective: Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch is challenged to a table tennis match by Chinese ping pong legend Deng Yaping, who beat him despite playing with a wooden spoon . Cumberbatch is a huge celebrity in China because of the popularity of the Sherlock TV series and his skit with Deng went down a storm with the audience. Opening the sketch, the star says: 'I'm getting a little nervous because I can't help noticing that there's a ping pong table behind us.' Turning to Deng, he says: 'You want me to play you?' She replies: 'How about that?' to which Cumberbatch gasps: 'Oh my God!' Deng, one of the world's most successful players, at first offers the star a jumbo-sized paddle in an attempt to ease his nerves. But politely declining, he says: 'I'm a bit better than that.'

As a final option, she picks up a wooden spoon, adding: 'My mum uses this for cooking.' The actor jokes: 'And you're going to beat me with it? That's what my mother used to say to me!' The pair have three rallies which end with Cumberbatch hitting it into the net twice and shooting it long the third time. They then have one final rally with Deng using a normal paddle, which she finishes with a smash, with the TV feed edited to show the ball bouncing out of the building and then back into his mouth.","Ping pong legend Deng Yaping challenged actor to game at sports awards .

"Manchester City’s problems are not confined to the Barclays Premier League. Over the pond, New York City FC manager Jason Kreis is finding life increasingly difficult following a patchy start to the season which continued on Thursday night as Philadelphia Union snatched a late draw in a match which had been bossed for long periods by the men in sky blue. The pressure hasn’t reached Manuel Pellegrini proportions. It's too early for that. New York City FC's Mehdi Ballouchy opened the scoring before his side were pegged back . Yet Kreis and NYCFC will be under no illusions about the task in hand. Things need to improve. And fast. A superb second half strike from Mehdi Ballouchy looked to have put an end to a run of just one win from the first five matches. But, as is ever the case in MLS, haphazard defending allowed CJ Sapong to stab in on 86 minutes. As long as David Villa stays fit - he came off at halftime with a hamstring strain here - and the squad continues to gel, Frank Lampard will arrive here in the summer and join a side who slowly but surely will have adapted to the task in hand by then. This though was a reminder of how much work needs to be done. The Big Apple sports fans have been quick to adopt City’s plans though it will take more time – and a more wins – for the club to really catch light. They will never, and don’t expect to compare to the might of the Yankees, Knicks, Jets or Giants. They are sporting titans in a city bursting with stars. Certainly a look around Yankees Stadium at kick-off was all you needed to see that the initial spike of interest in NYCFC has quickly dimmed. David Villa was forced off with a hamstring injury at half time on Thursday night . The opening game attendance of over 60,000 seemed like a hazy distant memory. It’s another reminder, not that the club bosses required one, of the desperate need for a permanent football specific home. But, to be fair, as the game wore on the atmosphere and excitement was enough to leave the attendees wanting more even if the League itself does little to help the product on the pitch. MLS needs to start acknowledging international breaks like everyone else. City’ s Mix Diskerud, arguably their best player thus far, was unavailable having played for the US in their win over Mexico on Wednesday night while the likes Robbie Keane missed League matches during the last round of Euro 2016 qualifier. That cannot help the progress of the game here. Another quirk this side of the pond saw Philadelphia lock horns with Kreis’ side just four days after beating them at home 2-1. It’s perhaps an attempt to recreate the mini-series of matches like in baseball. City, though, created nothing of note early on. David Villa’s second MLS strike in Philadelphia had brought his side level before Vincent Nogueira slotted home a late winner yet the Spanish star was feeding off scraps here. Indeed the chances were falling at the other end of the pitch, Venezuelan striker Fernando Aristeguieta firing just over to keep the stuttering home side firmly on their toes. Villa sparked into life every time the ball fell at his feet yet his markers weren’t giving an inch. Three surrounded the former Barcelona forward on 25 minutes and after he was ushered out of play, full-back Sheanon Williams needed no invitation to get stuck into the Spaniard by pushing his square in the chest. New York City have made a slow start to the MLS season, winning just once . It was handbags at best. Yet it showed just how wary Union were of Villa’s class. And on 27 minutes, the first moment of magic should have resulted in the opener. A sweet flick from the 33 year-old beautifully teed up Ballouchy only for the Moroccan to blaze over. He really should have scored. It goes without saying that Villa was emphatically the best player on the pitch. A canny dummy helped split the Philadelphia backline in half but Khiry Shelton couldn’t get round keeper John McCarthy. Kreis needed the rest of the team to start performing after the break though. And , to their credit, they did. Ned Grabavoy was denied by McCarthy’s outstretched leg before Adam Nemec headed wide. Finally there was some urgency and on 57 minutes, there was a goal. It was a superb strike by Ballouchy who cut inside with an excellent first touch before curling home. Philadelphia though, home of Rocky Balboa, stayed strong before delivering that late knock-out blow. Perhaps Kreis should give Pellegrini a call at some point soon. Both are enduring tough times.","New York City FC's patchy start to the season continued .

"Villarreal's slide continued as a Diego Castro header gave Getafe a 1-1 draw in La Liga on Sunday but the match was overshadowed by a serious looking injury to Mateo Musacchio. The Villarreal defender was carried off on a stretcher with 13 minutes to go after his ankle appeared to buckle when he was  running for the ball. The Argentine underwent a successful operation after being taken to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a broken left ankle. Villarreal's Mateo Musacchio runs for the ball near the touchline with 13 minutes left to play . As he closes in on the ball and the sliding opponent, his right foot is bent back, breaking his ankle . Musacchio crumples to the ground in agony after the horrendous ankle break . 'Musacchio has been successfully operated on tonight at the Cemtro Clinic in Madrid after having a dislocation and break of his left ankle,' read a statement on Villarreal's website. 'The recovery time for the footballer will depend on the progress he makes.' An Ikechukwu Uche penalty, after he himself was fouled by Medhi Lacen with 52 minutes played, was Villarreal's first goal in five league games but it was not enough to give them their first La Liga away win of the year. In a scrappy game Getafe deservedly drew level with a fine header from Castro after 64 minutes and Pedro Leon had the chance to win the game but his shot following a breakaway was parried by Villarreal keeper Sergio Asenjo. Villarreal have failed to win in seven games in all competitions and are sixth on 51 points. Getafe are 13th on 36 points. Barcelona lead the way at the top of the table on 75 points but their advantage was cut to two points following a 2-2 draw with Sevilla on Saturday.

"Giving away healthy lead is enough to send most managers into a fit of rage. There are many players out there that could vouch for that. On Saturday evening, NAC Breda manager Robert Maaskant let his fists do the talking as his side did just that against FC Dordrecht. After being two goals to the good at the interval thanks to goals from Dutch-Moroccan forward Adnane Tighadouini, relegation battlers NAC seemed to be heading towards three vital points against the team rooted to the bottom of the Eredivisie. NAC Breda manager Robert Maaskant takes out his anger on the substitutes bench on Saturday evening . After his side give up a two-goal lead the 46-year-old smashes through the plastic casing of the dugout . The livid NAC manager then turns to his bench to further express his dissatisfaction . However after the hour mark the home side appeared to crumble, letting the visitors claw themselves back into the game with two goals in as many minutes. Clearly incensed by his side's lack of concentration, Maaskant turned to his bench and threw a devastating right hook to the side of the dugout. The 46-year-old clearly packs a punch because his attack sent his fist clean through the plastic casing, cutting his hand. It goes without saying we wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of a Maaskant rant. It's lucky NAC's wobble didn't occur before they headed into the changing rooms at half time... with all those football boots lying around.","NAC Breda let slip a two-goal lead, sending boss Robert Maaskant wild .

"The Milan Derby used to be Italian football’s biggest attraction. A host of world stars, two unwavering sets of supporters and a fierce rivalry meant AC Milan and Inter could always guarantee a spectacle. It was certainly the case in April 2005 when a hail of flares rained down from the stands on to the San Siro pitch - flooding the stadium with smoke and forcing German referee Markus Merk to abandon a virulent Champions League quarter-final. On Sunday, they meet once more against the backdrop of a Champions League quarter-final week. This time, however, interest has barely stirred. Inter Milan pose for a team photo ahead of their Champions League quarter-final against AC Milan in 2005 . AC Milan (pictured against Schalke in same year) has changed dramatically since their glory years . Starting XIs from the Champs League quarter-final second leg, April 12, 2005 .

(4-3-1-2): Handanovic; Santon, Ranocchia, Vidic, Juan Jesus; Hernanes, Medel, Gnoukouri; Shaqiri; Icardi, Palacio. (4-3-3): Diego Lopez; Abate, Mexes, Paletta, Antonelli; Poli, De Jong, Van Ginkel; Honda, Menez, Bonaventura. Marco Materazzi and Rui Costa watch on while the match was stopped because of flares thrown on the pitch . The 2005 clash – widely remembered for the chaotic scenes in which Brazilian goalkeeper Dida was knocked to the ground by a flare - was the second time in two seasons the sides had met in the knockout stages as the pair threatened continental dominance to add to their monopoly on Serie A. European success did follow in the form of one title apiece – Milan lifting the trophy in 2007 and Inter followed suit in 2010 – but both have seen their stock dwindle severely in the past few years. The pair have vacated the Champions League scene and their form in Serie A suggests they won’t be rejoining Europe’s elite any time soon. Milan - Europe’s most decorated club - are 15 points off the Champions League pace in ninth. Inter are a point and place further behind. Failure to qualify for next season – when the San Siro plays host to the final - will see both sides absent for the second year in a row. Never before has Europe’s biggest competition gone consecutive campaigns without any representation from Italy’s second city. For now, supporters have the derby alone to look forward to next term. While the rivalry remains as strong from those clashes a decade ago, the current crop of talent at both clubs does not. The San Siro would morph into a Pantheon on previous derby days – with Ronaldinho, Kaka and Luis Figo all gracing the Derby della Madonnina. Each a former World Player of the Year. AC MIlan goalkeeper Dida was hit by a firework during the Champions League quarter-final at the San Siro . Kaka, a former world player of the year, celebrates after scoring against rivals Inter 10 years ago . The AC Milan players embrace Jaap Stam after his goal in the Champions League derby match . Seven World Cup winners – past and future – took to the pitch when the side’s met in that Champions League quarter-final second leg. What Inter’s sporting director Piero Ausilio wouldn’t give for even an ounce of that quality in today’s side. ‘If players want to be worthy of this shirt, they must play better,’ he blasted on the club’s website after an embarrassing home draw with beleaguered Parma at the beginning of this month. ‘We are already working with Roberto Mancini to prepare Inter of the future. This is why I say we are evaluating who is worthy of wearing this jersey and who is not.’ Mancini’s reaction to the draw was to cancel his squad’s Easter break and haul them in for extra training. There is belief that with the former Manchester City boss back at the helm a corner can be turned. However, Financial Fair Play rules, coupled with a lack of revenue from European football, means it will have to be negotiated without the full backing of Indonesian owner Erick Thohir. Mancini was in charge during the Nerazzurri’s most fruitful period of recent times, winning three consecutive Scudetti along with two Coppa Italia titles between 2004 and 2008. Inter Milan were booed off the pitch after a disappointing draw with bottom-of-the-table Parma this month . 2004/05: 54,150 (2nd highest in Serie A) 05/06 51,444(2nd) 06/07 48,248(1st) 07/08 51,215(2nd) 08/09 55,431(2nd) 09/10 56,195(1st) 10/11 59,484(1st) 11/12 45,664(2nd) 12/13 46,654(1st) 13/14 46,246(1st) 14/15* 33,189(6th) *after 16 Milan home games and 14 Inter home games. 2004/05: 63,521 (1st highest in Serie A) 05/06: 59,499(1st) 06/07 46,292(2nd) 07/08: 56,906(1st) 08/09: 59,731(1st) 09/10: 42,951(3rd) 10/11: 53,916(2nd) 11/12: 49,359(1st) 12/13: 43,651(2nd) 13/14: 40,061(4th) 14/15*: 37,237(3rd) *after 16 Milan home games and 14 Inter home games. AC Milan players look dejected during a Serie A match against Sassuolo in January . ‘To come back to Inter is the biggest challenge,’ he told CNN at the beginning of April, six months after retaking the hot seat in November last year. Speculation suggests that the 50-year-old may look to his former club in a bid to breed another successful side, with Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri both sounded out as potential summer targets as Inter look to rebuild. Keeping hold of key squad members will be just as important to Mancini’s vision though – with the futures of striker Mauro Icardi and goalkeeper Samir Handanovic both far from certain. If there is a silver lining for Inter, it’s that their own woes pale in insignificance when compared with Milan’s troubles. The Rossoneri’s problems are not solely consigned to the field and relationships have fractured between the club and fans. Supporters boycotted the recent home game against Cagliari in protest at the way the club is being run and the refusal at board level to shed any light on its future – with details of a possible takeover by Thai businessman Bee Taechaubol so far withheld. Unclear, too, is the future of head coach Fillipo Inzaghi after a season stained with indifference. Like their city rivals however, there is ground on which the green shoots of recovery could grow. Roberto Mancini (left) and Filipo Inzaghi (right) are currently tasked with leading the clubs into a new era . Former AC Milan defender and captain Paolo Maldini could return to the club in a role upstairs . Plans for a new stadium, while not finalised, are being pushed, and talk of a return for club legend Paolo Maldini has also begun to gather pace. A change at boardroom level would almost certainly see the former centre back – who spent every one of his 24 years as a professional at Milan – offered his first role since retiring in 2009. The man himself would probably argue his reintroduction can’t come soon enough. ‘One of the sources of strength for a club like Milan, and for the few other clubs that are alike to Milan, is tradition,’ Maldini stated in a recent interview with Gazzetta TV. ‘Nowadays the real values of Milan are not being tended to.’ Those values are being called into question by fans of both clubs, as they continue to vote with their feet. Andriy Shevchenko and Hernan Crespo lead an exciting AC Milan team up front in 2005 . Average attendances at the San Siro have never been lower this century, dipping under 40,000 for the first time. In 2005, Milan boasted the best average in the league with 63,521, Inter taking second spot with 54,150. For 2015 those figures read just 37,237 and 33,189 respectively. Clearly then, there are still bridges to be built between the two fallen giants and their fans. It is their attention that matters more; much more than the gaze of onlookers from across the continent. ‘It won’t be the same derby of a few years ago,’ admitted Milan full back Ignazio Abate when interviewed by Sky this week. ‘But we won’t be lacking in motivation. We want to bring happiness to the club and our fans.’ This weekend’s derby provides both the Nerazzurri and the Rossoneri a chance to restore a touch of pride for supporters at the end of an arduous season. Restoring either side to its former glory will be a much tougher task still. Neither Inter MIlan or AC Milan look like restoring themselves to former glory anytime soon .","Inter Milan host AC Milan in a Serie A derby this weekend .

"Arsene Wenger says something must be done to solve the fixture scheduling mess which means Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final will clash with a key Premier League title game. Arsenal will take on Reading on Saturday evening as league leaders Chelsea take on Manchester United at Stamford Bridge. The Gunners boss also branded rumours that he will be replaced by Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp as 'ridiculous', after the German announced he will be leaving the club this summer.

Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp oversees training on Thursday ahead of this weekend's match . On TV scheduling, Wenger said: 'Something should be done. I'm surprised they don't analyse it in the TV deals. I'm surprised a game of the same stature is played at the same time. There's a little conflict there. It's difficult to understand.' 'We would like it to be a unique competition that's played, especially a semi-final or final and don't want it to be conflicting with other competitions. It's a very big game (at Chelsea). It's a surprise to me.' Wenger admits a United win at Chelsea could open up the title race again. 'Mathematically yes,' he said. 'But we have to keep winning.' Klopp confirmed on Wednesday his intention to leave Dortmund at the end of the season after seven years in which the club won two Bundesliga titles and reached the Champions League final. It sparked a frenzy of speculation about whether the charismatic 47-year-old might be destined for England with Arsenal or Manchester City, where manager Manuel Pellegrini is feeling the heat after a poor run of form. Wenger hit out at the TV scheduling as Manchester United's trip to Chelsea clashes with the semi-final . Wenger has branded the 'circus' around Jurgen Klopp's resignation as 'ridiculous' 'I'm not an agency to place managers,' said Wenger, when asked about Klopp's announcement. 'I like every manager and respect, everybody. I find that circus a bit ridiculous. 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund. Dortmund is a massive club and will survive, they have the ability to keep their best players. They have a big history linked with great results and great achievements so I don't think that will stop for Dortmund.' Arsenal will have Jack Wilshere available for the semi-final against Reading, as he trained on Thursday with the club at their base. Wojciech Szczesny will start in the tie, and was also put through his paces during Arsenal's training session. The Gunners boss says his team have learned from last season, when they fell behind at this stage against Wigan and needed penalties to beat the Championship side. 'It's my 10th semi-final and that means we know how to prepare but it's always tricky,' he added. 'We learned from Wigan last year. It's always a special occasion to share with our fans.

"Bournemouth are within touching distance; they can almost smell the big-time. Another hurdle on their way to the Premier League has been negotiated as they secured a hard-fought win over Reading. This was tense, though. Manager Eddie Howe would testify to that. But winning a place in the top-flight has never been easy; Bournemouth are finding exactly that out. Callum Wilson celebrates after opening the scoring for Bournemouth in the fourth minute . Wilson opens the scoring for Bournemouth early on against Reading at the Madejski Stadium . READING: Federici, Gunter, A Pearce, Hector, Obita, Chalobah (Appiah 67), Karacan (Williams 59), Ake, McCleary, Mackie, Robson-Kanu (Aiyegbeni 81) Subs not used: Kelly, Norwood,  Andersen, Stacey .

BOURNEMOUTH: Boruc, Francis, Elphick, Cook, Daniels, Ritchie, Arter, Surman, Pugh (Smith 69), Kermorgant (Pitman 75), Wilson (Jones 90) Subs not used: Camp, Gosling, Fraser, Ward . Goal: Wilson 4 . Booked: Boruc, Francis, Wilson, Smith . Referee: Keith Stroud . Attendance: 18,917 . But, as of yet, the Cherries aren't choking, Callum Wilson's 22nd goal of the season setting them on their way to a third successive win at the Madejski Stadium. Howe said: ‘It was nervy, with what’s at stake it was always going to be that way. We defended for our lives and showed incredible mental strength. It was a different kind of win than we’re used to, but results are the most important things now. ‘I’d much rather we were playing total football and doing what we’ve done all season, but we are finding a new way to win and I’ll take that at this stage.’ There was no doubt over which team needed the three points more. This victory secured Bournemouth's position in the top-six, meaning - at the very least - that they'll have a crack at promotion via the play-offs. Reading, under Steve Clarke, have all but secured their Championship status, and with an FA Cup semi-final date at Wembley against Arsenal on the horizon the Royals, perhaps, had other matters on their mind. And so it proved as the Cherries took a fourth minute lead when Wilson fired home from close range after Andrew Surman's shot from the edge of the area struck Adam Federici's far post. It was exactly the start Howe wanted as they looked to maintain their position at the Championship summit. But the visitors had goalkeeper Artur Boruc to thank in the 17th minute as he produced an outstanding one-handed save to deny Jamie Mackie's close range effort from Jordan Obita's cross. And Nathaniel Chalobah, Hal Robson-Kanu and Obita all waste good opportunities to level for the Royals as they mustered a promising response to going behind. These were worrying moments for Howe, who paced regularly from the dugout to his technical area to holler instructions at his players. And despite Yann Kermogrant sending a towering header from Marc Pugh's cross narrowly wide during the dying seconds of the first-half, Bournemouth's early mojo had vanished. Bournemouth's Simon Francis (left) on the run with Nathaniel Cahalobah in hot pursuit . Players appeal to referee Keith Stroud (right) as Wilson lies injured on the ground . Howe would have been happy to get his players in at half-time; his side, in truth, were starting to rock. That's what pressure does to a team. In fairness to the Cherries, though, not once did they part with the passing principles that have put them on the brink of automatic promotion. And the south-coast club looked to have regained their composure during the opening exchanges of the second half. Though, goalscorer Wilson was booked for diving in the 55th minute as the striker took the necessity for points too far. Yet, despite his side's improvement, Howe looked far from comfortable in his technical area. And Bournemouth were struggling to create the opportunities that would have calmed their manager's obvious nerves. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe (centre) and his players applaud the travelling support . There were nervy moments for the travelling Bournemouth fans as the end of the match approached . One mistake, one moment of magic from a Reading player and this match would have been back in the balance. Not only the match, but his side's chances of automatic promotion. Matt Richie went within inches of providing Howe and his team the cushion that they desperately craved in the 63rd minute. The Royals defence made a mockery of trying to clear a Bournemouth throw deep inside their half, the ball eventually fell to Richie who let fly with a curling left-footed effort that skimmed the top of Federici's far post. Steve Cook then saw his half-volley from the edge of the area held by Federici as the visitors started to turn the screw. Wilson (bottom) is challenged by Reading's Alex Pearce during the Championship clash . Reading manager Steve Clarke gestures to his players but the hosts could not find a way back . But Reading refused to lie down, and had Danny Williams not miskicked in the final six minutes then the hosts could easily have pulled level. Wilson missed a glorious chance to seal victory for Bournemouth in the 87th minute, but his control let him down at the vital moment. And the visitors had endure some terrifying moments as Reading laid siege to the Cherries goal. But Howe's side held on for another vital victory as their promotion bandwagon rolls on... just.","Callum Wilson opened the scoring for Bournemouth in the fourth minute .

"Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was suspended four matches on Thursday by the French league's disciplinary commission following his criticism of a referee last month. Following PSG's 3-2 loss at Bordeaux in the league on March 15, the Swede striker lost his temper and vented his anger on television at decisions which went against his side. Ibrahimovic, whose comments were caught on camera, insulted referee Lionel Jaffredo and one of his assistants, then used an expletive to describe France. Paris Saint-Germain ace Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss his side's matches against Nice, Lille, Metz and Nantes . Ibrahimovic has been banned for lambasting Lionel Jaffredo during his side's defeat against Bordeaux . Ibrahimovic, who later said he was sorry after the French sports minister asked him to apologise, is available for Saturday's League Cup final against Bastia as his suspension only starts next week. He will miss league games against Nice, Lille, Metz and Nantes and should return for the last three matches of the season. Although PSG sporting director Olivier Letang argued that Ibrahimovic should not be suspended because he did not address his comments directly to the referee, the disciplinary commission activated a suspended one-match ban imposed in January to add to the three games he received for the latest incident. Ibrahimovic, who took his tally with PSG to 102 goals in less than three years following his hat-trick in a 4-1 win over Saint-Etienne in the French Cup midweek, will also miss the first leg of his club's Champions League quarter-finals against Barcelona after he was sent off against Chelsea in the previous round and therefore suspended for one match. Ibrahimovic has scored 102 goals for PSG since joining the Ligue 1 outfit in July 2012 . Ibrahimovic's comments in Bordeaux caused an outcry in France, with National Front leader Marine Le Pen suggesting that he should leave the country if he was not happy. The Swede's suspension is a tough blow to PSG's ambitions as Laurent Blanc's team chases an unprecedented quadruple with a squad already missing several key players through injuries. Ibrahimovic has been in tremendous form recently, completing two hat-tricks in three games and scoring 10 goals in his last six matches for club and country. The 33-year-old Ibrahimovic has never been shy of controversy during his much-travelled career. He described the Chelsea players as a bunch of 'babies' after he was sent off for a late challenge on Oscar in the first half of PSG's match at Stamford Bridge last month.","PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss his side's next four league games .

"He scored the two goals at the Etihad that saw off Manchester City in the last 16, he scored in the Clasico to leave the league title in Barcelona's hands, and with two more goals on Wednesday in the Parc des Princes, Luis Suarez put his team practically in the Champions League semi-finals. He is starting to look like £75million very well spent – especially in view of the fact that David Luiz, the man he nutmegged twice en route to both goals on Wednesday, cost £50m. The Spanish call the nutmeg a 'tunnel' and  in Catalonia they are hailing the 'Eurotunnels' that have led Barcelona to within two games of the Berlin final on June 6. Luis Suarez curls the ball home for his second and Barcelona's third against Paris Saint-Germain . Suarez celebrates with Neymar as Barcelona took a giant step towards the Champions League semi-finals . Suarez started the season late because of his FIFA ban and, on his own admission, was anxious in front of goal when he first joined Neymar and Lionel Messi – too conscious of the need not to appear greedy in the company of two world-class finishers. But now the numbers speak for themselves. He has scored 13 goals in his last 14 games – six from six in the Champions League. His overall tally is 18 and Barça's front three are on 91 for the season. They look set to eclipse arguably the club's greatest front three of Messi, Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry who scored 100 goals in the 2008-09 campaign. They also look to have even more about them than the Real Madrid trio of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo who won the Champions League last season. The ease with with which Suarez has fitted into Barcelona's front three should not be underestimated. Rio Ferdinand tweeted: 'Suarez does the dirty work for Messi & Neymar without losing any quality'. Suarez's relationship with Lionel Messi both on and off the field has blossomed in recent months . Suarez, Neymar and Messi have established themselves as the most feared front three in the world . And it's true that he batters defenders and tirelessly runs the channels, freeing up space for his Brazilian and Argentine team-mates. But it's no longer about Suarez applying the body shots and Neymar and Messi landing the knockout punch – he is now getting the winning goals himself. 'We have seen him do it before for Ajax and Liverpool,' said Luis Enrique after Wednesday's game. Suarez now has 15 goals in 2015 – almost twice as many as the eight managed by Daniel Sturridge, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini between them. He has also stayed clear of controversy. Last week he gave an in-depth radio interview with Cadena Cope and even made a light-hearted reference to the nonsensical action at the World Cup that cost him his place in the tournament and in this summer's Copa America. 'I was going to say we have a very special hunger but I had better use another word,' he said when asked about what sets Uruguayan players apart. He hates the biting pun headlines but after such a wonderful night in Paris he might let references in Diario AS to American Werewolf in Paris pass, especially the line that read, 'seeing David Luiz come on to the pitch must have been like a full moon to a werewolf'. Suarez enjoyed great success against David Luiz, twice nutmegging the former Chelsea player . Luiz was made to look rather ordinary by the Barcelona forward as he struggled on his return from injury . It's true he devoured Luiz, as he scored goal numbers 1,000 and 1,001 in Barcelona's history in European competition. There was a touch of the Samuel Eto'o about the goal too. It revived memories of Eto'o's strike in Rome 2009 against Manchester United. After nutmegging Luiz, the way Suarez combined that light touch with the use of his upper-body strength to repel Marquinhos and Maxwell was the perfect illustration of how he pairs the physical attributes of a centre forward, with the quick feet of a winger. It was another goal scored cutting in from the right much like the second he scored against England in Brazil at the World Cup. He began his Barca career on the right with Messi playing through the middle but admitted last week that in one game Messi switched places with him and told him to stay through the middle. Part of his remit is to dovetail with the four-times Ballon d'Or winner. If Messi plays centrally then he runs the right-hand channel. If Messi wants to hug the right touchline, then he plays through the middle. He was often as accommodating at Liverpool with Sturridge so he was never going to say no to Messi. Suarez was accommodating when he played with Daniel Sturridge at Liverpool last season . The degree to which those two, and the younger more frivolous Neymar have got along together off the pitch has helped them gel so quickly on it. Did you hear the one about the Uruguayan, the Brazilian and the Argentine sounds like the start of a joke - on Wednesday the defenders trying to cope with them will not have seen the funny side. 'It's not over,' he said after the game when asked about next week's second leg. And he also said he nutmegged Luiz because 'it was the only way to get past him'. He knows there are 90 minutes more to negotiate before Barcelona can celebrate reaching the final four. It wouldn't do to linger too long on how he had destroyed the world's most expensive defender – the replays of those two goals will do that on their own.","Luis Suarez scored twice as Barcelona beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 .

"Wayne Rooney has revealed how he is developing his own style of captaincy to lead Manchester United this season. Rooney has served under a number of big names for club and country during his career, but admits that he has had to learn to be his own man after Louis van Gaal handed him the armband last summer. It appears to have paid off with Rooney playing a key role in United’s resurgence under the Dutchman. Last weekend’s emphatic derby win over Manchester City was their sixth Premier League victory in a row as Van Gaal’s side head towards a top-four finish. Captain Wayne Rooney celebrates Marouane Fellaini's goal as Manchester United beat rivals City on Sunday . The United skipper has revealed he is captaining the team 'his own way' and has to be his own person . Rooney and Paddy McNair were inspired to go for a game of golf on Wednesday following The Masters . ‘You have to do it your own way,’ said Rooney. ‘You can obviously look how people have done it before you but I have to be my own person and do what I feel is the best way for me to captain the team. ‘Giggsy wasn’t captain here full-time in my time at United, but the things he’s done have been a big help and still now. There were also leaders like Roy Keane, Gary Neville and David Beckham. ‘There was Steven Gerrard and John Terry who were fantastic captains. But you can’t say I want to be like him or I want to be like someone else.’ Rooney was catained by midfielder Roy Keane (right) during his early years at Old Trafford . The England skipper has also played alongside leaders Steven Gerrard and John Terry for the national side . Rooney doesn’t hesitate to tell his team-mates what he thinks, even though his dressing-room speeches tend to be off the cuff. He added: ‘I didn’t even write anything down for my wedding! ‘The team spirit in the dressing-room is fantastic, but there are though obviously times when you have to speak up. Rooney insists the team spirit at Man United is fantastic but there are times when he needs to speak up . Rooney was handed the captain's armband by Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal last summer . ‘I did that before the Tottenham game because I felt I had to. We had a bad defeat in the FA Cup against Arsenal and I just wanted to reiterate to the players what our targets were for the remaining games of the season. ‘The players responded to that and we have had some good results.’ On Wednesday, United confirmed their plans for another summer tour of America where they will again take part in the International Champions Cup. The other teams include Chelsea, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Gerrard’s new club LA Galaxy.","Wayne Rooney was handed the captain's armband last summer .

"This is the shocking moment a worker risked his life by standing on top of a house jet washing a roof with what appears to be just a rope tied around him for safety. The unnamed worker was spotted on the roof 30-feet above the ground on top of an Edwardian semi-detached home in Greenwich, south east London. A local resident noticed the man carrying out the work with a lack of safety equipment on the slippery tiles and quickly took snaps of the man. A worker who was caught jet washing the roof of a home in south east London with just a rope tied around him for safety . The neighbour said: 'I couldn't believe it. He was standing on the roof with a power washer and seemed to have a rope tied around his waist. 'It looked incredibly dangerous. His boss seemed to be watching sitting on a wall opposite and seemed unfazed by it all.' A building expert, who did not want to be named, said the workman should have at least had scaffolding up at the front of the property and a much longer ladder with a harness. He said: 'You can't just stand up there with a bit of rope tied around you and think it's fine, it's not. 'You have to think about how slippery it would be up there because as you can see he is spraying from the top to bottom, meaning the water will be trickling down around his feet. A building expert said the man should have at least had scaffolding up at the front of the property and a longer ladder . 'You would only have to slip and fall once and that would be it.' The image was then passed to the Health and Safety Executive, who attended the property and caught the man doing the same thing on the roof of the garage before he was stopped. A HSE Spokeswoman said: 'Following a concern raised, HSE inspectors visited the house yesterday and served a prohibition notice. 'This means the work had to cease until appropriate safety measures are put in place.'","Unnamed worker was spotted on the roof of a house in south east London .

"Simon Mignolet insists Liverpool’s players are not feeling the pressure of trying to give Steven Gerrard a dream send-off – as their captain won’t let them entertain such talk. Victory over Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday enabled Brendan Rodgers’ squad to set up a date with Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final next Sunday and Liverpool are hot favourites to reach the final. The final, against either Arsenal or Reading, will be staged on May 30 – Gerrard’s 35th birthday – and has long been identified as being the perfect afternoon for Gerrard to bring the end down on his glittering Anfield career. Simon Mignolet (left) celebrates with Jordan Henderson after Liverpool reached the FA Cup semi-final . Philippe Coutinho (right) scored the winning goal in a tense 1-0 quarter-final victory against Blackburn . Captain Steven Gerrard, who is struggling to get in the side, will leave Anfield at the end of the season . It has created expectation and Liverpool have made heavy weather of getting to the semi-finals but Mignolet, who was outstanding in the 1-0 win at Ewood Park, maintains they are not thinking too far ahead. Gerrard, for one, won’t let them get carried away. ‘Nobody is talking about it,’ said Mignolet. Stevie is the first one to acknowledge that. Before we speak about the final, we have got to get through the semi-final and that is only possible after getting through here. ‘The only thing we can keep in mind now is how to get past Villa. Then we will see what comes. Villa will be tough. He is the first one to acknowledge that we can’t have any extra pressure on the team (to give him the dream send-off). He won’t let us think in a different way. Gerrard celebrates with Rafa Benitez after inspiring Liverpool to victory over West Ham in the 2006 Final . The Liverpool captain reacts after the Reds are beaten by Chelsea in the 2012 Final at Wembley . ‘We just want to focus on Villa and the games before that. We have got something to look forward to and we want to make sure that we get to the final. That is what we said in the dressing room before the game and everyone did their jobs.’ Liverpool last reached the FA Cup final in 2012, when they lost to Chelsea, and have not won the trophy since Gerrard inspired their 2006 victory over West Ham in Cardiff but they won’t let that opportunity distract their ambitions in the Barclays Premier League. Though they have had their ambitions of finishing in the top four dented by back-to-back defeats against Manchester United and Arsenal, the picture could change once more this weekend if United win the Manchester derby and Liverpool beat Newcastle on Monday. Liverpool have seen their form slip in the league with consecutive defeats to Man United and Arsenal (above) ‘We are pleased to get to the semi-final,’ said Mignolet. ‘Once it is semi-final time, we will make sure we are ready. But everything comes step by step. Newcastle is next. We are pleased with what we did against Blackburn but the next focus is the league. ‘We will be ready and focused then to make sure we get to the final. The only thing we can do is focus and keep our heads down. We have got to keep doing the things we are doing. There is still a lot to play for. The only thing that we can do is take every game as it comes. ‘When you are at Liverpool, you know you have to win every single game. After the results against Arsenal and Manchester United, we knew there was going to be criticism. You accept that. The only thing you can do is respond and we did that. Now the focus is on Newcastle. We will do our best to get three points.’","Liverpool are set to play Aston Villa in FA Cup semi-finals on April 19 .

"Denis Suarez scored a late winner for Sevilla as they came from behind to take control of the Europa League quarter-final tie against Zenit St Petersburg 2-1. Winger Aleksandr Ryazantsev had given the visitors the lead in the first-half, scoring off his own rebound, before forward Carlos Bacca drew the home side level with a close-range header from a set-piece.

"Real estate heir and suspected murderer Robert Durst has sent a bizarre letter to a reporter that shares no details about his alleged crime, but observations about life in Los Angeles. Molly Hennessey-Fiske, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who has been covering proceedings against Durst, 71, after his mid-March arrest in Louisiana, received a letter purporting to have been written by the suspect in state prison. The letter, post-marked April 1st in Baton Rouge, specifically states that Durst 'said nothing about charges, crimes or trials' but rambles on about Durst's thoughts on life in southern California. Dick DeGuerin, Durst's lead attorney, said that the letter looked like his client's handwriting. Murder suspect Robert Durst has sent a bizarre letter, in which he mentions his taste for opera and pro football, to a Los Angeles Times reporter covering his case. Molly Hennessey-Fiske received the letter, which was addressed 'Hiya Holly' from a man purporting to be Robert Durst at a Louisiana state prison . Durst, who was arrested for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman last month, pleaded not guilty to weapons charges on Thursday. Above, he is escorted to prison after his arraignment on March 17 . Hennessey-Fiske, a veteran reporter for the West Coast newspaper, is the outlet's Houston bureau chief and has been covering Durst's legal proceeding . 'Bob is his own person and he’s writing letters to people. As long as they’re not discussing the facts or legal plans or strategy, I don’t have any problem with it,' Mr DeGuerin told The Los Angeles Times. Durst, who was heir to a vast real estate empire before becoming estranged from his family, was arrested last month for the suspected 2000 murder of his friend, writer Susan Berman, in Los Angeles. His letter to Hennessey-Fiske, her paper's Houston bureau chief, does not speak about on his impending extradition to California, but touches on various topics of conversation related to Los Angeles. In sloppy handwritten text with grammar mistakes, Durst spoke about places he lived in the city 'part-time' from 2008 to 2011. He said he 'hated LA traffic, which makes Houston look like a small town' before going on to say that his interests are 'opera and pro football'. Durst began the letter with an apparent mixing up of Hennesey-Fiske's first name by writing 'Hiya Holly'. Hiya Holly, . I used to read your biline, from 2008-2011 I lived part time in L.A., I had a great apt in 1100 Alta Loma and I had bought a great apt complex on Brynhurst. Sareb Kaufman was my broker. I loved watching the traffic come up La Cienaga and mush into Santa Monica, hated L.A. traffic which makes Houston seem like a small town. Used to breakfast at coffee whatever on Sunset. My interests are opera and pro football. Your politicos and business leaders have chosen to fight rather than agree to disagree and there was no football. Like L.A. Opera except for Wagner's ring cycle with the absurd costumes and sloped stage, a true example of Hollywood gone berserk. As my minor balance prb. expanded to full blown hydrocephalus, requiring a shunt. I knew if I was going to let some guy drill into my head, there was no place I would be willing to go ahead other than the Houston Medical Center and I left L.A. I have said nothing about charges, crimes or trials. If you decide to used any of this, which is OK, please make the above clear. I am sure you know what your abilities are to visit me when I get to L.A., which is, if any of this gets published, please copy me . Bob . (Grammar and spelling errors throughout) Durst (right) was long thought to be involved in the murder of his friend and confidante Susan Berman (left) before his arrest. He is currently state and federal gun charges before being extradited to California . He blamed the lack of football in LA on 'politicos and business leaders' who 'have chosen to fight rather than agree to disagree'. The suspect said that he liked the L.A. Opera, with the exception of 19th century German composer Richard Wagner's The Ring Cycle, a 15-hour, three part show based on Norse legend. Durst said that he disliked the 'absurd costumes and sloped stage, a true example of Hollywood gone berserk'. The letter also gives information about the elderly man's health, and said that he moved from California to Texas to 'let some guy drill into my head' during surgery for what he says is hydrocephalus, water on the brain. Last year Durst had a shunt on the his head to drain water. Handwriting, including that on a 2000 letter to Beverly Hills Police informing them about the dead body of Susan Berman, is expected to play a part in the case against Durst for the murder of his friend . Evidence that came to light during the filming of HBO's The Jinx shows similar handwriting to the 'cadaver' letter on an envelope sent to Berman before her death (left). Right, another sample of his letter-writing . He also asked to be 'copied' if any of the information from his letter to Hennessey-Fiske was published. The millionaire, who gained $65 million from a court settlement with his family over his inheritance, was arrested in mid-March at a hotel in New Orleans after leaving his home in Houston. His life and criminal trials have gained more attention after he was the subject of an HBO documentary series called The Jinx, which delved into the Berman killing as well as two other deaths to which he is connected. Many observers think that the heir also played a role in the disappearance of his wife Kathleen McCormack in 1982 and have speculated that he killed his confidante Berman so that she did not reveal any information to police. He was found not guilty in 2003 of killing a man who was his neighbor at Galveston, Texas, house where Durst was living and pretending to be a mute woman named Dorothy Ciner. The HBO documentary series The Jinx delved into a letter Durst wrote to Berman obtained by the victim's stepson Sareb Kaufman . Durst, seen with The Jinx director Andrew Jarecki, willingly participated in the series, though he was later caught telling himself that he killed all the people he is accused of murdering . Durst admitted to chopping up the body of the Texas man, Morris Black, and dumping into Galveston Bay, but said the killing was in self-defense. The Jinx captured footage of Durst allegedly admitting to himself that he killed all three people while wearing a still-live microphone. 'Killed them all,' he said while in the bathroom after an interview. Durst was recently indicted on weapons charges for the revolver found in his New Orleans hotel room, a development that will most likely delay his extradition to California for the Berman trial. He is currently staying in the mental ward of state prison and is being held without bail. As a convicted felon he is barred from owning a gun in Louisiana, but pleaded not guilty to the charges on Thursday. He is also charged with having a gun while in possession of five ounces marijuana and faces up to 30 years in prison in addition to federal firearms charges. The arrest in the Berman case, in which Durst was long thought to have played a part, came after new evidence from the victim's stepson was shown as part of the HBO series. The final episode of the Jinx ran the day after Durst was arrested. Durst (right) is also thought to have been involved in the disappearance of his first wife Kathleen McCormack (right) and admitted to killing Morris Black (left) but said it was in self-defense . Durst's lawyer Dick DeGuerin (pictured in March) said that he does not mind his client sending letters from prison as long as they don't give away legal strategy . An episode also focused on a letter to Berman from Durst obtained by Berman's stepson Sareb Kaufman, where the handwriting matched a message to police alerting them of the writer's death. Initial Los Angeles Police investigations into the 'cadaver' letter believed that Berman's manager Nyle Brenner wrote the message, according to the New York Daily News. However the handwriting matches the letter from Kaufman, who is mentioned in Durst's recent letter to Hennessey-Fiske as his broker for an apartment deal, and contained the same spelling mistake of Beverly Hills as 'Beverley Hills'. Durst's lawyer Mr DeGuerin told the Los Angeles Times that the handwriting appeared authentic, but  'It certainly doesn’t look like the cadaver letter'. The similarities between Durst's previous correspondence and the anonymous letter sent to the Beverly Hills police is expected to play a role in his trial in California. Durst ends his letter to Hennessey-Fiske by saying that she is probably aware of her ability to visit him once he returns to Los Angeles.","Molly Hennessey-Fiske, Los Angeles Times reporter, received letter .

"Siem de Jong is targeting Newcastle's home clash with Swansea later this month for a return to senior action after an eight-month injury nightmare. The 26-year-old Holland international midfielder played 45 minutes for the club's Under-21s team on Wednesday evening after competing his recovery from surgery to repair a collapsed lung. Head coach John Carver has hinted that De Jong could even make the 18 for Sunday's Barclays Premier League fixture against Tottenham at St James' Park, and while the Dutchman has not ruled that out, his sights are set the Swans' visit to Tyneside on the following weekend. Newcastle playmaker Siem de Jong is hopeful of returning to the first-team before the end of the season . He told nufcTV: 'I don't think I could play 90 minutes in the coming weeks, so it will be maybe as a substitute at the end of the game, but I don't know if I will be on the bench... We haven't discussed yet when I'll be back. 'But I hope Swansea - I don't know yet if Tottenham would be a good time, but I hope to be back on the bench against Swansea, depending on how it goes in the coming days and depending on how I feel tomorrow after today. 'We'll see how it goes. I still have to get a little bit stronger, a little bit more explosive, a little faster, and hopefully I can work on that in the coming days.' De Jong, a £6million summer signing from Ajax, has made just three senior appearances for the club, the last of them in a 3-3 home draw with Crystal Palace on August 30 last year - his only league start to date. The summer signing has been plagued by injuries since arriving from Ajax but  is close to full fitness . Injury hit when he badly tore a thigh muscle in training days later and was sidelined until February, when disaster struck once again as he suffered a collapsed lung for the second time in his career. He took the first tentative steps towards a first-team return at St James' Park on Wednesday evening, and while he knows there is more hard work to be done, he is glad to be back and already looking towards the start of next season. De Jong said: 'I haven't repaid the fans a lot this season, so I hope to be playing a couple of games, maybe, at the end of the season. 'But I have to focus on next season and be really fit then and hopefully I can show the fans what I can do, and show myself and show my team-mates what I can do.' John Carver will be looking to put Newcastle's dreadful run to an end having lost their last five matches .","Siem de Jong signed for Newcastle last summer from Dutch giants Ajax .

"A new financial survey has confirmed what Australians already know. We live in the most expensive country in the world. The annual survey from Deutsche Bank has shown that for the fourth consecutive year, Australians pay higher prices for a range of consumer goods and services than are paid in any other place. A survey has shown Australia to be most expensive country in the world for the fourth year in a row . A luxurious hotel room in Sydney will set you back around $1126 per night, $640 more than in New York . The survey uses the purchasing power parity index to determine the relative price levels to the US dollar. It found that Australian prices are at 112 per cent of the US, meaning that we pay $1.12 to every $US1. The United States remains the world's cheapest developed country. New Zealand came in as the second most expensive country in the world and the United Kingdom was third. The index used a wide-ranging scale of differently priced items to judge the most costly country in the world. Sydney has the most expensive five star hotel rooms in the world which cost an 132 per cent more than their equivalent in New York. A luxurious Sydney hotel room will set you back $1126 per night with New York being much more reasonable at $485. A two-litre bottle of Coca Cola also tops the charts in Australia at $4.30, 51 percent more than New York. While Brazil has the most expensive iPhone 6's at nearly double the price of the United States, Australia's iPhone's still cost over $151 more than America. The report found that Australian prices are at 112 percent of the US, meaning that we pay $1.12 to every $US 1 .

"Baggage handlers at Miami International Airport have been caught on video as they steal items from passenger luggage. The Miami-Dade Police Department set up a hidden camera to deal with the ongoing problem of luggage theft, and found workers rifling through checked bags both before they were loaded onto planes and once inside the aircraft's belly. This as it is revealed that airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014. Scroll down for video . Police also caught baggage handlers at Miami International Airport (above) stealing from passenger luggage after installing a hidden camera . A baggage handler (above) at JFK Airport in New York was also caught on camera going through a passenger's wallet . CNN reports that 31 employees have been arrested for theft in Miami since 2012, including six this year. Incidents of theft at that airport are far less however that New York's John F. Kennedy, which has more claims of lost property that anywhere else in the country. In 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera at that airport, and found workers stealing cash, jewelry, iPhones and iPads, which led to six arrests. Across the country in Los Angeles, 16 airport workers were fired last year after police obtained search warrants for their homes following a increase in reported thefts at the terminal where they were employed. 'We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work,' said Patrick Gannon, the police chief at that airport. Overall, there have been 30,621 claims of missing valuables since 2010, with most of these coming from checked luggage. Of those claims, 2,493 occurred at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014 (above a JFK employee) Most shocking however may be how easy it is for airport employees to steal, with only Orlando and Miami screening employees through metal detectors as they arrive at work and only Miami screening them when they leave. Since 2002, the TSA has fired 513 workers for theft, though it is now known how many of them faced criminal charges. Gannon believes that theft is not the only problem either, as it could lead to bigger threats in the nation's airports. 'I absolutely think that if we don't pay attention to the small things that happen around here, that it could lead to much larger things. So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism.'","Police caught baggage handlers at Miami International Airport stealing from passenger luggage after installing a hidden camera .

Some moments captured include Winter bouncing up and down on the bed, him pushing Leo the cat off a chair, and then curling up with his feline friend for a nap. Winter also runs across the yard to Ms Hussein when he's called, headbutts chairs, bleats loudly, and snuggles ducklings. Liz the bearded dragon can understand English and nods when she wants something to eat, while baby ducklings follow their carer around the yard when they're called. Kyah the budgie likes to drink from water bottles, and Moey the kitten tries to attack his own reflection in the mirror.

Shingleback lizard's also live on Ms Hussein 's farm, in Rockbank about 35 kilometres from Melbourne . Ms Hussein's cats like to watch as she feeds the turtles, and Ozzie the emu which used to live on the farm liked to chase sheep. The young woman said although she does have other interests, much of her time is spent outside watching all that unfolds. 'In the warmer weather I'm usually out the door and outside and spending time with all the baby animals,' she said. 'In spring it's the craziest, we have baby animals everywhere. 'There was a time where we had baby ducks, baby geese and even baby emus and they were following me everywhere, it was so cute,' Ms Hussein added. Most of the animals on the farm get on well apart from the few that have to be kept separate, and some unlikely friendships have formed between many different species. 'We can't have the dogs with most of the animals, the cats are fine with all the animals except for the rabbits and the mice,' the young woman revealed. This little baby duckling is just one of the small creatures which inhabit the farm . Ms Hussein's ducklings and baby geese often follow her around and like to cuddle up to her . She said while it is her family farm, she is the most obsessed with caring for all the creatures great and small . This is the family's camel Alana . Winter the lamb often features in Vine videos, running across the yard when he is called or chasing ducklings . Here an emu chick snuggles up next to a ginger cat . For Ms Hussein, a life surrounded by a whole lot of different creatures is the only one she knows, and she says it's always filled with surprises. 'From a very young age I was taught how to care for baby animals and how to properly handle them. 'One of the earliest animals i got the chance of hand rearing that I can remember was a baby cockatiel which had been abandoned by her mum, and still have to this day, it's name is Squeaky,' she said. And while much of her day is spent filled with cuddles and funny moments, life on her farm isn't always fun and games. 'I spend quite a bit of time cleaning and feeding my animals, some of which need to be fed multiple times a day,' Ms Hussein revealed. ' 'My parents are a big help and often help me with the animals when needed as well as caring for the bigger animals outside and their own pets.' Ms Hussein also has two Akitas, Kumi and Rambo . Many little bunnies also roam the grounds, like this little guy celebrating Easter . A group of emu chicks pose for the camera, showing off their distinctive markings . Fredde was around the house as a pet kangaroo while the young woman was growing up . Ozzie the emu lived with Ms Hussein for many years before he moved to a wildlife park . This pond yard out the back is where many of the birds like to hang out, and where the turtles live . Some of the 21-year-old's favourite moments growing up include: 'a pet turkey which gave handshakes, a possum that slept in my bed, different species of animals interacting and enjoying each other's company'. For years she simply kept all these memories to herself, but now she has realised there is a whole audience of people who want to share these moments too. One video of Ms Hussein's lamb Winter has almost 40 million loops, and is still climbing more than eight months later. 'I was just so shocked at the attention my Vines attracted, I was only expecting to share my clips with a small audience.' Vine is a video sharing app which allows users to post six second long clips. They can be reposted, commented on and views are counted in 'loops'. When originally posted, the video of Winter bounding down the hallway of the house was shared by Taylor Swift, Ashton Kutcher, Ariana Grande and picked up by Ellen Degeneres and MTV. Winter the lamb runs across the yard to Ms Hussein when he is called . Miniature ponies also make up some of the residents at the farm . This turkey duckling is one of many which fill the fields, especially during spring . The young woman said she can't imagine a 'normal' life without all her crazy pets . 'Famous people were retweeting it and stuff and I didn't know how to react… I was numb,' the animal lover revealed. 'It amazes me how much something so simple as a lamb bouncing down the hall can mean so much to someone else.' Asked if she would live any other way, Ms Hussein said she doesn't believe she could. 'I can't see myself ever living in a ""normal"" house without pets.'","Shannen Hussein lives on a farm in Rockbank, north-west of Melbourne .

"Jurgen Klopp put England's top clubs on alert on Wednesday by confirming that he will leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season after seven years in charge. Klopp was immediately installed as the bookmakers' favourite to replace Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City, although it is understood that the struggling Premier League champions have no plans to make such a move. The colourful 47-year-old coach has been linked with several other English teams in the past, including Liverpool and Arsenal, and has a long-standing interest in working here. Jurgen Klopp confirmed in a press conference he is to leave Borussia Dortmund this summer . An emotional Klopp said he believed Dortmund need a change of manager next season .

MAN CITY – The Premier League champions are unlikely to deviate from their top target Pep Guardiola as speculation continues to surround Manuel Pellegrini's future – 3/10 . LIVERPOOL – Klopp has been linked with the Anfield job on previous occasions but Brendan Rodgers has come through a difficult spell and appears to be safe – 5/10 . ARSENAL – With the Gunners on course for second place and the chance to retain the FA Cup, it would be a surprise if they looked to replace Arsene Wenger now – 4/10 . BAYERN MUNICH – Klopp has appeared on Bayern's radar before and could do so again despite their intense rivalry with Dortmund – 6/10 . REAL MADRID – Carlo Ancelotti is on thin ice at the Bernabeu but Klopp has said he wants to work at a club where he speaks the language – 6/10 . He is among the most highly-rated managers in European football after winning two Bundesliga titles and the German Cup at the Westfalenstadion, as well as leading Dortmund to the Champions League final in 2013. Klopp insisted that he has not had any contact with other clubs but confirmed that he is open to offers, denying reports that he will take a sabbatical after a difficult season in which Dortmund have struggled towards the bottom of the table. 'I am sure that the decision is absolutely right,' he said at an emotional press conference. 'This team deserves to have the absolutely one hundred per cent right coach. I believe that Borussia Dortmund actually needs a change. As long as I'm here, we are always considering the successes of the past. 'What I have always said in the last few years is that in that moment when I feel I won't be the perfect manager for this incredible club then I would say it. 'I have of course every now and then thought about the topic in past years because it is always important to question yourself. I have though in the last weeks and days asked myself if I'm still the right manager. I wasn't sure but I couldn't answer with a yes. 'I have had no contact with others clubs, either in England or elsewhere, but I am not planning a sabbatical. 'I don't think of it as a load off my shoulders.

That would free up City's top target Guardiola to move to the Etihad and take over from Pellegrini whose future remains uncertain following a disappointing second season in English football. Neither will there be any shortage of top European clubs hoping to lure Klopp away from Germany where he has built an exciting team to challenge Bayern's dominance.

"Aaron Lennon has finally found something to smile about but Roberto Martinez carried the frown of a man down on his luck as he headed for the bus home. That’s not to say this was a bad day for Everton. They have had plenty of those in this long season over land and sea and could yet finish in the lower half of the Premier League for the first time since 2006. But this one frustrated the Spaniard. His side have found a degree of freedom since their European travels came to an end and in winning three on the trot they started to resemble the side that blitzed their way through last season. Jonjo Shelvey converted from 12 yards to rescue a point for Swansea after Seamus Coleman handled in the penalty box . Shelvey made no mistake from the spot as the former Liverpool midfielder sends Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard the wrong way . The midfielder salutes the home crowd after netting the equaliser for Swansea in the Saturday lunch-time kick-off . Seamus Coleman falls over under the challenge from Marvin Emnes and handles the ball, according to the watching Michael Oliver . Coleman appears to apologise to the visiting section at the full-time whistle . This game, in the mind of Martinez but not many others, should have been the fourth win of a streak. The contentious moment came in the second half when, having led through Lennon’s first-half strike, they conceded a penalty. Seamus Coleman was under pressure from Marvin Emnes, fell forward under marginal contact and then handled the ball. Martinez called for a foul on Coleman; Michael Oliver called a penalty for handball and Jonjo Shelvey buried the kick. Everton’s manager seethed as three points became one and then gave the kind of comments that suggested this fixture was not the dead rubber it appeared to be. ‘We feel like it was a defeat,’ he said. ‘It is difficult to take. I am very satisfied with the performance because they are a difficult side to play. Look at the way they open teams up like Arsenal and Manchester United. ‘For the first 20 or 25 minutes of the second half it was too easy. We just couldn’t find the second goal. You are exposed at 1-0 and something happened. ‘Seamus felt there was contact. Seamus loses his balance and as he falls he ends up touching the ball with his hand. There was no goalscoring threat whatsoever. The referee in those moments can make his own decision but I think it was very harsh. ‘He should have applied a bit of common sense. From my point of view, seeing it in a biased way, I would have wanted to see a free-kick awarded. Two or three actions straight after it was exactly the same and given as a free-kick. That is disappointing. You want some consistency.’ Swansea City (4-3-3): Fabianski 6.5; Rangel 6, Fernandez 6, Williams 6, Taylor 6; Ki 6.5, Cork 6.5, Shelvey 7.5 (Dyer 83); Sigurdsson 6, Gomis 6 (Emnes 17, 6.5), Routledge 6.5 .

CLICK HERE to see more from our brilliant match zone. Aaron Lennon celebrates with Seamus Coleman and Ross Barkley (left) after he opened the scoring for Everton at the Liberty Stadium . Lennon, on loan from Tottenham for the remainder of the season, fires in his second goal in three games for Roberto Martinez's side . Lennon's strike in the 41st minute came against the run of play with Swansea having dominated much of the opening half . While an argument could be made for the penalty, the comments on performance were less easy to accept. Swansea did not deserve to win but they certainly did not deserve to lose a game in which Garry Monk felt Arouna Kone might been sent off. There was also a wonderful goal from Shelvey disallowed in the first half because Wayne Routledge was adjudged to have fouled Leighton Baines. It appeared to be a harsh call. Monk said: ‘I was disappointed with the disallowed goal. I thought it was very harsh on what could have been one of the goals of the season.’ So, one referee and two disgruntled managers. Monk at least had the consolation of watching Shelvey have one of those days when the correct parts of his brain are in operation. He is capable of winning matches and losing matches - a blessing and a curse dictated by his emotions. But he was excellent here, driving Swansea early in the game before Lennon put Everton in front on 41 minutes. Fittingly it was Shelvey whose penalty ultimately claimed Swansea's 47th point of the season – equalling their Premier League record from 2012. Monk said: ‘The plan was three points and to get it (the record) in front of our fans. There is a slight disappointment and that shows how far we have come.’ Garry Monk and Roberto Martinez share an embrace in the dugout ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash at the Liberty Stadium .

"Tim Howard is adamant the Europa League is not to blame for Everton delivering what might be their worse season for nine years. Perhaps the goalkeeper would have been better off hiding behind conventional wisdom, considering the disappointment of this elongated campaign which could yet see Everton finish in the bottom half of the Premier League for the first time since 2006. Those prospects are dwindling, courtesy of a four-game unbeaten run, but there is no mistaking that Roberto Martinez’s side have fallen way below the standards set last season. The gap between their status now and after 32 games last season is 25 points, the difference between targeting a Champions League place and chasing the top 10. Tim Howard is adamant the Europa League is not to blame for Everton's poor season in the Premier League . The Merseyside outfit played 10 games in Europe this season before being knocked out by Dynamo Kiev . Aaron Lennon scored for Everton at Swansea City but the game ended in a 1-1 draw at the Liberty Stadium . Swansea City (4-3-3): Fabianski 6.5; Rangel 6, Fernandez 6, Williams 6, Taylor 6; Ki 6.5, Cork 6.5, Shelvey 7.5 (Dyer 83mins); Sigurdsson 6, Gomis 6 (Emnes 17, 6.5), Routledge 6.5. Subs not used: Amat, Britton, Grimes, Tremmel, Fulton. Booked: Taylor, Emnes, Williams. Everton (4-2-3-1): Howard 6.5; Coleman 6, Stones 6, Jagielka 6.5, Baines 6.5; McCarthy 6.5, Barry 7; Lennon 6.5, Barkley 5.5 (Mirallas 86), Osman 6 (Pienaar 28, 6); Kone 5 (Naismith 76). Subs not used: Robles, Besic, Garbutt, Alcaraz. Booked: Kone, Howard, Lennon. Man of the match: Jonjo Shelvey. Referee: Michael Oliver 5. Attendance: 20,468. The demands of playing 10 games in the Europa League have certainly taken their toll but Howard rejected that theory, saying: ‘That’s something that’s been talked about for the last five or 10 years but it’s just a blanket statement people make. Champions League teams have to do the same thing. ‘They play Wednesday and Saturday and it’s tough but no-one blames Champions League football. Every football team does not have a god given right to be anywhere. ‘We’ve put in honest performances but things just haven’t gone our way. We could sit here and make a list of a thousand different things but it’s not the Europa League or anything else.’ The perception that luck has not gone Everton’s way extended to Saturday when Aaron Lennon’s first-half strike was cancelled out by a Jonjo Shelvey penalty. Martinez was incensed by the award of a penalty though it appeared a reasonable decision. Neither side came out of the fixture unscathed, with Leon Osman of Everton and Swansea City’s Bafetimbi Gomis due to have scans today on respective groin and hamstring injuries. Howard will not allow Europe to be an excuse for what could be Everton's worst season in nine years . Jonjo Shelvey of Swansea scores past Howard with a penalty to level the scores on Saturday afternoon . Swansea manager Garry Monk confirmed a striker is top of his summer wishlist after being left with no fit front men, while Everton, in the shorter-term, have been told to finish in the top half. Howard added: ‘There’s a points total we want to achieve and get ourselves in the top half of the table.’ SUPER STAT: Everton named an unchanged team in the league for the first time since March 2014 against Fulham.

"Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe's rival for IAAF president, launched his election manifesto on Wednesday with a promise to take a hardline approach to doping. The Ukrainian pole vault great is battling with fellow IAAF vice-president Coe for the top job at athletics' world governing body. The sport has been rocked by allegations that doping and cover-ups are rife in Russian athletics. Sergey Bubka launched his election manifesto on Wednesday with a promise to crack down on doping . Bubka is Sebastian Coe's rival for IAAF president, the top job at athletics' world governing body . Bubka launched his manifesto, entitled 'Taking Athletics to New Heights' in an internet broadcast and presented his plans for the future of the sport. Speaking on Wednesday, the 51-year-old said: 'We need to show clear zero tolerance for doping.' Bubka said there was 'no acceptance for cheaters', adding: 'We must protect clean sport, clear athletics.' Bubka also called for a 'very deep study' to look at the possibility of imposing sanctions on national federations who have a high number of doping cases, given the associated legal complications. 'You would like to do many more sanctions, you would like to do more punishment, but to combine it legally it's always created an issue,' he said. Bubka launched his manifesto, entitled 'Taking Athletics to New Heights' in an internet broadcast . 'We need to study legally how we can strengthen our position, in which way we can put sanctions, if we need to put sanctions on the national federation which violates, I believe this issue needs to have very deep study.' He emphasised the need to hold members of an athlete's entourage, like coaches and doctors, to account in doping cases, the importance of education in the fight against doping and collaboration with the World Anti-Doping Agency and national federations. In his manifesto, Bubka also stressed the importance of engaging with a younger audience and attracting younger participants and of helping to strengthen national associations. An Anti-Doping test is taken during the  European Athletics Championship in Zurich in August last year . 'Strong national associations mean a strong IAAF,' he said. He outlined his plans for an extensive review of the sport called Vision 2025. 'Vision 2025 aims to identify and examine every significant element of our sport and determine how it can be improved to ensure we are in the best possible shape for the future,' he added. The vote to decide whether Coe or Bubka will succeed Lamine Diack takes place in Beijing in August . Bubka said, if elected, he would create the new position of chief executive, set up a business commission and look to attract new global sponsors. 'The IAAF is a global brand and we must generate greater commercial revenue,' he said. The vote to decide who will succeed the long-standing IAAF president Lamine Diack will take place at the IAAF Congress in Beijing in August.","Sergey Bubka launched a manifesto ahead of running to be IAAF president .

The Brazilian defender is out of contract this summer, sparking rumours about his future . He told beIN Sports: 'I am very happy at Barcelona and I have not signed with anyone. 'In life, you have to be thankful. Barca are a club that changed my life, made me realise all my dreams. I'll get to the end of my contract with the same ambition as when I came here.' 'If the club asks me to look for another alternative, then I'll look at the other options. But for now, this is not the case. I stay focused on the end of the season because I'm still a competitor. A decision will be made at the end of the season.' The likes of Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly interested in signing Alves . Speaking last week, Dinorah Santana, the player's agent and ex-wife, said at a press conference that her client had rejected the offer of a three-year contract extension, which was dependent on the player taking part in 60 per cent of matches for the club. 'The negotiations are over,' she said. 'If they say this is the final offer, then they (negotiations) are over. 'It doesn't make sense. It's very hard that we get to April and Barcelona haven't thought about renewing Dani's contract.","Barcelona star Dani Alves is out of contract at the end of the season .

"Barcelona will offer £50million for in-demand Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, and plan to let him stay in Italy for a year on loan. Spanish press reports indicate Chelsea are their only rivals for the Frenchman's signature. Pogba is one of Europe's most in demand young talents but Spanish paper SPORT say that the leaders in La Liga and the Barclays Premier League are the only two viable destinations for the 22-year-old Frenchman. With Barcelona currently under the restrictions of a FIFA-imposed transfer ban until the January window, Pogba would have to be loaned back to Juve until the 2016-17 season as part of any prospective deal. SPORT say Barcelona will make a £50m offer for Paul Pogba while Marca look at the race for La Liga . Pogba is said to be the subject of a £50m bid from Barca with Chelsea their only realistic transfer rivals . Lionel Messi returned to training for Barcelona after a foot problem ahead of facing Celta Vigo . SPORT claim that Pogba has listened to Barca's offer but is yet to decide on his future with four years remaining on his contract with the Italian champions. The Catalan daily also say that Lionel Messi has recovered from a problem with swelling on his foot to start for Barca in their return to La Liga against Celta Vigo on Sunday after making it through a training session unscathed. Also in Spain, Marca look at Real Madrid's quest to overhaul their perennial rivals at the top of La Liga. They say that if Real win their final 10 games to take a total points haul of 94, they can count on winning the title. That might be easier said than done, however. No team has won their last 10 games in La Liga in the last decade, no matter how sure Real are that Barca will falter. L'Equipe look ahead to a big weekend in the French title race, A Bola pin Benfica's hopes on Nicolas Gaitan . David Luiz and PSG have made their way to the top of Ligue 1 but that position will be challenge this weekend . Marseille and their star striker Andre-Pierre Gignac will want to knock PSG off the top of the table . It's a huge weekend in France with Le Classique top of the bill, Lyon getting the opportunity to top the table and Monaco taking on St Etienne. With that in mind, L'Equipe go with the headline: 'The hunt is on'. Champions PSG are still in with a shout of an unprecedented treble, sitting top of Ligue 1 with eight games to go, in the semi-finals of the French Cup and having reached the last eight of the Champions League. But their abilities are certain to be tested on Sunday night in a first vs third clash against Marseille at a packed 67,394-capacity Stade Velodrome. A difficult April schedule makes it important that PSG stay top of the table in Marseille, having struggled to maintain a title challenge for much of the season. Gaitan is viewed as the key man for Benfica as they look to open up a gap on Porto in Portugal . Manager Jorge Jesus said Gaitan is a star of different characteristics to his other players, with no equal . With nearest rivals Porto faltering, A Bola in France focus on Nicolas Gaitan's position as Benfica's leader as they look to wrap up the Primeira Liga title in the coming weeks. Benfica boss Jorge Jesus said of Gaitan: 'Nico is a player of different characteristics, we have no equal to him. 'He's a player with a lot of influence and he can be with us for many years. He is a leader on the pitch and it's good to know that he will be with us.' Benfica face Nacional on Saturday hoping to keep up their excellent home form which has seen them concede just two goals at the Estadio da Luz all season. The Italian papers have gone big on the race for a place in next season's Champions League . Carlos Tevez (left) could add PSG to his list of clubs if reports in the Italian press are to be believed . Finally, the Italian papers are going big on the race with the Champions League. Both Corriere dello Sport and Tuttosport look to Saturday's Roma-Napoli showdown as the first of a few clashes to decide the placings at the top of the table come the end of the season. Corriere also note that PSG could be a possible destination for Pogba, and that they are looking for a double swoop on Juventus with Carlos Tevez also a target. There is also a small mention for how Carlo Ancelotti could return to manage AC Milan from Real Madrid if the Spanish club call time on their Italian manager.","Spanish paper SPORT say Barcelona want to sign Juventus' Paul Pogba .

"British No 2 Aljaz Bedene was unable to sustain his strong run since switching allegiance from Slovenia, crashing out of the Grand Prix Hassan II in Casablanca in the last eight. The world No 99 had breezed past fellow-qualifier Arthur De Greef of Belgium in a 70-minute, straight-sets victory to set up his quarter-final clash - but was unable to dislodge Czech young gun Jiri Vesely on Friday. Vesely saw off Bedene 6-1 6-4 to reach the final four and tee up a clash with Spanish veteran Daniel Gimeno-Traver. Aljaz Bedene, who has switched from Slovenia to Great Britain, lost in Casablanca (not pictured) The 21-year-old rising Czech star put paid to Bedene's good start to life under the official British banner, after the London-based 25-year-old changed nationality last month. Vesely saw off Mikhail Youzhny on Thursday despite all his luggage being lost in transit from Rome and borrowing kit from doubles partner Frantisek Cermak. That victory ended a seven-match losing streak, and he continued his resurgence to sweep past Bedene without issue. Bedene's conqueror Jiri Vesely of the Czech Republic will play Gimeno-Traver in the semi-finals . Vesely's next opponent Gimeno-Traver dropped just six points on his first serve in a 6-4 6-3 victory over Lamine Ouahab.

"Jordan Spieth has hailed the 'most incredible week' of his life after becoming the second youngest Masters winner of all time and  the first start-to-finish winner at Augusta in 39 years. Spieth held his nerve in Sunday's final round to keep control of the season's first major championship, matching Tiger Woods' record of an 18-under 270 and finishing four shots clear of the field. Speaking in Butler cabin as he prepared to receive his green jacket, the 21-year-old admitted that despite never giving up the lead, he was still a bag of nerves as he looked to hold off the attentions of two major champions in the form of Phil Mickelson and Justin Rose. Jordan Spieth has hailed the 'most incredible week' of his life after winning the Masters at Augusta . Spieth poses in his green jacket having held his nerve in Sunday's final round in a start-to-finish victory . 'It was very nerve-racking today,' Spieth said. 'I thought today might be a little easier than yesterday having played a round with the lead but it wasn't. I didn't sleep well last night, just got out here and got in a bit of rhythm and we were off. With two major champions behind I couldn't let up. 'It's the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport, this is a dream come true for me. To shoot some low rounds and to see some putts go in out here and to hear those roars, it was remarkable.' Spieth was greeted by his family at the 18th green, with his father telling him to do a lap of honour for all the patrons round the 18th green. And the Texan said that it was the moment of seeing his loved ones where it finally dawned on him that he was going to win. Spieth hugs his father Shawn at the 18th green, and he admitted that seeing his family made things sink in . Of seeing his family and friends, Spieth said: 'at that point knew that it was going to be a done deal' Spieth hugs his grandfather Bob but later said that even then the excitement of winning hadn't fully kicked in . 'I saw my family and friends right behind the green, and at that point knew that it was going to be a done deal,' he said. 'To be honest, it didn't kick in there, it still hasn't kicked in. I'm still kind of in shock a little bit. 'I'm sure it'll settle in maybe a little later but it was really great to share that experience with my family who weren't there any of the couple of times I had one so to be at this one was special.' Asked what was next for him, having fulfilled a life-long ambition, Spieth said: 'I want to be like Bubba (Watson), I want to win two Masters! Spieth led from start to finish at Augusta, the first time that feat has been achieved in 39 years . The 21-year-old reacts after sinking his final putt to win the 2015 Masters Tournament on Sunday . 'I'm excited already to come back, I'm excited for the opportunity ahead this year to be the reigning Masters champion, I know that's going to carry a heavy weight with it and I hope to be ready for it.' Rose, who finished on 14-under had nothing but praise for the young champion. 'There's many players in the Tiger  era who have rued when Tiger won it by 15 or 12. Ernie Els, for example, could have won a bunch more major championships if it wasn't for one guy. 'Jordan seems to have that same quality right now and he's very comfortable playing with a lead. A 14 under round here... I'll take that every year and take my chances.'

"The superstitious will know – or perhaps those who have seen Alfred Hitchcock's classic film The Birds – that a bird in the house is a bad omen and one that is said to equate to death. So a family in Texas would  be forgiven for being slightly put out about the fact that their home became infested with them. According to the video maker, who returns home with the other people in the clip to find the infestation, the birds came in through the chimney. The video maker stated that he initially thought the intruders were bats but now believes them to be sparrows . Capturing them on camera as they fly around the room, the man remains very calm while narrating on the carnage before him – birds crashing into the walls and flying overhead. He says: ‘There are birds everywhere, what the hell, look at this,’ before reiterating his point and recoiling as one crashes into him. A female voice then speaks out – also extremely calmly considering the fact the front room has been turned into an aviary. Despite the infestation of birds in their front room, the family remain very calm throughout the video . According to the video maker the birds managed to invade the house through the chimney . The lady says: ‘Careful not to step on them,’ as the video maker points out that some of the birds appear to be dying, as they lie on the ground. The filmmaker then states: ‘This is awful,’ and suggests that the group need to find a way to get the birds out of the house. The video concludes with the filmmaker continuing to record the birds as they circle the room and bounce off the walls. The video maker states that the scene is awful as a number of birds crash into the walls and end up on the floor . According to the video maker there were around 30 birds in the front room when the group came home. Speaking on another video, he also states that he initially thought they were bats before realising they were birds and potentially sparrows.","Family stay remarkably calm as birds fly around the room .

"Andy Murray has shown nerves of steel on the tennis court, but the British No 1 appeared slightly overwhelmed by the occasion during his wedding rehearsal on Friday. The former Wimbledon champion is marrying his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears in his hometown of Dunblane on Saturday and visited the cathedral to run through the service with friends, family and his fiancee. The pair have been together for 10 years after meeting at the 2005 US Open. They got back together after a brief split in 2010 before announcing their engagement last year. Andy Murray looked understandably nervous as he arrived for his wedding rehearsal . Murray arrives at Dunblane Cathedral to run through the wedding service ahead of his big day .

Murray will forego a traditional honeymoon to fly to Barcelona after his nuptials to take a look at prospective new assistant coach Jonas Bjorkman - an appointment that has taken on greater significance since his coach Amelie Mauresmo announced she is pregnant. It is understood that the 27 year-old Scot has known about Mauresmo' s pregnancy for a number of weeks, but he was anyway planning on linking up with Bjorkman – the former world singles No 4 and doubles No 1 – prior to that. As Sportsmail reported as far back as nearly a year ago, the Swede was on Murray's shortlist to replace Ivan Lendl before he settled on the former Wimbledon women's champion as part of a groundbreaking move.

"A Chihuahua and a bearded dragon showed off their interspecies friendship when they embarked upon a game of tag together. Videoed in their front room, the dog named Foxxy Cleopatra and the reptile called Ryuu can be seen chasing after one another around a coffee table. Standing perfectly still while looking in the other direction, the bearded dragon initially appears disinterested as the Chihuahua jumps around excitedly. The video begins with the Chihuahua jumping around excitedly while the bearded dragon appears disinterested . The reptile then turns to face the dog, causing it to bark, run off and watch from a safe distance behind the table. Without warning, the bearded dragon then charges at full speed towards the dog and forces it to make a quick retreat. Pausing at the end of the table, the reptile waits as the sneaky dog creeps up behind it before pivoting and running after it again. The Chihuahua named Foxxy Cleopatra stalks the bearded dragon on a number of ocassions in the video . The video maker said that the Chihuahua never tries to hurt the dragon and loves to chase after him . The video maker, named Meo Madeley, can then be heard laughing as the bearded dragon becomes even more animated and chases the dog in a circle. Later in the clip the dog creeps up behind the reptile but remains twitchy and nervous as it prepares to run away at any minute. According to the video maker, who is believed to live in Canada, the pair completely love one another. The filmmaker can then be heard laughing as the bearded dragon  chases the dog around the coffee table . She wrote in the comment section of the original video: ‘They seriously love to play together. I love to watch them. ‘Our Chihuahua never tries to hurt the dragon, she really loves to chase him and our dragon gets excited whenever she comes into the room because he thinks it's time to play. They make us laugh all the time.’ Interestingly however, Ms Madeley also stated that the love is entirely loyal as their other pet hardly gets a look in. ‘Our beardie doesn't like our cat, so we don't let them play together. He will [only] play with the cat if the dog is around because he really likes our dog,’ said the video maker. He's behind you!

"Instead of enjoying a conventional honeymoon after his wedding on Saturday Andy Murray will be heading to Barcelona next week for a training block that has now taken on a much increased significance. For in the wake of Amelie Mauresmo's announcement that she is pregnant, the world No 3's trial with his prospective assistant coach Jonas Bjorkman has assumed a greater importance. Mauresmo, who is to give birth some time in August, will be around eight months' pregnant during Wimbledon this summer, which is not finishing until July 12 due to the new three week gap between Roland Garros and The Championships. Andy Murray celebrates taking a set against Novak Djokovic in the final of the Miami Open . The British No 1 is set to marry his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears in Dunblane on Saturday . Therefore Bjorkman is likely to have a key part to play as Murray attempts to regain his title at SW19 – something which, given his improved form during the first part of the season and his prowess on grass, is well within his reach this year. Beyond that the 43 year-old Swede may also come into his own, as it is unclear how this will affect Mauresmo's 26 week per year commitment to the Scot, which is almost exclusively spent on the road. She also has the part-time job of being Captain of the French Fed Cup team, who are in action next weekend. Mauresmo has never made any secret of the fact that the travel is the part of the job that least appeals to her, and that will inevitably become more complicated with a baby on board. Already it must be very questionable whether she would be at the US Open which begins at the end of the August, although there has been no comment on this from either her or Murray, who has been up in Scotland ahead of tying the knot with Kim Sears in Dunblane. Murray's current coach Amelie Mauresmo has recently announced that she is expecting a baby . Mauresmo, pictured at this year's Australian Open, may have to alter her coaching schedule after the birth . It is understood that the 27 year-old Scot has known about Mauresmo' s pregnancy for a number of weeks, but he was anyway planning on linking up with Bjorkman – the former world singles No 4 and doubles No 1 – prior to that. As Sportsmail reported as far back as nearly a year ago, the Swede was on Murray's shortlist to replace Ivan Lendl before he settled on the former Wimbledon women's champion as part of a groundbreaking move. A personable and intelligent man still actively involved in the game, and as someone who made the absolute best of his natural ability, he was someone the Scot identified as prime coaching material. Murray has been planning to work with former world No 3 Jonas Bjorkman as an assistant coach . The Swede, pictured winning Wimbledon with Todd Woodbridge, is a former world No 1 doubles player . Last week in Miami Murray reported that the two of them had recently spent two hours on the phone together, and he has not been able to join up before because he has been involved with Sweden's version of Strictly Come Dancing. 'The time flew by,' the British No 1 said of their highly satisfactory conversation. It would be a major surprise if they somehow did not get along, or if he did not fit in with others in the team, including Mauresmo. Just where this leaves the player and his 35 year-old head coach will be for the two of them to work out. The softly-spoken Mauresmo is a very private person who prefers to keep a low profile on the tennis side of things, let alone on matters to do with her personal life. Bjorkman could have a key part to play in Murray's quest to reclaim the Wimbledon title he won in 2013 . She is known to have been accompanied by a girlfriend on trips with Murray to Australia and America this year, who stays in the background to the point where she has been near enough invisible. However pleased Murray will be for his coach on a personal basis – and there is no question they have become very close – he might also feel that the last thing he needs is any further complication or upheaval within his support team. His form has been good this year after all the disruptions and departures of last season, and Bjorkman appeared to be the last piece slotting into place. Now the Swede could find himself with a bigger role than was initially bargained for.","Andy Murray is getting married to long-term girlfriend Kim Sears .

"A moment of madness from England hooker Tom Youngs handed Saracens victory but the second-placed Londoners were frustrated by their failure to earn a four-try bonus. With Leicester 6-0 up after 37 minutes, Youngs was sin-binned for a barge on Chris Ashton, who had passed the ball to Richard Wigglesworth and as he tried to return the favour Tigers Matt Smith grabbed it. Ashton was nowhere near getting the ball, which made Youngs' action even more senseless. Saracens scored two tries with him off and the game was as good over at 14-6 when he came back.

'It is cynical and it was a moment of madness but he does a lot of good things for us. I was disappointed with our discipline because you can't do that. It gets you in trouble and it did today.' Billy Vunipola scored after Youngs' exit and Marcelo Bosch scored after the break.

Director of rugby Mark McCall said: 'There is frustration in the dressing room because we scored our third try after 48 minutes and not much happened after that.

"Beef at a good price . If Ian Botham is going to watch his Test wickets record get beaten by Jimmy Anderson, he might as well earn himself a bit of cash doing it. After spotting that SkyBet were offering 9/4 on the Lancashire seamer to take four wickets in the first innings on Wednesday morning, Beefy, who remains England’s leading wicket-taker for the time being with 383, tweeted: ‘I’ll have a go at that price!!!’ Sir Ian Botham was tempted to bet on Jimmy Anderson breaking his record on the third morning in Antigua . Daddy’s girl . With Botham’s record in his sights, all eyes at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium were on Anderson — including those of his wife Daniella and daughter Ruby Luxe. But the Burnley Express kept everyone waiting, and watching Test cricket can be a hard slog for anyone — let alone a four-year-old. Anderson's wife Daniella and daughter watch the action from the stands at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium . Swanny’s funny . While tributes were paid to Anderson on Test Match Special at lunch, former team-mate Graeme Swann revealed how he used to wind him up. ‘It was great when his face was on the back of all of those London buses last year — just so I could say to him “You’ve got a face like the back of a bus”,’ said Swann. Anderson picked up one wicket on day three, but is still one shy of Botham's record of 383 dismissals . Moeen spinning in . The ECB announced on Wednesday that Moeen Ali has been called up for the next Test in Grenada. The question is, where will he fit into the first XI with off-spinner James Tredwell bowling so well? It would be embarrassing for Moeen if he was kept out of the England team by a man who can’t get into his own county side. Moeen Ali, pictured playing for Worcestershire, has been added to the England squad for the remaining Tests . Blackwood frustrates Ben . By far the most interesting on-pitch battle was between Ben Stokes and Jermaine Blackwood. The West Indies’ sixth man in scored 112 in the first innings, much to the frustration of Stokes — and not just because of the eight boundaries the Jamaican hit off him. After Tuesday’s no-ball episode, Stokes narrowly missed out on Blackwood’s wicket twice on Wednesday  — seeing an edge dropped by James Tredwell at slip, followed by a close lbw denial upheld by the third umpire. Jermaine Blackwood hit his maiden Test match century in his sixth match for the West Indies on Wednesday . Ben Stokes was frustrated twice when he thought he dismissed Blackwood, adding to Tuesday's no-ball . Five-star Jos . Tredwell rightly took the plaudits on day three, but Jos Buttler put in a tidy performance with the gloves. The Lancashire wicketkeeper took five catches for the first time in a Test innings. He’s only the second keeper to do so against West Indies, after Jack Russell in 1990. Jos Buttler took five catches for the first time in a Test innings, only the second England 'keeper to do so .

Yarde excelled in Saturday's roller-coaster Aviva Premiership victory over Gloucester, scoring the crucial try in the 70th minute at The Stoop. The 22-year-old wing won the last of his seven caps as a replacement last autumn, but was overlooked by England throughout the RBS 6 Nations. Harlequins winger Charlie Walker crosses for his side's first try at the Stoop . ‘We’ve had a difficult year, but anyone who has watched him will know he’s been absolutely outstanding. When we get back to winning he will get recognition again,’ O'Shea said. Quins spent most of an uninspiring mid-table clash feeding off scraps due to the overwhelming superiority of the visiting scrum, only to produce the key drive in the 70th minute that was finished by Marland Yarde. As half time drew close, referee Luke Pearce had finally lost patience with Harlequins set-piece frailty and pointed the finger at Joe Marler by sending the club captain to the sin-bin. Gloucester only entered the interval 13-11 ahead - a poor return given their ascendency - and then moved 18-11 clear through a Charlie Sharples try with half an hour remaining to suggest their eighth win of the season was imminent. Quins centre Aseli Tikoirotuma puts in a strong fend on Gloucester lock James Hudson . The kicking of Nick Evans kept Quins in touch - the Kiwi fly-half finished with 14 points - before an eventful final quarter produced a flurry of yellow cards and three tries. Yarde seized the initiative for the London club and full-back Ollie Lindsay-Hague appeared to have sealed the victory, only for Dan Robson's try with a minute left to give Gloucester a faint glimmer of hope until they aimlessly kicked the ball away in the last act of the game. The opening 10 minutes were dominated by Gloucester's scrum, yet it was Quins who opened the scoring when outside centre Asaeli Tikoirotuma jinked into space before sending Charlie Walker over. Walker's try was the result of a clinical counter attack, but the 2012 Premiership champions were immediately back under pressure once play resumed with their set-piece targeted once more, conceding a penalty that Greig Laidlaw sent between the uprights. Gloucester No 8 Gareth Evans is hit hard by Quins flanker Jack Clifford . Laidlaw and Evans exchanged penalties and just as Quins began to attack with greater frequency, yet another retreating scrum gave Gloucester the platform to race into a 31st minute lead. Hook broke the gainline with a large dummy - his second of the afternoon - and found Bill Meakes in support, with the outside centre showing strength to force his way over from 10 yards out. Gloucester's set-piece dominance was rewarded when Pearce sent Marler to the sin bin, but they were unable to turn a push late in the first half into points. A big step and outside-break from full-back Lindsay-Hague created a half-chance for Yarde moments after the interval, but the England wing was well tackled. Harry Sloan tries to evade the clutches of Cherry and Whites flanker Sione Kalamafoni . It was then Gloucester's turn to find space through Jonny May down the right wing only for Sharples to drop what should have been a try scoring pass. Two attacking scrums later, however, and Sharples dived over after Meakes had spotted the overlap caused by Quins being sucked into the one-sided forward exchanges. Evans' boot whittled down the deficit to one point but as the match entered the final quarter number eight Jack Clifford was shown a yellow card for a shoulder challenge on Sharples and Laidlaw rifled over the ensuing penalty. Gloucester scrum half Dan Robson crosses the Quins whitewash for a late score . Despite being a man down, Quins almost scored with two successive rolling mauls and on both occasions Gloucester saw a player sin-binned - replacement lock Ross Moriarty for bringing down the first drive and Sharples for a deliberate knock on. On the third line-out catch and drive they succeeded, with Yarde touching down as the game entered the final 10 minutes. Lindsay-Hague and replacement scrum-half Robson then swapped late tries to bring the game to a dramatic if scrappy conclusion.","Gloucester led 13-11 at half-time thanks to a Billy Meakes try .

"The West Indies believe they now dominate England captain Alastair Cook whose nightmare start to the series saw him fail in both innings of the first Test - along with opening partner Jonathan Trott. England finished on 116-3 to lead by 220 runs at the end of the third day in Antigua with seven second-innings wickets standing. But the hosts are jubilant that struggling Cook has twice fallen cheaply to the plan of bowling at him full and swinging around off stump. Alastair Cook failed with the bat once again on day three of the first Test in Antigua . Captain Cook also fell cheaply as he was out for 13 after edging a Taylor delivery into the slips . Asked whether the West Indies feel they have got the better of Cook, maiden Test centurion Jermaine Blackwood replied: ' Yes, I think so. We worked to the plan of separating Cook's bat from his body and it worked. Jerome Taylor stuck to the plan great.; . Taylor's pace partner Kemar Roach, who snared Cook in the first innings in similar fashion, said: 'Everyone knows Cook has a weakness.' Even more worrying for England is the form of Trott, whose footwork and head movement looked awry in both his brief knocks. The wisdom of him returning to the England side only 18 months after mental health issues forced him to quit the Ashes tour after his first Test roughing up by Mitchell Johnson in Brisbane now looks very questionable. BBC's Test Match Special pundit Geoff Boycott said: 'Trott's on the move, which is not great against the new ball. I don't think he's an opener.' James Tredwell, whose four for 47 made him the pick of the England bowlers, was the typical team man when pressed about the opening pair's struggles thus far. 'I guess whenever you go through a challenge - for wickets or runs - it can get on your mind at times, but they're both strong characters so I'm sure there'll be scores around the corner,' he said. 'It's their own issue but we'll stick with them. They're fine players.' Tredwell admits England's decision to fly Moeen Ali to Grenada for the second Test spurred him towards his four-wicket haul. Asked about Moeen linking up with the side on Saturday, he said: 'It's probably at the back of my mind but you try not to think too deeply about that. 'I wanted to give them a bit of a headache, shall we say, and hopefully I've done that now. 'So it's over to the people who matter to make that decision going forward in the series. There's another important innings to come so hopefully we can knock them over and get the win.' Jonathan Trott was also out cheaply as the first three wickets once again fell for not many . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Trott for just four after he edged behind to Ramdin . Trott added a score of four to his first innings duck in his first Test since returning after an 18 month absence .

"Alastair Cook may have had a long break working on his batting with his old mentor Graham Gooch but his technical problems very much remain. The England captain, without an international century for almost two years, failed for the second time in the first Test as his old failing against the full ball just outside off-stump was again exploited by West Indies. To compound Cook’s misery, there was also another failure for Jonathan Trott, who has endured a nightmare return to the England team for his 50th Test, 18 months after the trauma of leaving the Ashes tour following his 49th. The double blow at the start of England’s second innings left them with much to do in this first Test to work their way towards a winning position at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium even though they earned a first-innings lead of 104. Cook simply cannot afford many more mistakes, with new ECB chairman Colin Graves demanding victory here over opposition in West Indies he condemned as ‘mediocre’ ahead of this trip. Cook returned to something like his best last year with three half-centuries in his last four Test innings against India but his woeful one-day form in Sri Lanka led England to jettisoning him as 50-over captain ahead of the World Cup. He arrived in the Caribbean still smarting from that blow but with a slightly altered technique and looked refreshed in scoring a warm-up hundred against St Kitts. The step up to Test level, however, has seen Cook struggling and Jerome Taylor looked anything but mediocre in sending both him and Trott back with just 20 on the board as England endured a rocky start to their second innings. Trott has been recalled in the unaccustomed role of opener but has looked jittery in scoring a duck and now four and was noticeably falling over in the crease as he edged a decent ball from Taylor to Denesh Ramdin. Alastair Cook failed with the bat once again on day three of the first Test in Antigua . Jonathan Trott was also out cheaply as the first three wickets once again fell for not many . James Tredwell earlier picked up four wickets as England bowled West Indies out for 295 in their first innings . It is far too early to say that England’s gamble in bringing back a man who left Australia with what was later diagnosed as ‘situational anxiety’ has backfired but Trott will be under significant pressure in the second Test. Cook’s problems have been going on much longer and it is no exaggeration to say that he will be fighting for his job for the rest of this three-match series, particularly with change sweeping through English cricket. Here he pushed forward hesitantly to a ball he could have left alone from Taylor and succeeded only in edging to the delighted Sulieman Benn at slip on 13 after falling for 11 in the first innings. And when Ian Bell, a centurion in the first innings, was run out after a dreadful mix-up with Gary Balance, England had again lost early wickets and were struggling on 52 for three, only 156 ahead. West Indies were very much in the game then but Ballance and Joe Root settled any English nerves with an unbroken stand of 64 which gives them a lead of 220 and puts them in what should be a decisive position. Earlier England had toiled before dismissing West Indies for 295, with the unlikely figure of James Tredwell finishing with four for 47 but Jimmy Anderson only being able to claim one more victim to remain one short of Sir Ian Botham’s England record of 383 Test wickets. Shivnarine Chanderpaul was the first wicket to fall on day three as he was caught by Ben Stokes off Tredwell . Stuart Broad celebrates after claiming the wicket of Denesh Ramdin to leave West Indies on 227 for six . Jermaine Blackwood celebrates his maiden Test match century in his sixth Test match . Alastair Cook has now gone 61 combined Test and ODI innings without making a century. His last ton for England came against New Zealand at Headingley in May 2013, 690 days ago. England fought long and hard before they decided to bring Tredwell on this tour and considered Surrey’s Zafar Ansari and even his veteran team-mate Gareth Batty before they plumped for the likeable yeoman of Kent. Moeen Ali’s absence gave an opportunity to an off-spinner who could not even get into Kent’s championship team last season, the promise of Adam Riley being preferred to him, and Tredwell had to go on loan to Sussex to get a game. Yet Tredwell is reliable, steady and under-stated and England knew he would not let them down when they preferred him to the more naturally talented but inconsistent Adil Rashid for this first Test. The 23-year-old Jamaican scored 112 from 220 deliveries to drag West Indies up to 295 from their first innings . Blackwood takes off his helmet and raises his bat to celebrate a first century in international cricket . Joe Root makes the catch to dismiss Sulieman Benn, who was the last wicket to fall in West Indies' innings . Jermaine Blackwood is a 23-year-old Jamaican middle-order batsman playing in his sixth Test match. What kind of batsman is he? He’s a very aggressive player — he hit James Tredwell for six off his second ball of the innings — but perfectly capable of a well-worked innings. Blackwood has passed 50 four times in his first six Tests, including 56 and 63 against New Zealand and South Africa respectively, not to mention his unbeaten 112. Anything else I need to know? Tredwell isn’t the first Test bowler Blackwood has hit over the rope at the start of his innings. The batsman hit Trent Boult for four and six in his second over against New Zealand. It will be difficult for England to leave him out now, even though Moeen will join the squad in Grenada in time for the second Test, particularly if Tredwell can spin them to victory on this slow Antiguan pitch. It was Tredwell who made the first breakthrough of the day for England and the most important one in persuading the limpet-like Shiv Chanderpaul to chip tamely to extra cover in an off-side dominated field. That should have opened the door for England but they needed to be patient until the last three West Indians fell in 11 balls to a combination of Tredwell, Anderson and sharp work from Stuart Broad to run out Taylor. Throughout it all the diminutive figure of Jermaine Blackwood stood firm for West Indies to go to his maiden hundred in his sixth Test with thrilling but often risky stroke-making. Blackwood severely tried the patience of Ben Stokes, who could have had him three times but ended up wicketless as the 23-year-old Jamaican finished unbeaten on 112. Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Trott for just four after he edged behind to Ramdin . Trott added a score of four to his first innings duck in his first Test since returning after an 18 month absence . Trott makes his way off the field after a disappointing first Test back in the England team . Captain Cook also fell cheaply as he was out for 13 after edging a Taylor delivery into the slips . Ian Bell also lost his wicket late on the third evening as England's first three wickets fell for just 52 runs . Jimmy Anders on will have to wait until West Indies’ second innings to beat Ian Botham’s record Test wicket haul of 383. The Lancashire fast bowler took 2 for 67 in the first innings — after Devon Smith was caught behind on Tuesday, Anderson dismissed tail-ender Sulieman Benn with a length ball deflected to short leg. Benn was Anderson’s first wicket caught at short leg since New Zealand’s Iain O’Brien at Old Trafford in 2008 — his 78th Test wicket. It was Blackwood who was reprieved by Stokes overstepping on the second evening when he was caught at slip and it was the same man who survived when he was dropped by the diving Tredwell on 43 and then when he edged Stokes through the vacant second slip on 80. For Anderson this was another frustrating day, with little reverse swing on offer, but he did move a big step closer to the record when he had last man Benn caught by Root at short leg. Yet the ultimate English frustration belonged to Cook and Trott.","England closed day three of the first Test on 116 for three, 220 runs ahead .

"Ronald Koeman insists Southampton's goals have dried up due to their Barclays Premier League rivals giving them more respect. Saints have slipped out of the Champions League places and into seventh following a run of three defeats in their last six games ahead of Saturday's home clash with Hull. Koeman blames the slump on a lack of goals but rather than looking to his strikers for fault, he believes a change in approach from opponents has been the telling factor.

Southampton striker Graziano Pelle (centre) has struggled to reproduce his form from the start of the season . Pelle (left) is tackled by John Stones in Southampton's 1-0 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park . 'It's not in my opinion a problem about one player - just look at the last few games,' Koeman said. 'Even when we play away - for example last weekend against Everton - teams don't care about playing football at home, they defend. That is different to the beginning of the season. 'Now opponents don't care how they play against Southampton, they're happy to defend and they're concerned about getting points. At this point of the season, points are more important for them. 'We are not always scoring lots of goals and that's the difference. We are not getting the space we had in the beginning. 'It makes it more difficult because then there is not really a lot of space. Liverpool played with three centre-backs but with five defenders against Southampton, and Hull normally play with five defenders. 'That means there is not a lot of space, so you have to play very well or you need a player who makes an individual action and scores a goal. 'But those types of individual, high-quality players are not playing for Southampton.' Koeman remains upbeat and is targeting European qualification with Southampton this season . Koeman believes Southampton's Champions League dream is over, but still covets a place in the Europa League. 'You have to be realistic.

"No other scoreline could have emphasised how seriously this new Arsenal team are taking their prospects of winning major trophies again. 'One-nil to the Arsenal' used to be commonplace before Arsene Wenger arrived and made everything more exciting, and you sensed the class of 2015 quite enjoyed travelling north and nicking the narrowest of victories at Burnley with a first-half goal from Aaron Ramsey. It was Arsenal's eighth win in a row, their best run since the Invincibles team in 2004, and kept the pressure on Chelsea, who they meet in their next league game at the Emirates. Only once before this season have Arsenal won 1-0 but striker Olivier Giroud feels the hard-fought victory proved there is more to this current Wenger team than pass-pass-pass and dissolve when the going gets tough. In other words, they are built to last. Olivier Giroud wants Arsenal to continue their Premier League winning streak and challenge for the title . 'You can't play your best football every game. We tried to be focused on not conceding and it's one more clean sheet,' Giroud said proudly. 'As long as we were winning the game I don't think we were in too much danger. We are really pleased. 'If we had been told we would win this game 1-0 I would have signed for it straight away. Burnley played really tough against us. It was a big fight. 'We know about the record of the Invincibles. It's really good for us to be near that and I'm really proud to take part. But we don't want to stop here. We want to carry on and keep this good run going until the end.' Aaron Ramsey's 12th-minute strike was enough for Arsenal to earn a 1-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday . The win was Arsenal's eighth in a row and they kept up the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea . If Arsenal manage that, Jose Mourinho might have a far tighter finish to the title race than he could have anticipated a couple of months ago. Wenger has even found his own Claude Makelele in 23-year-old Frenchman Francis Coquelin who sat in front of the back-four and kept Burnley's chances to a minimum on Saturday. Club legend Thierry Henry even gave him a new nickname 'The Detective' for the way he sensed danger and snuffed it out. 'I always knew I could do a job for the team. I just needed a chance to show it,' said Coquelin, who was sent loan to Charlton earlier this season. It's ironic that having preached the beautiful game for nearly two decades Wenger has finally found a couple of warriors in Laurent Koscielny and Coquelin that hark back to the Tony Adams era. Arsene Wenger's side face Chelsea in their next home game and have an FA Cup semi-final to look forward to . Even if they can't catch Chelsea this time they will fancy a proper tilt at the Premier League next season and by then they might be back-to-back FA Cup winners. They won the trophy last May and face Reading in another semi-final at Wembley on Saturday. 'We have a better balance in the team,' Wenger said. 'Coquelin contributes to that, Hector Bellerin has come into the team and big players like Koscielny, Giroud and (Mesut) Ozil were out for four months in the season. People forget that. 'I also have a quality bench and quality players like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mathieu Debuchy who didn't travel. We have a big squad and I think we have quality.' Francis Coquelin was praised for his performance in midfield with Thierry Henry calling him 'the detective' 360 - days since Arsenal's last 1-0 away win in the Premier League. That was in March 2014 against Tottenham when Tomas Rosicky scored the winner. The Arsenal manager is playing down chances of overtaking Chelsea: 'We have to be perfect' – but the Emirates will still be buzzing in a fortnight when the top two clash. For Burnley, it will be matches against Hull City, Leicester City and Aston Villa in the next five weeks that determine their Premier League survival prospects rather than this result. Striker Ashley Barnes, who was twice denied an equaliser by goalkeeper David Ospina, said: 'If we could have got something against Arsenal it would have been a bonus. But we get cracking again next weekend against Everton.' The return of Matt Taylor as a late substitute was also a boost for the Clarets. Taylor has missed eight months with an achilles injury but his experience will be extremely valuable in the run-in.","Arsenal beat Burnley 1-0 at Turf Moor on Saturday .

"Christian Benteke believes it would be risky to suggest Aston Villa can be safe from relegation with one more victory. The Belgian striker, back to form under manager Tim Sherwood with eight goals in six games, said his side must continue to stretch their lead over the drop zone.

Benteke said: ‘The more the better, I think it's risky to say we can take three points and we're finished. We have to try to win every game. ‘Saturday was a massive three points because now we're six points clear of QPR so it's very important for us to be far off them.’ Benteke, 24, said the match against Brendan Rodgers’ team at Wembley was the biggest of his career. ‘For the moment, yes,’ he said. ‘It (missing the World Cup) was hard but now it's in the past, I'm looking forward to playing the semi final. Benteke thinks it would be risky to think that one more win will be enough to ensure survival . ‘Liverpool are a good team but the thing with the FA Cup is it's still something special. It's 50-50 for me but some will say they are favourites. ‘Wembley is something good and special because it's a semi final, it's close to the final and we have to do everything to be there again.’ Benteke believes his partnership with Gabby Agbonalhor can destroy defences. He added: ‘He (Sherwood) said to the team we have to play to our strengths, to play with me and Gabby. ‘He helped me to destroy the defenders, with two we're always better than one. I'm comfortable, it's a good partnership.’","Aston Villa beat Tottenham 1-0 at White Hart Lane on Saturday .

"Nigel Pearson spent the last quarter of this match pushing his team on from his technical area, clapping, cajoling, instructing. He has experienced a great escape at the Hawthorns before, in 2005 as assistant to Bryan Robson. Beyond 90 minutes, Jamie Vardy scored a goal that gave an exhilarating indication another improbable story could yet be told. Leicester secured their second consecutive Premier League win to bring safety into view for the first time in a long time. Pearson’s side are still bottom, but now just three points behind Hull in 17th. With seven games to go, five at home, they are still very much in this fight.

In the first minute of added time he bullied Gareth McAuley to gain possession by the halfway line and advanced on goal. Joleon Lescott was unable to halt him and in a flash the ball was in the net. Pearson turned to his bench and held both arms aloft. He had switched to three at the back at the interval and made all his substitutions with half an hour to go, and been vindicated. Trailing 2-1, Leicester had equalised in the 80th minute when Marc Albrighton delivered a cross that reached David Nugent at the far post. He hooked the ball back, Marcin Wasilewski won the header and Robert Huth nodded beyond Craig Dawson on the line.

It had all begun so brightly for the hosts on a day to honour their late, great striker Jeff Astle, scorer of the winning goal in the 1968 FA Cup. West Brom looked resplendent in their replica kits from that year, numbered one to 11. Darren Fletcher paid a fitting tribute with a very good glancing header to Chris Brunt’s corner. Goal-line technology was required to confirm the goal after Esteban Cambiasso cleared. It was Fletcher’s first goal since scoring for Manchester United in November 2012. Leicester equalised in the 20th minute. Cambiasso took a long free-kick that Leonardo Ulloa flicked forward for Nugent to stroke in a composed finish. West Brom went ahead again six minutes later when Craig Gardner’s volley deflected off Wes Morgan into the net. But Leicester struck back impressively and, from nowhere, have genuine hope of survival. ‘You never want to come off the field with regrets,’ said Pearson. ‘If we can maximise that home advantage we have a chance. I don’t think at any point this season [the] players doubted themselves.’ West Brom are not yet safe and face a frightening run-in. ‘The first goal is lower-league stuff,’ said Pulis. ‘The third goal, Gareth’s trying to play like a right winger. You can’t do that at this level.’ Robert Huth nodded home with 10 minutes left on the clock to help his side launch an emphatic comeback against West Brom .

"Successive last-gasp victories have reignited struggling Leicester City's Premier League survival bid and manager Nigel Pearson said his side's fate is back in their own hands. Late goals from Robert Huth and Jamie Vardy sealed a dramatic 3-2 victory against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, a week after Andy King's late goal secured a 2-1 win against West Ham United. The Foxes had look buried two weeks ago, seven points adrift of the relative safety of 17th place, but are now just three points behind Hull City, the side immediately above the relegation trapdoor. Jamie Vardy scored an late winner against West Brom on Saturday to improve Leicester's chances of survival . Vardy struck past West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill during the closing stages of the game at The Hawthorns . Robert Huth nodded home with 10 minutes left on the clock to help his side launch an emphatic comeback . Foxes boss Nigel Pearson (left) believes Premier League survival is still firmly placed in his side's hands . Crucially Leicester, who have discovered an attacking potency with eight goals in three games, have a game in hand over their survival rivals and play five of their final seven fixtures at home. 'One thing we've spoken about recently is we want to keep (our fate) in our own hands for as long as possible,' Pearson told the BBC. 'While it's in our own hands you know that the responsibility is solely with ourselves. In many ways that's the driving force for us but we've still got an awful lot to do. 'It's more congested (at the bottom of the table) but because of the gap there has been for such a long time we don't have any chances of getting away with a disappointing result.

However the Foxes were instantly punished when West Ham midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate netted immediately . But Andy King (left) was the hero as the Premier League strugglers struck late on at the King Power Stadium . 'We've got to try and force the issue between now and the end of the season.' Leicester have been rooted to the foot of the table since November but are slowly building much-needed momentum as the battle to avoid the drop intensifies. 'I hope (we've got momentum). Back-to-back wins are difficult to achieve, especially for a side like ourselves who have been struggling for vast parts of the season in terms of results,' he said. 'It's going to be tough but we'll give it a good shot.' Leicester have a relatively manageable run-in and play host to Swansea City in their next game on Saturday.","Leicester looked to be on the brink of relegation just two weeks ago .

"Leicester’s Premier League forecast has looked gloomy for some considerable time, but Jamie Vardy’s stoppage time winner at the Hawthorns suddenly offers a sunnier outlook. ‘It was a pretty decent day,’ said Vardy (below). ‘I go to the racing for a giggle. Winning the sweepstake was nice but three points was the main thing.’ Leicester have appeared doomed to relegation for months, cemented to the bottom of the table since November.

But two successive wins give genuine hope of survival with seven games to play, five at home. Vardy struck a confident tone. Survival is, after all, in Leicester’s hands. ‘We’ve all been running ourselves in the ground and not getting the points we deserve,’ said Vardy. ‘We’ve not played bad in any game really. This just shows what we are capable of. ‘We still want to be in this Premier League next year. We feel like we belong here. We’ve never been battered and always given a good account of ourselves.’ Leicester manager Nigel Pearson deserves credit for altering his team at half-time when 2-1 down to goals from Darren Fletcher and Craig Gardner. Leicester switched to a 3-5-2 formation and flooded men forwards in a bid to add to David Nugent’s strike. Robert Huth found a leveller with 10 minutes to go before Vardy ran from halfway to drill a cracking finish in the first minute of injury time. Pearson said: ‘This season we have to make sure our destiny remains with our own results as long as possible. Whenever that’s the case, we have a realistic opportunity.’","Leicester City hero Jamie Vardy believes the Foxes deserve to stay up .

"The title race appears to be over, but what about the fight to stay in the Premier League? No one is dead and buried and even Sunderland in 15th are a bad weekend away from falling into the relegation zone. It’s extremely close with the delightful benefit that there will be five key fixtures between sides in the bottom six. Have Hull got enough breathing room to survive what looks like the hardest run-in? Are Leicester too far back? Burnley have been dealt a reasonable hand but can they capitalise? Have QPR improved enough away from home to take any confidence to Leicester on the final day? Sportsmail considers the possibilities and delivers a verdict. Sunderland . Position: 15th on 29 points . Jermain Defoe (centre) reinvigorated Sunderland with a stunning strike to beat rivals Newcastle 1-0 . Dick Advocaat is overseeing Sunderland's survival bid as manager until the end of the season . Seven points split Sunderland in 15th and Leicester in 20th as the battle for Premier League survival heats up . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Crystal Palace (H) -D . Stoke (A) - D . Southampton (H) - L . Everton (A) - L . Leicester (H) - W . Arsenal (A) - L . Chelsea (A) L . Predicted total: 34 points . Verdict: Safe . Their derby win will have done them the world of good, as will the relative comfort of facing three teams in Palace, Stoke and Everton who have very little to play for. They need to make the most of those initial fixtures because it’s highly unlikely that they will get anything out of closing trips to Arsenal and Chelsea. Aston Villa . Position: 16th on 29 points . Christian Benteke scored a hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday . Tim Sherwood has helped Villa rediscover their scoring touch since replacing Paul Lambert as manager . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester City (A) - L . Everton (H) - D . West Ham (H) - W . Southampton (A) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Predicted total: 36 points . Verdict: Safe . At this stage of the season and in these circumstances you want winnable home games and that is what Villa have. However, with only three home wins this season (one less than on the road) they face a challenge. They ought to be OK, not least because a team that struggled to score under Paul Lambert has improved under Tim Sherwood. Hull . Position: 17th on 28 points . Steve Bruce's Hull  are placed perilously above the drop zone in 17th with seven games remaining . Ahmed Elmohamady will be a key man in Hull's bid to protect their position outside of the relegation zone . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Southampton (A) - L . Liverpool (H) - D . Crystal Palace (A) - D . Arsenal (H) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester United (H) - L . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Safe. On goal difference. The hardest run-in of the lot? It looks that way and therefore they could cut it awfully fine with regards to survival. There are two points between them and QPR at the moment, but Hull could have a potentially decisive advantage in the form of their goal difference, which is six better than QPR’s. Their fixtures are simply awful. Crystal Palace are isolated on that list as a team without major incentive. QPR . Position: 18th on 26 points . Charlie Austin has netted 17 goals in 29 games for QPR and will be vital during his team's difficult run-in . Chris Ramsey may find QPR's goal difference a big disadvantage, particularly with a tough final seven games . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Chelsea (H) - L . West Ham (H) - W . Liverpool (A) - L . Man City (A) - L . Newcastle (H) - W . Leicester (A) - D . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Relegated on goal difference . Three brutally hard fixtures with perhaps a mixed blessing that Liverpool and Manchester City – games you would expect them to lose anywhere – are played away. That places huge emphasis on home games against West Ham and Newcastle, neither of whom are in form nor have much to play for. It could all come down to the final game of the season, which is away at Leicester. Chris Ramsey has improved their away form but it is a big ask. Their poor goal difference in relation to Hull’s could be the deciding factor. Burnley . Position: 19th on 26 points . Danny Ings will spearhead Burnley's attack as they attempt to escape the Premier League relegation zone . Sean Dyche's side have two relegation crunch matches away from home against Hull and Villa . Predicted results: Six points from seven games . Arsenal (H) – L . Everton (A) - D . Leicester (H) – W . West Ham (A) - D . Hull (A) - L . Stoke (H) - D . Aston Villa (A) - L . Predicted total: 32 points . Verdict: Relegated . On paper they probably have the most straightforward opponents, but have the misfortune of playing two of their most critical fixtures – against Hull and Villa – away from Turf Moor. They have won only once away all season so it would be extremely ambitious to expect them to make hay now, considering four of those seven fixtures are on the road. Would expect their status to be decided by the final two games. Leicester . Position: 20th on 22 points . Esteban Cambiasso celebrates after an impressive display helped Leicester beat West Ham 2-1 on Saturday . Nigel Pearson (left) has eight games remaining to get Leicester safe and has five home games to play . Predicted results: Four points from eight games . West Brom (A) - L . Swansea (H) - D . Burnley (A) - L . Chelsea (H) - L . Newcastle (H) - D . Southampton (H) - D . Sunderland (A) - L . QPR (H) - D . Predicted total: 26 points . Verdict: Relegated . As with Burnley, it’s not the most intimidating run-in and they do have the most games from which to gain points. They also have the slight advantage of five fixtures at home. But 22 points from 30 games so far offers little indication that they will mount any kind of sprint for the line.","Six teams are embroiled in a close battle to avoid the Premier League drop .

"West Ham striker Carlton Cole says he can't approach Sam Allardyce about a new contract - because the manager doesn't know whether he's even staying at Upton Park. Cole's contract expires at the end of the season and it is unclear whether he'll stay at the club beyond the summer. But Cole admits he's in no position to ask his boss about an extension with Allardyce's future also in limbo. Carlton Cole attended a Football Fighting Ebola event with Nathaniel Clyne on Sunday . Cole's contract expires at the end of the season and is unsure if he will be offered a new deal . Like Cole, the manager's contract expires in the summer and it is looking increasingly likely he'll leave West Ham. And the 31-year-old striker said: 'I've not spoken to the manager about a new contract, I don’t think Sam knows what he is doing. He isn't going to be talking about my contract.' Cole, who came close to joining West Brom in January before Allardyce pulled the plug on the deal 20 minutes before the deadline after his attempts to sign Emmanuel Adebayor failed, admits he is making contingency plans in case his Hammers career comes to an end this summer. 'I have been at West Ham for 10 years, I’m trying to build a case to get a testimonial out of them but I don’t think it’s the right thing to be talking about right now,' said Cole. 'I am trying my best to make myself a presence in the team, which has been hard for me this year. Cole has found first team opportunities limited in the second half of the season . 'We did go on a good run, but I felt in the last 12-13 games I could have played a bigger part, but the manager chose to go with someone else, so whenever I do get my chance I do do my best. 'I was obviously on the brink of going to West Brom but that didn’t work out - hopefully something else works out in the future. 'I have got a few things lined up, just in case. I have been playing in the Premier league for 10 years so I have a lot to offer a team who wants to take me or if I stay at West Ham I have a lot to offer them.' On the collapse of his move to the Hawthorns, Cole, speaking at the Football Fighting Ebola fundraising event, added: 'I had a chance to play first team football and as a player I was not playing regularly at West Ham, I'm still not. 'Sam chose not to let me go. It was really hard at the time and we had a few words but these things carry on and you dust yourself off and carry on. I do like Sam a lot. He is an honest guy. Cole has not spoken to Sam Allardyce about his future because the West Ham boss does not know if he will be there next season . 'He told me how it was and said: ""I can’t let you go as I have not got a replacement for you"". I said: ""Okay I will come back and try my best for you"". 'It was 20 minutes to the deadline; I was on the table with a pen in my hand saying: ""Where do I sign?"". 'It was one of those that was really frustrating. I am f-ing and blinding in the catering room over there. 'Sam said he needed me, but I don’t think he has. I think I have played 120 minutes since. That is football. Sometimes you don’t get what you want. I didn’ t get what I wanted. 'But I can’t be bothered complaining. What has happened has happened and what am I going to complain for? I have to do the right by me now and my family to try and get another deal. 'I am not going to be sitting there complaining about what happened last week. It is not going to help.'

"Midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate has warned West Ham must be ready to face a 'wounded animal' at Manchester City on Sunday, but will be ready to inflict more pain on Manuel Pellegrini's men. The Barclays Premier League champions have seen their title defence left in tatters following a run of four defeats in six matches, thrashed 4-2 at rivals United last weekend - a result which left the long-term future of manager Pellegrini in doubt as City might now face a scrap with Liverpool for a Champions League qualifying spot. West Ham are also in need a pick-me-up, having seen victory slip through their fingers when Stoke netted a stoppage time equaliser at Upton Park. West Ham midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate is wary of facing champions Manchester City on Sunday . City midfielder Yaya Toure (centre) and his team-mates suffered a 4-2 defeat at Old Trafford last week . Senegal midfielder Kouyate expects City to produce a response, but also one from Sam Allardyce's squad, who have failed to find consistency over the second half of the season to drop out of contention for the European places. 'Anything is possible in football, but we mustn't forget who we are up against. They are a wounded animal, because they need points, so they have to wake themselves up to win,' Kouyate said on the club's official website, www.whufc.com. 'We need the points as well, because we want to remain in the top 10. 'It is not going to be easy because we will be up against one of the best teams in the country and last year's champions of England. 'If we are going to get anything there, we have to enjoy it and really play as a team and work as a team.' Kouyate celebrates with left back Aaron Cresswell after his goal against Stoke at Upton Park last Saturday . Marouane Fellaini (right) scores United's second goal as City fell to another Premier League defeat . Kouyate added: 'A team like Manchester City can't afford to make mistakes, so for us it's a good time to face them, but we mustn't underestimate them, there's life in them yet.' West Ham look short of options in attack. Striker Enner Valencia is being assessed for a foot injury picked up on his return to action against Stoke, while Diafra Sakho, who has netted 12 goals in all competitions, is facing a battle to play again this season following a thigh strain. Allardyce is hoping his team can produce the required level of concentration to accommodate their forward losses. He said: 'That leaves us very short on the front line with Andy (Carroll) being out, and means goals will be fewer and farther between than they used to be, so if we don't get that defensive side right then the last six games are going to be tough for us.'","West Ham face Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday, KO at 1.30pm .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce conceded that his side are suffering from a psychological problem after Marko Arnautovic's 95th-minute equaliser saw the Hammers drop points for the second game in a row. Allardyce's side had been on track for their first back-to-back home wins in almost four months but having already had two goals ruled out for offside, Arnautovic eventually punished the fading hosts to earn a draw. Aaron Cresswell had given the home side an early lead at Upton Park but after a strong start it was Stoke who ended up dominating and they left with a deserved point. Marko Arnautovic (second left) is mobbed by his Stoke City team-mates after scoring a 95th minute equaliser at West Ham United .

CLICK HERE to view our brilliant Match Zone including the move for Marko Arnautovic's 95th minute equaliser for Stoke City . It is the fourth time this year that a late goal has cost the ninth-placed Hammers after draws at Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and the defeat at Leicester City last week. Without the late goals they could be above Swansea City and sitting on a club-record 50 points. 'We can't find the right key elements to see that game out. We leave ourselves on a nervous edge,' Allardyce said. 'We are very nervous at that stage over what's happened before and we should be on 50 points now. We've thrown away seven points in two minutes or less in four games. 'If we had concentrated better in those (last) minutes, we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the (Premier) League. Instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again. I thought we were going to do it today, but it finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds.' West Ham's performances have dipped since a strong start to the season but there was no sign of any supposed complacency early on against Stoke, and the reawakening coincided with the return of Enner Valencia. It was Stoke's inability to deal with him led to the opening goal after seven minutes. Glenn Whelan tripped Valencia five yards outside the penalty area to give West Ham an opportunity to shoot from the dead ball. Mark Noble looked the most likely candidate and when he stepped over the ball it seemed to leave goalkeeper Asmir Begovic confused. Instead, unlikely scorer Cresswell was the chosen one and he sent the free-kick over the wall and curling into the Bosnian stopper's top left-hand corner to give West Ham the lead with his second goal of the season.

West Ham were well on top, and Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate could have added to the lead inside the opening 20 minutes. But as the half wore on it was Stoke who looked the more likely to score. Valencia's influence waned and instead it was Arnautovic who took control, dominating Cresswell down West Ham's left-hand side. Charlie Adam curled an ambitious free-kick over the bar from 40 yards out in search of his second wonder goal in a week before Jonathan Walters silenced an impatient Upton Park with a low strike that looked to have gone in but had instead hit Adrian's side netting. Victor Moses also had an opportunity, bringing down Arnautovic's cross inside the penalty area, spinning and firing in a shot that was deflected just wide. Allardyce would have been pleased just to see his side make it through to half-time unscathed and Stoke went in at the break with a sense of injustice after hearing referee Roger East blow his whistle as they prepared for the latest in a series of dangerous corners. A low-key opening to the second half allowed the home side to settle a bit and they looked the better side until a mistake by Winston Reid gave Adam a chance on the hour mark but a bobble came to the rescue and the Scot shot wide.

Minutes later Arnautovic had the ball in the net, slotting past Adrian, but his run was correctly flagged for offside. The Spanish keeper's goal seemed to be living a charmed life and particularly so as Stoke went within an inch of equalising. Jonathan Walters sent in a cross from the right that was met by the unmarked head of substitute Mame Biram Diouf, who powered an effort towards goal only to see it bounce off the inside of the post, along the goal line and somehow staying out. West Ham looked like throwing it all away again late on. Arnautovic found Adrian's net for a second time but was again flagged for offside. But the Austrian wasn't to be denied and he eventually scored with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end. Stephen Ireland flicked the ball on and Arnautovic applied the finish, slipping the ball into the corner to leave a familiar scene for the home support. Stoke manager Mark Hughes said: 'It looked for a long time that we weren't going to be able to do it. 'When we got into the fourth minute of added on time it looked as though it wasn't going to be our day. Credit to the lads, I thought they were brilliant.'

"Greg Dyke has vowed there will be no repeat of the FA’s failure to deliver potentially life-saving research into links between concussion and early on-set dementia. The Football Association chairman admits his organisation’s response to former West Bromwich Albion striker Jeff Astle’s death aged 59 in 2002, from ‘industrial disease’ linked to repetitive head injuries sustained playing football, was ‘woefully inadequate’. The FA and PFA promised a 10-year study to investigate the connection between head injuries and early on-set dementia after a coroner found Astle’s brain ‘resembled that of a boxer’s’ but a Mail on Sunday investigation last year revealed the research was never carried out. Jeff Astle's family were at The Hawthorns for 'Astle Day' as Baggies fans paid to tribute to the former striker . Jeff Astle's wife brings out the match ball ahead of the league clash between West Brom and Leicester . West Brom paid tribute to  Astle on 'Astle Day', the former Baggies striker at the age of 59 in 2002 due . Baggies striker Saido Berahino wore Astle's No 9 shirt during the Premier League match at The Hawthorns . Dyke went to The Hawthorns on Saturday for the launch of the Jeff Astle Foundation, which aims to raise awareness of head injuries in football while funding future research, and he apologised for the FA’s failure to acknowledge the significance of Astle’s death. ‘We promised the Astle family we would do some research and we didn’t and that is a failure by the FA and yes, we are now going to do it,’ Dyke told the Mail on Sunday. ‘It’s going to be done. There will be a piece of work about head injuries and football. We want to get FIFA involved as well because if we draw some profound conclusions we’ll need to get everyone involved. ‘We’ll help fund the research and we’ll put together a working group and we’ll help fund it too. You need to separate the emotion and do the research and ask, “What do we understand?” The suggestion of the Astle family is that head injuries are more likely to lead to early on-set dementia and that is to do with heading the ball or physical contact. That’s what we need to investigate and understand. ‘Let’s see what the research finds and get FIFA involved too because this isn’t going to be a British-only phenomenon, it’s going to be a worldwide phenomenon. It won’t disappear, that is for certain. That was a bad mistake by the FA (to not carry out research).’ West Bromwich Albion became only the second team in Premier League history to be granted permission to wear a replica strip on Saturday, with their shirts resembling those worn by the 1968 FA Cup-winning side in which Astle scored in every round including the final. Astle represented the Baggies for 10 years between 1964 and 1974 during his professional career . West Brom players take to the pitch in a Astle commemorative kit ahead of their showdown with Leicester . A close up view of the Jeff Astle gates ahead of the Barclays Premier League match at West Brom . Their match against Leicester City was attended by his wife Laraine and daughters Dawn and Claire, who set up the Justice for Jeff campaign last season after being alerted to the FA and PFA’s failure to deliver promised research by the Mail on Sunday. ‘My Jeff died not knowing he had ever been a professional footballer,’ Laraine said. ‘We were promised research into the issue and it wasn’t until we were alerted by the Mail on Sunday that it hadn’t been carried out that we knew any different. None of this would have happened if it hadn’t been for the Mail on Sunday.’ West Brom’s fans held up placards nine minutes into Saturday's game proclaiming ‘Astle is King’ in remembrance of a man whose death could yet prove the catalyst to drastic improvements to concussion protocols in sport. ‘This is just too important to let go,’ Dawn said. ‘We have been inundated with calls from concerned families who believe their dads or husbands are suffering dementia prematurely because of the head injuries they suffered as professional footballers. ‘There are too many cases for it to be coincidence. Sport’s governing bodies have paid lip service to this for far too long and have been allowed to get away with it. That has to stop. The Mail on Sunday revealed the Football Association did not carry out adequate research into Astle's death . West Brom fans display an 'Astle' banner during the ninth minute to represent the shirt number he wore at The Hawthorns . Greg Dyke has vowed there will be no repeat of the FA’s failure to deliver potentially life-saving research . ‘My dad loved the game but ultimately it killed him. Everybody who plays the game needs to know that it comes with a risk. Players need to leave the field if they suffer a head injury. ‘We’ve been encouraged by the FA and PFA’s response in recent months but it’s taken them too long to address this.’ Sections of Astle’s brain were re-examined at Glasgow Southern General Hospital last year by Professor Willie Stewart, who confirmed the striker had been suffering from the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which was previously believed only to be found in boxers. But studies in the United States have revealed a far higher incidence of CTE in American footballers than the wider population, while sports including rugby, horse racing, boxing and ice hockey are also now on high alert following a massive lawsuit involving the NFL and retired players suffering dementia. Prof Stewart called Saturday's launch of the Jeff Astle Foundation ‘a landmark day’. He went on: ‘Though Jeff was the first former footballer recognised with CTE, sadly he will not be the last. And the foundation will provide a source of information and support for people within sport affected by dementia, and their families. It has taken 13 years to get this far in football. We cannot allow another 13 years to slip by without action.’ Saturday’s match was attended by a host of celebrity backers, including 1966 World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks, as well as concussion campaigners like Peter Robinson, whose 14-year-old rugby-playing son Ben died in 2011 after being allowed to play on after suffering repeated blows to the head. ‘If one person present at the game had recognised the signs of concussion or understood how dangerous it could be then my Ben would still be alive,’ Peter Robinson said. ‘There has been too much lip service paid to the issue in the past. It’s time to act.’","Former West Brom forward Jeff Astle died 'from an industrial disease'

"The Scottish Professional Football League has performed a U-turn by switching Rangers' final-day clash with Hearts back to Saturday, May 2. The league found itself at the centre of a furious row on Wednesday after announcing it had moved Gers' Tynecastle fixture with the Jambos to May 3 - 24 hours after their rivals for second place in the Scottish Championship, Hibernian, completed their campaign at Falkirk. The decision was made after TV broadcaster Sky decided to screen the match live but Hibs hit out at the change, claiming it would place the league's sporting integrity at risk as they jostled with Rangers for the play-off slots. Rangers' Marius Zaliukas (right) dribbles with the ball as Livingston's Jordan White (left) gives chase . Zaliukas (left) jumps highest to score his side's equalising goal during the 1-1 draw with Livingston . The three other clubs involved have all backed the Easter Road club's stance - but the SPFL released a controversial statement on Wednesday night admitting it was puzzled by the fall-out. It said: 'It is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise'. But now it has been forced to backtrack after Sky gave the league the thumbs up to move the Rangers-Hearts clash at Tynecastle back to its original date. All other Championship fixtures will now be moved to 12.15pm to match the kick-off in Gorgie. Confirming the move, a league spokesperson said: 'Following consultation between the SPFL, member clubs and broadcast partners regarding the final round of Championship fixtures over the weekend of May 2 and 3, Sky Sports has now suggested an alternative schedule for its televised Championship match that weekend. 'As a result, we are pleased to confirm all five Championship matches that weekend will now kick-off simultaneously at 12.15pm on Saturday, May 2. The Hearts v Rangers match will be televised live on Sky Sports. 'The SPFL would like to thank Sky Sports for its flexibility and understanding and we're sure all football fans will look forward to an exciting climax to the Championship season.' Speaking before the switch, Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan admitted if he had been in charge, Rangers and Hibernian would have always kicked off at the same time. Easter Road chief executive Leeann Dempster feared the rescheduling would give the Ibrox side an advantage as they would know exactly what kind of result would be required to clinch the runners-up slot - saving them the bother of two extra games in the play-offs. Regan refused to directly criticise his SPFL counterpart Neil Doncaster for allowing the fixture change which has sparked the drama in the first place - but he did admit his personal preference would be to have all teams battling for vital play-off spots played at the same time. Rangers' Kenny Miller (right) tussles for the ball with Livingston's Declan Gallacher (left) during the 1-1 draw . The SFA boss - who made his comments at the launch of the Football Memories project at Hampden - said: 'Sporting integrity is fundamental to any competition and I think that has to be considered in the round [of fixtures]. 'The clubs have made their feelings known and I'm sure Neil and his colleagues have listened to what their member clubs have said and come back with a pragmatic proposal. 'My preference in a play-off situation is having games finishing at the same time. 'It's not for me to stand here and criticise how another body has dealt with things. The clubs themselves have made their feelings known to the league. I know Neil and his colleagues have taken that on board and will do what they can to satisfy the various parties.' The row followed two days on intense negotiations with police and TV companies over the Premiership post-split fixtures and Regan added: 'Clearly the SPFL have come under pressure from a number of sources over the last 24/48 hours,' he said. 'But I'm sure Neil and his colleagues will be looking at the fall-out from the feedback they have received and trying to come up with a proposal. 'It's not helpful when you have negative issues being constantly played out in the press. When you get to the climax to the season, there is a lot at stake. 'It's never easy when you are trying to balance the needs of broadcasters, clubs, fans and sponsors but my view on this is that the fans come first and they have to be considered.

"On a day of fireworks off the pitch as the row over end of season Championship scheduling exploded, Rangers fans let themselves down by setting off flares in the Energy Assets Arena. As the smoke cleared on this 1-1 draw against bottom side Livingston, though, Stuart McCall was left ruing the explosive impact of Myles Hippolyte despite his Ibrox side nudging one point clear of Hibs in second place. The Livvy attacker’s absolute cracker of a free-kick had sent the home side into the lead just two minutes after the break. Hippolyte’s joy was to be short-lived, though, as Rangers centre-half Marius Zaliukas raced up the park to restore parity with a clever back-header two minutes later. Rangers dropped two points at Championship bottom side Livingston in their bid for promotion . Livingston: Jamieson, Fordyce, Gallacher, Cole, Talbot, Keaghan Jacobs, O'Brien, Pitman (Mullen 86), Kyle Jacobs, White (Boulding 89), Hippolyte (Glen 81).

Goals: Zaliukas 49. Att: 4,345. Referee: Greg Aitken (Scotland). But despite leapfrogging Hibs to go second, there was no mistaking McCall’s expression at full-time. To the manager, this was two points lost as Rangers’ form away from Ibrox once again gave them cause for concern. That’s just one win away from home in the last five Championships games now, as the tense race to finish second — and avoid the third/fourth play-off games — hots up ahead of the final three matches. To be fair to McCall, he had pinpointed this clash against a resurgent Livvy as one of the toughest matches his side would face before the end of the regular league season. The Rangers boss made just the one change from the side that beat Raith Rovers 4-0 at the weekend. There was a return to centre-half for captain Lee McCulloch, free from suspension after serving his two-game ban for an elbow on Hearts striker Osman Sow. The captain’s recall saw Darren McGregor move to right back, with Robbie Crawford dropping onto the bench. Livingston, on a run of three straight wins, made just the one change, Danny Mullen dropping out while the veteran Burton O’Brien was included to pack the home midfield. Myles Hippolyte gave Livingston the lead early in the second half and threatened to upset Rangers . Hippolyte curled a free-kick into the back of the Rangers net to give Livingston the lead in the 47th minute . After a series of loud bangs rang out across the stadium, the game exploded into real controversy after seven minutes. Livingston striker Jordan White challenged Rangers goalkeeper Cammy Bell in the air and Hippolyte turned the loose ball home. As he raced away in glee, the Rangers players, not to mention McCall in the dugout, looked grateful as the flag of assistant referee Dougie Potter halted the home celebrations. The Livingston players, and fans, meanwhile, reacted furiously. There had seemed little wrong with White’s challenge on the keeper. Rangers were struggling to impose themselves as an attacking force, against a side that looked nothing like relegation contenders. The best McCall’s men could muster early on was a header over the bar from Nicky Clark after a cross from the right wing by Haris Vuckic. The Slovenian then saw a long-ranger effort comfortably saved by Darren Jamieson in the home goal. But shortly afterwards, Vuckic looked fortunate to escape punishment when he appeared to catch Livvy’s Jason Talbot in the face with his arm. Referee Aitken had spotted the off-the-ball incident but he elected to award a foul to Livvy but took no action against the Slovenian, to the visible disgust of some Livingston players. Keaghan Jacobs sent the free-kick over the bar. Five minutes before the break, Kenny Miller sent a 16-yard shot flying over the bar when he really should have tested goalkeeper Jamieson. In the second half more booms erupted in the Rangers end but they were stunned into silence as the dangerous Hippolyte gave Livingston a lead with a terrific goal. McGregor fouled White at the edge of the box and Hippolyte stepped up to curl a stylish and superb free-kick beyond the diving Bell to leave Rangers players and their fans staring at a damaging defeat. Marius Zaliukas equalised a couple of minutes later for Rangers at the Energy Assets Arena . Rangers were unable to force a second goal and get the win, but still leapfrogged Hibernian in the table . But McCall’s men showed the kind of mettle that has been missing for most of this season when they drew level within 120 seconds. Vuckic sent in a free-kick from the left and there was Zaliukas to get in position to flick a backwards header beyond the diving Jamieson. As Rangers searched for a winner, McGregor fired in a powerful shot from the right wing that Jamieson uncomfortably palmed away. And Rangers thought they had gone ahead when Nicky Law fed Miller on the right, and he cut the ball back for Vuckic. But the Newcastle loan star’s shot cracked the inside of the post before being scrambled away to safety. Rangers survived a scare at the other end when Bell slipped but the goalkeeper recovered before White could take advantage of his fall. And the Livvy fans were furious when Zaliukas appeared to foul Scott Pittman in the box, only for referee Aitken to wave play on. McCall went for it, sending on Kris Boyd and young Ryan Hardie for front two Miller and Clark while Tom Walsh replaced Shiels. But his replacements made no impact and Rangers were unable to carve out any more opportunities. At the death, Vuckic was booked for simulation in the box as he desperately claimed a penalty. There was still time for yet another ear-shattering explosion from the Rangers end. But the booms were soon replaced by boos at the full-time whistle as Rangers had stuttered once more on the road. Livvy, for their part, were afforded a rapturous reception from their own band of fans as Mark Burchill’s men moved to within two points of second-bottom Alloa.","Rangers held to 1-1 draw by bottom side in the Championship .

"It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals . Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992 . Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie . Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta . However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp . Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000 . Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal . Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009 . Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United . Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011 . Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United . Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 . Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar.

"Raheem Sterling arrived at Liverpool's Melwood base for training on Wednesday after the latest twist to his controversy-ridden season. Sterling has escaped a club punishment after being caught on video inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide, but fresh pictures have emerged of him holding a shisha pipe, this time alongside young team-mate Jordon Ibe. Sterling, 20, and Ibe, 19, were pictured during what is believed to be a visit to a shisha cafe in London earlier this season. The teenager was spotted arriving at Melwood on Wednesday just seconds after Sterling. Ibe was driving a black Range Rover while Sterling arrived in a white version of the same model. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling pictured arriving at training on Wednesday morning . Sterling arrived at Melwood in a white Range Rover after fresh pictures emerged of him with a shisha pipe . Jordon Ibe at Melwood on Wednesday after he was also pictured alongside Sterling holding a shisha . Sterling is expected to meet Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers on Thursday and he will be reminded of his professional responsibilities and warned about the consequences of taking a drug that has been called ‘hippy crack’. Rodgers questioned Sterling’s professionalism on Monday after footage emerged of the 20-year-old unconscious in his house in Southport having taken nitrous oxide with two unnamed friends. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. It has been a chastening week for Sterling. Pictures were published on Sunday of him smoking a shisha pipe and then a different set of images surfaced on Tuesday of Sterling and Ibe. Casually dressed, the pair are sat on a sofa in front of a table with shisha pipes, cans of fizzy Fanta orange and a portable music speaker. Ibe, wearing a red hoodie and ripped black jeans, is pictured holding a shisha pipe. He is sitting next to Sterling, who is wearing a tight white v-neck t-shirt and blue jeans, on the sofa. The pair can be seen smiling and joking as they hold on to the pipes in the bar. The pictures are believed to have been taken last September. Liverpool offered no comment on those photos. The club maintain the matter will be dealt with internally but he is not going to be fined. Sterling enraged Liverpool after saying in a BBC interview that he was ‘flattered’ to be linked with Arsenal. It is understood, however, that Arsenal have gone cold on Sterling, who scored in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Newcastle on Monday. All talks about his future have been put on hold until the end of the campaign but Ian Ayre, Liverpool’s chief executive, issued a strong line yesterday, insisting that Sterling — who has turned down a contract in the region of £100,000 per week — would be at Anfield for a ‘long time’. Ayre said: ‘Raheem’s agent has asked that we park all discussions regarding his future until the summer. We respect that. Raheem is a Liverpool player and has two years left on his contract. We expect Raheem Sterling to be here for a long time.’ It appears that Sterling and Ibe each have a shisha pipe and are also drinking Fanta . Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Shisha pipes are used to smoke fruit-flavoured tobacco, which is burned on hot coals, through a long tube. They are commonly used in the Middle East. It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes, which calls into question the professionalism of any athlete using the pipe. The British Heart Foundation website it clearly states: ‘Like cigarettes [shisha] contains nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.' Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, was pictured on a social media site with the picture captioned ‘1 down 3 to go’, suggesting he did not just take a single drag on the pipe.
