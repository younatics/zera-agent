"There were no apologies from Floyd Mayweather for claiming to be greater than Muhammad Ali. There was reverence for God, even though Manny Pacquiao believes the Almighty is in his corner. There was an emotional remembrance of the frail old gentleman back in his tough birth-place of Grand Rapids, Michigan who was his surrogate grandfather. Floyd Mayweather is preparing to face Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand on May 2 in Las Vegas . Mayweather has defended his announcement that he feels he is The Best Ever ahead of the mega-fight . Mayweather built a reputation on being brash and flash but was soft-spoken during his conference call . There was sympathy for Freddie Roach in his battle with Parkinson's disease' even though Pacquiao's trainer has been trash-talking his claim to be The Best Ever. There were even soft-spoken words of thanks for we 200 hacks on the conference call for helping sell the half-billion-dollar richest fight of all time. Goodbye to the brash, flash, bombastic Floyd Jnr. Well, more or less. Hello to the mature Mr Mayweather who weighs his words carefully and respects one and all. Well, mostly. He has been slammed for pronouncing himself superior to Ali so he said: 'I respect all the great champions of the past. But I've done just as much as Ali did. 'He was champion at heavyweight but I've won world titles in five divisions. He fought for a helluva cause (anti-Vietnam War) but I'm still sharp at age 38. Still going strong at age 38. 'He lost, once to man who'd only had seven fights previously. I'm undefeated. He called himself The Greatest so I call myself The Best Ever. I knew there would be a back-lash but I couldn't care less. 'He said he was greater than Sugar Ray Robinson and someone else will come along in the future to be criticised for believing he's the best.' The God question did not faze him: 'I also believe in God. I've been blessed in my life. I love God and I don't believe God takes sides (in fights). We are all God's children and I don't think he roots for which of us he wants to win.' Geroge Foreman is down on count two after being struck by Muhammad Ali's killer right-hander in 1974 . Ali looks on after he knocked Foreman to the canvas with the holy mother of all right-handers during the bout . Ali called himself The Greatest and the Rumble in the Jungle was voted the best sporting event of the century . Roach has characterised the fight as 'good against evil' but the barbs have not rattled Mayweather: 'I'm not going to say anything negative about Freddie Roach. Not against someone who's not 100 per cent healthy. He's entitled to say what he wants to say. It's better for me to say nothing at all. 'His fighter is not talking like that and it's only me and Pacquiao who will do the fighting. I wish Freddie well.' The new, considerate Floyd choked up a little when asked about important influences who had inspired him to greatness. He took us back to Grand Rapids and a certain Mr Frank Brown, saying: 'He was important to me from the age of three, Like a grandfather. He would drive me to fights in my amateur days (no Money back then). Sometimes hundreds of miles. He believed in me more than anyone. He told me I'd make it. He took me to church. 'He came to so many of my fights right up to Oscar De La Hoya. But he's not doing well now. He's in an old folks home. He's losing his memory. It hurts. I love the guy so much. I think about him every day.' It went quiet for a moment on the line. It seemed like a good time to ask why he had changed from cocksure to contemplative almost to the point of silence. Mayweather slips a punch from Oscar De La Hoya in the eighth round at the MGM Grand on May 5, 2007 . Mayweather poses with the WBC super welterweight belt after beating De La Hoya by split decision in 2007 . 'I had to be loud to get where we are today,' he said. 'At 17 or 18 I was saying look at me. The big personality was part of that game plan. To get to this point we're at now. Making seven figures in one night. Now I'm here. And as you get older you mature.' And he welcomes the challenge which some think threatens his unbeaten legacy: 'I respect Manny Pacquaio. To be here now he must be doing something right. 'We reached the point where this fight had to happen. He's one of the last great fighters of our time left for me to defeat. I'm glad it's happening.' He goes back again to a moment in his youth: 'When I was 17 or 18 Mike Tyson had come out of prison. I went to the MGM to watch him fight. Busy? I thought, man, we'll never see the MGM Grand this packed ever again. Manny Pacquiao says he will have to be a warrior against Mayweather but is convinced he will win . Pacquiao works out at a park in Los Angeles, California, ahead of his $300million mega-fight on May 2 . Pacquiao is joined by supporters during training as he jogs along a city street to a park in Los Angeles . 'But then I started to believe I could do record numbers one day and now me and my team are making it happen.' Two days earlier Pacquiao had time for only two words at his conference call before his promoter Bob Arum hung up the phone in frustration at some questions he deemed banal. Mayweather gave us about half-an-hour of insights which, at the end, came down to these six words of blinding simplicity: 'My game plan is to win.'","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao meet on May 2 in Las Vegas .

"Smartphones often overheat if they're held close to the body or are used for long periods of time. And while the dangers of overheating lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries have been known for some time, researchers have now revealed exactly what happens inside the 'burning' cells. Thermal images show copper inside the battery reaching temperatures of at least 1,085°C (1,985°F) causing jets of molten material to burst from its vent. Scroll down for video . Researchers subjected Lithium-ion batteries to heat and used thermal imaging and non-invasive high speed imaging techniques to observe changes in their internal structure. Copper inside melted, indicating temperatures of at least 1,085°C (1,985°F), and it caused molten material to stream from the vent (pictured) The footage is the first time the failure of Li-ion batteries due to overheating has been recorded. It was filmed by Paul Shearing  from University College London and the findings are published in the journal Nature Communications. Li-ion batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway, which occurs when the rate of heat generation is greater than the rate of heat lost. Although battery failure is rare, prevention of thermal runaway presents one of the greatest challenges for the safe operation of lithium-ion batteries. Dr Shearing and his colleagues subjected two commercial Li-ion batteries, known as Cell 1 and Cell 2, to external heat. They then used thermal imaging and non-invasive high speed imaging techniques to observe the internal structure of each. Li-ion batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway, which occurs when the rate of heat generation is greater than the rate of heat lost. A Li-ion battery before being subjected to high temperatures is shown left, the same battery after heat abuse is shown right . During tests, one cell remained intact during battery failure and as the heat-generating reactions continued, hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the battery’s vent (pictured left to right). By comparison, the rapid pressure rise in a second cell caused the entire cap of the cell to detach . Cell 1 remained intact during battery failure and as the heat-generating reactions continued, hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the battery’s vent. Li-ion batteries have been known to overheat and are vulnerable to thermal runaway. This occurs when the rate of heat generated in the cell is greater than the rate of heat lost. Lithium-ion cells with cobalt cathodes, for example, are not designed to rise above 130°C (265°F). This is because, at 150°C (302°F) the cell becomes 'thermally unstable'. Once it reaches this state it can lead to a thermal runaway in which flaming gases are released. During a thermal runaway, the high heat in the failing cell can travel to the next cell, causing it to become thermally unstable as well. In some cases, a chain reaction occurs in which each cell disintegrates one-by-one. This means a battery pack can be destroyed within seconds, or the venting of gases and heat can last for hours. As a safety measure, packs are fitted with dividers to protect failing cells from affecting nearby cells. Source: Battery University . The copper material inside Cell 1 melted, indicating internal temperatures of at least 1,085°C (1,985°F). By comparison, the rapid pressure rise in Cell 2 caused the entire cap of the cell to detach. In a real-world situation this could have increased thermal runaway because it allows oxygen into the cell. During a thermal runaway, the high heat in the failing cell can travel to the next cell, causing it to become thermally unstable as well. In some cases, a chain reaction occurs in which each cell disintegrates one-by-one. This means a battery pack can be destroyed within seconds or the venting of gases and heat can last for hours. As a safety measure, packs are fitted with dividers to protect the failing cell form affecting nearby cells. The authors found that thermal and electrochemical reactions inside both cells produced gas pockets that deformed the spiral wound layers of the cells. Cell 2 showed severe internal distortion of its architecture, which the authors suggest compromised its safety. Unlike Cell 2, Cell 1 was designed with a central cylindrical support, which seemed to help maintain its structural integrity. The authors hope their observations will lead to improvements in the design of Li-ion batteries and improve their safety features.","Researchers subjected two Lithium-ion batteries to external heat .

"Rare and valuable pieces of meteorite have fallen to Earth from a gigantic fireball that lit up the skies over Britain and Ireland, experts say. The fireball was captured on camera on Sunday by the United Kingdom Meteor Observing Network (UKMON) in Portadown, County Armagh. Footage shows it glowing brightly as it races northwards towards the Irish Sea. Scroll down for videos . The fireball was captured on camera on Sunday by the United Kingdom Meteor Observing Network (UKMON) in Portadown, County Armagh . UKMON said that pieces from the meteorite, which came from an asteroid in orbit between Mars and Jupiter, would have crashed to Earth and could potentially be worth thousands of pounds. David Moore from Astronomy Ireland told The Mirror: 'This event was so bright that a piece or pieces may have survived the re-entry and landed as extremely rare and valuable meteorites.' However, the group's initial analysis of its trajectory, based on the 50 sightings that were reported to it, suggests that it may well have fallen into the Irish Sea. UKMON said: 'It is very likely something has survived and landed in the Irish Sea. Probably no bigger than 30 to 50 grams.' It added that the meteorite was burning at a very low altitude of  21 miles, compared to the usual 50 to 75 miles and was formed of 'very hard and dense material compared to soft cometary material which we normally see as meteor showers'. The network is appealing for members of the public to report eyewitness accounts of the event. It comes after astronomers revealed that they believe a meteor triggered the conversion of biblical figure Paul, one of the most influential figures in early Christianity, . Experts believe the bright light in the sky that blinded him for three days match accounts of the fireball that streaked across the sky above Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013. Dr William Hartmann, co-founder of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, examined three accounts of Paul's conversion in the Bible. Astronomers revealed that they believe a meteor that streaked across the sky above Chelyabinsk in Russia (pictured) triggered the conversion of biblical figure Paul . The fireball above Chelyabinsk (above) was captured by a number of dashboard cameras in cars . Writing in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, he said: 'The first-century book, Acts of the Apostles, gives three separate descriptions of a bright light ""from heaven"", which occurred probably in the 30s (C.E.) near Damascus, Syria. 'The details offer a strikingly good match to a Chelyabinsk-class or Tunguska-class fireball.' In the accounts given in the Bible, Paul had been one of the zealous persecutors of the followers of Jesus. However, during a journey to Damascus, Syria, he and his companions saw a bright light in the sky. Paul was blinded for three days and he heard a divine voice or sound. The experience apparently so affected Paul that he converted to Christianity and undertook several influential missions to spread the word of Christ around the Mediterranean. Many believe Paul's preaching led to the rise of much of the theology and traditions in the Roman and Protestant faith strands that exist today. However, some have attempted to explain Paul's vision as being the result of some kind of seizure or of sunstroke. Dr Hartmann, however, says the description of the light in the sky, the thunderous sound and the temporary blindness all match the events of a meteorite. He said the Cheyabinsk meteor, which exploded in the atmosphere close to the Russian city, is a good example of what Paul may have experienced. He said that the bright light in the sky - which was 'brighter than the sun, shining round me' - matches videos of the Chelyabinsk meteor, which was estimated to be three times as bright as the sun. Its movement across the sky created fast moving shadows that would have given the impression of the light moving around Paul.","Fireball captured on camera by the UK Meteor Observing Network .

"In Afghanistan, many girls are forbidden from riding bicycles - they are, however, allowed to ride skateboards. So when Australian skateboarder Oliver Percovich created Skateistan, a non-profit organization that aims to connect youth in Afghanistan with education through skateboarding, it shouldn't have been a surprise that 40 per cent of the program's students would be girls. In 2012, photographer Jessica Fulford-Dobson decided to take pictures of these Middle Eastern skater girls, and her work was recently on display at a gallery in London. Scroll down for video . Tough girls: Photographer Jessica Fulford-Dobson took pictures of young girls skateboarding in dresses and skirts in Kabul, Afghanistan . Finding time for fun: Most girls are not allowed to ride bikes in Afghanistan, but skateboarding isn't against the rules . According to Feature Shoot, when Mr. Percovich first brought the program to Kabul, Afghanistan in 2007, many of the locals had never even heard of skateboarding. In fact, Ms. Fulford-Dobson said she believes the reason skateboarding has been received so differently in Afghanistan than in other countries is precisely because it was new to the region. 'When skateboarding arrived in Afghanistan, it didn't have any preconceived images for them. They didn't know what it was,' she said, while adding that it was only accepted after it became clear that it was just 'a toy to have fun with'. Safety first: While the girls were conservatively dressed, they didn't forgo safety measures like wearing helmets and knee pads . Little ladies who skate: Ms. Fulford-Dobson said she was fascinated with just how immaculate one girl, left, was, considering how dusty the skateboard facilities were . This sport knows no gender: 40 per cent of Skateistan's students are female; the girls also have the option of joining a back-to-school program . Now, its the top sport for girls in the country, who are able to ride freely in dresses and other clothing that can be restrictive when playing other sports. When Ms. Fulford-Dobson visited the Skateistan facilities in 2012, she quickly noticed their confidence and the joy they took in learning. She took pictures of them with natural light, capturing them in dresses, pants, headscarves and sneakers as they happily played on skateboards. 'I captured about nine in total,' she told the BBC, recalling one girl whose father had initially told her she couldn't join the skateboarding program. He finally relented after she wouldn't stop begging him. Girls will be girls: Ms. Fulford-Dobson said she was struck by the girls' confidence and how happy they were to skateboard . Unconventional athletic gear: The style of dress required by girls can make it difficult to play other sports, but luckily it doesn’t tend to interfere with their skateboarding . 'I met so many impressive women and girls in Afghanistan: a teacher as tough and determined as any man; young Afghans in their early twenties who were volunteering at an orphanage and were passionate about being seen as strong and willing to fight for themselves, rather than as victims of circumstance; and girls who were being educated to be leaders in their communities and who were already thinking carefully about their own and their country’s future,'  Ms. Fulford-Dobson said. That education is a top priority for Skateistan, as many children in Kabul from low-income families are forced to drop out of school to earn money. Besides being taught to skateboard, the program's participants are also invited to join a free back-to-school program to help them get back on track with their education.","Photographer Jessica Fulford-Dobson took pictures of the girls at the Skateistan facilities in Kabul .

"Nasa has unveiled a revolutionary type of wing that it says could save millions in air travel. The wing is able to morph itself like that of a bird to provide the same functionality as normal flaps, but with much less weight. It can also reportedly be used to increase fuel efficiency and even reduce noise on take-off and landing. Scroll down for videos . Nasa has been testing a flexible wing on a plane in California (shown). The wing can bend from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees. It means that regular flaps aren't needed - and it is much lighter. In this image, the technology is visible at the flat 'flap at the base of the wing . The latest test of the technology took place above Nasa’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. Over the past six months, 22 research flights of the Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE) flight control surface has taken place. The project is a collaboration between Nasa, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and FlexSys from Ann Arbor Michigan. The wing is able to ‘bend’ through angles from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees. Test pilots have described it as being ‘very smooth’, while it can also deal with hard banking manoeuvres and extreme temperatures. For all the flights so far, the wing has flown in a fixed position on a Gulfstream III jet between these two extremes, to ensure risk is minimal. But for future flights, the wings will be able to change angles while in the air. The breakthrough could also increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent, and reduce noise at take-off and landing up to 40 per cent. The wing is shown above bending through its two extremes. The project is a collaboration between Nasa, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and FlexSys Inc from Ann Arbor Michigan. Credit: FlexSys . Figures suggest the breakthrough could increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent, and reduce noise at take-off and landing up to 40 per cent, compared to traditional wing flaps (one shown on a Boeing 737) A Transformer-style ‘flying car’ being developed by an Arizona company could soon spell the end of runways. The company’s vision is to build a vehicle with four rotors that allow it to take to the air anywhere like a helicopter - and then switch to fly like a normal plane. While this ‘SkyCruiser’ vehicle is still some way from development, the technology could soon become a reality in a functioning prototype dubbed the ‘SkyProwler’. The SkyProwler has four horizontal propellers that allow it to perform vertical take-offs and landings, and to hover in mid-air. ‘We are thrilled to have accomplished all of our flight test goals without encountering any significant technical issues,’ said AFRL Program Manager Pete Flick, from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. ‘These flights cap 17 years of technology maturation, beginning with AFRL’s initial Phase 1 SBIR contract with FlexSys, and the technology now is ready to dramatically improve aircraft efficiency for the Air Force and the commercial aviation industry.’ The technology can be fitted to existing airplane wings, so it does not require a complete redesign of current aircraft wings. ‘The completion of this flight test campaign at Armstrong is a big step for Nasa's Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project,’ said ERA project manager Fay Collier. ‘This is the first of eight large-scale integrated technology demonstrations ERA is finishing up this year that are designed to reduce the impact of aviation on the environment.’ It will take years for such a technology to be approved for commercial aircraft, though, so it’s unlikely to be used on planes any time soon. But the cost and fuel economy benefits will be appealing to many if testing continues smoothly.","Nasa has been testing a flexible wing on a plane in California .

"A builder who wolf-whistled a young woman only to be accused of sexual harassment said today she is a 'silly little girl' who was 'lucky' to have received the attention. Ian Merrett, 28, is astonished that Poppy Smart, 23, did not take it as a compliment, which he says has helped him 'snog loads of girls' in the past. The builder  and his colleagues whistled at her every day for a month as she passed their Worcester construction site. Miss Smart, who compared the wolf-whistling to racial discrimination, eventually filmed them and asked West Mercia Police to investigate alleged sexual harassment. Mr Merrett admits it was probably him whistling but called Miss Smart a 'silly little girl' who should never have gone to the police. He said: 'I'm sure if she walks past again and she is lucky she will get wolf-whistled again. I have wolf-whistled so many girls and got so many birds and snogged so many girls off the back of that, and never had a complaint before. But I've got a girlfriend so need to be careful what I say'. Scroll down for video . Fighting back: Builder Ian Merrett, left, was accused of sexual harassment for wolf-whistling Poppy Smart, 23, right, every day for a month, but he has said she should take it as a compliment . Mr Merrett, who was jailed for 12 months in 2009 for affray, also accused her of damaging the reputation of his trade and 'hard working' builders by trying to get them prosecuted. Miss Smart, a marketing co-ordinator, contacted West Mercia Police over the regular taunts and the force went to the building site in Worcester to warn the men about their conduct. She also filmed the whistles and handed the evidence to officers, who followed up Poppy's complaint but had not taken further action, the force said. Mr Merrett, who was branded 'disgraceful' by the judge when he was convicted for the unprovoked train attack six years ago, said: 'It's highly likely it was me who did that wolf-whistle. I've seen the news coverage and it's not right. 'Wolf-whistling is part and parcel of working on a site, it's complimenting a girl. I'm a builder and my mates are builders. We are all hard working people and our reputation has been damaged' 'I can remember that day when she took the video, we were under-pinning a wall that day. 'I only saw the back of her, I didn't even see her face and you can see in the video the wolf-whistle comes after she had passed the gate. 'I didn't even see her face, and I wouldn't recognise her if I fell over her in the street, so I don't know how that could possibly be sexual harassment. 'Police came to our site and said someone had made an allegation of harassment. They showed us the video so we stopped doing it. 'It's not worth getting into trouble over some silly little girl. I don't know why she complained, she must be thinking things above her station.' Mr Merrett was 23 when he received a 12-month prison sentence for an unprovoked attack on a Malvern to Birmingham train in 2009. Jailing him and his friend Anthony Hannay, Judge Amjad Nawaz condemned their 'disgraceful' behaviour after they repeatedly punched passenger Michael Powell in a drunken attack. At the time, the judge told them: 'Loutish behaviour like this is sadly becoming all too common.' Speaking today, Mr Merrett shrugged off the attack, and said: 'It was all a very long time ago when I used to go around town getting p***** up and fighting. 'I was sentenced for 12 months and served six months. It's the first and last time I've been in prison but not the first time I've had a run in with the law. 'As far as I'm concerned, it's in the past, I'm older now and I've got a job and a kid. I'm a different person.' Ms Smart recorded one of the occasions she walked past the building site. There is no suggestion any of the men pictured in the mobile phone footage (shown left and right) were involved in the alleged wolf-whistling . Crime scene: The building yard in Worcester where Ms Smart alleges workman wolf-whistled at her while on her way to work . 'Disrespectful': The 23-year-old marketing co-ordinator (pictured) claimed builders at a construction site wolf-whistled at her every morning as she walked to work in Worcester city centre . Earlier this week, Miss Smart condemned men who wolf-whistle, claiming it was demeaning and compared it to racism. She decided to take action after the workmen whistled and made disrespectful comments towards her as she walked past the building site on her way to work, making it unbearable for her on her daily commute to Worcester city centre. The marketing co-ordinator said it went on for at least a month before she decided to take action. She said: 'I had to walk past that way to go to work and it got so bad that they would actually come out of the building site at the time I walked down the road. 'I often had my earphones in but I could still hear the whistling over it. 'I eventually contacted the building company and the police when it got so bad I even considered changing my route to work but thought 'why should I do that?' 'I remember one of the builders, who was probably 18 or 19, got right in my face and said 'morning love' to me when he was stood with an older guy.' She told Newsbeat they often 'blocked the pavement' forcing her to walk around them. She said: 'I started wearing sunglasses so I didn't have to look at them. I started putting headphones on so I didn't have to hear them. 'Eventually it got to the day where I had enough.' Miss Smart said she decided to film the workmen on her mobile phone and hand the footage to police because 'women shouldn't have to deal with it.' She added: 'I've noticed this behaviour more and more around the city. 'Men will lean out of their cars or vans and shout comments about my appearance or whistle and I know and have seen this happen to others as well. 'I think more women should speak out about this behaviour, maybe it will make people think twice. 'Imagine hearing someone speaking that way to your sister, mother, wife or daughter. 'Personally I don't think that such comments, even if they are considered complimentary by the perpetrators, are appropriate. 'It is very disrespectful and is comparable to calling out at someone of a different race or religion.'","Poppy Smart, 23, accused builders of sexual harassment for wolf-whistling .

"For talented youth team strikers fighting for their big break in the game, goals really are the best currency to convert into those precious first-team minutes. And after extraordinary seasons in which they have both smashed the 35-goal mark, Chelsea's teenage strike duo Tammy Abraham and Dominic Solanke are certainly flush at the moment. The two 17-year-olds are in the form of their young lives, enhancing their reputations every time they find the net and boosting their chances of Jose Mourinho handing them some game time once the Premier League title has been secured. Tammy Abraham scores for Chelsea during their 3-1 FA Youth Cup final first leg win against Manchester City . Striker Dominic Solanke celebrates after scoring Chelsea's third goal at the Academy Stadium on Monday . And after the Portuguese manager said his first-team squad had space for 'three or four kids' next season, there is every incentive to keep scoring. The latest victim of their remarkable goalscoring spree was Manchester City in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final on Monday night. Chelsea will take a commanding 3-1 lead into the second leg at Stamford Bridge after Abraham's double - which took his tally to 36 for the season - was added to late on by Solanke, who has now reached 35. The Blues have consciously tried to recruit talented young players from the London area and Camberwell-born Abraham, who joined the club in the under eights, is a success story of this policy. By any standards, he has enjoyed an exceptional season and one that has featured numerous milestones in his development. Most striking has been the sheer volume of goals for the under 18 team, who finished 10 points clear at the top of the southern section of the Premier League at that age group, and are currently competing in the play-off round. Abraham is top scorer in the whole competition with 22 goals. Solanke (No 9) celebrates with Abraham after the latter's second goal of the night and 36th this season . Solanke, pictured scoring against City, could play for the first-team against Arsenal this weekend . Highlights included back-to-back hat-tricks in away matches with Tottenham (which ended in 4-2 and 6-4 wins), plus four goals during Chelsea's run to success in the UEFA Youth League, the continental competition for under 19 teams. This campaign has also seen a scoring debut for Chelsea's under 21 side and a first involvement with the England youth set-up. It has been the kind of scoring sequence where pretty much anything struck seems to fly into the top corner and that was the case for Abraham's first goal against City. Controlling Charlie Colkett's excellent ball over the top to allow it to run across his body, he sent his shot spearing into the top corner. It was a moment that drew considerable attention on Twitter. Little wonder the dreadlocked frontman described 'scoring goals as the best feeling ever' in an interview after the match. His second goal showed the sort of instinct all successful strikers need, positioning himself on the edge of City's six-yard box to hook the ball home after the goalkeeper had blocked an initial header from Izzy Brown. Abraham (right) poses with team-mates Charly Musonda and Izzy Brown (L-R) after winning the Youth League . Solanke trains regularly with Chelsea's first-team and made his senior debut against Maribor this season . Another strength is his ability to play across the forward line, on either flank or as a central targetman. On Monday, he started on the right, with Solanke as the No 9 and Izzy Brown on the other side. When asked about it, Abraham showed a studious nature when it comes to watching the game: 'Over the years you see how people have to change their positions in games and it's a good thing if you can adapt.' Solanke is a more familiar name to not only followers of Chelsea but football fans in general. He has been part of Mourinho's first-team squad all season alongside Brown, 18, and the midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek, 19. They train daily with the first team and Solanke made his professional debut when he replaced Oscar for the final 20 minutes of a Champions League match with Maribor back in October. He seems well-suited to the continental stage, as shown by the tournament-best 12 goals he scored as Chelsea became the first English side to lift the Youth League after beating Shakhtar Donetsk in Nyon, Switzerland last week. Solanke scored in every round in that competition and has now done likewise in the Youth Cup, a competition he won when Chelsea beat Fulham in last season's final. Abraham acrobatically puts Chelsea 2-1 ahead against Manchester City after Isaac Buckley's equaliser . Solanke scores Chelsea's second goal in their 3-2 win over Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League final . By his standards, it was a quiet night against City but when his chance came in the closing minutes, he made no mistake and scored a potentially tie-killing third. With Diego Costa out injured and Loic Remy and Didier Drogba doubtful, there is a chance Solanke will play against Arsenal in the Premier League this weekend. His performances this season, which has also seen him elevated to England Under 18 standard, mean he is no longer an unknown quantity but any first-team action between now and the close of the campaign will be valuable. Solanke is calm about his future but certainly not complacent. He said after the Youth League success: 'It's a tough task at Chelsea to get into the first team but you've just got to keep working and see what happens. 'You've got to keep trying to improve and impress and who knows what happens in the future.' Like Abraham, he is certainly making a compelling case at the moment.","Tammy Abraham scored twice against Manchester City on Monday .

"Kellie Maloney, pictured at Ukip's spring conference in February, now says that a vote for the party is 'wasted' Kellie Maloney has said that a vote for Ukip is a wasted vote. The celebrity former boxing promoter, formerly known as Frank, is one of the party's most famous former candidates. But she warned Ukip supporters should vote Tory to keep Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon out of power. She told Sky News: 'If we want to stop Labour and the SNP I think you’ve got to vote Tory. A vote for Ukip would be quite wasted I believe. 'I know Ukip are not going to like hearing that, but if they’re honest they would say the same things as well because they’re not going to get enough seats to wield any power. 'I think they’ll get four or five seats, maybe.' She praised Ukip leader Nigel Farage, adding: 'You can’t knock him.' But she warned how other candidates have given the party a bad image. She said: 'There is free speech (in the party) but some of the stuff that comes out from some of the Ukip people. 'I mean no normal person in the street could accept that and I think that is their downfall. 'They could offer some great things to the British public had they sat down and done it right and they weeded out the bad and brought in more people through the ranks.' The former boxing promoter, who stood as the party's candidate for London Mayor in 2004, has just undergone a full gender re-assignment. Speaking about transgender people, she said: 'We are probably where the gay community was 25 years ago and we can learn a lot from them. 'But it would be nice to hear political parties speak up on civil rights and gender issues.' Mr Farage last night dismissed the criticism. He told Sky News: 'There is a fear about Labour and the SNP and that’s why I’m talking to you from Hartlepool because whats happened over the last couple of weeks is there is a strengthening in the Ukip polls and its all coming from Labour. 'So the way to stop Labour/SNP coalition is for Labour voters to switch and vote for Ukip.' When Miss Maloney was standing to London Mayor, she caused controversy by claiming there were 'too many gays' in Camden. She apologised for the homophobic remarks when she addressed Ukip's spring conference in February this year. The criticism is a blow for Ukip leader Nigel Farage who had hoped that Miss Maloney's backing would help to change the image of the party . Mr Farage will today campaign in Hartlepool, where he thinks the party has its best chance of winning in the North East at the election. The seat has been put on Ukip’s list of top ten targets. Other seats outside of the south of England on the list are Great Grimsby, Boston & Skegness, Dudley North and Heywood & Middleton. Mr Farage last night said he believed Ukip could 'smash up' Labour's 'one-party state' in the North. In an article for MailOnline he said Mr Miliband's party 'simply do not understand' the impact mass immigration has had on people's lives. He accused shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna of calling Ukip racist because Labour is 'running scared' of Ukip. Ukip’s strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the North. In 2010 the party failed to achieve even a single second place. The Hartlepool constituency has been held by Labour since it was formed in 1974. In 2010, Ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and Labour’s Iain Wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority. He replaced Peter Mandelson as the MP in a by-election in 2004 after the Labour grandee stood down to become a European Commissioner. Mr Farage’s hopes for electoral victory in Hartlepool come after the town elected a man dressed as a monkey as its mayor in 2002. Stuart Drummond stood as ‘H'Angus the Monkey’, Hartlepool United FC’s mascot, as a publicity stunt with the slogan, ‘free bananas for schoolchildren’. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009 before voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the paid post in 2012. Hartlepool's residents are famously said to have hanged a monkey during the Napoleonic wars because they thought it was a French spy.","Star formerly known as Frank is one of the party's most famous backers .

"An unknown illustrator who films her every move and interacts with strangers for hours at a time has become one of the internet's biggest celebrities - and she's only been online for 29 days. Amanda Oleander, 25, is one of the stars of Periscope, Twitter's new live broadcasting platform and has been 'loved' over 7.5 million times in less than a month since it launched. Branded the Kim Kardashian of the social platform, when the brunette starts a live stream, thousands of Periscope users around the globe stop what they're doing to watch. Scroll down for video . Amanda Orleander, broadcasting live from her bedroom, is the emerging star of Periscope . In a recent broadcast, Amanda addressed her audience via her iPhone from her LA bedroom: 'Do you know the power that we have? Do you guys understand what is happening. 'This is crazy!' Amanda continued during her bedroom broadcast, and before she has even taken a breath, hundreds of hearts flutter on to her screen - more tokens of 'love' from the thousands of people watching. Last month, the art graduate was going about her anonymous life as an illustrator for entertainment site  E! Online but her Periscope broadcasts, which show her going about her daily business in LA, have catapulted her into the limelight. And so far she has had little competition from 'real' celebrities. Ellen DeGeneres is the highest ranking star but is trailing behind Amanda with a mere three million 'loves'. 'This is like a reality show, but it’s not scripted,' Amanda tells her thousands of viewers continuing her bedroom broadcast. 'Before this happened I always thought I'd love to share my life with more people because I’m always up to really spontaneous things.' Amanda mulls over the day during a live broadcast, whilst she chats to the viewers messaging her (which appear on left of screen). So far she has been 'loved' 7.5million times, shown by hearts on the right . The new app not only allows users to stream live video to anyone on Earth who wants to watch, but allows viewers  to chat to the broadcaster in real time by typing  messages that pop up on screen. So Amanda's monologue is peppered with shout-outs and answers to questions from her viewers. 'Hey Charles,' she says acknowledging a new follower. 'I was going to sleep when I thought about this last broadcast. Arlene you’re funny!' she continues in reference to a message, then 'You’re so beautiful' pops up from @Arlene. 'I don’t know how many of you saw me tonight,' she says. 'We randomly talked to my neighbour, then I went to see my friend Yonatan. Then I met with a Periscope follower for the first time.' A little yellow square with the message 'Show us your boobs' flashes up on screen. 'Why would you do that?' she adds. 'Now you're blocked forever.' A live webcam platform, may seem to have porn written all over but users won't be flashing anything X-rated during broadcasts - nudity is banned. Although bought by Twitter in January for close to $100million (£67million), Periscope  is a tech mash-up of selfies, social networking and reality TV,  only launched last month, . Twitching curtains to peek at the neighbours may still be a 'no' but watching Amanda randomly go about her day? That's 'way cool', to quote the star herself. And like all the best social networking platforms, the content need not be thrilling to grab considerable global attention. In the last 24 hours, Amanda has broadcast some mundane errands, some sitting in traffic in her Prius (phone in recording mode balanced on her dash board, of course) and a random chat with her neighbour . Periscope allows people to live-stream video from their phones to their Twitter followers with the click of a button. The Periscope team outlined a range of possibilities for the service, including how it can turn any smartphone user into a global reporter. In the last 24 hours, Amanda has broadcast herself going on mundane errands, sitting in traffic in her Prius (phone in recording mode balanced on her dash board, of course) and a random chat with her neighbour. Five hours before her bedtime round-up, Amanda was broadcasting live from an LA bar, watching her friend Yonatan perform the bass guitar. 'I'm drinking water. I don't like to drink alcohol,' Amanda tells viewers in answer to their questions, before introducing some followers she's come across at the bar. 'Hey we're double Persicoping,' she says capturing her new friends waving their phones in the air capturing her capturing them. But it's all too much - even for Amanda. 'We’re going to get off the phone soon so we can enjoy each others' real company,' she says. What will today hold for Amanda when she wakes up in a few hours time? Judging by today, perhaps a trip to the post office, a bit of sitting in traffic and a lot of mulling over the wonders of her new found mutual love for Periscope. Sound thrilling? Don't be shy to admit it. Millions agree. Amanda broadcasting live from an LA bar. 'I'm drinking water. I don't like to drink alcohol,' she tells viewers in answer to questions about what she's drinking . Despite the initial hype surrounding the launch of Periscope, Twitter's iPhone app, which is being touted as a revolutionary new way to share news, there are already a concerning number of users, particularly women, reporting that they have been sexually harassed, or trolled. Justin Esgar , App Developer of the app Goodnight, told FEMAIL that because Periscope 'allows users to share even more of their intimate lives with each other than ever before', there are 'apparent dangers' that users have to consider before accessing it. Special features: The app, which is owned by Twitter, allows users to follow certain people (L) and scroll through a 'Watch' feed of live videos (R) Emma Barker, sex and relationships editor at Cosmopolitan.com, noted that the app is already crawling with men who are using the anonymity afforded to them by the app's settings in order to sexually harass women - including one of her female friends. She explained that her friend recently tried out the app by sharing a conversation she was having with her female roommate. They were fully clothed, sitting on a couch and casually conversing, yet 'within the first 20 seconds the first comment popped up’, asking for the women to ‘show butt’. While neither of them were speaking in an even remotely sexual manor, the lewd comments continued to pour in and included phrases such as: 'Show boobs', 'Age?' and 'I would soooo swipe right on both [sic]!' Streaming revolution: Periscope, an iPhone app that allows users to broadcast live video and audio to the internet, launched last Thursday . One particularly creepy user asked: 'Do you get out of the shower to pee?' According to Periscope's community guidelines, the app prohibits 'pornographic or overtly sexual content' as well as 'explicitly graphic content or media that is intended to incite violent, illegal or dangerous activities'. And while a spokesperson for the app told Emma that Periscope has a team dedicated to content review, there doesn't appear to be anything specific being done to prevent sexual commentary and online harassment. The app's policies are, unsurprisingly, similar to Twitter, which is currently testing out a 'quality filter' that monitors and removes threats and offensive language out of users notifications feeds. It's not clear as to whether or not Periscope will be given a similar screening system.","Strangers watch Amanda Oleander, 25, from LA, all day long .

The Eshima Ohashi bridge in Japan – the third largest of its kind in the world – rises sharply so ships can pass underneath . The concrete road bridge, pictured, spans a mile across Lake Nakaumi, linking the cities of Matsue and Sakaiminato . The two-lane concrete road bridge stretches 1.7km or just over 1 mile long and has a width of 11.4 metres making it the largest rigid frame bridge in Japan and the third largest in the world. It's incredible slope, which has a gradient of 6.1 per cent on the Shimane Prefecture side and 5.1 per cent on the Tottori Prefecture side gives it a rollercoaster-like appearance. The unusual steep bridge was recently featured in a commercial for Daihatsu Motor Co.'s Tanto minivan to test the vehicle's durability. 1. Sidhue River Bridge – China . At an incredible 460m (1509ft), it is the highest bridge in the world. Suspended across the Sidhue River in the Badong County of the Hubei Province, in stretches more than 1,300m to connect Shanghai and Chendo. The bridge makes up part of a dangerous mountain path known as highway Huyu G50. 2. Millau Viaduct - France . When it was opened in 2004, this was the world’s tallest vehicular bridge and it is still taller than the Eiffel Tower at its highest point. The cable-stayed bridge, which spans across the Tarn River Valley in southern France, remains in the world's top twenty highest at 270m above the valley floor. The tallest concrete pylon on the Millau Viaduct is 800ft on its own  -  higher than most buildings . 3. Monkey Bridges – Vietnam . Made of one single bamboo log for your feet, and another as a rather unsteady handrail, this bridge us named from the stooped 'monkey-like' posture people must adapt when crossing to try and avoid falling into the river below. 4. Royal Gorge Bridge - Colorado, US . America’s highest suspension bridge can look down nearly 90 stories at the Arkansas River in the Royal Gorge below. At 295m (969 ft tall) and 384m (1,260ft) long, it was first built in 1929, but it did not get stabilizing wind cables until 1982 meaning it would have swung dangerously in a high gust. 5. Trift Suspension Bridge -Switzerland . Suspended across the Alps, this bridge has some of the most stunning views in the world. Built at 100m ( 328ft) high and 170m (558ft) long, Trift was built in 2004 and became one of the mountain range's longest and highest pedestrian suspension bridges. It was supposed to connect hikers to a hut made inaccessible by a retreating glacier but it was known to swing wildly when windy and was only allowed to be crossed in summer months in clear weather. Higher handrails and stabilizing cables were installed in 2009 but the bridge is still known to move in bad weather.","Eshima Ohashi bridge in Japan is the third largest of its kind in the world .

"Britain's intelligence agencies have been ordered to destroy information they got illegally by spying on confidential communications between a Libyan dissident and his lawyers, a watchdog has ruled. GCHQ, the Government’s listening post, unlawfully intercepted telephone calls and emails from Sami al-Saadi – even though the legally-privileged material was protected by strict rules. In a landmark ruling yesterday, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) the only judicial body with the power to investigate the security services, ordered spies to destroy two copies of the sensitive eavesdropped communications. Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham. The Government’s listening post unlawfully intercepted telephone calls and emails from Sami al-Saadi, it has been ruled . GCHQ confessed it intercepted confidential conversations between Mr al-Saadi (pictured) and his lawyer . Mr al-Saadi has fought a legal battle against the British Government claiming it was complicit in kidnapping him and sending him back to his homeland to be tortured by the Gaddafi regime. But the IPT said the dissident should not receive compensation for breaching Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to private and family life. Intelligence chiefs sparked fury in February by admitting that they had unlawfully listened in to lawyer-client communications even though they are generally covered by 'legal professional privilege' to protect privacy and the right to a free trial. Now GCHQ has confessed it intercepted confidential conversations between Mr al-Saadi and his lawyer. The IPT rejected similar claims by other Libyan claimants including Abdel Hakim Belhadj, another prominent anti-Gaddafi campaigner. Britain has already paid Mr al-Saadi £2.2million compensation after he took legal action over MI6's role in his abduction, imprisonment and mistreatment by Libya. Mr Belhadj is currently suing the UK. It has not been disclosed what type of material the two documents contained or when they were recorded but they are likely to be transcripts of telephone conversations secretly intercepted by GCHQ. Last night Mr al-Saadi said: ‘I had always been told I had a right to communicate with my lawyers about this torture case in private, but that clearly wasn’t the case. Tony Blair with former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Mr al-Saadi has fought a legal battle against the British Government claiming it was complicit in kidnapping him and sending him back to his homeland to be tortured by the Gaddafi regime . ‘This was illegal behaviour and I hope now that the right to take legal advice in private will never be ignored again.’ Richard Stein, his solicitor, said: ‘GCHQ unlawfully spied on privileged legal communications for years, and the secret oversight mechanisms failed to stop it. ‘This marks the end of GCHQ’s standard boilerplate response that its activities are lawful, necessary and proportionate. I am sure that the unlawful behaviour we have uncovered in this case is the tip of the iceberg.’ Cori Crider, of legal charity Reprieve, which represented the families, said: ‘GCHQ spied on privileged legal communications, in a case where they were being sued by a rendition and torture victim. ‘We are pleased that one man has finally beaten the security services in this secretive tribunal. But this kind of illegal snooping makes phone hacking look like child’s play, because it rigs the whole justice game in the government’s favour.’ The IPT's ruling said that two documents involving al-Saadi ‘contained material subject to the legal professional privilege… held by GCHQ’. It added: ‘In order to emphasise the importance of the protection of legally privileged material the tribunal has required GCHQ to give an undertaking that the parts of the documents containing legally privileged information will be destroyed or deleted so as to render such information inaccessible to the agency in the future.’ The IPT rejected similar claims to Mr al Saadi's made by other Libyan claimants, including Abdel Hakim Belhadj (pictured), another prominent anti-Gaddafi campaigner . Mr al Saadi was kidnapped with his family in Hong Kong in 2004, and tortured after his rendition to Libya following what he claims was a tip-off by MI6. He was eventually freed and returned to Britain where he began legal action against the Government. In December 2012 Britain agreed to pay Mr al Saadi £2 million in compensation in an out of court settlement. However, the Government did not admit liability for the rendition to Libya in 2004, nor confirm that MI6 was involved. Mr Belhadj is currently suing the UK over the same scandal. He insists he was tortured during six horrific years in jail, including being beaten and hung from hooks on the walls. The former Islamist rebel, now a prominent politician in Tripoli, has spurned a seven-figure settlement and wants an admission of guilt and an apology from Britain. Last October, the Court of Appeal heard claims that the British Government under Tony Blair was complicit in the arrest of Mr Belhadj and his wife at Bangkok airport in 2004. His legal battle raises the extraordinary prospect of Mr Straw and Sir Mark Allen, a former senior MI6 spy, being hauled before the courts to give evidence. A Government spokesman said: ‘We welcome the tribunal's confirmation today that the intelligence agencies did not seek or gain any advantage in legal proceedings and, in fact, held no information referring to any legal advice relating to the claimants.’","Sami al-Saadi's  communications with his lawyer were illegally intercepted .

"Celtic are considering a second double raid on Dundee United for teenager John Souttar and striker Nadir Ciftci. The Tannadice club sparked a row with supporters when they sold star duo Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to the Parkhead club on deadline day in January. Jackie McNamara’s side have won just three of their 14 games since, and lost 3-0 at home to Ronny Deila’s side on Sunday. Dundee United midfielder John Souttar (right) challenges for possession with Celtic's Kris Commons . Heavily linked with Ciftci in January, the Norwegian has also earmarked 18-year-old Souttar as potential cover for Scott Brown and Nir Bitton in a holding midfield role. The teenager has recently impressed in the middle of the pitch since switching from central defence. Ciftci and Souttar are under contract until May next year and could go for a combined fee of £1.5million. Admitting there is huge pressure on the Europa League contenders not to sell any more players to Celtic, however, United No 2 Simon Donnelly said: ‘I think that’s always going to be there. All the drama that was whipped up over the stuff in January wasn’t helpful to the club, but we as coaches and the manager just have to try and focus on our job here. You are always going to have interest and speculation. We’ve had to deal with it for the two years we’ve been here.’ Adding to the pressure on United was the public release of a clause in manager McNamara’s contract entitling him to a cut of any transfer profits. Celtic are also interested in signing striker Nadir Ciftc from Dundee United . Insisting Tannadice minds are focused on securing a European slot next season, Donnelly played down talk of a move for Ciftci or anyone else, adding: ‘Nadir is a Dundee United player, so it’s our job in the next five games to go and try to reach Europe and Nadir will help us do that.’ Meanwhile, referee Steven McLean will be back in the firing line this weekend for the first time since he and his officials missed a crucial hand-ball by Caley Thistle defender Josh Meekings in Celtic’s Scottish Cup semi final defeat to Inverness at Hampden on April 19. The duo are likely to cost Celtic around £1.5million, the second double raid on the club after signing Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven . Celtic, who had been leading 1-0 at the time, went on to lose 3-2 and subsequently wrote to the SFA demanding an explanation. Meekings was hit with a notice of complaint by SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan, which could have seen him miss the final, but Inverness were successful in contesting the charge. As a result of the fall-out, McLean was spared a top-flight assignment last week, serving as fourth official in Motherwell’s trip to Hamilton, but will be back in the middle on Saturday for the bottom-six clash between Kilmarnock and Accies at Rugby Park.","Celtic considering bids for Dundee United's John Souttar and Nadir Ciftci .

"A new antibody injection could 'wipe out advanced cancer' by rooting out and obliterating tumours, scientists have revealed. The research has been hailed a 'tour de force', raising hopes the body's immune system could be trained to attack melanoma, pancreatic, breast and lung cancer. The team at Stanford University School of Medicine believe the laboratory-engineered antibodies could eradicate not only primary tumours, but also distant metastases that have spread through the body. Professor Edgar Engleman, senior author of the study, said: 'The potency is impressive. 'You actually see tumour eradication.' A new study has suggested an antibody injection could 'wipe out cancer' by rooting out and eradicating both primary tumours and distant metastases, where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body . Their findings have been hailed a 'tour de force', raising hopes the body's immune system could be trained to attack melanoma, pancreatic, lung and breast cancer, pictured . His team concluded their approach differed to other potential treatments that only apply to specific cancers, in that it could target a wide range of solid tumours. The process relies on the same mechanism as that which causes animals' bodies to reject organ transplants, researchers said. In both cases, antibodies - molecules that detect foreign substances in the body - trigger the immune system. They bind themselves to proteins from the foreign tissue - in this case the tumour - and through the use of signalling cells, alert T-cells, that act like the immune's system's SWAT team. When the T-cells come into contact with the 'unwelcome' tissue, they attack and destroy it. Researchers isolated the antibodies from mice that were found to be resistant to the cancers. They then injected these antibodies, along with chemicals that activated signalling cells, known as dendritic cells, into cancerous mice. The mice mounted an immune response and were found to remain cancer-free for more than a year. Once primed to recognise the cancerous tissue, the T-cells would multiply and not only attack the tumour, but hunt down any metastatic cells travelling through the body. The team concluded their approach differed to other potential treatments that only apply to specific cancers, in that it could target a wide range of solid tumours, including melanoma, pictured . Dr Yaron Carmi, the lead author, discovered both antibodies and the signalling, dendritic cells are both crucial for tumour elimination. 'Within hours after injection, these tumour cells are already coated with antibodies,' he said. He added when the team disabled the antibodies' ability to bind to the tumours, or the dendritic cells' ability to ingest the tumours, the T-cells failed to eradicate the cancer. 'T-cells contain the bullets, but in our system, the antibodies start the whole thing off,' Professor Engleman, said. By adding chemicals that encouraged the growth of the signalling, dendritic cells, to the antibodies, the researchers were able to eliminate six different types of cancer - two melanomas, lymphoma, breast, lung and pancreatic cancer. 'Dr Carmi was able to show that this combination therapy was extraordinary powerful,' said Professor Engleman. 'Pretty much we could eliminate any cancer.' While the researchers tested their process in mice, they said in vitro work with human cancer cells indicates a similar immune-cell response. To confirm that, blood plasma from 10 healthy donors was pooled to collect antibodies against four cancers from patients: two lung and two mesothelioma cancers. The antibodies with the stimulation factors were able to activate the two lung cancer patients' dendritic cells in vitro. The process relies on the same mechanism as that which causes animals' bodies to reject organ transplants, researchers said.In both cases, antibodies - molecules that detect foreign substances in the body (computer generated image, pictured) - trigger the immune system . With the cells from the two mesothelioma cancer patients, the antibodies induced T-cell proliferation in vitro under the same experimental conditions. Medical oncologist assistant professor Holbrook Kohrt at Stanford, who was not involved with the study, called the paper 'a nice tour de force' and believes the novel therapeutic strategy could utilise the patient's own immune system to defend against certain cancers. He oversees numerous clinical trials involving immunotherapy for cancer patients and thinks an important aspect of the technique is its potential to fight different tumour types. He added that given the chemicals used have already been used in other clinical trials, developing them into a therapeutic drug should be 'fairly straightforward'. 'I honestly think the most important thing is to see if we can bring this new approach into the clinic,' said Professor Engleman. 'That's where we want to go.' The study was published in the journal Nature.","Study at Stanford University has been hailed a 'tour de force'

"More than 70 years ago these five men each played their own vital role in the Normandy campaign that began with the D-Day landings. Two were just teenagers, another was a young sapper, one a rookie tank driver and the last was a veteran of jungle warfare. All ordinary young men doing their bit to help liberate France. Until now their exploits have escaped the attention of historians, but yesterday these veterans of World War Two stood proudly side by side after being awarded France’s highest decoration, the Legion d’Honneur. Courageous veterans are given France's highest honour for their vital role on D-Day in a ceremony at Yorkshire Air Museum, Left to Right: Gordon Collinson, Eric Gerald Briscoe, Thomas William Wright, Eric Gill, James Denwood and Catherine Rush who was accepting the Honour on behalf of her late husband Bernard Rush . Conducting the ceremony at the Yorkshire Air Museum at Elvington, near York, the French Ambassador Sylvie Bermann told the frail veterans: ‘I am here in recognition of your heroic accomplishments in the liberation of France and to honour your bravery and dedication.’ Aged between 90 and 99, they are among the first of 2,800 living veterans who will receive the Legion of Honour in the months to come. The decision was announced by French President Francois Hollande following last summer’s 70th anniversary celebrations and the ambassador said: ‘France will keep its promise.’ Although the memories are now fading, this group of humble soldiers - along with the widow of a veteran who died recently - couldn’t hide their pride as they received what will probably be the last medal of their extraordinary lives. Eric Gill (right), a veteran of the Burma campaign who landed on a beach in Normandy, pictured during the liberation of France . GERRY BRISCOE was a butcher when he joined up at 18, a year later he was putting his life on the line by storming a Normandy beach. It was his first ever action and a terrifying experience for a hardened veteran let alone a youngster. A sapper with the Royal Engineers, he owes his life to a stroke of luck. ‘On D-Day I should have been the last one in the boat to be the first one out because I was carrying a charge to blow up a pill box,’ he recalled. ‘I miscounted so I finished up the first one in the boat and so the last one out. The lad that got out the boat first drowned straight away because the boat went over him. There for the grace of God, I was saved.’. Battle was raging when Mr Briscoe reached shore and discovered the pill box had already been blown up by a shell, but there were chaotic scenes all around. ‘The Germans were still firing at us and there were shells firing all over the place and the rockets from the big main ships were going over to the Germans.’ He said: ‘You are frightened to death really, I remember it well.’ The teenager helped build a bridge in the days that followed and continued working on bridges and roads to help Allied troops as they headed for Germany. He was among the first troops into Brussels and recalled the local citizens coming out with bowls of warm water, because the soldiers were covered in dirt, and meat sandwiches. After the war he returned to working as a butcher. He married wife Jean, now 86, and the couple had two children. Mr Briscoe, 90, from Bradford, said of the honour: ‘I am very pleased about it. I have gone to France regularly over the years and received medals but this one is the top of the shop. France's highest award, the Legion of Honour, is pinned on James Denwood by Her Excellency Madame Sylvie Berman . The Legion of Honour medals for the five veterans aged between 90 and 99 who are among the first of 2,800 living veterans who will receive the Legion of Honour in the months to come . BILL WRIGHT was a fresh-faced 19-year-old recruit and D-Day was his first experience of warfare. ‘People don’t realise that for about half the forces on D-Day it was their first action,’ he said. Mr Wright said he recalled being extremely sea sick on the way over as the seas were choppy. He was on one of the American landing craft and remembered ‘the chap in charge was absolutely brilliant.’ ‘He was not much older than me and looked like a young President Kennedy. He was cool as a cucumber and put us ashore almost dry.’ Mr Wright was in the Staffordshire Yeomanry who came ashore in the ‘second wave’ of troops. Fortunately for him he was inside a tank – working as the radio operator and loader. His tank was stuck in a ‘traffic jam on the beach’ as there were few exits amid the fierce battle. ‘We were too busy to be frightened,’ he said. ‘Everybody was very conscious we were making history. As a young lad out of school it was a most terrific adventure.’ Mr Wright stayed in Normandy for two months before returning to England to re-train to work in amphibious tanks. In the winter of 1944 he saw further action in Holland and then moved into Germany in the final months of the war. ‘My tank was knocked out but fortunately none of us were hurt,’ he said. Her Excellency Madame Sylvi awarded Frances highest honour the Legion dHonneur at the Yorkshire Air Museum . After the war he married his childhood sweetheart Margaret. They had three children and he worked in forestry. Commenting on yesterday’s award, the 90-year-old widower from York said: ‘It’s a great honour, but there are far more deserving souls who didn’t get it.’ ERIC GILL was a veteran of the Burma campaign when he landed on a beach in Normandy. Later, when the action moved to Holland, he had an astonishing escape when shrapnel pierced his helmet and ‘scalped him.’ The Private with the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry suffered a six inch wound on his head and couldn’t see for the blood streaming over his face, but he survived to tell the tale. Born in Doncaster and one of nine children, he left school at 14 to work down the pit. The teenage miner worked with the pit ponies. At 19, with the Nazi threat growing, he joined the army and was in Burma when war broke out. His wartime adventures saw him escape the horrors of the Burmese jungle by walking 400 miles to India, then travel to Australia with 1,000 Italian prisoners of war and on to New York before returning to ‘Blighty.’ He arrived in Normandy four days after D-Day and headed across mainland Europe on the push for victory. Mr Gill, 99, married wife Doris and had two children. He had various jobs, including being a plasterer and graveyard worker, before retiring. Gordon Collinson talks to his Air Cadet grandson Alfie Tomlinson at the award ceremony at the Yorkshire Air Museum . GORDON COLLINSON should have been in the relative safety of a tank when he landed on Gold Beach. Unfortunately, his tank broke down and couldn’t get off the landing craft. The 20-year-old tank driver was forced to wade ashore carrying his rifle around his head as bullets flew all around him. A man of small stature, the water was up to his nose at one point, but he was grabbed by his comrades and managed to survive the terrifying experience. He eventually found a tank to board so he could continue with his duties. Mr Collinson ended up battling his way across France and going into the heart of Germany during the final months of the war. He was among the Allied troops to reach Berlin in May 1945 after the Russians arrived first and witnessed the scenes of terrible devastation. After the war he married and had three children and spent the rest of his working life as a civil servant. He is now aged 91 and living in York. JAMES DENWOOD was lucky to survive the early stages of the war to take part in the Normandy invasion. He was on board the troopship and former Cunard liner the Lancastria when it was sunk in June 1940 as it evacuated exhausted soldiers from northern France. Around 5,000 died but Mr Denwood was among the lucky ones and survived. ‘It went down in 20 minutes,’ he recalled yesterday. ‘I was like a duck and had to swim.’ The veterans of World War Two stood proudly side by side after being awarded France’s highest decoration, the Legion d’Honneur . The Legion of Honour medals were awarded after an announcement by French President Francois Hollande following last summer’s 70th anniversary celebrations and the ambassador said: ‘France will keep its promise' He was a sapper in the Royal Engineers during the D-Day landings and was designated to work on a fuel pipeline - ensuring the Allied forces could maintain total air supremacy. He married wife Edith during the war and the eldest of his three children was born in 1944. When the fighting ended he returned to Cumbria to work in the quarries and eventually moved down to South Yorkshire to work in a steel works. He is now aged 97 and living in Mexborough, South Yorkshire. BERNARD RUSH was a chief petty officer in the navy and turned 21 five days before D-Day. He was an engineer whose job was to repair damaged vehicles. After the war he returned to working in the cotton mills at Silsden, West Yorkshire, and rose to become a manager. Mr Rush died last September aged 91 but the French government took the ‘exceptional’ decision to give the father-of-four the promised award posthumously. His widow Catherine, 83, collected it for him and said: ‘He would have been over the moon and so proud.’","Group are the first living veterans of 2,800 to receive the Legion of Honour .

"Johanna Basford, 32, has released a colouring book for adults which has sold 226,000 in one month . A colouring book has become a sell-out success thanks to an unusual twist – it is designed for adults. Since British artist Johanna Basford created one of the first colouring books for grown-ups in 2013, called Secret Garden, it has sold over 1.5million copies and inspired a flurry of similar books. Now, the 32-year-old’s second book Enchanted Forest has sold out within weeks of its release. Some 226,000 copies were scooped up last month and the publishers have now printed another 250,000. Enchanted Forest reached number one on the UK Amazon book chart at the start of April, while the two books took first and second place on Amazon’s bestsellers list for the US. Mother-of-one Miss Basford, from Aberdeen, said she has been contacted by people from all walks of life who enjoy her ‘stress-relieving’ books, from artists to investment bankers. She said colouring books were no longer viewed as ‘childish’ and instead allowed everyone to express their creative side. She added: ‘I think it has been a bit of an underground movement for a long time. ‘People have always loved colouring because it is a very accessible way of unleashing your creative side. But I think it was seen as childish. By creating adult books, with more intricate designs, it makes it more socially acceptable. 'It is a book of artwork geared towards an adult audience.’ The artist, who is married to James Watt – the owner of craft beer company BrewDog – said adults had been enjoying children’s colouring books for years but had been sheepish about admitting it. Miss Basford said she had been stunned by the response to her books, which will soon have sold close to 2million copies and been translated into 14 languages. She previously did commercial work designing packaging and perfume bottles, but now focuses almost full-time on her colouring books. She said: ‘It started as a selfish pursuit to create a book that I loved. I didn’t do any market research. ‘We initially printed 13,000 copies and I honestly thought my mum was going to have buy a lot of books just to save face.’ Enchanted Forest, the mother-of-one's second release, reached number one on the UK Amazon book chart at the start of April, while the two books took first and second place on Amazon’s bestsellers list for the US . The designer studied textiles at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee, but focused on drawing after graduating. Several years later, she came up with the idea of a whimsical colouring book for adults after her clients said her black and white designs would be perfect for colouring. It took her nine months to design her first book, which she juggled in between commercial assignments for companies such as Absolut Vodka, Sony and Nike. She said she now receives thousands of pictures from fans who want to show off their colouring in, adding: ‘It is a really inclusive activity. ‘I have heard from artists who can no longer do their original discipline for health reasons but still want to be creative, and from people recuperating from an illness who find it therapeutic. ‘It is stress-relieving. People using the books include investment bankers, academics and lots of people in finance. Colouring lets you lose yourself in your own bubble.’","Johanna Basford released Secret Garden in 2013 which sold 1.5m copies .

"A Celtic treble is gone, but the recriminations, anger and sense of injustice will linger and fester for some time to come. Cup defeats to Inverness are rarely a tranquil affair. On a fateful night in Glasgow 15 years ago the Highlanders inflicted the first of their damaging, deeply defeats on Scotland's champions. They've made a habit of it down the years. Yet in a re-enactment of the night Caley went ballistic their players celebrated David Raven's late, extra-time strike by sliding joyously on their fronts before a small, delirious support. David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner . The celebrations continue on the pitch as Inverness rejoice in reaching the William Hill Scottish Cup final . They will be back here in greater number for this club's first ever Scottish Cup final against Falkirk – a former club of manager John Hughes - on May 30 where they will be favourites to triumph. 'That doesn't sit nice with me,' said Hughes afterwards. 'I love to be underdogs. I love to create a siege mentality.' This dogged, energetic Inverness side – driven on by their man of the match captain Graeme Shinnie – perform better as underdogs. Yet who can dispute they now have an outstanding chance of winning their first major trophy, a mere 21 years since the acrimonious amalgamation which led to their entry to the senior ranks? Before then comes weeks of uproar. Days of Celtic anger, finger jabbing and injustice over the standard of officiating here. Not, it must be said, without justification. The standard of Scottish refereeing remains an ongoing embarrassment. Supporters of other clubs believe Celtic have had their share of favourable decisions down the years. If that's true this was a pretty savage slice of karma. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute . A goal to the good via Virgil van Dijk's superb 16th minute free-kick the Parkhead side were denied a clear penalty kick – followed by an Inverness red card for Josh Meekings - before half-time. Celtic's Stefan Johansen was deftly played through on goal, his shot parried across goal the face of goal by Inverness keeper Ryan Esson, where Leigh Griffiths seemed certain to score with a swooping header. The hand of Meekings blocked the ball, yet additional assistant referee Alan Muir - standing five yards away – failed to see it through the bodies in his way. With Meekings off and a chance to make it 2-0 from 12 yards this could easily have been the Celtic walkover people expected. Where Inverness are concerned, we should all know better. Four times in the last 15 years they have denied their more feted opponents big victories in league and cups at a critical juncture. Greg Tansey shoots past replacement goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska to equalise for Inverness . And the turning point for this latest triumph came in 53 minutes. In a bitter, unpalatable irony for Celtic supporters it came from a penalty. And a red card for their keeper Craig Gordon after he upended Marley Watkins as he outstripped Adam Matthews and hared in behind the Celtic defence. The decision to dismiss the Celtic keeper was correct. That the officials had gone this one right – while making such a hash of the first half equivalent – was of no consolation to Celtic's players and management at time up. Ronny Deila began a slow, menacing trudge towards the other side of the pitch to confront referee MacLean and his officials. His captain Scott Brown, making his a little too forcibly, had been dragged away seconds earlier. 'I didn't say so much,' said the Norwegian. 'I just asked if he knew what he had done. That's it. He didn't know. He hadn't seen it.' Virgil van Dijk's post match protestations were strong enough to earn a booking. Edward O'Fere gave Inverness the lead in the 96th minute despite the attention of Van Dijk . 'Everybody of course gets angry,' added Deila. 'But that's why football is interesting, it's a tough world, that's why it's so hard to get the treble. It's small details that can make you fail and today it was a small detail that made it hard for us.' To say so, however, is to overlook a rather large obstacle in Celtic's way; Inverness. For Lukasz Zaluska, Craig Gordon's deputy, the task of keeping Greg Tansey's penalty out with his first touch was a tall order. James Forrest had also been sacrificed in a tactical manoeuvre and suddenly Inverness, with their one man advantage, had the legs and the running. On a diet of three games a week the champions elect looked tired and leggy, their bench options limited. With Forrest gone they were neutered. Who could have predicted that when they began the game with purpose and intent? Nir Bitton smashed a first time right foot shot off the junction of post and bar in 12 minutes. Four minutes later they took the lead with a superb strike from van Dijk. John Guidetti levels matters in the 116th minute with a well-taken free-kick . Inverness defender Gary Warren was booked for a crude - if vital - foul on Forrest on the edge of the box as the Celtic winger threatened to use his pace to rampage the Inverness support. Van Dijk took the free kick, curling a magnificent right foot effort into the top left hand corner of off the inside of the post. On league duty last week Inverness had recovered from the loss of an early goal and so it was here. In last season's League Cup Final defeat to Aberdeen in Glasgow the team in blue stood accused of being dour and unadventurous. The same couldn't be said here. Whatever the Celtic injustices, they can hardly deny their opponents played to devastating effect on the break. They should have been out of the game by half-time. Celtic had the chances. Yet their captain Graeme Shinnie had an outstanding game, proving the man of the match. When the highlanders equalised they were the stronger sharper team. A weary Celtic clung on slightly for extra-time. And in 95 minutes it seemed they were broken when Shinnie's cross from the left touchline ricocheted off the knee of Marley Watkins into the path of striker Edward Ofere. The Nigerian, who had blown a golden opportunity to level in the first half, guided his shot low and true past the outstretched left hand of Zaluska. Craig Gordon might have made the save. In every sense Celtic looked weak and vulnerable now. They weren't out of it completely. Not yet. Celtic players stand dejected on the pitch following their 3-2 loss . In a personal disaster for Inverness stand-in keeper Ryan Esson – who had enjoyed a fine game beforehand – allowed a swirling John Guidetti free-kick to bounce over his outstretch hands and into the net for 2-2 12 minutes into extra-time. Inverness could – should have had a second penalty when the unconvincing Zaluska clattered his fists into the back of Ofere in 108 minutes. But they wouldn't be denied. With four minutes of extra-time to play. David Raven, castigated by his manager before extra-time, slammed the ball into the net from an acute angle after more outstanding work by Shinnie, driving into the area and hammering the ball across the face of goal. 'Coming into extra time he was sitting down,' said Hughes in some disgust afterwards. 'I grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and told him to stand up because sitting down is, for me, a sign of weakness in those circumstances.' Such was the Inverness strength that Celtic were done. They were gone. Their upporters drifted away silently, but in the days to come they will have plenty to say. And for Scotland's referees there will be no avoiding the din.","Virgil van Dijk gave Celtic the lead with a superb free-kick .

"They take singing very seriously in the Philippines. In 2007, a 29-year-old karaoke performer was shot dead at a bar in San Mateo for delivering an off-key rendition of My Way. There followed a spate of copycat killings provoked by inadequate attempts at the song. The death toll now as high as 12, many clubs have taken My Way off their playlist. Manny Pacquiao need not worry. He already has two platinum albums to his name back home. And that’s the thing; in a country where the line ‘and now the end is near’ can have literal truth if delivered out of tune, Pacquiao’s voice really isn’t particularly special. His jokes aren’t always zingers, either, but that hasn’t stopped him having his own sitcom, Show Me Da Manny, plus a game show, Manny Many Prizes on the GMA Network. Manny Pacquiao recorded his own song for when he takes to the ring for his fight with Floyd Mayweather . This screenshot shows Pacquiao playing it for laughs in his sitcom Show Me Da Manny . Pacquiao also has a quiz show called Manny Many Prizes . He is being pursued for £33m in unpaid taxes but remains a twice-elected and popular congressman and if he ran for president would win by a landslide. He is just over 5ft 6in but doubles as the player-coach of a professional basketball team, the Kia Carnival. His birthday is celebrated like a national holiday, and there is a truce in the civil war to the south of the country whenever he fights. Each April, in Cebu City, the battle of Mactan is re-enacted, when Philippine warrior Datu Lapu-Lapu repelled the conquistador forces of Magellan. In previous years, the role of Lapu-Lapu has been played by Pacquiao; as this year he was in training to fight Floyd Mayweather, they merely dedicated the performance to him instead. There is no point comparing Pacquiao with sporting contemporaries because there is no-one like him. Tiger Woods, at his peak, moved Wall Street. If he won a tournament on the Sunday, the markets were more confident and buoyant the following morning. To influence the biggest economy in the free world is beyond Pacquiao, true. Yet what does it say of Woods? That he was corporate America’s poster boy. Drive five minutes from the azalea-skirted fairways of Augusta National and it is possible to find whole communities entirely untouched by the Tiger phenomenon, no matter the racial boundaries broken. Pacquiao, in his own land, is different. Pacquiao is the people’s champion. Whatever the state of his accounts, he still pays 64 per cent more tax than any other citizen in the Philippines. He builds hospitals, his wealth fights natural disasters. The crime rate plummets when he fights, his country stops, roads clear. May 3 – the date of the Mayweather bout in Pacquiao’s homeland – has already been declared a national holiday, and there, the world’s richest fight can be viewed free. No pay-per-view in Manila. Temporary paper billboards will be erected on street corners, plazas and in church grounds, so that crowds can watch the action direct from Las Vegas. The judges’ scores will be shown via Skype. No other sportsman would command this level of attention in one country; Pacquiao’s fame has transcended the boxing ring. Pacquiao's fan rally was another moment for the small screen as the ring legend took a selfie at the event . Size doesn't seem to matter when Pacquiao takes to the basketball court - well, it's his team . As a pious Roman Catholic – his bible is never far from his side, its most affecting passages highlighted in pink – he would not welcome the allusion, but the devotion he inspires is that of a pontiff. It is papal, the love that follows him in the Philippines; his people would chair him through the streets if they could. On a more earthbound level, he is Rudolph Valentino, The Beatles or pre-ignominy Michael Jackson, a star beyond familiar experience. Mayweather is a boxer; a great boxer, a very wealthy boxer, but a boxer, still. Pacquiao, while being the underdog in pure sporting terms on Saturday, is somehow more. He has been elevated to higher ground. At the South Convention Centre of the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas, the Filipiniana Dance Company of Las Vegas (Est. 2001) is on its third number. Corralled behind steel barriers, a crowd – bemused, impatient – are waiting to see one man. Instead, they are being treated to a second-rate talent show. Filipino singers replace the Filipiniana dancers and two unfunny MC’s try desperately to drum up frenzy. 'He’s in the building,' they scream which, as Pacquiao actually checked into the resort on Monday, is hardly an earth-shattering development. When he arrives, the contrast between the hype and the human is immediate, the sincerity of the figure in the white tee and camel coloured trousers smiling sweetly at the crowd, quite obvious. They wave back: national flags and home-made banners. One shows a hungry Pac-man eating a dollar sign. Later, in the Panda Room – strangely appropriate, pandas are bears yet are seen as benign, cuddly creatures – Pacquiao’s effect on those of Philippine descent is clear. The Filipiniana dancers file in and crowd the aisles. Every time Pacquiao speaks they giggle like smitten schoolgirls. An endless string of selfies are taken, until they begin teasing each other about their faux-teenage crushes. One of the dancers is given a souvenir boxing glove by a pressman. Nothing unique, just a memento that could be bought at any local sports shop or in the foyer of the hotel, a commemorative glove with the fight’s logo and date embossed on the mitt, yet she stares at it as if presented with a holy relic until broken from her reverie by the sound of more squeals as another image is committed to digital memory; laughing girls in the foreground, Pacquiao a smudge in the distance. But, still, that’s him. Pacquiao addressed his fans, the ones in Vegas anyway, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel on Tuesday . Filipino dancers were part of the entertainment during the fan rally for Pacquiao . Manny mania was in full swing with just a few days to go before he enters the ring in Las Vegas . Mayweather had dancers of his own for his arrival at the MGM Grand just along the famous Strip . It is fair to say there are few middle-class boxers but even by the standards of a working man’s sport, Pacquiao’s story is exceptional. Mayweather grew up poor, but it was first-world poor; the electricity might have been cut off, and his family sometimes slept seven to a room, but there were safety nets, checks and balances. There was always a roof and no-one went hungry. Pacquiao is a third-world survivor. He was born in General Santos City, 600 miles south of the capital Manila, a part of the region now consumed by terrorism. Pacquiao knew tin-shanty poverty, hungry-every-day poverty, bare-foot poverty; he knew what it was to be filthy poor, unable to bathe, dirty, unschooled. His father abandoned the family when Manny was small, came home unannounced one day, killed, cooked and ate his dog, and then left again. When Pacquiao departed for the capital it wasn’t out of up-by-the-bootstraps ambition, but basic human necessity. His family couldn’t feed him; but maybe he could feed himself. He slept rough, he sold doughnuts for loose change and fought in the back streets for little more – sometimes the purse was the equivalent of £1. The iconic black and white images that have since emerged of Pacquiao at his Manila gym at the age of 17 were taken three years after he arrived in the capital, and 10 fights into his professional career. Even then, he looks scrawny, raw, unpolished – a street kid as much as a street fighter. It is hard to reconcile those haunted eyes with the figure who will march confidently towards the ring at the MGM Grand on Saturday, to the sound of his own voice. These images of a 17-year-old Pacquiao training in Manila were published ahead of the big fight . Pacquiao left his home as a 14-year-old and headed for Manila, the capital of the Philippines . Pacquiao turned professional aged 16 and had 10 fights by the time these images were taken . Pacquiao, as befits a platinum-selling game show host, basketball player turned singer-politician and world welterweight champion, has brought out a song for this fight called Lalaban Ako Para Sa Pilipino , which translates as ‘I will fight for the Filipinos’. 'Even if I am in pain,' Pacquiao sings, 'I force myself to hide it and be silent. My heart is bleeding yet others don’t see it, but what is important is that my country is happy. I will fight around the world, I will risk my life. I am Filipino, we are Filipino.' The video is at the botom of the page. And yet, in its way, it is him. Just as Andy Murray tried his whole life to erase the association of his home town, Dunblane, with unimaginable tragedy, so Pacquiao’s mission is to reawaken feelings of pride in a nation whose global image has been defined by a corrupt political dynasty and a president’s wife, obsessed with shoes. At the time Manny Pacquiao was barefoot on the streets of GenSan, Imelda Marcos was hoarding 3,000 pairs of the finest designer heels. It is this perception that he, The National Fist – Pambansang Kamao – feels it is his duty to address. That is why he sings, that is why he stands, that is why he prays and, most significantly, that is why he fights.","Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather fight in Las Vegas on Saturday .

"Chelsea took a commanding 3-1 lead back to west London after a strong showing in Manchester to see off City's young side. Dominic Solanke scored late on to put a gloss on the scoreline after a Tammy Abraham double had seen Chelsea take a first half lead. Sportsmail was at the Academy Stadium to see how the youngsters got on... Tammy Abraham smashes Chelsea into the lead with a fierce drive into the top corner . Manchester City (4-2-3-1) Kjetil Haug: Norwegian international has been on the bench for long periods but got the nod and looked shaky under the high ball. That said, powerless to stop Abraham's volleys and Soalnke's killer. 6.5 . Pablo Maffeo: Barcelona-born former Espanyol youngster is not the tallest and at times struggled with Chelsea's diagonals early on but grew into the game and could have levelled. 6.5 . Tosin Adarabioyo: Manchester lad and England youth international, City's captain was a commanding presence at the heart of defence. Has the movement of Yaya Toure but put a big shift in. 7 . Christian Haug goes up for the ball under pressure from Chelsea forwards during the Youth Cup final . Cameron Humphreys-Grant: Has captained England and, like Adarabioyo had his hands full against a vibrant Chelsea attack but stood up to the test well. 6.5 .

Manchester City midfielder Kean Bryan tracks the run of Dominic Solanke as City looked to stem the tide . Aaron Nemane: Moved to Manchester from France as a toddler, the wide man who scored twice in the first leg of the Semi Final did outwitted Dasilva with a delightful tap and go but could not find the final, killer ball. Blasted wide when should have levelled. 6.5 . Bersant Celina: Kosovan international Celina struggled to fill in for injured star Thierry Ambrose, seeing one shot from the edge of the area easily held by Collins. 6 . Manu Garcia: Joined City from Sporting Gijon and the mini David Silva showed some neat touches on the rare occasions he found space. Was largely ineffective and should have done better when teed up by Barker late on. Yanked on 85 minuted. 6 . Manuel Garcia gets a shot away, but it was blocked by Jake Clarke-Salter . Isaac Buckley-Ricketts: Pacy Mancunian centre forward produced measured finish to bring City level but was marshalled well for the majority of the evening. 7 . Brandon Barker: City's star man, the two-footed local lad is tipped for big things at the Etihad but was perhaps guilty of trying to do too much at times here. Did create a fine chance for Garcia with a trademark surge and almost levelled late on. 7.5 . City's players celebrate after Isaac Buckley (left) had levelled the game in the first half . Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Bradley Collins: The Southampton-born stopper could do little about City's opener and distributed the ball well. 6.5 . Fikayo Tomori: Canadian born but eligible for England combined well with Clarke-Salter to nullify City's threat in a commanding-looking partnership. 7 . Ola Aina: England Under-19 right-back found space time and time again down the right. Quick, strong and often influential. 7 . Jake Clarke-Salter: England Under 18s international often too strong for Buckley-Ricketts and, on the evidence of this sterling performance, is one to watch. 7 . Jay Dasilva: Under-21 regular is still 16. Fortunate to escape at least a caution with a from-behind challenge in the first half but was solid at the back and lively going forward, whipping in a number of decent crosses. 7 . Ruben Sammut: Scottish youth international covered his back four expertly and kickstarted a number of breaks as City pressed. 6.5 . Ruben Sammut plays the ball out in an excellent performance protecting the back four . Tammy Abraham: Two volleys for his 35th and 36th strikes of the season. Big, bold and often brilliant, Chelsea will be hoping the injury that saw him substituted on 67 minutes is not serious. 8 . Charlie Colkett: Put in a captain's shift in the centre of the park as the visitors won the midfield battle. Is tipped for big things and showed just why. 7.5 . Abraham makes it 2-1 at the Academy Stadium with an acrobatic finish past Christian Haug . Dominic Solanke: Scored for England in the European Under-17 Championship Final and put in a powerful shift here, teaming up well with Abraham before effectively killing the tie with a neat third. 7.5 . Charly Musonda: The Belgian playmaker, the only overseas man in the starting XI, was quiet by his standards and drilled a decent chance tamely wide. Departed late on. 6 . Isaiah Brown: Said to be interesting Jose Mourinho but will not want to dwell on his big moment early on when he blasted over bar when unmarked on the edge of the box. Miss aside, was a constant menace. Substitutes: . Kasey Palmer (Abraham, 67, 6): On for Abraham and showed explosive pace straight away but was let down by a hurried attempt at a finish which flew over the bar.

"Didier Drogba was utterly exhausted and emotionally drained as he and John Terry held each other up through a post-match flash interview. It was as if these two warriors might collapse on camera if either of them moved, so they clung on and spoke happily if wearily after supplying the goals which fuelled this fight-back at Leicester. Drogba is into his 38th year and could be doing something a little more leisurely than leading the line through 90 minutes at the sharp end of the season. Centre-forward is a demanding role in any team, let alone one of Jose Mourinho’s.

Despite being 38, Didier Drogba played a crucial part in Chelsea's win - and covered a lot of grass as shown by his heat map above. For more stats, figures and facts visit our brilliant match zone service. But he and Terry are not shaped that way and the pride burned through their yellow shirts as they led their team-mates to salute three thousand noisy Chelsea supporters in the corner of the King Power Stadium. They had trailed to a goal from Marc Albrighton after a slightly lethargic first-half display but came out inspired and soon levelled through Drogba, before Terry put the Londoners ahead, 12 minutes from time, and Ramires curled the third into the top corner. The strike by Ramires triggered an ironic chorus of 'Boring Boring Chelsea' from the visiting fans and they sang long into the night, aware that their team can be crowned champions on Sunday at Stamford Bridge if they beat Crystal Palace. Mourinho tried to play down the party vibe but they will come in expectation because this has the feel of a procession after breaking through an awkward sequence of games with only one fit centre-forward, who happened to be 37.

Drogba’s legs don’t cover quite the same ground at quite the same rate as they once did. He rarely gets clear of the back-line, it has been a long time since he screamed one into the top corner and his touch can be heavy. Until Wednesday night it had been a long time since he found the net. You have to go all the way back to Newcastle away in December, when he came on in a bid to rescue Chelsea from their first defeat of the campaign, and almost managed it. Drogba has an impossible-to-pin-down ability to influence the game and his desire glows as fiercely as ever. He energised Chelsea with the equaliser - just as he once did in Munich in the Champions League final. He missed chances and he might have scored more, but he never stopped showing for the ball or leading by example to those team-mates who have yet to cross this finish-line in a title race, as injured striker Diego Costa and Loic Remy looked on from the stands. Mourinho wanted all of his squad to travel and prepare together at St George’s Park as a show of solidarity as they closed in on the goal. This was where the head-tennis video was filmed which went viral on Wednesday. Six Chelsea players headed the ball back and forth across the dinner table until it reached John Obi Mikel, on the end, who nodded it into a bin. Judging by the celebrations which followed, Remy is not far from a return.

Chelsea's players looked dejected after falling behind to Albrighton's goal just before the end of the second half . On Wednesday, it was over to the legends who have made the journey before to respond to the challenge set down by Nigel Pearson’s vibrant team, who offered more evidence, even in defeat, that they are capable of surviving the drop. Terry scored his seventh of the season, forcing the ball in from close range after Kasper Schmeichel had saved from Gary Cahill at a corner. And Petr Cech came in for Thibaut Courtois and played superbly, making a crucial save to thwart Paul Konchesky when the game was goalless. Courtois hurt his hip during Sunday’s draw at Arsenal and was on the bench. Cech came in for only his fifth Premier League game of the season, but buoyed by the knowledge he had not conceded in this competition for more than a year. Leicester started at a healthy tempo, seeking to use the electric pace of Jamie Vardy, only to see their rhythm disrupted to injuries which forced Andy King and Robert Huth off before the interval. Chelsea dominated from midway through the first half but that did not prevent Leicester from taking the lead on the break when Matty James released Vardy down the left. Vardy beat Terry to the ball and cut his cross low and deep. It might have been aimed at Leonardo Ulloa, but it bypassed the Argentine striker and Cesar Azpilicueta slipped as he tried to adjust his feet. Esteban Cambiasso seemed to be accused by Cheslea's players of stamping of Eden Hazard (on the floor left) Drogba (left) misses with a right-footed shot from inside the box in the first half as he is closed down by Leicester captain Wes Morgan .

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (right) and Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson have a talk in the tunnel before kick off . The upshot was a simple finish for Albrighton, arriving late with the ball set nicely and Cech’s goal hopelessly exposed. He had not scored for more than four years but he made no mistake, sliding it low into the net. The King Power erupted as home fans detected an improbably fifth win on the bounce and another year in this lofty company. But Drogba soon punctured those hopes when he reacted swiftly to beat substitute Ritchie de Laet to a low cross from Branislav Ivanovic and hooked it past Schmeichel. It was a different game from this point. Chelsea had re-emerged in a different mood. There was extra urgency about their game and they would go on to win by more than one goal for the first time since a 5-0 win against Swansea in mid-January. Drogba fired one chance over and another wide but Terry produced the second, just as it seemed Mourinho would have to settle for a point. It could have been many more but Ramires made it three. And it wasn’t boring at all.","Marc Albrighton opens the scoring for Leicester with neat finish in the area after a slip by Cesar Azpilicueta .

"The number of Chinese tourists eager to travel the world has risen dramatically over the last few years, and Beijing International Airport is launching the world's biggest terminal to cope with the substantial increase. Opening in 2018, the gigantic Terminal 1 will cover 700,000 square metres, and is set to handle 45million passengers a year. Renown British-Iraqi architect, Zaha Hadid, has collaborated with airport developers ADPI to create a six-tier concept which aims to decrease customer walking distances, and increase connectivity. Scroll down for video . Terminal 1 at Beijing International Airport is set to the largest in the world, in order to cope with the surge in tourist numbers . Aiming to be the perfect welcome to Beijing, the designs focus on creating a feeling of space and openness, which is reflected in the flowing lines of the roof, and the lack of pillars inside. All the passenger pathways will convene in a central multi-layered courtyard, which will be a meeting place for passengers who have travelled from around the globe. Zaha Hadid's website states that the structure of Terminal 1 will guide users seamlessly and harmoniously through the building by public spaces that flow into each other, reflecting the harmony and balance between Chinese landscape and culture. It is hoped to combine the rich Chinese culture, with its impressive future on the worldwide stage. The huge terminal will focus on wide open spaces, made possible by the lack of pillars and flowing roof design . The international airport, which also goes by the name of Daxing Airport, is the second busiest in the world, after Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport which saw 96 million passengers pass through it last year. London Heathrow was the third busiest in the world with over 73 million passengers. The new terminal reflects research by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch which found that there were 109 million Chinese tourists in 2014, who spent $164 billion. These figures are a dramatic increase from the 10 million outbound tourists in 2000. Opening in 2018, the gigantic Terminal 1 will cover 700,000 square metres, and is set to handle 45 million passengers a year .","The new Terminal 1 will open in 2018 spanning 700,000 square metres .

"Two of England’s most ambitious and well-resourced academies go head-to-head on Monday night as Manchester City play Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final. Both teams are packed with talented players eager to make an impression in front of the TV cameras and stake their claim for first-team involvement in the seasons to come. Ahead of the match at City’s Academy Stadium we tell you everything you need to know. Dominic Solanke (second right) scores for Chelsea against Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League final . WHAT’S THE OCCASION? It’s the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final and it’ll take place at City’s 7,200-capacity Academy Stadium, in the shadow of the main Etihad Stadium and part of their £200m Etihad Campus that opened last year. The match kicks off at 7.45pm and will be shown live on ITV4. The second leg takes place next Monday at Stamford Bridge. HOW DID THE TEAMS GET THERE? City started their campaign with a 2-0 win over Oxford United in the third round just before Christmas, with goals from Marcus Wood and Bersant Celina sealing a comfortable win. Jason Wilcox’s team really had their shooting boots on in the fourth round, thrashing Coventry City 8-2. Brandon Barker was the star with three of them, while Thierry Ambrose (2), Pablo Maffeo, Javairo Dilrosun and Denzeil Boadu also cashed in. Man City's Thierry Ambrose (centre) scores his second goal during the 8-2 victory over Coventry . Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester . It wasn’t as straightforward in the next round, with a solitary Celina strike beating Stoke City, but City were back to their free-scoring best in beating Crewe Alexandra 6-1 in the last eight. Having fallen behind early on, City stormed back to win thanks to goals from Aaron Nemane, Barker (2), Boadu, Celina and Ambrose. That set up a two-legged semi-final with Leicester City and they were very keen to get the job done, winning the home first leg 3-0. Nemane (2) and Boadu continued their scoring form. The second leg at the King Power Stadium was a formality and, having fallen behind to a second-half penalty, two goals in stoppage time from Isaac Buckley and Barker sealed a 5-1 aggregate win. Chelsea started their campaign at the beginning of December and were drawn away to Leeds United. An Izzy Brown penalty and a late second from Dominic Solanke got the Blues Youth Cup defence underway. Huddersfield Town were beaten 6-1 in the fourth round, with England under 18 star Solanke scoring a hat-trick. Tammy Abraham grabbed two and Kasey Palmer rounded off an emphatic win. And Joe Edwards’ team went goal crazy again in the fifth round, beating Swansea 6-0. This time it was Abraham scoring a treble and Solanke adding two. Palmer also got on the scoresheet. A tough trip to Newcastle United followed but the Blues finally prevailed in extra time with Brown, Solanke and Abraham on the scoresheet in a 3-0 win at St James’ Park. That set up a tasty semi-final tie with Tottenham and all seemed lost when Spurs took a 2-0 lead from the first leg at White Hart Lane. Chelsea were to fall further behind in the second leg at Stamford Bridge but mounted an extraordinary fightback. Izzy Brown (centre) scores for Cheslea against Tottenham as they staged a thrilling comeback last month . Goals from Solanke and Brown gave them hope before the break, before two in two minutes from Solanke and Charlie Colkett just after turned the game on its head. A Colkett penalty then put daylight between the teams as Chelsea won a thrilling tie 5-4 on aggregate. YOUTH CUP PEDIGREE . Manchester City have twice lifted the FA Youth Cup - in 1986 and 2008. The last of those saw them defeat Chelsea 3-1 at the Etihad after a 1-1 draw in London. Slovakian Vladimir Weiss was the star performer. He went on to make just five first-team appearances for City and now plays, aged 25, for Lekhwiya in the Qatari Stars League. Chelsea have made the competition their own in recent years and this is their fifth final in six seasons. Their wins in 2010, 2012 and 2014 added to earlier successes in 1960 and 1961. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? City coach Jason Wilcox: ‘Our job is to recruit local lads. If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge. We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea. It’s up to us to make sure that, via the scouting, we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme. I’m convinced once they see us it’s very difficult to walk away from.’ Chelsea coach Joe Edwards: ‘Winning breeds confidence so to have a group of players coming back for this game who were crowned European champions last week [when the Under-19s won the UEFA Youth League] is a massive plus for us. Once you get a taste of winning, you want that feeling again and again.’ PLAYERS TO WATCH . MANCHESTER CITY . Brandon Barker - speedy winger who has been on the books at City’s academy since the age of eight. The Manchester-born teenager made a positive impression with 13 goals for the under 18s last season and has since progressed into Patrick Vieira’s Elite Development Squad. Has scored six time on the Youth Cup run and is an England under 19 international. Brandon Barker is an England Under 19 international and scored 13 goals for City's under 18s last season . Thierry Ambrose - capable of playing anywhere across the forward line, Ambrose was signed from Auxerre’s youth teams in 2013. Impressed in his first season with the under 18s, scoring 22 goals in 32 matches, enough to earn the Parisian a place in the EDS team. Has scored three times during City’s Youth Cup run. Ambrose (centre) scored 22 goals in 32 matches for City's under 18s after signing from Auxerre . Aaron Nemane - another who has scored three times during the Youth Cup run. Right winger Nemane made his debut for the City under 18 side at just 14 and made quite an impact by scoring twice. Has played mainly in the under 18 team but did travel to Croatia with the EDS squad last pre-season. Aaron Nemane (right) made his debut for Manchester City's under 18 side aged just 14 . CHELSEA . Dominic Solanke - enjoying an extraordinary season and hoping to win the Youth Cup for the second successive season having scored two goals in the last five minutes to sink Fulham last year. With 34 goals for Chelsea this season, he inspired them to UEFA Youth League success a week ago having scored in every round. Should he score in the final, he will also have scored in each round of the Youth Cup. England under 18 international. Solanke (left) has been in prolific form for Chelsea both at home and abroad this season . Jay Dasilva - earned rave reviews for his performances in the Youth League, with Ian Wright suggesting he was already better than any left-back in the Premier League. Still only 16, his mature performance have seen him already established in the under 21 team. Jay Dasilva has impressed for Chelsea at left-back and is a regular for the Under 21 team . Charlie Colkett - captain of the side and an important figure in the Chelsea midfield. Will set the tempo and drive the team forward with direct runs and intelligent passes. Very impressive all season, especially on the continental stage.

"A new Reddit thread is offering some fascinating insights into the strange lives of men who have purchased mail-order brides. The discussion, which focuses on brides from Russia and the Philippines and has so far garnered more than 10,000 comments, asked users to spill the beans on what 'surprised' them the most when they started living with their spouses. '[She] spoke about sex the same way she spoke about housework,' wrote one, while another confessed: 'I could always tell she was uncomfortable. It seemed like she was just doing a job.' Ruse awakening: The Reddit thread asked users to spill the beans on what 'surprised' them the most when they started living with their spouses . One user described the process of 'ordering' a bride from Russia or the Philippines, where thousands of women are desperate to start a new life for themselves in Europe and the US. The fee to find a bride this way, according to this user, costs between $10,000 (£6,500) and $15,000 (£9,800), although others have said they paid as much as $50,000 (£32,700). 'Since a large amount of these foreign brides do not speak English, a person must hire a translator for phone and other forms of correspondence,' he explains. 'When a man becomes serious about a few women, he will want to purchase the girl’s address to send letters and gifts. 'Addresses usually will cost between $10 [£6.50] and $15 [£9.80}. A translator will also be needed for these letters which will normally add another $10  to $15 a letter.' Several people submitted stories not about themselves but people they know, and almost all of them noted that the men ordered their brides because they struggled socially. Booming: Russianbrides.com (pictured) now boasts an online community of more than one million hopefuls . Face value: Once a man has zeroed in on a woman he likes, he generally needs to hire a translator to communicate with her . 'My father brought my mum at an auction in Thailand a LONG time ago, it's pretty weird and he was kinda a creepy guy so basically what you'd expect,' one stated. 'I mean there's a reason these kinds of guys end up getting mail-ordered brides. Sometimes they are just super awkward, other times they are total d-bags,' another wrote. Several men, who had presumably since split with their mail-order brides, noted that the sexual chemistry was lacking. 'She would cook, clean, offer sex, whatever,' one wrote. 'Pretty much what you want from your wife. But the passion, emotion, warmth, everything that makes a marriage actually work was lacking. 'You could liken it to a gold digger but it was much worse. At least with a gold digger it isn’t painfully obvious, and you might actually convince yourself she likes some aspect of you.' Another found the opposite. 'The only thing I can think of is that she is very open about sexuality compared to most girls,' wrote one man, a 35-year-old who said he had cerebral palsy, and spent $22,000 [£14,395] to secure his bride. Just a chore: '[She] spoke about sex the same way she spoke about housework,' wrote one submitter . One user wrote: 'She seemed under the impression that a man was to be kept like a king and she was there for food and sex.' But then added: 'The biggest surprise was finding out that when his ""wife"" was sending money ""back home to her family"", it was to her husband (not ""ex"") and kids in the Philippines.' Amid all the stories about disappointed grooms, there were a few sad accounts regarding the brides. One user wrote of a friend's mail-order wife: '[She] had a ridiculous amount of humidifiers in the home so that it could be more like where she came from. All she did was to sit in a chair staring at the wall looking very depressed.' Another commented: 'There's way too many cases in which those girls looking for a better life end up in bad stories of domestic abuse and even murder when those guys start realizing that the girls are way out of their league and they start to meet new people and making friends.' Regardless of where you stand, the mail-order business is booming - Russianbrides.com now boasts an online community of more than one million hopefuls -  and shows no sign of slowing down.","A new Reddit thread asked users to submit their experiences .

"With Saturday's fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao billed as the $300million fight of the century, it's no surprise that its pay-per-view figures look set to blow previous bouts out of the water. In the US, viewers are being charged between $89.99 (£59) and $99.99 (£66) to watch the fight while in Britain, Sky Box Office is offering the bout for £19.99, but those figures will equate to a small fraction of the earnings for Mayweather and Pacquiao. Once ticket sales and casino profits have been considered, the eagerly anticipated mega-fight, which is due to take place at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, will become the biggest pay-per-view in sport and could see the two fighters pocket astronomical sums. This Sports Interaction graphic shows how much Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao stand to earn . American boxing legend Mike Tyson features in four of the top 10 highest grossing pay-per-view fights . The eagerly-anticipated mega-fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao is just days away . Canadian data crunchers Sports Interaction have put together all the big numbers to find out who will earn what, the top 10 pay-per-view bouts by earnings and whether the  event will give fans value for money. Firstly, let's take a look at how much Mayweather and Pacquiao stand to earn should the showpiece fight go the distance on May 2. 12 rounds of jousting will give Mayweather a stunning $170m (£111m) purse, meaning the 38-year-old will be picking up $15m (£9m) per round and $5m (£3m) per minute. His opponent stands to earn slightly less and could bank almost $95m (£62m) which boils down to a tidy $8.4m (£5m) per round. Pacquiao gets in his last workout in Los Angeles before heading to Las Vegas on Monday . Mayweather has featured in three of the top 10 highest grossing pay-per-view fights to date . The average payout for the top 10 pay-per-view fighters stands at $22.4m (£14m) Mayweather tends to give his viewers values for money by going the distance during his fights . Six of the top 10 pay-per-view events have gone the distance, which is encouraging news for fans across the globe who will be paying to tune in. Although the Las Vegas mega-fight is set to eclipse the highest grossing bouts to date, there will still be one man that can claim to have featured in more of the top 10 duels than Mayweather. Mike Tyson featured in four of the top 10 grossing bouts, ahead of 'Money' Mayweather and Evander Holyfield who have both featured in three. Mayweather's lucrative victory against Saul Alvarez in 2013 looks set to be eclipsed by his next bout . The American poses for photos with singer Justin Bieber after defeating Alvarez in Las Vegas . Oscar De La Hoya has featured in two, while Lennox Lewis, Miguel Cotto, Saul Alvarez, Peter McNeeley, Shane Moseley, Felix Trinidad, George Foreman and Pacquiao have all featured in one. Tyson may have featured in more of the top fights, but it's Mayweather who is currently sitting pretty at the top of the pile after his pay-per-view 12-round fight against Alvarez in September, 2013 saw the American collect a total close to $140m (£91m). Pacquiao features only once in the current list after earning around $555,555 per minute for his victory against Shane Moseley in 2011. Mike Tyson's heavyweight bout against Lennox Lewis (right) in 2002, grossed $112m (£73m) Tyson looks on after being knocked down for a final time by Lewis after just eight rounds . Tyson's biggest earner came after his defeat against British legend Lennox Lewis as the pair claimed $760,869 (£497,796) per minute each after eight rounds. Tyson is also responsible for the first and second most economically inefficient fights inside our top 10. In 1997, his constant biting of Holyfield saw him disqualified at the end of the third round, resulting in that pay-per-view event costing fans $5.59 (£3.60) a minute for the action. Those still deciding whether whether to fork out for Saturday's fight may be swayed by the fact that each fight inside the top 10 grossing bouts that has involved Mayweather or Pacquiao has gone the distance. Tyson is also responsible for the second most economically inefficient fight for fans after being disqualified for biting Evander Holyfield in the third round during the WBA heavyweight clash in 1997 .

"Bayern Munich were crowned Bundesliga champions for the third year running without even kicking a ball on Sunday as their nearest rivals Wolfsburg went down to a 1-0 defeat at Borussia Monchengladbach. Needing to win to keep the title race alive - at least mathematically - for another week, Wolfsburg rarely looked like succeeding as they were second best at the Borussia Park Stadion. They resisted until the last minute of the game, though, when Max Kruse struck to earn the Foals a win which moves them up to third and secures their place in the Champions League next season.

Bayern have secured the title with four matches to spare. However, the Champions League semi-finalists will have to wait to celebrate it with their fans as they travel to Bayer Leverkusen next week before hosting Augsburg on May 9th. 'Retaining the title is a magnificent achievement. All credit to the coach and the team,' Bayern president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on the club's website.

"She was the pregnant teenager who horrifically murdered her American socialite mother in a wealthy Balinese resort and heartlessly stuffed the half-naked body in a suitcase. Heather Mack, 19, brutally killed Sheila von Wiese-Mack with the help of her boyfriend in August and dumped the bloody suitcase in a taxi outside the upscale St. Regis Bali Resort. Mack avoided the death penalty last week when a judge sentenced her to 10 years, a relatively light sentence that took into consideration her need to care for her newborn. Mack was photographed after her sentencing celebrating in her jail cell by getting drunk off alcohol smuggled to her in a Sprite bottle. In contrast, Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have spent the past decade on death row after they were convicted of trying to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005. Scroll down for video . Heather Mack, 19, avoided the death penalty last week after brutally killing her mother with the help of her boyfriend in August and dumped the bloody suitcase in a taxi outside the upscale St. Regis Bali Resort . Meanwhile Muyran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were executed on Wednesday after they were convicted of trying to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia back in 2005 . The Bali Nine ringleaders spent 10 years in Kerobokan Prison working to reform themselves with Chan now an ordained Christian minister and Sukumaran being an accomplished artist. Despite their clear rehabilitation, Chan and Sukumaran were shot dead by a firing squad early on Wednesday morning. The differences in the sentences in the two cases left many people wondering about the fairness of the decisions. 'Outcomes of the criminal justice system must reflect the seriousness of the case,' barrister and president of the Australian Bar Association, Fiona McLeod, told Daily Mail Australia. Photographers say 19-year-old Heather Mack was drinking alcohol from a Sprite bottle behind bars in Bali immediately after her sentence was handed down .

Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Now share your opinion . 'In all cases the outcome in terms of punishment should reflect the seriousness of the crime.' Speaking ahead of the executions, Ms McLeod said Indonesia had issued a blanket statement about executing all drug smugglers on death row without considering individual circumstances. 'It’s such a sledgehammer. The death penalty is cruel and excessive in all circumstances,' she said. 'We know that these two Australians have reformed and are excellent examples of what is possible with appropriate terms of imprisonment and rehabilitation. 'These are two different men today, 10 years after they entered prison in Indonesia. They are living examples of what rehabilitation and hope can achieve. 'Imprisonment commensurate with the crime is an appropriate response. We remain firmly opposed to the death penalty in any country, for any crime.' The families of the condemned men endured harrowing goodbyes with the two Australian men in last visits in prison on Tuesday. Sukuraman's sister, Brintha, could not stifle her wails as she made her way through the crowds of people outside the gates of the port where they embarked for the prison. Moments later, Chan's mother Helen arrived outwardly sobbing and had to be carried away from the media scrum as police officers led the family through the crowd. The Bali Nine ringleaders spent 10 years in Kerobokan Prison working to reform themselves with Chan becoming a priest and Sukumaran being an accomplished artist . The date of the executions - April 29 - became official when a local funeral director in Cilacap was instructed to inscribe the names of those to be shot by firing squad and the date of their deaths . Myuran Sukumaran (pictured) and Andrew Chan were transported from Bali's Kerobokan Prison where they had been for a decade to Besi Prison on Indonesia's 'death island' for their execution .

Michael Chan (centre, in green) brother of Andrew Chan, makes his way through the media to the port authority office before travelling to Nusakambangan Island . Mack, from Chicago, avoided the death penalty last week after a judge granted her leniency on the grounds that she's a new mother and needs to take care of her infant daughter Stella. 'Her newborn baby badly needs a mother's love and breastfeeding,' the verdict said. She was sentenced alongside her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer for killing her mother and stuffing her half-naked body in a suitcase at their Bali hotel. Schaefer got 18 years, while Mack was handed 10. Prosecutors have vowed to appeal and pursue a tougher sentence for the teenager mother. Jailed: Heather Mack and Tommy Schaefer pictured with their daughter in a prison bus after the court hearings .

"Floyd Mayweather Jnr's personal chef responsible for fuelling the the fighter ahead of his $300million clash with Manny Pacquiao has revealed her boss does have some weaknesses when it comes to food. Quiana Jeffries, aka Chef Q, was brought into Mayweather's camp after driving through the night to impress him with a trial breakfast. A regimented diet is crucial to the champion's training regime and Mayweather demands organic produce, although there are a few exceptions. 'Twizzlers are his favorite,' Jeffries reveals in an interview with New York Magazine. Floyd Mayweather Jnr (left) insists on eating organic food before his fight, although there are exceptions .

'And Top Ramen (dried noodle packets). 'It's what he had growing up. He likes them crunchy, with a lot of noodles, and not a lot of juice,' she adds. However, Mayweather's most unhealthy food craving has got to be 'fried hot dogs... with barbecue sauce'. Jeffries explains that she tries her best to ake them as healthy as possible: 'I cut them longways, and fry them up in a little coconut oil. I spice that up the barbeque sauce, too. 'I add a oranges, orange zest, and other spices. He loves barbecue sauce. Everything with barbecue sauce. But that's life. You like what you know.' As well as unusual eating requests, Jeffries also has to cope with Mayweather's unconventional timekeeping. The 38-year-old does not followed a structured training regime and prefers to decide when he does things according to how he is feeling, which can pose problems for his 24-hour chef who charges around £1,000 per meal. 'If Champ wants a meal at three, four, five, six in the morning, I have to be ready for that,' Jeffries said. 'He's called me at four and says, 'I want that oxtail.' Finding organic food stores in the early hours of the morning is also challenging, especially in Las Vegas. Mayweather and Pacquiao are just days away from their $300m mega-fight in Las Vegas . Jeffries explains how she is yet to find a farmers' market in the city and is restricted to a handful of 24-hour supermarkets, but not all departments stay open all night. 'The seafood counters always close early,' she says — leading her to befriend managers to acquire the necessary ingredients for Mayweather's favourite seafood gumbo.

"Two mistakes from Rangers keeper Robby McCrorie handed Celtic the Glasgow Cup as they clinched the trophy for the fourth time in eight seasons at Hampden. Josh Kerr took advantage when the Scotland under-17 star came for a corner and missed it to put the Hoops in front before McCrorie dropped a Mark Hill free kick over the line. With Old Firm bosses Ronny Deila and Stuart McCall looking on, it was the former who left happiest after seeing Tommy McIntyre’s side record a deserved victory. Celtic U17 players celebrate after beating Rangers 2-0 to win the Glasgow Cup at Hampden . Celtic goalscorer Josh Kerr holds the trophy in the air as he celebrates on Tuesday evening . Both teams line up ahead of the match which was played behind closed doors at Hampden Park . And as only local schoolkids and their parents were allowed in following trouble among fans at the last three finals, the match passed without any major off-field problems. Rangers took the game to their opponents but early headers from Aiden Wilson and Ross McCrorie ran past either post. Celtic hit back and began to dictate play, sitting further up the park the more time wore on and pressing well for an opener. Nine days after the Parkhead club’s first team was denied a clear penalty in the Scottish Cup against Inverness, their youths had another good claim. But Kyle Bradley’s handball in the box from a Regan Hendry shot went unnoticed by referee Stephen Graham before the midfielder fired the rebound straight at Robby McCrorie. Calvin Miller then shot just over from 20 yards, Hendry was denied again by McCrorie and Miller screwed another long-range drive inches wide as the Hoops looked more likely to net. Kerr fires the ball into the net to give Celtic the lead against Rangers in the 74th minute . Kerr slides along the Hampden pitch in celebration after putting Celtic ahead . Mark Hill (third left) is congratulated by his team-mates after doubling Celtic's lead . Just when it seemed they would get themselves in front, Hendry nodded past from close range when Miller picked him out with a great right-wing cross and it was a poor miss. Rangers were being restricted to playing on the counter and offered little in attack, with a low Ross Lyon shot that ran tamely wide being as close as they came. It took some strong defending to keep them level at the break too, with two last-gasp tackles from Wilson and Ross McCrorie being just enough to deny Hendry. Celtic kept pressing after the restart, with Theo Archibald firing a volley over and Rory Currie’s low attempt flashing off target. They almost paid for their slackness in front of goal, with Gers’ Sam Jamieson forcing a terrific tip over the bar from keeper Ross Doohan.

Rangers manager Stuart McCall (centre), assistant Kenny Black (left) and goalkeeping coach Jim Stewart watch the match from the stands at Hampden . The Light Blues took heart from that and began coming forward more but were just as sloppy with their finishing as Wilson nodded a Lyon corner over. Celtic responded once again, with Robby McCrorie smothering Mark Hill’s attempt, Dan Higgins aiming too high from 20 yards and McCrorie gathering Archibald’s grasscutter. Rangers made their best chances through Lyon and substitute Jamie Barjonas but rued their misses as Celtic scored twice in as many minutes and McCrorie was culpable both times. Celtic players celebrate in the dressing room at the national stadium in Glasgow . He failed to take Hendry’s corner when he tried to claim it with 16 minutes left and Kerr lashed in the loose ball from four yards. McCrorie’s error moments later was worse, however, as he fumbled into the net when a flighted Hill free kick came in from wide on the left. Rangers tried to get back into the game and Jamieson came closest but Doohan kept him out and that sealed Celts’ success.","Celtic U17 won the Glasgow Cup at Hampden Park on Tuesday night .

Some stood around and watched the fracas unfold, while other pulled out their phones and started recording the action. In a YouTube of the fight, someone said: 'I just came in here to get a suit.' During the melee, the women pulled hair, slapped, yanked each other's clothes and knocked over store displays. At one point a woman got on top of a table and jumped off like she was wrestling in a WWE match. A security guard attempted to break up the fight, but was mostly unsuccessful.

"It was, as so often this season, the story of two Chelsea rising stars in the form of their young lives. They have rampaged through opposition defences both at home and abroad all season. They have already been crowned kings of Europe in the UEFA Youth League. And here, with yet another devastating performance, they put Chelsea within touching distance of retaining the FA Youth Cup, in the process further augmenting their remarkable goalscoring tallies and enhancing their growing reputations. Tammy Abraham wheels away in celebration as he notches for Chelsea away at Manchester City in the FA Youth Cup final first leg . Chelsea striker Abraham opens the scoring against Manchester with an impressive right-footed shot into the far corner . Isaac Buckley-Ricketts is mobbed by his Manchester City team-mates following his equaliser against Chelsea in the Youth Cup .

Abraham is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates having given the west London side the lead against Manchester City . After Manchester City were put to the sword in this first leg on Monday night, the pair’s records for the season stand like this: Tammy Abraham - 36 goals; Dominic Solanke - 35 goals. That’s one hell of a return. Both are in that special moment of form where it is nigh on impossible to miss and that was the case here as the dark Blues from London established a healthy advantage to take into the second leg at Stamford Bridge in seven days’ time. When Solanke had raced through to make it 3-1 just before the end, you sensed it was a fatal blow. Of course there is a chance City may fight back - nothing is out of the question in youth football - but there was something about Chelsea’s dominance here that suggests it is unlikely. This was the most high-profile meeting yet of England’s two most ambitious and well-resourced academies and, for the moment, it is definitely Chelsea who are on top. Another tickertape parade surely awaits for this group of players next week. ‘Obviously it’s a daunting place to come,’ said Chelsea coach Joe Edwards. ‘But we wanted to make sure we did what we do best, dominate possession, get right up against them and press hard. The way the lads implemented what we spoke about before the game was outstanding.’ Indeed it was and the unfailing right boot of Abraham provided a moment to savour after just seven minutes. Even the technically fiendish chances are flying in for the unstoppable England under 18 forward at the moment and that was proven when he controlled Charlie Colkett’s laser-guided cross-field pass and sent the ball arrowing beyond goalkeeper Christian Haug into the top corner. Within minutes, Abraham was trending on Twitter, clips of his immaculate hit racking up the retweets the world over. By half-time, his name was attracting more interest in the UK than any other subject. By then he had a second, restoring Chelsea’s lead on 20 minutes after Isaac Buckley had briefly restored parity for the hosts. Goal No 36 of the campaign wasn’t quite as memorable as No 35 but it was athletic, Abraham hooking the ball home from six yards out after Izzy Brown’s header from a Colkett corner had been saved by the foot of Haug and then headed back into his vicinity. From then, aside from a five-minute flurry late on when City had genuine chances to equalise, Chelsea were in complete command. They enjoyed the lion’s share of possession and looked comfortable in their game plan, in each other and in themselves. Chelsea youngster Dominic Solanke scores the west London side's third goal of the game with just minutes to play . Manchester City goalkeeper Christian Kjetil Haug comes under pressure from Chelsea as both sides look to win the aerial ball . Solanke’s late third was a hammer blow after the City pressure, a typically calm finish after Charly Musonda slipped him through. It had actually been a quiet night for Solanke but this goal preserves his remarkable record of scoring in every round of this season’s Youth Cup. Incidentally, he also scored in every round of their Youth League triumph too for good measure. City, who were watched by Manuel Pellegrini, Vincent Kompany, Aleksander Kolarov and a near-full house at their handsome Academy Stadium, had levelled within two minutes of Abraham’s opener. Chelsea were guilty of a lapse in defensive concentration very unlike them and City swept through to punish.

Scorers: Abraham 7, 20; Solanke 89 . Referee: Robert Madley (West Yorkshire) Attendance: 6,421 . Brandon Barker spent much of the first-half struggling in his battle with Ola Aina on the City left but on this occasion, he dived in-field and made a purposeful run in the direction of the Chelsea box. Looking up, he saw Buckley darting through and supplied a slide-rule pass that the forward slickly rolled past Bradley Collins into the far corner. But they didn't kick on and seize control. Abraham’s exertions eventually took their toll and he went off in some discomfort midway through the second-half. It proved the catalyst for a City revival and the chances missed in this bright spell would prove costly. First, Aaron Nemane nutmegged Jake Clarke-Salter and brushed off Ruben Sammut but blazed wastefully wide. And there was soon an even-better chance for Kean Bryan, who stole the ball from Colkett, but fired over from a great position. They ramped it up further with Barker running clear down the left and forcing Collins to block with his feet. A minute or two later, Solanke scored. Edwards was proud of the performance but still exercised a note of caution: ‘We got the goal on the break, Dominic was very clinical and I think that 3-1 scoreline doesn’t overly flatter us because their spell was just a spell in amongst a game we dominated. ‘We don’t need to be reminded that you need to be switched on and professional next week.’ His City counterpart Jason Wilcox was bullish about the chances of a comeback: ‘It’s definitely not game over, we’ll go down to Stamford Bridge and anything can happen down there. If we get a goal, we’ll see what character they’ve got. At 3-1 we’re still in the tie.' But for that to happen, they’ll have to neutralise Chelsea’s relentless, remorseless forward duo.

We all want to win on Sunday but it will be a difficult game. Stamford Bridge must be ready to push us. ‘The April month, where everybody expected Chelsea to drop points playing difficult matches against teams fighting not to be relegated as well as Arsenal and Man United, was exactly the month where we destroy opponents. ‘It was a month without Diego (Costa), without (Loic) Remy, with Didier (Drogba) and Oscar playing striker, no other solutions, just this small group of players we have. We were tactically phenomenal, team spirit, team ethic, the way we defended, the way we were clinical with our goals, the stability we showed in every game. ‘In this moment we are 13 points ahead of second. We won every game except the draw against Arsenal. The boys, when the pressure was on, were even stronger. ‘The old and the young. Petr Cech, great performance, John, Didier, Branislav (Ivanovic), but other giants on the pitch, (Nemanja) Matic, (Cesc) Fabregas, Ramires. A great team. So I'm so, so happy.

But Didier Drogba equalised, Terry put Chelsea ahead, and Ramires added a late screamer. ‘If I tell you what I said it will be 'peep peep peep'. Too many peeps!’ laughed Mourinho. Terry added: ‘They were a tough side and they kept fighting. We got a telling off at half-time and we came out and played excellently in the second half. It wasn't good enough in the first half but listen, we got the three points. Drogba looks on as his effort from inside the box drifts in to the far corner past goalkeeper Schmeichel . ‘We've been the best side all season. We deserve a lot of respect, we've been very good all year. Let's hope we win it on Sunday. We are almost there.’ Drogba said: ‘We don't get enough credit. We are top of the league, we have the most points and people find us boring because we've been top since day one.’ Leicester lost Andy King and Robert Huth to injury in the first 25 minutes and manager Nigel Pearson rued the double loss, while praising Chelsea's champion qualities. ‘It was difficult tonight because we've had to make substitutions which in normal circumstances we wouldn't have done - but that's life,’ he said. Drogba (right) wheels away in celebration as his team-mates Eden Hazard and WIllian congratulate him . ‘I don't think our players deserved being on the end of a 3-1 defeat because it was a tighter game than that.

Metal detector enthusiast Bill Ladd found the missing dog tags after a storm last year, returning them to the vet's son, William Benn of Rhode Island . Fike and Ladd gave the tags to William Benn of Providence, Rhode Island, on Sunday afternoon. Cpl. Benn manned a gun during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. He was awarded the Silver Star for shooting down several Japanese aircraft the next year as a tail gunner on a B-17 bomber at the Battle of Midway. Benn died in 2002. Fike's group recently received a $50,000 grant. The tags came from World War II veteran Cpl. William Benn, who lost them in 1939 at a coastal artillery placement on Salisbury Beach . Purple Hearts Reunited says it will use the money from the Military Order of the Purple Heart Service Foundation to cover the 'purchase or rescue' of Purple Heart medals, the cost of framing, travel expenses and event and presentation costs.

"Ronny Deila is preparing for the William Hill Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness, believing Celtic themselves provide the biggest hurdle to their treble hopes. The Scottish League Cup winners are eight points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the Scottish Premiership with six games remaining and strong favourites to make it four in a row. Asked ahead of the trip to Hampden Park on Sunday if he felt he had a treble-winning squad at his disposal, the Norwegian boss said: . Ronny Deila is preparing his Celtic side for Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness . As they ready themselves for the trip to Hampden Park, Celtic will be focused on treble hopes . 'We will see but I really believe that we can do it and now it is up to us. 'If we are performing well, we know that we are very hard to beat. 'We have shown that for a long, long time now and again, our biggest opponent is ourselves. 'We need to keep our mind on the right things. 'I have felt a sense of excitement for a long time. But it is very important to focus on the next training session and next game, instead of thinking of what might be, thinking of what we have to do to make it as good as possible now.' Deila believes treble success will help not only attract players to the club this summer, but also help keep those who are already at Parkhead and perhaps thinking of moving to pastures new. The former Stromsgodset boss said: 'The players are happy, they enjoy being in Glasgow and at Celtic and if they see the team is going forward they want to stay, that is my experience. The Scottish League Cup winners are eight points clear in Scottish Premiership with six games to play . 'It's my job to make the staff and players feel well and have fun and looking forward to coming to work. 'It is not like that everywhere. I've had players come to me who are very unhappy and then money is nothing, in my opinion.'

He said: 'Scepovic is in the squad for Sunday. He needed a game instead of sitting on the bench on Wednesday. 'His contribution is going up and down. There is competition, it's tough to switch around when you have other strikers doing well.

"Kingsholm transformed into the House of Fun on Saturday night as Gloucester beat Exeter to set up a Challenge Cup final against Edinburgh. The Cherry and Whites delivered their most complete performance of the campaign to earn a place at the Twickenham Stoop - where they will compete for their first European title since 2006. Victory in the capital would also earn the West Country side a home play-off spot for next season’s Champions Cup – however they would be forced to find an alternative venue for the fixture because of a pre-arranged Madness concert in front of The Shed. Gloucester centre Bill Meakes celebrates after he scored the opening try for his side at Kingsholm . Gloucester lock Mariano Galarza wins a lineout as his pack look to set up another attack . ‘It’s going to be a huge final,’ said Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys. ‘It gives us the opportunity to take something meaningful from the season.’ It was a season-defining night for Gloucester, whose mediocre Aviva Premiership campaign has fizzled out. They played with intent and purpose, establishing a foothold at the scrum to supplement their hard running around the corner. But they were unable to capitalise on early territory, drawing 3-3 after half an hour. Greig Laidlaw had opened the scoring and – to the tune of ‘cheat, cheat, cheat’ after he craftily moved his kicking tee closer to the posts – Henry Slade levelled from 40 metres. Cherry and Whites flanker Sione Kalamafoni is tackled by Chiefs openside Kai Horstmann . Gloucester loose-head Nick Wood managed to get underneath Anglo-Welsh prop Tomas Francis, who was so impressive against Northampton, to establish scrum dominamce. Enjoying territory and possession, Bill Meakes scored off a deft grubber kick from James Hook, with further penalties putting the hosts 13-6 up at half-time. Jack Nowell suffered a nasty gash through his scrum cap – adding to recent debate about the effectiveness of protective headgear – and his side edged back with six more points from Slade’s boot. But Gloucester responded with a short-range try from Tom Savage and another penalty from Laidlaw. Elvis Taione and Jonny May exchanged further tries but – with the game finishing well into Saturday night because of the late kick-off – it was Gloucester who were left to enjoy the party.

"His primary job is to keep opposition strikers at bay, but that hasn't stopped John Terry from showing them the art of finishing too. The Chelsea captain scored his side's second goal in their 3-1 win away at Leicester on Wednesday night - as the Blues close in on their fourth Premier League title. The 34-year-old's close-range effort took his tally for the season to seven in all competitions - making him the club's joint third-highest goalscorer. John Terry was on hand to prod home from close range against Leicester on Wednesday night . Terry's strike at the King Power Stadium was his seventh goal in all competitions for Chelsea this season . Terry sits alongside strikers Loic Remy and Didier Drogba with seven goals apiece as well as attacking midfielder Oscar. Only star striker Diego Costa (20 goals) and PFA Player of the Year Eden Hazard (18) have more for Jose Mourinho's side this campaign. The centre back's ability to score is a skill that compares him favourably to the firepower among other teams in and around the top seven of the table. At Manchester City, former Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard also has seven goals in all competitions this season - but Terry has fared better than forwards Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic who have only found the back of the net six and five times respectively. On the other side of Manchester, much has been made of the malaise of on loan United striker Radamel Falcao. The 29-year-old has endured a tough season in England and this has been reflected by his poor tally of four goals in all competitions. Terry's goal return is better than Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko - who has six goals for the season . Radamel Falcao has endured a difficult season on loan at Manchester United - scoring only four goals . Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has scored only one more goal than Terry this season . Liverpool forward Mario Balotelli (left) and Tottenham's Roberto Soldado have both struggled in front of goal . Danny Welbeck, who left United for Arsenal last summer, hasn't fared much better too - having scored eight goals in all competitions for the Gunners. North London rivals Tottenham have relied heavily upon on the goals of Harry Kane and without his productivity Mauricio Pochettino would have had to call upon four-goal man Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor who has only scored twice. Liverpool's struggle for goals has been highlighted by the fact that Raheem Sterling has been deployed in attack by manager Brendan Rodgers this season. First-choice forward Daniel Sturridge has scored only five goals in a campaign which has been beset by injuries. Coupled with that, summer signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have failed to replace the void left by Luis Suarez - with the pair having scored four and three goals apiece. Terry's impressive goal return is even impressive when you look at the figures of Lambert's former club Southampton, where Saints forward Graziano Pelle (15) is their only player to have scored more than the former England international. The south coast club's next highest marksman is Sadio Mane with six then Shane Long with five. Southampton striker Graziano Pelle (left) has scored 15 goals in all competitions for the club this season . Chelsea's No 26 is vying with team-mate Branislav Ivanovic and United's Chris Smalling as this season's highest-scoring Premier League defender. The trio all have four goals in England's top-tier this season - three behind Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel's feat 12 months ago. Despite their impressive return, the triumvirate have a long way to go to match Julian Dicks' record.

"Prostate cancer resistant to conventional treatment could be all but wiped out by a therapy that boosts the immune system, claim researchers. Tests carried out in combination with chemotherapy drugs achieved almost complete remission in mice. The US scientists used low doses of the drug oxaliplatin, which has a unique ability to activate cancer-killing immune cells in small tumours but works less well in large, aggressive tumours. Tests of new drug oxaliplatin, carried out in combination with chemotherapy drugs, achieved almost complete remission in mice. Each year in the UK around 41,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 11,000 die from the disease . The problem is partly caused by immune system ‘B-cells’ that put a brake on the body’s defences in prostate and other cancers. In their study, the researchers found a way of blocking the development or function of these B-cells, or removed them entirely before using oxaliplatin. The prostate tumours were ‘almost completely destroyed’ by the mice’s own immune cells, the team said. Lead scientist Shabnam Shalapour, of the University of California at San Diego, said: ‘The presence of such B-cells in human prostate cancer calls for clinical testing of this novel therapeutic approach.’ Because of the effect of the immune system, advanced and aggressive prostate cancer does not typically respond to chemotherapy, researchers said. B-cells also undermine the effectiveness of promising new drugs called checkpoint inhibitors which ‘unmask’ cancer cells allowing them to be recognised by the immune system. Prostate cancer cells. There are currently few options for men with aggressive drug-resistant prostate cancer that has started to spread . But researchers also managed to get a checkpoint inhibitor – combined with chemotherapy – to work after wiping out the B-cells in one test. Each year in the UK around 41,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 11,000 die from the disease. While early treatment is often highly successful, there are few options for men with aggressive drug-resistant prostate cancer that has started to spread. B-cells play a number of vital immune system roles, including the production of antibodies. They can also tell the immune system to slow down when it is getting overheated, but this can be counter-productive in cancer treatment. Professor Michael Karin, study co-author and also from the University of California at San Diego, said there might be implications for the treatment of other types of cancer. The William Pereira designed Geisel Library at the University of California San Diego. Researchers there have made this new prostate cancer breakthrough . ‘Similar immunosuppressive B-cells can be detected in other human cancers,’ he added. ‘This indicates that B-cell-mediated immunosuppression might be the reason several other cancers are also unresponsive to checkpoint inhibitors, raising the hope that chemoimmunotherapy will have broader applications for many cancer types.’ Symptoms of prostate cancer include the need to urinate more frequently, especially at night, painful ejaculation and blood in the urine or semen. Men may also have pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips or thighs. However, not all men with the disease will have symptoms and often the cancer is spotted only in a routine check-up. Early diagnosis is crucial – up to 98 per cent of men who are diagnosed when the cancer is still contained within the gland will live for more than five years. That drops to just 30 per cent if the cancer has spread.","US scientists used drug oxaliplatin to fire up cancer-killing immune cells .

"Steve Davis would love to see Jimmy White and Reanne Evans light up the Crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn. The king of the baize in the 1980s believes the Whirlwind and the doyenne of the women's tour face tall orders to get through qualifying for the Betfred World Championship. Evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion Ken Doherty on Thursday, in the first of three preliminary rounds, while White will tackle fellow veteran James Wattana in his opener on Saturday. Steve Davis will attempt to qualify for this year's Betfred World Championship at the Crucible . But Davis, who will also attempt to qualify, expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in Sheffield. He calls 29-year-old Dudley potter Evans 'a great player', and said of the 10-time ladies' world champion: 'It's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods. It's a bun fight, but she's perhaps the best woman player I've ever seen. 'In the 1980s I saw Allison Fisher who was the best around, and she was an excellent, excellent player but more methodical. 'Reanne is more like the Jimmy White or the Ronnie O'Sullivan of the women's game. She has the feel for the game, she's at one with the table. 'She could cause a surprise, but to win three matches is the tough bit. It's hard enough for me and Jimmy. 'If me or Jimmy qualify for the Crucible, it's arguably as big a win as we've ever had. 'I've got a little bit of a desire to do it, but Jimmy would certainly love to get back to the Crucible.' Reanne Evans takes on Ken Docherty for a place at the World Championships in Sheffield . Reanne Evans is a 10-time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010-11 season. She suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year. White, who lost six World Championship finals, last appeared at the tournament in 2006, and has fallen short in qualifying every year since. While 52-year-old White is in the autumn of his career, for Davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down. He turns 58 in August and fell off the main tour 12 months ago. A memoir, Interesting, hits the bookshelves on Thursday. A tricky qualifying opener against Jamie Cope could end in disappointment, but it would be short-lived. 'I can't build up the intensity that I used to have, but I must admit I'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players,' Davis said. 'Of course, it'll all end in tears. 'I'm not totally committed but I still have the juices running through me a little bit. I've been practising but it's not a pretty sight. They're wobbling more in the pockets before saying 'nope'. 'Whether I get to the TV stages, that's a long shot. That's tough. Jimmy White will take on fellow veteran James Wattana in qualifying on Thursday . 'I was still practising hard even when I wasn't getting to the latter stages of the Crucible, and in the end you have to say, 'Yeah, I've tried, but the price is too much investment of time'. 'Now if I've lost a match, by the time I've got in the car I've thought about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day, rather than beating up the person who's come up with me. 'I think it's been a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version.' Davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament, but the 1985 'black-ball final' defeat to Dennis Taylor stands over and above all memories. Dennis Taylor in action during the memorable 1985 World Championship final against Davis . The second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant Davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again. 'I don't remember anything as much as I remember the '85 final,' Davis said. 'I do remember the last frame, more so because I've watched it through on video a few times. 'My career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end, it's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain.'

Doherty, the 1997 world champion, led the calls for Evans to be handed another chance on the main tour, but Hearn says the 29-year-old from Dudley must go through the qualifying school to earn a place. Doherty said after the match: 'She's a good player and she should be given more chances on the tour.'

"Reanne Evans insists her World Championship bid is 'do or die' for women in snooker.

Evans has won 10 women's world titles and plays Irishman Doherty at Pond's Forge in Sheffield on Thursday. Reanne Evans is aiming to become the first women to qualify for the snooker World Championships . And, while her profile is dwarfed by the men's game, Evans knows she must take her chance. 'As much as it's brilliant, you get the added pressure. I'm do or die for the ladies. You have to accept it, that's the way it is,' she said. 'I hope it all goes in the right direction. 'It's going to take time and I'm getting old now, all the wrinkles are showing. 'If I don't get to play (in the main draw), I hope (my attempt to qualify will inspire) the young girls because they need to see a future in the game. 'We don't need every match on TV but it's just to show ladies are playing snooker and it might invite more players in. 'When I first started playing I didn't even know there was a ladies tour. If I didn't know, and I was into it, how are other people going to find out? 'We just need it public and to make sure there are lady players out there.' Opponent Doherty won the Crucible title in 1997 but Evans admits she is dreaming of making the main draw, which will require her and all the other 128 entrants to the preliminary draw to win three best-of-19-frame matches. Her opponent Ken Doherty won the title in 1997 and he's all that stands between her and the Championships . She said: 'Everybody wants to dream and sometimes they come true. It's going to be such a tough ask, to win one is hard but to win three is going to be mega-tough. 'You have to go out there and play your best game and hopefully on the day you'll win. 'There are that many good players out there even down the rankings - look at Ben Woollaston, who would have thought he'd have got to the Welsh Open final? But you never know if you don't try.

In it, a small boy named Harry Davies-Carr is seen happily sitting with his baby brother Charlie on his lap - until Charlie painfully makes a snap for one of his older sibling's digits. Now the pair, from Buckinghamshire, who are now aged 11 and nine, have given an interview to children's TV programme Newsround, to talk about the video that changed their lives. Scroll down for video . The boys are they are not: Harry (left) is now 11, whilst his younger brother Charlie (right) is now nine . The YouTube pioneers told CBBC reporter Ricky Boleto that the video was originally filmed for the family to send to the brothers' godfather who lives in America. However, it quickly went viral, becoming an early online hit when it was uploaded eight years ago, going on to amass more than 816million views on YouTube. Harry told the children's TV show that he now finds watching the video funny, saying: 'It makes me laugh.' Charlie said he didn't find it embarrassing but said: 'I think it's a bit odd that loads of people have watched it.

If no one imagines he now spends his days train-spotting, the nights seem a little quieter than they once were. Leigh Griffiths celebrates scoring his third goal of the afternoon against Dundee United on Sunday . Hat-trick hero Griffiths takes the ball home following his heroics against Dundee at Tannadice Park . The 24-year-old (left) embraces his manager Ronny Deila after Sunday's convincing win . ‘Leigh used to put himself around in the Leith area,’ says Tam Currie, his former coach at boys club Leith Athletic. ‘Not that he was doing anything off limits. ‘But I’ve not spoken to him in a good while. Before you would see quite a bit of him round here. But we don’t see nearly as much of him now as we used to.’ It may be a conscious thing. Google the words ‘Leigh Griffiths and controversy’ in the same search and there are more answers than pubs on Leith Walk. In football people talk and older, wiser colleagues and managers whispered of a player with a reputation for being unmanagable. ‘There was never any doubt about the boy’s ability,’ says former Dundee manager Gordon Chisholm. ‘It was the off-field stuff that concerned you. He was a young boy when I had him. He was quiet, withdrawn at times, and wasn’ t exactly the life and soul of the dressing room. ‘He kept himself to himself - but he couldn’t get back to Edinburgh quick enough. ‘That seemed to be the case any time he got a day off. Any spare time and he wanted back to Leith to be with his mates, which probably wasn’t a good thing. 'I’m not sure he was doing the right kind of things. I’m sure he is now being guided by the Celtic management team.’ It has taken time, work and effort to get to a point where Griffiths can now boast 14 goals in his last 17 games. Griffiths celebrated his hat-trick with a trophy as he became Celtic's top scorer . Griffiths caused a stir when he first arrived at Hibernian but proved to be a fans favourite in the end . Griffiths celebrates scoring the winning goal for Hibs in the Scottish Cup semi-final in April 2013 . As a child, he stood out in Edinburgh amateur football. But concerns about the impact of his formative years on the company he kept prompted Hibs, his boyhood idols, to reject his talents. ‘It’s well known he could be a feisty character,’ recalls Tam Currie, a Leith Athletic committee member. ‘I go back with Leigh to when he was 12 and he was a lad who had to be looked after. ‘He came from a split family and you take on the role of social worker in that situation. But he was no different from the others in that regard. ‘He was like any other young lad. He had his troubles with different folk and what not.’ ‘Troubles with different folk’ is a polite way of summing up his career. Boldly, Neil Lennon took a gamble on signing him for £900,000 in January 2014. Celtic supporters were underwhelmed. Griffiths had accumulated yet more front-page cuttings from while on loan at Hibernian from Wolverhampton Wanderers following a racism row on social media. The doubts over his perceived shortcomings as a human being were amplified when he returned to Leith – where else? – to attend an Edinburgh derby as a Hibs fan. He was in a pub where offensive chants about Hearts and former Tynecastle attacker Rudi Skacel were filmed and posted on the internet. In October, he will stand trial on offensive behaviour at football. When the legal action is concluded one way or the other the SFA will revisit charges of bringing the game into disrepute. Griffiths was Wolves leading goalscorer in January of last year, scoring 13 goals in all . That attracted interest from Celtic though, with the Scottish striker penning a four-year deal with the Bhoys . The potential for embarrassment to Celtic is apparent and, perhaps for that reason, Lennon’s successor, Ronny Deila, appeared to make a judgement the player wasn’t worth the hassle. He was no one’s definition of a Deila 24-hour athlete. Yet the Norwegian’s attitudes to Griffiths began to soften when the player opted to drive three hours to play for Celtic’s development team against Sunderland of his own accord. Within days he was back in the first team, scoring in a 2-1 defeat to Dundee United at Tannadice. In the five months since, he has usurped John Guidetti in the starting XI and is now regarded as Deila’s most potent attacker. ‘He looks as if he has matured as a player,’ adds Chisholm, now a scout with Sunderland. ‘He never wanted to be an out-and-out striker when I had him at Dundee. He always drifted out into wide areas. ‘He still does that, but I think he has improved. His hold-up play and movement is better. ‘He is playing with good quality players, getting better service and I am hopeful he has turned a corner now.’ Bolton and Hibs wanted Griffiths on loan in the last window. The court case notwithstanding, however, his No 28 Celtic shirt looks a better fit now than it did even three months ago. ‘He is silencing a few critics now,’ says his former Leith coach Currie, with Griffiths having grabbed his second hat-trick of the season against Dundee United on Sunday. ‘The Celtic supporters didn’t fancy him much. There were certainly a few doubters there. ‘People here in this neck of woods was hoping he would end up back at Hibs on loan. ‘I’m delighted for him it didn’t come to that because I don’t think it would have been a good move for his career. ‘To be honest, I would take him over Steven Fletcher every time. ‘He is a better striker. I used to see Fletcher a lot when he played for Hibs and, all round, Leigh is a better player. ‘I read he still has a trial to go through for the pub incident - but he knows now he has to be on his best behaviour. You have to be to be a Celtic player. ‘I’ll tell him that if I see him again in Leith. But it looks to me now like he has turned the corner.’","Leigh Griffiths is making the right sort of noise with Celtic .

"Falkirk booked their place in the  Scottish Cup Final with a smash-and-grab 1-0 win over Hibernian at Hampden Park. The dominant Easter Road side hit the post just before the break through Fraser Fyvie and again in the second half through fellow midfielder Scott Allan, with the Bairns rarely threatening. However, the Hibees were stunned in the 74th minute when Falkirk midfielder Craig Sibbald headed in a Blair Alston cross to set up a meeting on May 30 with either Inverness or Celtic. Craig Sibbald finally breaks the deadlock for Falkirk with a stooping header that left Hibernian hearts broken .

The Falkirk players celebrate taking the lead against Hibernian in the Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden Park .

Subs not used: Bowman, Dick, Cooper, Blair, O'Hara . Scorer: Sibbald 74 . Booked: Taiwo . Referee: John Beaton . It was sweet revenge for the Bairns, who lost a seven-goal thriller to the Leith side at the same stage of the competition two years ago, and they will be looking to take the cup back to the town for the first time since 1957. For their part, Hibs, last winners of the trophy in 1902, will wonder if that curse will ever be broken after a semi-final in which they had bossed for long spells. Both managers were forced into changes for the all-Championship last-four tie. Hibs midfielder Scott Robertson replaced Martin Boyle who is cup-tied after playing for parent club Dundee in the competition before his loan move to Easter Road. Falkirk manager Peter Houston had John Baird and Mark Kerr cup-tied and top scorer Rory Loy failed to recover from an ankle injury as captain David McCracken returned to defence with forward Taylor Morgan given a start.

The Hibernian supporters can't quite believe their luck as Fraser Fyvie and Scott Allan both hit the woodwork . Lewis Stevenson misses from close range for Hibernian on one of those afternoon's for Alan Stubbs' side . There wasn't much too cheer about for Hibernian fans in a sparse Hampden Park crowd on Saturday . Falkirk went into the game undefeated in three league games against Hibs this season, drawing two and winning one, but found themselves under pressure from the first whistle. Indeed, Houston's side were lucky to escape going behind after only six minutes when Dylan McGeouch's fine cross from the right was directed toward his own goal by the foot of the stretching McCracken. Falkirk goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald chested it straight to the falling former Falkirk striker Farid El Alagui but, while flat on the ground, he headed straight into the arms of the grateful Bairns keeper. The Bairns hit back immediately. Midfielder Will Vaulks' long-range drive was deflected past the post as Hibs withstood a brief spell of pressure, with McCracken heading a Sibbald corner just past the near post. The tempo then subsided, as if both teams had surprised themselves with their early boldness. Hibs were the slicker but their final ball was lacking and so was their luck, it appeared. Two minutes from the break, after El Alagui had hit the side-netting, Fyvie's low drive from around 30 yards beat MacDonald. Luke Leahy celebrates Falkirk's win (left) as Hibernian's Scott Robertson looks dejected at the final whistle . However, the ball bounced off the post and back to the keeper who, like the Falkirk fans, again breathed a sigh of relief. Houston replaced David Smith with Botti Biabi for the start of the second half but, in the 47th minute, it was Alston who forced Hibs keeper Mark Oxley to push his 25-yard shot round the post for a corner, which came to nothing. The Easter Road men then dominated. In the 64th minute, as they pinned Falkirk back in their box again, McGeouch got his legs tangled trying to execute a volley before Lewis Stevenson skied his close-range shot high over the bar. Then Allan brilliantly weaved his way into the Falkirk penalty area before driving against the bar, with El Alagui heading his corner over moments later. But the Hibees were stunned when Falkirk took the lead. There was little imminent danger when Alston got past Robertson down the right, but he whipped in a delightful cross and Sibbald escaped the attention of McGeouch to power a header past Oxley. Reeling Hibs threw everything forward in search of a leveller. A Paul Hanlon tackle prevented Biabi getting his shot away on the counter - Falkirk cries for a penalty were dismissed by referee John Beaton - before MacDonald made a crucial save from El Alagui at his near post. Falkirk then held out for the three minutes of added time to spark scenes of joy among players and fans at the final whistle.","Craig Sibbald's 74th-minute header is enough to send Falkirk through .

"For the 0.01 per cent, booking holiday travel is a far different experience than it is for the rest of us. Instead of scrolling through holiday deals on bargain-finding websites, these ultra-wealthy individuals prefer to take off on a moment's notice and sort out any over-the-top accommodations and activities upon arrival. To get a glimpse inside this elite - and rarely planned - world, MailOnline Travel spoke to wedding and event planner Sarah Haywood, who has helped organise ceremonies and honeymoons for everyone from celebrities to Fortune 500 businessmen. Scroll down for video . For the super-wealthy, money is of no concern when it comes to booking private jets and chartering yachts . 'Most of our clients have a private travel consultant,' Haywood explains to MailOnline Travel. 'There are several really upmarket agents where you pay a fee annually to have them take care of all your travel.' Haywood reveals that she often works with these agencies, where she estimates that membership fees for such a service start at about £50,000. 'These aren't companies you'll find online,' she adds. 'The people that they're working with don't plan and they expect things to be catered to their whims.' Victoria Hoffman, founder and CEO of the Miami-based Concierge & Events by Victoria, tells MailOnline Travel that some of the most common last-minute request include special access to exclusive events, such as the Cannes Film Festival, the Academy Awards or tickets to the White House Correspondence Dinner. Victoria Hoffman, who owns her on US-based concierge service, reveals she's had clients request special access to exclusive events such as the Cannes Film Festival . Specialist Italian travel company, Bellini Travel, set up by Emily FitzRoy 15 years ago, is so exclusive that it only caters to a carefully selected list of 100 clients a year. 'As we look after a limited number of people each year, we can pull in huge favours,' Emily said. 'For example, we're just in the middle of negotiating to close the Uffizi for a client who only has 24 hours in Florence, but wants to see Botticelli's Birth of Venus on his own. Brown and Hudson describe themselves as the antidote to everything that is packaged and unconsidered about today’s luxury travel business. Their bespoke service, which charges a minimum of £1,000 simply to create an itinerary for potential clients, has an impressive portfolio of bespoke experiences they have orchestrated for guests. Alexander Martin, director of luxury lifestyle website The Envy Group agrees that for the super-rich, it's not about what you give, so much as the amazing experience behind it. 'Our clients - or 'friends' as we call them - are very successful and generous people, and we help them create unique lifestyle experiences that goes far beyond booking a table at an amazing restaurant. 'We recently organised the world's only Tiffany-blue Bentley for one of our friends, and created a 20ft Tiffany-inspired remote-controlled hydraulic gift box complete to deliver it in.' And if you're heading to the luxurious five-star properties hoping to catch a glimpse of some of the world's wealthiest individuals, don't bother. Haywood tells us the the ultra-elite don't often check in to big hotels, much preferring somewhere private for their opulent getaways. 'This is above just a private island in the Maldives,' she tells us. 'People with this kind of money aren't looking at what's fashionable, they're looking for privacy and security. 'The world's wealthiest like to stay low profile, so we'll be looking at places where they can do that.' Hoffman agrees, explaining that more and more clients have been asking her recently to rent villas and help them to live like a local. Instead of splashing out on a luxurious suite, the ultra-rich prefer to rent their own private Maldivian island . Haywood cites Cote d'Azur and the Maldives as two locations favoured by her A-list clientele, while Hoffman notes that she has planned extravagant vacation experiences everywhere from Paris to Italy. 'We once provided access to Coco Chanel's apartment and private jewellery collection,' Hoffman tells MailOnline Travel. 'The entire experience was a day in the life of Coco in which the clients dined and had afternoon tea in many of the places in Paris she frequented. 'In other scenarios, we have given privileged access to the private estates of winemakers in Bordeaux, Burgundy and Piedmont. 'In one case, my client wanted to relive the 18th century, so we had period costumes and horse-drawn carriages for the day. In another, we created a progressive feast in which each course was served at a different historic home in Italy.' Travel around the world by private jet . Hurlingham Travel - price on application . Checking in with the hoi palloi at overcrowded airports and squeezing into a tiny seat can be a tiresome experience at the best of times.

At the time of going to press, the companies are in negotiations with a Chinese PHD student who is hoping to be whisked off on this incredible adventure once he completes his studies. Hoffman tells MailOnline Travel that exclusive access to private wine estates in France is a common request . One of Hoffman's most impressive travel experiences included creating a 'day in the life' of Coco Chanel for a client visiting Paris . Elite wedding and event planner, Sarah Haywood, explains that the ultra-wealthy prefer not to book in advance . Haywood has also had very last minute requests that she has had to sort only hours before - and from many miles away. 'Once, somebody was on a post-wedding shoot and they wanted a white horse at sunset,' she remembers. 'Finding a white horse at sunset, it is possible and it did happen, but for a few hours it was quite touch and go. 'And it turns out that white horses are actually grey, not white.' Haywood reveals that one traveller once asked her to find a white horse at sunset for a post-wedding shoot - only hours before they needed it! In future, these one-of-a-kind holiday experiences will only become more popular. 'People want a customised vacation focused around an annual event or theme,' Hoffman says. But such an extravagantly-themed getaway will cost you - as much as $100,000 for a dinner, depending on who its with. 'Pricing structure varies,' Hoffman adds. 'A VIP experience to France or Italy in which two people explore special access historic UNESCO sites not generally open to the public could have a starting range of $7,000 (£4,540), whereas dinner with a celebrity or athlete could have a starting cost of $100,000 (about £65,000).'","For the most elite travellers, vacations are rarely planned far in advance .

"Manny Pacquiao has become one of the most recognisable stars in the world of sport after a series of mega-fights and another one to follow on Saturday night against Floyd Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines. He spent the early part of his career boxing in the Far East before being given his chance on the big stage in 2001 against Lehlo Ledwaba in an IBF world super-bantamweight title fight in Las Vegas.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night. The one upmanship is sure to continue until fight day. Pacquiao has been involved in some of the biggest fights over the last decade but Saturday's occasion will eclipse all of them .

"A celebrated Australian artist has penned an impassioned message to the Indonesian President in the final hours before his treasured friends, Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, are expected to be executed in Indonesia. Archibald-winning artist Ben Quilty became a mentor to Bali Nine duo in 2012 and has been a staunch advocate for clemency having witnessed their remarkable rehabilitation first-hand. Quilty has addressed his poignant post to Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who has repeatedly rejected pleas to spare the lives of the nine drug convicts on death row. The artist has described how the two good men will be a pillar of strength for the others on death row until their last moment. Scroll down for video . Australian artist Ben Quilty has penned an impassioned message to the Indonesian President in the final hours before his treasured friends, Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, are expected to be executed in Indonesia . Artist and vigil organiser, Ben Quilty speaks during the Ampuni (Mercy) Vigils in February. He has long led the Mercy campaigns and has now addressed a message to Indonesian President Joko Widodo . The heartbreaking message Ben Quilty wrote, directed at Joko Widodo, during Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's last day on earth . Present Joko Widodo has repeatedly rejected all pleas for clemency for the nine on death row . 'Joko Widodo tonight you will kill two good men, my friends,' Quilty wrote. 'I want you to know that you may take their freedom and their lives, you may rob their fellow inmates of the support and love that both men have offered and provided for so long, you can turn off Myu's imagination but you will never kill the memory of them.' Quilty has pledged to become the 'most outspoken critic of the death penalty for the rest of my life'. 'I have promised Myu and Andrew, their parents and their siblings, that I will fight against the death penalty for the rest of my life,' he wrote. Quilty gives an insight into the two men's compassionate characters and the strength he imagines they are showing during their last hours of earth. 'I can also assure you that Myu and Andrew will care for the other inmates you will execute tonight,' he wrote. A portrait on Ben Quilty, painted by his protege and death row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran . Recent paintings done in prison by Australian drug convict and death row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran are carried by relatives at the Nusakambangan port in Cilacap across from the Nusakambangan maximum security prison island on his last day alive. The heart is his last ever painting . 'The six men and one young woman from the Philippines, Ghana, Brazil and Nigeria will have two constant, calming and compassionate voices beside them right until the last second.' The artist particularly mentions that Sukumaran would be a vital source of comfort for single mother-of-two, Filipino woman Mary Jane Veloso, who was not allowed a translator during her crucial court cases. 'Myuran will continue to translate your executioner's words into English for Mary Jane Veloso and Andrew will calm and console,' Quilty wrote, describing the artist and the priest. 'I know that before the sound of your guns the island will hear the comforting whisper of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.' Quilty has tirelessly led the Mercy Campaigns and organised vigils to appeal for mercy from the Indonesian Government. He has organised concerts and created videos with well-known Australians pleading for compassion to be shown for the two young men.

Helen Chan, the mother of Andrew Chan cries as she arrived from Nusakambangan island at a hotel in Cilicap, Central Java, Indonesia . Quilty has previously described Sukumaran as 'humble and generous and kind'. 'He is not a terrorist. He is not even dangerous,' wrote Quilty in March, as Sukumaran and Chan were taken by Special Force soldiers. 'He was a self indulgent kid. But now he is a quiet, dignified young man. He is an artist.' On Monday, as time continued to slip away, Quilty posted another reflection as he tried to come to terms with the imminent death of his Sukumaran, a masterful artist who became his protégé. Sukumaran completed a fine arts degree this year through correspondence with Curtin University and produced his last artwork on Tuesday afternoon – a heart, signed by all nine people on death row. 'With his passing my world will take a dark plunge backwards,' Quilty wrote. Hundreds of supporters of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, including Ben Quilty, held a vigil tonight at Martin Place as the pair prepare to face the firing squad . Supporters of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran held a vigil tonight as the pair prepare to face the firing squad this evening at Indonesia's Nusakambangan Island . He's called for the men to be pardoned and organised candle-lit vigils in a bid to sway Indonesian President Joko Widodo's favour. But with the news on Monday that Indonesia authorities have told the men they had begun the 72-hour notification period, even Quilty's hope appears to be fading. 'Myu is ok. He is ready for what is to come,' he posted on Facebook. The artist said his friend, Sukumaran, had brought people together in an outpouring of compassion. 'We will all ensure that compassion continues to flourish,' he promised. Quilty also hit out at media reports depicting Sukumaran as 'The Enforcer' and hoped in the future no young man would be victimised by such coverage. An ambulance carrying coffins arrives at Wijaya Pura Port, Cilacap the day of their execution . An ambulance bearing the name of Mary Jane Veloso, a Filipino facing execution, enters Wijayapura port as it heads to the prison island of Nusa Kambangan in Cilacap, preparing for the executions . 'The only thing Myu enforced in me is that compassion is at the core of a healthy society,' he wrote. Notably, Quilty rose to prominence in the Australian contemporary art scene for his expressive artworks - such as a series of crashed car portraits - that often focused on the destructive character of masculine youth. Now, it appears his one-time pupil and eternal friend will pay the ultimate price for such indiscretions. 'Myu made terrible mistakes,' Quilty writes. 'So did I, but Myu, his family and his friends will pay a dreadful price for his youthful self-indulgence. 'And so will Myu.'

"Scottish football's relationship with television has become a form of Stockholm Syndrome. No one is tied up in a basement. There are no hostages. Yet the lengths to which the SPFL will go to show love to those broadcasters who hold a gun to their heads has become a source of growing, simmering public fury. The Scottish game is engaged in a Faustian pact. And the television piper is calling the tune. Sky and BT Sports pay £16million a year for live coverage of Scottish football. The BBC puts in an estimated £3m a year for Sportscene highlights and radio commentaries. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths (right) completes his hat-trick during the win over Kilmarnock earlier this week . Compared with the £5billion paid to English clubs for Premiership football the sums are trifling. Borderline insulting. St Mirren facing Ross County on a wet March night in Paisley will never be a rival to the Manchester derby but broadcasters don't show Scottish football out of charity. They do so because it fills their schedules and meets a level of demand. In return for which they regard SPFL football with indifference. The BBC, a state public service broadcaster, charges the same flat rate licence tax to viewers in London and Manchester as it does to viewers in Glasgow and Inverness, with one key difference. English football is treated with reverence and respect. Scottish football like a pavement beggar. On Saturday, Hibernian and Falkirk fans will be asked to travel to Glasgow for a Scottish Cup semi-final which kicks off at 12.15pm Why? Because Sky Sports want the game out of the way to show a recorded documentary on Bob Paisley. On Sunday, Inverness fans must travel 200 miles for another 12.15pm kick-off against Celtic. Topping the bill in the afternoon is the European Cup rugby semi-final between Leinster and Toulon, a game likely to prompt complete indifference in public houses the length and breadth of Britain. It's not just the Scottish Cup. Celtic have played just four home league games at 3pm on a Saturday all season. And the decision to put back the Hearts v Rangers Championship clash 24 hours for the benefit of Sky caused an almighty row while resurrecting the dreaded 'sporting integrity' phrase. Hibernian are engaged in a battle with the Ibrox side for second place in the Championship. This matters because the team which finishes second has two fewer tense, troublesome play-off games to play. Were Rangers to go into their final game at Tynecastle needing only a point against Hearts — Hibernian's city rivals — the game would be played against an unparalleled backdrop of suspicion. To most — Leanne Dempster of Hibs and Hearts owner Ann Budge especially — the issue is one of fairness. It's clear cut. The games should always have kicked off at the same time and they believe the SPFL have been duplicitous and deceitful. Loathe to be seen criticising the SPFL, SFA chief executive Stewart Regan chose his words carefully, while all but admitting the league had made a complete and utter hash of things. Hamilton's Jason Scotland (right) challenges Dundee United's Calum Morris (left) during the SPL match . 'For 99 per cent of the time, there are no issues,' he said. 'Broadcasting in football has been operating for 20-30 years with big money coming into the game. Usually it's no problem at all. 'There are times — and we have one right now — where the broadcaster has a requirement to show a match at a particular time on a particular day and that causes issues. 'It's important for the league to consult with all of the interested parties, particularly the clubs who are the connecting point with the fans. 'Obviously, you can't please everybody but consultation is the secret. Neil Doncaster (SPFL chief) has been challenged by a number of different parties and I think it's important he listens and tries to come up with a pragmatic solution.' Minutes after Regan spoke, the SPFL's solution arrived in the shape of an embarrassing U-turn. As they should have been from the outset, the final-day Championship games were all rearranged for Saturday May 2. With a 12.15pm kick-off, naturally. And after some cap doffing and bowing to the Sky paymasters. Most accept Doncaster is the paid hand of the most influential clubs in Scotland, with little real executive authority. His job is to act as a human shield for clubs and to put lipstick on a pig of a broadcasting deal. Yet the decision to put the Rangers fixture back heightened suspicions over both his competence and motives. In May 2013, the final game in Division Three for the Ibrox club — against Berwick Rangers — was shown live on television. The other four fixtures were immediately brought forward, too. A statement on the Rangers website confirmed the decision had been taken 'in the interests of fairness'. What changed between May 2013 and now? To those who believe the SPFL are hellbent on getting Rangers back into the top tier come what may, this was manna from heaven. 'It's a challenging time for the SPFL right now,' said Regan with a degree of understatement. 'I can see why fans are unhappy. 'Ultimately there's always a balance between the needs of the broadcasters and the needs of the clubs, the needs of the supporters and sponsors. 'When you're looking at a Scottish football landscape, where money is tight and a broadcaster is the biggest provider of income, that can't be ignored. I'm not saying it's right but they have to be heard.' The problem comes when paying customers believe the broadcasters are the only people being heard. St Mirren's Stephen Mallan (centre) is challenged by Ross County's Jackson Irvine (right) Scottish fans from across the UK are now routinely asked, at the drop of a hat, to change travel plans to facilitate Friday-night football and noon kick-offs on a Saturday or Sunday. Monday night games have also crept onto the schedules. And for what? Scottish viewers make up around nine per cent of Sky and BT Sport' s subscribers. Yet it now costs them more to cover two games between West Brom and Stoke than it does to fund an entire season of Scottish football. The BBC, meanwhile, pays Gary Lineker as much to present Match of the Day as they do for SPFL highlights and radio coverage. 'It's fair to say that the landscape we are in right now is challenging,' added Regan. 'When you look at the numbers that the Premier League delivered in England it blows everything out of the water. 'The Scottish football authorities — the league in particular — are fighting for what you would call the scraps from the table. 'I know that there is pressure being put on the BBC through a number of parties right now, including the Scottish Government, to try to see if there is any way to make an improvement in income that can be generated by further discussions. 'But, ultimately, the broadcaster will only pay market rate for the product they are buying. 'We are trying to get that market rate back up by collectively working on initiatives to improve our game, but it's not going to happen overnight.' The empty stands are a problem. The spectacle in the SPFL is often poor and does nothing to persuade Sky that Scottish football is worth paying out more cash. In a vicious circle, however, this attitude drives the crowds lower and lower. Many now speak openly, then, of Scottish football going cold turkey. Of subscriber boycotts or ending the abusive relationship with broadcasters altogether and streaming SPFL games online on a pay-per-view basis. Or having no coverage at all. When old hands of the Scottish game such as Sir Bob Kelly, Jim McLean and Jim Farry warned of the creeping dangers of live television they were dismissed as dinosaurs. Right now, they look like visionaries. Celtic fans sing during the win over Kilmarnock, which sees them three points clear at the top of the SPL .","Scottish football coverage is at the mercy of Sky and BT's schedules .
Yet, Scottish football is never afforded the same precedence as England's .
The demand for Scottish football is nearing an all-time low ."

"Stefan Johansen gratefully picked up two individual prizes at the annual Celtic player of the year awards dinner on Sunday night then looked forward to the team clinching the Scottish Premiership title. The Norway midfielder, 24, shared the players' player of the year award with captain Scott Brown but stood alone as the choice of the supporters. And by this weekend the former Stromsgodset player, who joined the Parkhead club in January last year, could have another championship medal to boot. Stefan Johansen has been in terrific form for Celtic this season and has impressed during his first campaign . Ronny Deila's side went eight points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the table with a 3-0 away win at Dundee United on Sunday, courtesy of a Leigh Griffiths hat-trick. The Hoops will win the league for the fourth successive season if they beat Dundee at home on Friday night and the Dons fail to win against the Tannadice side on Saturday, which would cap a 'special' campaign for Johansen. 'It's an amazing feeling,' he told Celtic's official website. 'I didn't expect it at all. This is my first full season here so it's special, especially at a big club like Celtic. The Norwegian picked up two awards and is delighted with the Bhoys 'special' season . 'With all the great players in the team and how the team has developed this season, it's an honour to get this prize. 'I'm proud because when you see all the other players nominated - any one of them could win it. 'We have had a great season and hopefully we can seal the league title now.

"He is regarded as the next big thing in South American football and he's coming to the Premier League. Chelsea are set to confirm the £4.5m signing of Nathan Allan de Souza on Wednesday, beating rivals Manchester City to his signature. The dazzling Brazilian attacking midfielder, who turned 19 last month, arrives from Atletico Paranaense with a glowing and ever-growing reputation. Scroll down to watch video of Chelsea's new signing Nathan in action . Chelsea are set to announce the £4.5million signing of Brazilian wonderkid Nathan . Nathan tweeted the news he was set to sign for Chelsea by revealing he was headed for contract talks and a medical. He said: 'Very happy!!! In London to sign my contract with Chelsea and take tests' Full name: Nathan Allan de Souza . Born: 13 March 1996 in Blumenau, Brazil . Position: Attacking midfield . Clubs: . Atletico Paranaense (2014-15) - 13 appearances, 0 goals . Chelsea (2015-) - signed April 2015 . International: . Brazil U17 - 6 caps, 5 goals . Brazil U20 - 5 caps, 0 goals . Nathan will add to the Samba feel at Stamford Bridge, joining compatriots Willian, Ramires, Filipe Luis and Oscar. And he should have plenty to offer Jose Mourinho's side on the evidence of his highlights reel for his club and the Brazilian youth teams. The YouTube compilations certainly offer enough to get Chelsea fans excited - there are lightning-fast runs through opposition defences, pinged long balls to the forward line and a promising knack of getting into goalscoring positions. Most of the best bits come from the 2013 FIFA Under 17 World Cup, the tournament that first alerted the Premier League elite to Nathan's talents. Although Brazil only reached the quarter-finals of the competition, Nathan scored five goals and demonstrated his full potential. He found the net twice in a 6-1 rout of Slovakia and scored two more as the hosts UAE were beaten by the same scoreline. Nathan is brought down by Martin Junas of Slovakia to win a penalty during the Under 17 World Cup in 2013 . The young midfielder made his name while starring for Brazil at the tournament two years ago  in Abu Dhabi . Nathan shows his strength by shrugging off the challenge of Russia's Dimitriy Barinov . In the last eight, he scored an 85th-minute equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Mexico, before converting in the marathon penalty shootout, which Brazil ultimately lost 10-11. His classy performances earned him a spot in the FIFA Team of the Tournament and a star was born. At that time, Nathan was playing for the Atletico Paranaense Under 19 side. The club is based in Curitiba, a city about three hours' drive from his hometown of Blumenau. But those performances out in the Middle East put the rocket boosters on his career, with promotion into the first-team squad at his club and advancement to the Brazil Under 20 team, for whom he has played five times. Chelsea will soon boast another Brazilian in their ranks to add to the likes of Willian (left) and Oscar (right) Nathan will join Ramires (right, in action against QPR last Sunday) as the fifth Brazilian in the squad . Nathan will not be ready to throw into the Chelsea first-team right away. He hasn't yet completed a full 90 minutes for Paranaense, with the majority of his 11 appearances in the Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A coming from the bench. Leaving Brazil will come as something of a relief for Nathan and, in particular, his family following an ugly contract dispute with the Brazilian club. With his contract due to expire this month, the club informed Nathan's father and agent, Jose Carlos de Souza, they wished to trigger a clause to keep him for another two years. Nathan currently plays in midfield for Atletico Paranaense in the Brazilian league . Nathan battles for the ball against Tiago Real of Goias at Arena da Baixada stadium in November last year . Caught off guard, Nathan's family offered the club £2m to release him from the contract and allow them to negotiate with European clubs who had shown an interest. Paranaense refused, saying that figure fell well short of what they could sell the player for and went to court to settle the dispute. But with a fee now agreed with Chelsea, the club should drop the legal proceedings when he settles in at Stamford Bridge. It now remains to be seen whether Nathan can live up to his promise in the Premier League.","Chelsea are set to sign Nathan from Atletico Paranaense for £4.5m .

"Massaging your 'third eye',  the point between your eyebrows, can help boost concentration, massage therapist Suzi Cinalli says . Do you find your mind wandering, caught in a day dream? Or hitting the afternoon slump ahead of schedule, loosing your train of thought even by mid-morning? If you struggle to stay alert, massage therapist Suzi Cinalli, from The Vital Touch, might have just the answer. Here, writing for Healthista, she outlines her six top tips to boost concentration, from cooing over cute pictures of  pets, to indulging in a lunchtime yoga session... Massage your 'third eye' Massaging reflex points when you have a spare moment at your desk can boost memory and dissolve tension. Apply pressure to your 'third eye' with your middle finger tip while taking several deep breaths. The 'third eye' is a point directly between your eyebrows at the point where the bridge of your nose meets your forehead. Press on this point to 3-4 minutes, repeating two or three times a day. The 'third eye' is associated with the pituitary gland, the pea-sized master gland of the endocrine system. Light pressure applied to this pressure point will boost memory and concentration and relieve stress. Keep pumpkin seeds in your desk drawer . Just a handful a day provides the recommended daily amount of zinc, vital for enhancing memory and thinking skills. Pumpkin seeds also contain omega-3 oils which are great brain food. These oils help build and maintain the myelin sheath that protects our brain nerve fibres - allowing messages to flow freely. If you don’t like pumpkin seeds walnuts are another great omega-3 brain snack you can keep on your desk. Opt for activated nuts – available from Planet Organic – for optimum nutrient absorption. (Activated nuts are those that have been soaked in water and salt for a period of time. This not only increases the nutrient value of them, but breaks down the problematic compounds that help enhance their digestibility) Eat fish for breakfast . Swap cereals for kippers and wholemeal toast and you’ll soon ramp up brain-boosting essential fatty acids (EFAs) and slow release sugars, needed to stay focused all day. Swapping cereal for fish at breakfast can ramp up brain-boosting essential fatty acids . Oily fish deliver a powerful EFA boost in a form that’s easily absorbed by the body, containing both EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids. Low DHA levels have been linked to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and memory loss. Other good options include salmon, trout, mackerel, herring, sardines or pilchards. And if you’re serving them on toast, opt for wholegrain granary bread, which has a low-GI and releases glucose into the bloodstream more slowly, a steady blood sugar level will also help keep you mentally alert throughout the day. Take a deep breath . Slow your breath down when you need to focus, do a presentation or attend an interview. Deepening your breathing can change brainwave patterns activating theta waves, a brain state associated with enhanced memory. To activate theta waves switch your breathing to your lower abdomen and start breathing from your stomach and consciously slow your breath. 1. Breathe in for the count of six. 2. Hold it (count to two) 3. Let the breathe out slowly (count to nine approx.) After a few moments you should feel calm and more receptive to new information. To improve memory even further combine deep breathing with mindfulness. Look at cute pet pictures . Next time you’re feeling fuzzy-headed, log on to PetSugar for an instant reboot. Yes, you read that right, far from being the ultimate timewaster trawling through cute kitten photos could actually help you meet that deadline at work. It sounds unlikely we know but a study by Japanese researchers found that university students behaved ‘more deliberately and perform tasks with greater time and care,’ after viewing photos of cute kittens and puppies. Just make sure your boss knows that cuddly pets are an all-important part of your new work remit. A study by Japanese researchers found university students behaved 'more deliberately and performed tasks with greater time and care' after viewing pictures of cute kittens and puppies . Do yoga at lunchtime . Aerobic exercise is good for your heart and health but a lunchtime yoga class will help you stay sharp. After the yoga you are better able to focus and process information quickly, more accurately. In one study, reported in the, researchers gave participants a series of yoga exercises, including isometric contractions of different muscles in the body. The exercises were followed by a meditation session, when participants focused on posture and deep breathing. After the yoga session they were given a series of mental tests. The researchers at the University of Illinois also put the guinea pigs through their paces on a treadmill for the same 20-minute period, keeping their heart rate up between 60 and 70 per cent of the maximum. Aerobic exercise is good for your heart and health but a lunchtime yoga class will help you stay sharp . They found that people who had been for a 20-minute jog were less able to focus mentally on tasks than they were following a yoga session. Also those who had done yoga could learn, hold and update pieces of information more effectively than after performing an aerobic exercise. Breathing and meditative yoga calms the mind and body, reducing distracting thoughts while you focus on your body, posture or breath. The scientists in the study believed that this could have a beneficial, wider-reaching effect on your day, beyond the yoga class, when you try to focus on tasks requiring concentration.

"While racism is thought to be rife in the Southern US states, a new 'hate map of America' reveals prejudice to be common elsewhere. The map suggests that the coal region and rust belt in the American Northeast, along with the South, have now become the most racist areas of the US. The rust belt straddles the upper northeastern US, the Great Lakes, and the Midwest states, while the coal region is found in Northeastern Pennsylvania and the spine of the Appalachian Mountains.

Racism in the New England states, along with New York, were two of the most surprising discoveries for the researchers. Searches for n****r are less frequent in regions west of Texas. The map based its results on Google search data – a technique previously used by data scientists to understand how racism may impact Barack Obama's electoral chances, according to the Washington Post. 'Google data, evidence suggests, are unlikely to suffer from major social censoring,' Harvard University data scientist, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, wrote in an earlier paper. He added that Google searchers are online and likely alone - both of which make it easier to express socially taboo thoughts. Asking someone about racism in a traditional survey rarely works, says Stephens-Davidowitz, because people may lie, and often, racism can operate on a subconscious level. As part of the study, researchers at the University of Maryland, Columbia University, Emory University and Harvard University looked at searches containing the slur n****r. They found that it was searched for frequently, as often as, for instance, 'economist,' 'sweater,' and 'Daily Show'. The map revealed that clusters of racism appeared in areas of the Gulf Coast, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and a large portion of Ohio. Racism in the New England states, along with New York, were two surprising hotspots for racism. Searches for n****r are less frequent in regions west of Texas. The researchers on the Plos One paper found that racist searches were linked with higher death rates in black communities. 'Results from our study indicate that living in an area characterised by a one standard deviation greater proportion of racist Google searches is associated with an 8.2 per cent increase in the all-cause mortality rate among Blacks,' the authors wrote. The map looks strikingly similar to a recent a map of racist Tweets made by researchers at Humboldt State University. Students studied 150,000 geocoded tweets sent out between June 2012 and April 2013 containing 10 pre-selected hate words in three categories: Racism, homophobia and disability . The map looks strikingly similar to a recent a map of racist Tweets made by researchers at Humboldt State University. Students studied 150,000 geocoded tweets sent out between June 2012 and April 2013 containing 10 pre-selected hate words in three categories: Racism, homophobia and disability. Researchers discovered 41,306 tweets containing the word n****r, 95,123 referenced 'homo', among other terms. While racism may appear rife in the US, a separate study found that overall, Western countries are the most accepting of other cultures. The data came from the World Value Survey, which measured the social attitudes of people in different countries. Below are results of the countries that are the least tolerant: . 40% + (of individuals surveyed would not want a person of another race as a neighbour) India, Jordan . 30 - 39.9%Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Vietnam, Indonesia, South Korea . 20 - 39.9% France, Turkey, Bulgaria, Algeria, Morocco, Mali, Zambia, Thailand, Malaysia, The Philippines, Bangladesh, Hong Kong . Tweets that included the slur n****r, were not concentrated in any single region in the US. Instead, there are a number of pockets of concentration, including East Iowa, where 31 users sent out 41 tweets referencing the word, and Fountain, Indiana, where there were 22 tweets containing the slur. Perhaps the most interesting concentration comes for references to 'wetback' - a derogatory term used for illegal Mexican immigrants. Most tweets containing the offensive term came from several parts of Texas, which surprisingly are not even close to the Mexican-American border. While racism may appear rife in the US, a separate study found that overall, Western countries are the most accepting of other cultures with Britain, the U.S.and Australia more tolerant than anywhere else. The data came from the World Value Survey, which measured the social attitudes of people in different countries. The country with the highest proportion of 'intolerant' people who wanted neighbours similar to them was Jordan, where 51.4 per cent of the population would refuse to live next to someone of a different race. Next was India with 43.5 per cent. Racist views are strikingly rare in the U.S., according to the survey, which claims that only 3.8 per cent of residents are reluctant to have a neighbour of another race.

"After two months since the official announcement, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are into the final few days of their preparation at camp ahead of their monumental bout on Saturday. On Monday night, Pacquiao arrived in Las Vegas ahead of his MGM Grand summit with Mayweather. The 36-year-old was seen arriving on the world-famous Strip in the Nevada desert at the Mandalay Bay hotel, which will be his base for the week. Pacquiao had been training in Los Angeles at trainer Freddie Roach's Wild Card Gym - an unassuming building that is surrounded by a launderette and a petrol station. The Filipino star uprooted on Monday night as he and his team took a 270-mile drive on board his own bus. Roach's star fighter will be hoping a change of scenery won't affect his preparations against Mayweather - who has the luxury of training at his self-titled Boxing Club in Las Vegas, which is situated next to a Chinese Baptist Church. Ahead of their gigantic fight, Sportsmail takes a tale of the tape look at the duo's two main bases and what is on offer at either facility. Manny Pacquiao gestures to fans gathered after arriving at the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas on Monday .

Despite the wealth of talent that trains at the Wild Card Gym and the Mayweather Boxing Club, both are in rather low-key surroundings. The former is situated along Vine Street - an unassuming road in Los Angeles which is set back from its nearby properties. Next to it on the right is a Stop & Shop Market while a Mobil petrol station is situatied to its left. In among the small complex too is a nail parlour, a Thai food restaurant and a launderette. The latter is on Schiff Drive - another unassuming road. Next to the building on one side is a Chinese Baptist Church, with KitcheNova - a kitchen supllies shop a futher store down. It's fair to say that both gyms could be lost among a backdrop of similar-looking buildings. The Wild Card Gym is located on the unassuming road of Vine Street in Los Angeles .

In contrast to use the Mayweather Boxing Club - you have to contact their website for more information first . EQUIPMENT . The Wild Card gym is rather simplistic in comparison to the Mayweather Boxing Club - but still produces the same knockout results.

"How to get the enviable physiques of the stars. This week: Judy Murray's waist. Judy Murray dazzled at her son Andy's wedding, wearing a belted dress-coat that accentuated her toned stomach. Judy, 55, doesn't play tennis to stay in shape, 'Because my life is saturated with it' You might think tennis would be the 55-year-old's preferred means of staying in shape but she says she avoids it: 'Because my life is saturated with it.' Instead, she tries anything from dancing, to Pilates, to walking in the hills or gardening. What to try: . The V-Sit up. Sit upright on the floor, knees bent and feet flat. Engage your abdominal muscles, keep your back straight and lean back a little (put your palms on the floor to support yourself). Instead, she tries anything from dancing, to Pilates, to walking in the hills or gardening . Keep legs together and lift your feet so your lower legs are parallel to the floor. Start by keeping the knees bent (straighten them for this move as you get stronger), keeping a V shape between your thighs and upper body. Then, make the V shape slightly narrower by bringing your legs higher and the upper body towards them. Lower your legs and upper body a few inches to the wider V - and repeat this narrowing and widening V action 12-15 times.","Judy Murray wore a belted dress-coat to her son Andy's wedding .

"Bayern Munich moved a step closer to a third straight Bundesliga title thanks to a 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Robert Lewandowski boosted his own chances of winning the golden boot award at the end of his first season with Bayern, and a second in a row after finishing the league's top-scorer with Borussia Dortmund last season, by netting two goals in a commanding victory for Pep Guardiola's men. Bayern also had a goal disallowed and they struck the woodwork before Thomas Muller added a third, with few doubts from start to finish that they would pick up all three points once again.

It was downhill all the way for Bayern after Lewandowski gave them the lead after only 15 minutes. Thomas Muller put him in position to shoot, but it took a sweet, unstoppable volley to beat Kevin Trapp into the top left-hand corner. Lewandowski could have had a second goal 10 minutes later, but Trapp reacted well to deny him. Bayern had the ball in the back of the net again shortly before half-time, but after consultation with his linesman, the referee ruled out Muller's effort for offside, even though the ball came to him from an opponent. Bayern were again close to a second on the hour mark when Mario Gotze struck the left-hand post, with the ball rebounding out to safety. The hosts did not have long to wait for their second, though, with Gotze's shot blocked by Makoto Hasebe, but the ball fell kindly for Lewandowski to tuck in for his 16th goal of the season. He is now just three behind Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier. Lewandoski did not complete his hat-trick, but there was a third in the match for Bayern with Muller netting from a tight angle in the 82nd minute, setting the Bavarians up in style for their Champions League quarter-final with Porto in midweek.

"An Ohio couple have filed a major lawsuit against the risque erotic e-book 'A Gronking To Remember', claiming a photo as they were celebrating their engagement was used as the online cover without their permission. The unnamed couple are subsequently suing the novella's author, who released it under the pen name Lacey Noonan, as well as distributors Apple, Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble for allowing readers to buy the work in iBooks, Kindle and Nook digital formats. The fan fiction, which is $2.51 on Kindle, is about a housewife's infatuation with New England Patriots tight end Rob 'Gronk' Gronkowski, who she habitually masturbates over while watching his games. It enjoyed some viral success following its release, which coincided with the Superbowl. Scroll down for video . 'Appropriated image': The couple featured on the cover of A Gronking To Remember, a work of fan fiction about a woman's sexual infatuation with Patriots player Rob 'Gronk' Gronkowski, say the photo of them that appears was used without their permission or without them even knowing . 'Ridicule': The book has been shown as a source of ribald humor on The Tonight Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live, the lawsuit claims . Gronkowski even read out some of the cringeworthy lines during the Patriots press tour, including during an appearance of Jimmy Kimmel Live. One such line is: 'Spike me, Daniel, through the goalposts of life.' Another part reads: 'I’ll never forget the first time I saw Gronk spike a football. The unrivaled power of his touchdown dance: ‘The Gronk.’ It jettisoned jiggling ribbons of electric jelly through my body and melted my knees like two pads of margarine.' However the lawsuit slams the book is distasteful and 'offensive'. 'The use of the plaintiffs' image has held them up to ridicule and embarrassment,' the lawsuit said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. 'This outrageous connection has been further aggravated when the book with the plaintiffs' image has been reproduced in the media nationwide. 'The book has been shown as a source of ribald humor on The Tonight Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live as well as being displayed and read before the press at media day for the Super Bowl.' Source of infatuation: Rob Gronkowski answers questions from reports on April 23 during a visit to the White House after the New Englad Patriots won the Superbowl . The book was self-published by the pseudonymous Noonan, meaning she is likely the one who chose the image for the cover. It is unclear how she came to find the photo in the first place however. A new cover has now started to appear online featuring a different couple. The couple is asking the court to award “any profits derived from and attributable to” the unauthorized use, or $10,000, compensatory damages of $25,000, attorneys fees, court costs, expenses and treble damages, The Boston Globe reported. The case has been transferred to federal court in Ohio.","Ohio couple suing author Lacey Noonan as well as Apple, Amazon and Barnes & Noble .

The riot erupted in February 2012 when supporters of home team Al-Masry - from the canal city of Port Said - and Cairo's Al-Ahly clashed after an Egyptian  league match between the two clubs. An appeals court ordered the retrial of 73 defendants last year after rejecting a lower court's verdict, which sentenced 21 people to death. Scroll down for video .

The clashes in the Port Said stadium (pictured) sparked days of violent protests in Cairo, which led to another 16 deaths . Eleven of the fans were again sentenced to death today, with their verdicts referred to Egypt's supreme court, the Grand Mufti. The court will make a final decision on their fates, as well as those of the other defendants, on May 30. The 73 defendants include nine police officers and three officials from Al-Masry club, while the rest were fans of the team. Two of those sentenced to death are on the run. None of the families of the victims or of the defendants attended today's court session, which was held in Cairo for security reasons.

A year later, dozens of people also died in the canal city during riots which started after the lower court handed down the 21 original death sentences. The football riots were the deadliest ever seen in Egypt, where football fans regularly clash with rival supporters and security forces. The authorities reacted by imposing a ban on fans attending  matches and held games behind closed doors. This year at least 22 people died in a stampede after police fired tear gas at fans trying to force their way into a stadium in Cairo, leading the authorities to suspend the Egyptian league. Television footage showed crowds of supporters squeezed inside a narrow metal enclosure, jostling to enter the stadium when the stampede began as police fired tear gas. The police blame the unrest on Islamists. Sixteen suspects accused of clashing with police on that day have been arrested and will face trial.

'I will throw a lot of punches and I believe I can win every round.’ His master trainer Freddie Roach is equally confident: ‘We’ve wanted this fight every day of our lives together.

This was the scene-stealer by Pacquiao and his promoter Bob Arum after declining to take part in the traditional Grand Arrival of the fighters at the MGM Grand, in which Mayweather would be starring later in the day.

It’s personal for the fans.’ Giant screens in the convention centre showed highlights of some of Pacquiao’s more spectacular victories, to much enthusiasm from the faithful. There is a substantial Filipino community in this region of America - 7,000 in southern Nevada alone - and Pacquiao may well have the greater support in the Grand Garden Arena. The travelling British fight fraternity - the advance guard arrived in time to join the Fan Fest and the Grand Arrival – are split between Money and Manny. Arum effected the introduction of ‘the man you love and who will be victorious on Saturday night.’ Pacquiao shook a hundred hands before he said: ‘Don’t get nervous on Saturday. I’m the one who’s going to win the fight. So relax. It is time for Mayweather to lose. ‘Just be excited. I’m excited. Thank you for your overwhelming support and prayers. I love you guys. God bless.’ The noise was deafening. And there are still four days to go.","Manny Pacquiao made his arrival at the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas .

"They were young men from stable families who believed they were stuck in dead end jobs and looked on with jealousy at the flashy lifestyles of others who had girls, money and fast cars at their fingertips. What Andrew Chan, then aged 21, and Myuran Sukumaran, 24, came to have in common was the belief that smuggling drugs would provide them with a short cut to the life of ease and glamour and - their biggest mistake - that they could get away with it. Thirteen years since their fateful first meeting, after all their legal appeals and pleas for clemency have been rejected, the ringleaders of the infamous Bali Nine, who were caught trying to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin out of Indonesia, are now dead. Scroll down for video . Andrew Chan, pictured aged 21, and Myuran Sukumaran, 24, pictured during their first trial in October of 2005, were both attracted to drug smuggling by the promised riches, after being disillusioned by their jobs . Thirteen years since their fateful first meeting, after all their legal appeals and pleas for clemency have been rejected, the ringleaders of the infamous Bali Nine and their tragic tale will shortly come to an end . Dubbed the masterminds behind the $4 million drug plot from the very beginning, the death penalty has never left the table for Chan and Sukumaran since they were first convicted in 2005 following a tip off from Australian federal police to Indonesian officials. But a glance at their working-class backgrounds would never have led anyone to predict their dismal fate. Chan, the youngest of four children and the son of Chinese immigrants, once described himself as the black sheep of his family. He worked as a supervisor for the catering company Eurest, where he first met Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens and Matthew Norman, who he would later recruit into the drug smuggling roles that landed them in various Indonesian prisons. Sukumaran, a university drop-out and the eldest of three, still lived with his parents while working in a mail room. The Bali Nine trials began in October 2005 at Denpasar district court: Top row (from L-R) Myuran Sukumaran, Andrew Chan and Martin Eric Stephens, 2nd row (from L-R) Chen Si Yi, Tach Duc Thanh Nguyen and Matthew Norman, and 3rd row (from L-R) Scott Rush, Michael Czugaj and Renae Lawrence . Both men, who first met at a party in 2002 despite attending the same Sydney high school, had one thing in common; they were disillusioned by their jobs and had been won over by the riches and lifestyle that selling drugs promised. 'I don't think I was really going anywhere in life. I don't think, you know, I was achieving too much, even though I had a stable job and all… I was a drug user,' Chan told Dateline in a 2010 interview in which Sukumaran also admitted: 'I didn't see myself working in the mail room for the next 50 years of my life'. He continued: 'I thought ""No, I can't do this"", then you see all these people like in night clubs with nice BMWs, and nice Mercedes and there's always chicks there, and they was buying drinks for everyone and you think ""F***"", how do you do this on a mail room salary'. Both men were arrested on April 17 in 2005. Chan was intercepted at Denpasar airport along with Scott Rush, Michael Czugaj, Lawrence and Stephens who had heroin strapped to their stomach and legs, while Sukumaran was found at the Melasti Beach Bungalows hotel on Kuta Beach with Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, Si Yi Chen and Norman. The latter were found with 334g of heroin along with materials for smuggling including Elastoplast, scales and plastic wrap. Both men were arrested on April 17 in 2005.

Pictured: Scott Rush (left and right) with heroin strapped to his stomach and legs after being arrested . Renae Lawrence is pictured being searched by police. The latter group  were found with 334g of heroin along with materials for smuggling including Elastoplast, scales and plastic wrap . It's difficult to imagine the two men, now in their 30s and swearing by their rehabilitation, as the gangster thugs that threatened the lives of their drug mules. Although the Indonesian courts concluded that it could not be proven, Rush and Lawrence both claimed that Chan had threatened their families' lives if they did not follow his orders. Meanwhile prosecutors accused Sukumaran of being uncooperative and having no remorse for his actions, making it all the easier to push for the death penalty. By October, the trials had begun for the Bali Nine at Denpasar district court and within just five months on February 14 in 2006, Chan and Sukumaran were sentenced to death by firing squad. Stephens, Czugaj, Lawrence, Nguyen, Chen, Norman and Rush meanwhile, were given life in prison during trials between February 13 and 15. However by the 17th, all of them had appealed their sentences except Rush, marking the beginning of a long battle with prosecutors as their verdicts wavered between death and life in prison.

Renae Lawrence is the only Bali Nine member who was given a reduced sentence of 20 years, while the other six (Chan and Sukumaran excluded) were sentenced to life in prison. Pictured Nguyen (left) and Rush (right) Finally in 2011, Rush was the last of the smugglers to be sentenced to life in prison along with five others. Renae Lawrence is the only Bali Nine member who was given a reduced sentence of 20 years. All seven are now waiting out their sentences from inside various Indonesian jails scattered around the country. Chan and Sukumaran's death sentence on the other hand, would never budge. An initial appeal of the death penalty was rejected by the Bali high court in April of 2006 at a time when Australia's prime minister at the time, John Howard, refused to interfere. A second attempt, this time requesting for a judicial review in August 2010, were supported by prison officials who attested to their rehabilitation. Chan, covered in tattoos and gold jewellery upon his arrest, had transformed into a devout Christian minister ordained by the Bayside Church in Melbourne. All seven are now waiting out their sentences from inside various Indonesian jails scattered around the country. They fought a long battle with prosecutors as their verdicts wavered between death and life in prison . Several trips: Panel beater turned drug mule Renae Lawrence made two successful trips for Chan from Bali with heroin strapped to her body, but was caught on the third, in April 2005, and sentenced to 20 years . Former Wollongong bartender, Martin Stephens (left) and Sydney catering worker Matthew Norman (right), pictured at Kerobokan Jail, Bali, in 2007, two years after they were duped by Chan who had promised them quick riches by acting as heroin mules in Bali . Skumaran meanwhile, had obtained an Associate Degree in Fine Art from Curtin University in Perth and became known for his haunting paintings. Both organised and ran various classes, including English and art classes, for their fellow inmates and spoke out in media interviews about their lengthy imprisonment and how they reflected on their past with regret. Both judicial review requests were rejected by July 2011, leading the duo to appeal for presidential clemency from Indonesia's then President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in the following year. But a two year long wait amounted to nothing as both men had their pleas reject by Joko Widodo, who was elected in July of 2014 and by December had announced his hard-line stance on drug smugglers. The first four months of 2015 has proved to be a complete nightmare for Chan and Sukumaran and their families. Handcuffed and shackled, Andrew Chan cut a bleak figure as he was transferred from Bali to central Java and a prison cell on 'Death Island' Utter despair was etched on Myuran Sukumaran's face as he was led away to be transferred to Nusakambangan where he is due to face the death penalty . It began with the rejection of their clemency and the announcement that they would be amongst those next executed. In the following months judicial reviews were rejected, legal appeals failed along with appeals against the refusal for clemency and prisoner swaps were refused as the men's lawyers mounted a new case in the constitutional court. The pleas of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and the Grand Mufti of Australia, Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, fell on deaf ears as Mr Widodo repeatedly made his stance on drug smugglers clear - there would be no mercy.","Andrew Chan is the youngest of four children and the son of Chinese immigrants who worked as a supervisor for a catering company .

"Peering into the heart of the Milky Way, astronomers have spotted the 'howls' of dead stars as they feed on stellar companions. These zombie stars are thought to be leaving a 'mass grave' of white dwarf stars near the centre of the Milky Way. But why there are so many of these stars here - which are left behind when a larger star runs out of fuel - remains a mystery. Scroll down for video . The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuStar, has captured a new high-energy X-ray view (magenta) of the bustling center of our Milky Way galaxy. The smaller circle shows the center of our galaxy where the NuStar image was taken . The finding, published in Nature, was made by scientists at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, US using Nasa's NuStar telescope. 'We can see a completely new component of the centre of our galaxy with Nustar's images,' said Kerstin Perez of Columbia University in New York. 'We can't definitively explain the X-ray signal yet - it's a mystery. More work needs to be done.' When a star runs out of fuel it usually collapses in on itself. Stars more than eight times the mass of our sun will explode in a supernova, leaving behind a neutron star or black hole. Smaller stars, though, will shed their outer layers and leave behind a hot dense core – known as a white dwarf. A white dwarf contains a similar amount of mass to its previous star but will be much smaller – about the size of Earth – making gravity at its surface much more intense. They are thought to be able to burn for tens or hundreds of billions of years - at which point they  become black dwarfs – but as the universe is not this old, no black dwarfs exist in the universe yet. When they peered at the Galactic Centre, they found an emission of X-rays that corresponded to thousands of dead stars being present. The emission could also be due to millisecond pulsars - rapidly rotating neutron stars - or dense magnetic fields. 'However, all these interpretations pose significant challenges to our understanding of stellar evolution, binary formation and cosmic-ray production in the Galactic Centre,' the researchers wrote in their paper. The emissions were found to be coming from a region of the Galactic Centre 13 by 26 light-years in size around the central supermassive black hole, called Sagittarius A*. On theory is that when stars die, they don't always go quietly into the night. Unlike stars like our sun, collapsed dead stars that belong to stellar pairs, or binaries, can siphon matter from their companions. This zombie-like 'feeding' process differs depending on the nature of the normal star, but the result may be an eruption of X-rays. But it is the potential for these to be white dwarf stars that is the most intriguing theory. Scientists at Haverford College in Pennsylvania say they have spotted X-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarfs (one illustrated centre) at the galaxy's centre. These are stars left behind after larger ones use up their fuel. But why thousands of these stars are here remains a mystery . There are already known to be many young, massive stars orbiting our galaxy's central supermassive black hole - but why there would be thousands of white dwarf stars as well is not clear. White dwarfs are what are left when medium-mass stars - including our sun - shed their outer layers at the end of their life. Behind is left the hot, dense core which burns white. If the white dwarf gathers too much material from a companion, its mass will reach a critical point and the star will explode. The researchers say the latest finding needs further study to get to the bottom of the mystery. 'This new result just reminds us that the galactic center is a bizarre place,' said co-author Chuck Hailey of Columbia University. 'In the same way people behave differently walking on the street instead of jammed on a crowded rush hour subway, stellar objects exhibit weird behavior when crammed in close quarters near the supermassive black hole.' Shown is the region around the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's Galactic Centre - Sagittarius A* - where the X-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarfs were found. Other possible explanations include millisecond pulsars, which are rapidly rotating neutron stars . Nasa's NuStar telescope (illustrated) is a space-based X-ray telescope that focuses high-energy X-rays from distant astrophysical sources. Its primary goal is to conduct a survey for black holes, but it has also been used for other purposes such as this latest research .","Scientists at Haverford College in Pennsylvania made the finding .

Mrs Clooney is part of a high-profile international legal team representing ousted and jailed Maldivian ex-President Nasheed, who has been sentenced to 13 years in prison . In her remarks Thursday in Washington, Mrs Clooney said she will not rest until Nasheed walks free. The case against the president, who was ousted in 2012 in what has been described by hs supporters as a coup, stemmed from the alleged wrongful detention of a judge by the Maldivian military. The Maldives leader's trial has sparked international concern for the fledgling island democracy after local and foreign human rights activists said the former president's imprisonment was politically motivated. Amnesty International panned the 'sham trial,' and said the verdict was a 'travesty of justice,' according to a press release put out by the National Press Club Thursday. In early April, Nasheed announced a high-profile legal team, including Amal Clooney, will spearhead a fresh attempt to secure his release. In her prepared remarks Thursday in Washington, Mrs Clooney said she will not rest until Nasheed walks free, reported the India's Focus News.

"A 60-stone woman once dubbed 'Britain's fattest teenager' has been dramatically lifted out of her home by a crane during a seven-hour emergency operation to take her to hospital. A number of roads had to be closed in the neighbourhood as firefighters worked to remove Georgia Davis, 22, from her specially-adapted flat in Aberdare, south Wales. At the height of the operation yesterday, neighbours said there were 12 fire, police and ambulance vehicles at the property. Scroll down for video . Georgia Davis, 22 (pictured) has been lifted from her home in Aberdare, south Wales, by a crane during a seven-hour emergency operation to take her to hospital . The young woman has previously had to be removed from another property in 2012. At the height of today's operation, neighbours said there were 12 fire, police and ambulance vehicles at the property . French doors at the front of the property were reportedly removed to allow crews to winch the morbidly obese woman out of her home using the crane. It is the second time Ms Davis has had to be rescued in such a way. An eye-witness, who asked not to be named, told the Daily Mirror: 'It's absolute chaos. There's 999 vehicles everywhere and dozens of emergency service workers. 'All the roads are shut down and parents and school transport can't get to the nearby schools and colleges, it's been complete lock down all day.' Retired Margaret Evans, 79, who also lives on the road, said she believed that Ms Davis fell and was unable to get back up again. She told MailOnline: ‘There was loads of traffic here. They had the crane and they shut all the roads. I don’t think they could get her out of the house. ‘They were here for ages, all afternoon. There were police cars in the middle of the road and no one could get in or out. ‘They tried to get her out and they had to take out the French windows eventually. There were so many people crowded watching. ‘Somebody said she fell, if she did I expect she couldn’t get back up again. ‘It’s not very nice, it was quite a disturbance.’ Ms Evans said she had a stint in hospital at the same time as Ms Davis a few years ago. She said: ‘They had to put three hospital beds together for her and she had her own room. ‘Somebody said she’s 50 stone now. I know she was 30 stone in hospital.’ French doors at the front of the property were reportedly removed to allow crews to lift the young woman out using the crane. Today's operation (left and right) took seven hours . An eye-witness, who asked not to be named, said it was 'absolute chaos'. Several roads had to be closed . Neighbour Janice Love described Ms Davis as a ‘lovely’ person and said she always gives her a wave when she passes her house. She said: ‘I’ve spoken to her a lot of times and she’s so nice. I’ve got daughters that age and it’s so sad. ‘We wave into her through the window and sometimes she stands outside with her dog. She always waves back and is more than happy to chat. ‘She has two friends living with her, one I think is her carer. ‘She’s very quiet. I hope she’s going to be alright. She’s such a lovely person.’ Ms Davis, who has suffered with yo-yo dieting for most of her life, also had to be removed from another property on a crane in 2012. During that incident, a 40-strong team of builders, scaffolders and crew from all three emergency services was involved in the complex operation to remove Ms Davis from her home. As well as knocking down walls, the emergency services were forced to build a temporary ramp from the first floor of the house to the pavement to get her out. Local traffic also had to be diverted. The operation to cut into her home, which came after she telephoned her mother to say she couldn't stand up, cost emergency workers an estimated £100,000.

As well as knocking down walls, the emergency services were forced to build a temporary ramp from the first floor of the house to the pavement to get her out. Local traffic also had to be diverted . After that rescue operation, Ms Davis was admitted to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil where she stayed for several months due to suffering organ failure. While there, she dropped down to 40stone. At the time she vowed to lose more weight and get her life back on track, saying: ‘I'm sick of being like this - I'm getting my life back.’ She went on to lose 18st in four months. Ms Davies, who has suffered from bullying for most of her life, originally started to gain weight when she began comfort eating following the death of her father. But in August 2008, a 33st Ms Davies was told by doctors to 'lose 20 stones or die.' Spurred into action, she attended a £3,600-a-month diet academy in the U.S - dubbed 'Fat Camp' - for nine months, during which time she shrank to 18st and beat her Type 2 diabetes. While at the Wellspring Academy in North Carolina, she was seen by behavioural coaches, food psychologists and fitness trainers and encouraged to walk 10,000 steps every day. But, after returning to the UK in June 2009, she discovered her step-father had cancer. She moved back into her parents' home and started putting on weight again. In less than a year, she had piled on another ten stone.

The 5ft 6in woman admitted how she used to order up to 20 kebabs each week from a takeaway and gorge throughout the day on chocolate, crisps and two litre bottles of Coca Cola. Her mother Lesley has also previously spoken of her guilt over the woman's obesity. In an interview, she said she and her daughter had started comfort eating after her husband Geoff died when Ms Davis was five. But she said she had later made a determined effort to change their diets – such as making her own chips instead of buying them from the takeaway. A spokeswoman for Cwm Taf University Health Board said: 'We can confirm that the fire service was brought in earlier today to assist us with access to a property in order to safely transport a patient into hospital.

"Morgan Schneiderlin says Southampton are refusing to give up on their Champions League aspirations despite Saturday's damaging defeat at Stoke. Saints missed the chance to close the gap on fourth-placed Manchester City to two points as they went down to a 2-1 defeat at the Britannia Stadium. Schneiderlin opened the scoring with his first Barclays Premier League goal since September, but a mistake from Saints goalkeeper Kelvin Davis allowed Mame Diouf to equalise and substitute Charlie Adam stole all three points with six minutes to go. Morgan Schneiderlin fires Southampton into the lead at the Britannia with a close-range finish . Schneiderlin accepts the Europa League is a more realistic goal for Southampton now, but he insists the players still have faint hopes of qualifying for the premier club competition in Europe. 'We wanted to achieve the top four and now it's going to be even more complicated but we're not going to give up,' the midfielder told Southampton's website. 'We wanted to give the fans the most prestigious competition but if not, we want to give them the Europa League. We want to secure European football for this club, that's our main target.' Stoke had struggled to create any decent chances before Davis' misjudgement handed them a way back into the game less than two minutes into the second half. The 38-year-old declined to catch Steven Nzonzi's shot, believing it was going wide. The ball struck the angle and the goalkeeper had no time to respond before Diouf swept in from eight yards. Schneiderlin (left) makes a run as Stoke's Steven Nzonzi gives chase on Saturday . Saints manager Ronald Koeman was loathe to criticise his goalkeeper after the match. 'I call it unlucky,' the Dutchman said. 'I will have to watch it back. I don't know if it was a cross or a shot, and maybe the wind was part of the difficulty for Kelvin.' Saints' demise was complete when substitute Adam nipped the ball away from Sadio Mane in the box and swept a volley past Davis. Mame Biram Diouf swept in from 10 yards as Stoke forced an equaliser in the 47th minute . After scoring a 65-yard wonder goal against Chelsea just a couple of weeks ago, Adam was unhappy at starting the game on the bench, but he thinks he gave his manager the perfect response. 'It's nice to keep scoring and win the game,' the Scot said. 'It was disappointing to be on the bench and I think it was a great way to react by not starting the game.' The win moved Stoke to within four points of their 50-point target for the season. Charlie Adam secured all three points for Stoke as the hit the winner with six minutes remaining . And Adam believes the Potters can make up the one-point gap that separates them from eighth-placed Swansea. He said: 'We're edging nearer to doing better than last season and since the manager came in, our aim is to keep improving year upon year. 'We are a top-10 club and we want to consolidate ourselves in that position, so we want to keep pushing on for the remaining games of the season. 'It will be difficult, but we will keep pushing on and if we can finish in eighth place then we will be very happy.' Ronald Koeman applauds the Saints fans as their dreams of Champions League qualification all but ended .","Southampton went down 2-1 to Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday .

"Southampton manager Ronald Koeman admits Morgan Schneiderlin may have played his last game for the club.

Morgan Schneiderlin may have played his last game for Southampton after damaging knee ligaments . The  French midfielder has been linked with a move to Arsenal and Tottenham this summer . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has admitted that Schneiderlin may leave the club this summer . The Southampton boss said: ‘It’s more difficult (than last year), I understand because I got the possibility as a player to change team and go to a big team, Barcelona, from Holland. ‘We try to keep him for longer, we do everything, but there is a “stop” where we can’t do more and then it’s all about the decision of the player. ‘I don’t know (if he’s played his last game), or about interest or about bids. We would like to keep everybody but sometimes it’s difficult. There aren’t any serious bids for the player. He is happy but it’s up to him.’ While Koeman says that Schneiderlin's season is over, the player himself has not given up on making it back before the end of May. He tweeted: 'Sad about my injury .. I am not giving up on coming back before the end of the season !Thanks to everyone for their support !' Koeman also conceded that he may be forced to consider selling Nathaniel Clyne if the England right back does not sign a new contract within the next 10 days. Manchester United have shown interest in Clyne, who is entering the last year of his deal, and despite the offer to make him one of Saints’ best-paid players, he is stalling on signing. ‘The club is offering the maximum we can,’ Koeman said. ‘In football if you go into your last season of a contract, we don’t like that.’ Koeman also conceded that he may have to consider selling Nathaniel Clyne if he does not sign a new contract .","Morgan Schneiderlin ruled out for rest of the season with ligament damage .

Liris Crosse always dreamed of being a model but had a tough time breaking into the industry with many people telling her to lose weight to succeed - but the size 18 model (US 14) proved them wrong . Liris, who grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, shares her candid journey to the top with FEMAIL, how she proved her doubters wrong and how she's hoping to take the UK by storm. 'I can recall studying all the major fashion magazines as a little girl so I could see Tyra Banks and my model idol, Naomi Campbell,' she said of her earliest fashion memories. 'I watched fashion TV for all the runway shows and obsessed over Naomi Campbell's runway walk. 'I still idolise her poise, body and skin to this day and I practiced in my mother's heels back and forth in the kitchen. I'm honored that the plus fashion world calls me the ""Naomi of Plus"" because she's taught me from afar unknowingly.' Liris, 32,  is now dubbed The Body and The Naomi Campbell of plus - but it wasn't always so simple . Liris' model idol has always been Naomi Campbell, right, who she 'obsessed over' as a young girl and is now compared to by industry bigwigs . When she was starting out, despite being a healthy size 10 (US 6), Liris received rejection after rejection due to her voluptuous shape, but now she stars in regular fashion shoots, pictured . In her junior year of high school, she heard about a casting call in her area for a convention called Model Search America and immediately signed up. She was lucky enough to get callbacks from Zoli Models, Elite Models NY, Michelle Pommier and Seventeen Magazine - but there was a catch. 'They all loved me but wanted me to lose weight,' she said. Despite being a healthy size 10 (US 6), Liris received rejection after rejection due to her voluptuous shape. And even though she chose an east coast giant, Wilhelmina Models, as her mother agency, casting reps still requested that she first lose weight and then come back in six months. Liris has also starred in top videos with Jennifer Lopez, Jay Z and Puff Daddy . Liris is breaking into the UK and appeared in a recent campaign for Sir Philip Green's Evans, and starred in the Goddess Lingerie line through the Eveden brand . Instead of giving into their demands or giving up on what she believed was her calling, Liris, who is 5ft 11in, and now size 18 (US 14), took matters into her own hands and created the vision for them. She became her own agent and utilised the urban market to achieve her dreams with the help of her agency. Liris began to spread like wildfire. Essence, Honey, XXL, The Source and Black Elegance magazines were the first to believe in her vision. With these successes, Glamour, Seventeen and Girl soon caught onto her refreshing image and began requesting Liris for their glossy pages. She booked top videos for the likes of Jennifer Lopez,  Jay Z, Puff Daddy, starred on MTV and landed  film roles. Liris says she wants to change the industry by inspiring women to follow their dreams, helping to represent a different body type other than straight size in mainstream fashion . And now she's starting to break the UK. Liris appeared in a recent campaign for Sir Philip Green's plus-size fashion retailer, Evans, who fell in love with her when she took her runway reign to British Plus Size Fashion Weekend 2014. She has also starred in the Goddess Lingerie line through the Eveden brand. 'I would love to work more in the UK with Evans, Anna Scholz, Yours Clothing, Panache, Elomi, ASOS, Simple Be, Dorothy Perkins, Carma Koma to name a few,' she said. 'I want to continue to change the industry by inspiring women to follow their dreams, helping to represent a different body type other than straight size in mainstream fashion like I have done through my work and to also represent for the black plus woman who feels she doesn't see herself in mainstream fashion and entertainment.' 'I also want to get back more into my acting career because I truly believe a plus woman can be a sexy lead on a TV series... Hey Hollywood, call me! Liris has starred on the glossy covers of plus-size magazines in her time .","Liris Crosse, 32, was rejected due to her 'voluptuous size'

"A former member, Miracle, told Daily Mail Australia abuse victims were often blamed for their situations . As police step up their inquiries into a secretive Christian community following abuse allegations, former members have told of a culture of victim-blaming. Gloriavale, a New Zealand settlement of around 500 where everyone follows a strict New Testament creed and wears blue uniforms, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks. Several ex-members have come forward, telling stories of sexual abuse, violence and bullying - sometimes involving underage girls. Miracle escaped Gloriavale with her family around six years ago. She told Daily Mail Australia that sex outside of marriage and with underage children was 'absolutely frowned upon' and 'dealt with very severely in the community'. 'In saying that, these things have happened. These allegations against certain individuals - there is truth in them. 'Where it's been brought out into the open, the leaders have dealt with it - but where I disagree is that the girls in particular are blamed. Scroll down for video . Gloriavale, a New Zealand settlement of around 500 where everyone follows a strict New Testament creed and wears blue uniforms, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks following abuse allegations . Residents of Gloriavale follow a New Testament code, wear blue uniforms and do not use birth control. This still is from a previous documentary about Gloriavale . Gloriavale is located on the west coast of New Zealand and has an estimated population of around 500 . 'Julia', pictured, told a New Zealand television program she was the victim of a 'wrong relationship' with an adult man when she was a child . 'They have been called w****s and s***s and that sort of thing and almost exonerated the guys. The guys couldn't help it. 'That then causes an effect where the girls don't want to bring it out into the open. They think if I go and say, ""this happened to me"" they'll turn on me and ""blame me"".' Miracle said there had been a few 'one off incidents' - but that 'it's not just the one'. 'Where I disagree is the way it's been dealt with, it's always placed on the girl. 'Women are treated well, they are looked after very well, but there is this doctrine that women submit to the men and do what they are told. '(The men) are brought before meetings and dealt with. They are punished. But not to the same extent the girl would be.' Another former member, Karen Winder, told stuff.co.nz abuse was 'not rampant'. She said young men are 'groomed' to have sex with underage girls and should not shoulder the blame. '(Some think) that 13 and 14 year old girls are ready to have babies - there's no child rape going on,' Ms Winder was quoted saying. 'A 23-year-old is not necessarily culpable for his actions, because he's been groomed for it.' She reportedly added that she knew of a female member who had been involved with an older man when she was 15. There has been an exodus from Gloriavale (located on the picturesque banks of Lake Haupiri) in recent years . Another escapee, Julia, told the Campbell Live program earlier this month that she had a 'wrong relationship with a married guy when she was 12 or 13' - and he was a decade older. Gloriavale responded to recent allegations in an interview with TVNZ this week. 'There have been serious allegations but it doesn't mean they're all true,' said a spokesman. He would not discuss the particulars. Police reportedly made a 'social call' to the town this week and are urging anyone with evidence of abuse to come forward. Miracle said Gloriavale needs to open itself up the outside world. 'These things are starting to happen more and more frequently because of their closing off,' she said. There has been a mass exodus from Gloriavale over the past two years, most recently including a family of 14 in March. They, and other families are now living  some 350km south-west of Gloriavale.

"Rapper 50 Cent may have publicly criticised the crude manner Adrien Broner chose to rejection a contract offer by fledgling boxing promoter Jay Z but there doesn't appear to be any hard feelings. Former world champion Broner is pictured with New York-based 50 Cent in an Instagram happy snap on Tuesday that was taken at the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn on Saturday night. The pair, with Broner wearing a bright shirt and giant jewellery bearing his initials and 50 Cent in all dark with a New York Yankees cap, were watching the Premier Boxing Champions primetime TV event featuring Danny Garcia Swift and Lamont Peterson and Irish Andy Lee against Peter Quillan. Adrien Broner sports a bright shirt and bling with his own initials in this Instagram shot with 50 Cent . Danny Garcia won a controversial majority decision over Lamont Peterson before being called out by Broner . Garcia puts Peterson on his back briefly in the 11th round of their Premier Boxing Champions bout . Broner called Garcia out, again on Instagram, for a September fight after 'Swift' kept his unbeaten record in tact with a win over Peterson with a controversial majority decision . 'Great fight Garcia and Lamont,' Broner wrote. 'I'm happy nobody got severely hurt I got love for both fighters but Lamont is closer to me so I was going for him. 'Now I got all that out the way this is my message to my friend my homie Danny Garcia heal up well and get back in the gym and fight me in September in Vegas at the MGM GRAND.

Broner throws an uppercut at John Molina Jnr during their fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in March . Broner has his arm raised after comfortably beating Molina Jnr on points in Las Vegas . Broner, a huge admirer of Floyd 'Money' Mayweather, recently stirred up controversy when he called a $40million contract offer from Jay Z and his Roc Nation 'bull****'. 50 Cent said Broner was disrespectful of Jay Z and should have accepted the offer. 'That wasn't a good idea to say that. 40 million, he should take it,' 50 Cent told TMZ. Broner had told TMS Sports he didn't appreciate receiving the offer via email: 'The capacity of the contract was $40 million for five years, that's just bull****… Like I wanted to tell him, and hopefully this get to him, stop sending your workers to come talk to me.

"Arsenal are only three signings away from winning the title and should start by pinching Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, according to former Gunners midfielder Ray Parlour. Cech is likely to be watching from the substitutes bench when Arsenal face Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, having made only four league starts this season. Jose Mourinho's men are 10 points clear going into the game this weekend but Parlour believes signing Cech in the summer can help Arsenal overcome the Blues next year. Ray Parlour believes Arsenal moving for Petr Cech this summer would be a 'no brainer' The experienced keepers has made just four league starts this season for the Blues . 'Cech would definitely be on my radar if I was Arsene Wenger,' said Parlour, who was speaking at the Boot Camp stage of The People's Pundit, championed by Carlsberg - the Official Beer of the England team and the Premier League. 'Cech has got that experience, he's played in big games and he's only 33 so he's got plenty of years left in him. 'Wojciech Szczesny wants to play on a regular basis and you could still get good money for him, someone will buy him for around £6million. 'So it's a no-brainer really. If you can get Cech for around £10m and sell Szcezsny for £6m, it's a great deal for Arsenal. 'The question is will Chelsea sell to a rival? I'm not sure they will.' Arsenal can make it nine consecutive league victories with a win on Sunday and the team's strong finish to the campaign has given Gunners fans hope for a more sustained title challenge next year. 'The summer window will be very important to what happens next season,' Parlour said. Cech (left) has had to play second fiddle to Thibaut Courtois (right) all season . 'The spine of the team needs strengthening - I think they need a centre half, a central midfielder and a goalkeeper. 'Alexis Sanchez has had a brilliant season, he's set the bar so high so early in his career that when he dropped off, it seemed like it wasn't the Sanchez we know. 'He has been amazing this season. If Arsene Wenger can get two or three players of his calibre this summer, there's no reason why Arsenal can't win the league next year.' Wenger has not come out on top against Mourinho in 12 attempts and a win this weekend would be particularly welcome for the Frenchman as Arsenal look to cement second place. Chelsea ground out a 1-0 victory against Manchester United last time out and Parlour expects the league leaders to be resolute again on Sunday. Parlour believes the Gunners should sell Wojciech Szczesny in order to sign Cech this summer . 'A draw is a perfect result for Chelsea,' Parlour said. 'They'll look to defend well and put in a solid performance so it's up to Arsenal to ask questions. 'With the pace they've got, Arsenal can test Chelsea's back four. 'John Terry has been brilliant this year but he does sit off a bit deeper now to allow for his lack of pace and that might give more space in midfield. 'Arsene will look at getting Sanchez into those spaces and perhaps Theo Walcott will start as well. 'It's a big, big game for Arsenal. Chelsea will win the league but there's still a battle for second, third and fourth so it's a bigger game for Arsenal than it is for Chelsea.' :: The People's Pundit has narrowed down its search to five football fans in with a chance of winning their big break on talkSPORT on the last day of the Barclays Premier League season. To vote for your favourite and find out which will win their big break on talkSPORT, head to ThePeoplesPundit.co.uk £PeoplesPundit.

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce says he would have no problem with sneaking through the ‘back door’ into European football via the Fair Play League. The Hammers started the season strongly and looked a good bet for European qualification around Christmas before their form fell away, with a mid-table finish now all-but certain. But a reprieve could be granted by the Fair Play League, with Allardyce’s side topping the Barclays Premier League table for their good behaviour, just ahead of Burnley. If West Ham finish top of the pile and England’s top flight is within the top three ‘fair-playing’ leagues in Europe – which it was on last count - they will earn a Europa League place. Sam Allardyce's West Ham are top of the Premier League Fair Play table, sitting just above Burnley . The Hammers have won once in their last 10 league matches and drew 1-1 against Stoke in their last match . Where do the English teams stand? 1. West Ham . 2. Burnley . 3. Liverpool . 4. Manchester City . 5. Southampton . Qualification via Fair Play would see the Hammers enter the competition at the first qualifying round, playing their first game on July 2 and competing in up to six games before the Premier League season even starts. But Allardyce, who takes his charges to face champions Manchester City on Sunday, just wants to qualify and doesn’t care how he does it, or when the season restarts. ‘It’s a headache but you’ve got to take the opportunity if it arises,’ he said. ‘It might be seen as the back door, (but) it’s an opportunity to play in Europe. ‘I think every player wants, not come back that bit earlier, but certainly to play in Europe because this club hasn’t been in that position to play in Europe for a long time.’ Allardyce’s Upton Park future hangs in the balance with his contract expiring in the summer and a section of fans demanding he is replaced at the end of the season, but he has already been involved in meetings concerning pre-season plans. Allardyce is out of contract at West Ham in the summer which leaves his managerial future in the balance . ‘The difficulty is the fact that we don’t know when, yet, whether we’re going to finish in that spot,’ he said. ‘And so we’ve already planned for either. One in it and one out of it, and obviously if we’re in it we’re back earlier, a few days earlier. If we’re out of it (the Europa League) we come back on July 1, which is one of the smallest close seasons we’ve had in a long time. ‘And even then international players won’t be back on that date, either earlier or on the first of July because they won’t be finished international duties until the middle of June.’ Aaron Cresswell (left) and Mark Noble (right) could be playing Europa League football next season . Conceding late goals in games to drop points has been a trend for West Ham of late, topped off by Mark Arnautovic’s 95th-minute equaliser for Stoke City at Upton Park on Saturday. Allardyce hopes that run of misfortune will end at the Etihad Stadium. ‘It’s been a terrible thing for our results in terms of points to performances in general,’ he said. ‘We’ve got to make sure that we focus and if we’re in that position again (leading late on), don’t show the type of nerves we showed last week. ‘I think we got exceedingly nervous in the last few minutes and made basic mistakes which kept allowing a bit of pressure and Stoke took advantage of it.’","Sam Allardyce's West Ham are top of the Premier League Fair Play table .

"Last year it was 'Dare to Zlatan' and 12 months on it seems to be 'Search Zlatan,' following the launch of a brand new website. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has made the headlines throughout his trophy-laden career but it appears a novel way has been created to find any information purely about the maverick 32-year-old striker. Search engine zlaaatan.com has immortalised the Paris Saint-Germain forward with the site totally devoted to the French giants' No 10. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had a search engine website created in his honour called zlaaatan.com . The website has an identical  style to Google with users given the option to 'Zlatan Search' or 'I'm feeling Zlatan' In a house style that is identical to Google, and operates just like the search engine, users have the option to 'Zlatan Search' or 'I'm feeling Zlatan.' The click of the former button takes users to articles about Ibrahimovic on Google, while the latter directs them to his Wikipedia page. In addition any results from the search bar will automatically add 'Zlatan' to the front - meaning he will forever be at the forefront of the news. It must be said though that website is neither affiliated with Ibrahimovic nor Google. The website though has no affliation with the Paris Saint-Germain No 10 (left) nor Google . Creative director of  SweetPop, the agency that came up with the website idea, Andreas Killander hopes the search engine will bring a smile to the Sweden international. 'We didn't ask his permission, but we hope he sees it as an amusing experience,' he said. 'Our search engine is linked to Google but all the searches are Zlatanified. All the results have some link to Zlatan... if you type in Ferrari, you'll get stuff about Zlatan's Ferrari; if you want a recipe, you'll get the Zlatan Burger. 'Zlatan is an idol. He's known the world over. That's why we chose him.' SweetPop, the agency that came up with the website idea, hope that Ibrahimovic (left) will find it amusing . As memorable as he can be with his feet, Zlatan Ibrahimovic can also do likewise with his tongue. Sportsmail reminds you of 10 of the Sweden international's best quotes. 'In my head I am the strongest of all. I certainly don't need the Ballon d'Or to prove that I am number one.' Ibrahimovic may not have been named on the shortlist for the 2012 Ballon d'Or award, but it clearly didn't affect the striker's confidence in his own ability. 'A World Cup without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the World Cup.' Ibrahimovic came up against Cristiano Ronaldo in the play-off to reach the World Cup in Brazil last summer, but it was Sweden that were on the losing side and the PSG forward let everyone know there wasn't much point in watching a tournament that didn't feature himself. 'I couldn’t believe it. I was like ""No way, Zlatan doesn’t do auditions"".' Arsene Wenger revealed that he came close to signing Ibrahimovic when he was a fresh-faced 16-year-old but he refused to have a trial at the north London club. 'Nothing. She already has Zlatan.' As any man will attest to, buying a gift for your loved one can be a difficult task. Not for Ibrahimovic though, who admits his wife needs nothing else for her birthday when she already has Zlatan. 'Well, I don’t know. You’ll have to ask your wife about that.' As a member of the media you have to remember to choose your questions carefully when interviewing Ibrahimovic. This reporter wasn't, and asked the striker how he got the scars on his face. 'What Carew does with a football, I can do with an orange.' Ibrahimovic didn't take too kindly to criticism from Scandinavian counterpart and former Aston Villa and West Ham striker John Carew. 'Come to my house and you'll see if I'm gay, and bring your sister.' During his spell at Barcelona a picture emerged of Ibrahimovic getting rather close to team-mate Gerard Pique but the Sweden international strongly refuted suggestions he was gay, particularly when they were voiced by one female reporter. 'It was the fault of David Trezeguet, who made me do one drink of vodka after another. I slept in the bathtub. Now I hold my vodka much better.' Ibrahimovic tried to pass the blame to former Juventus team-mate David Trezeguet after reports of excessive behaviour following the club's Serie A title success. 'I like fireworks too, but I set them off in gardens or kebab stands. I never set fire to my own house.' After Mario Balotelli, a former team-mate of Ibrahimovic's at Inter Milan, set fire to his bathroom when he let fireworks of out the window, the PSG hitman admitted his like for fireworks. 'You bought a Ferrari but you drive it like a Fiat.' Ibrahimovic's short and tumultuous stint in La Liga with Barcelona was riddled with arguments and falling outs, particularly with manager Pep Guardiola and the 33-year-old was not happy with his role in the team.","zlaaatan.com was created in dedicated to Zlatan Ibrahimovic .

"The Scottish Football Association have failed in their to have the punishment handed to Rangers goalkeeper Steve Simonsen for breaching betting laws increased. The 35-year-old served a one-game ban after he admitted breaking the SFA's zero-tolerance gambling rules by betting on a total of 50 games in a year. But SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan challenged that decision, claiming his punishment was 'unduly lenient'. The Scottish FA have failed in their attempt to further punish Rangers' goalkeeper Steve Simonsen for betting . However, Simonsen's legal team from the ProLegal group have confirmed the Englishman will not face a further suspension after the SFA's appeal was rejected by an appellate tribunal. They tweeted: 'SFA Appeal against Steve Simonsen suspension fails.' Simonsen had not bet on any games relating to his club's competitions and was given a one-match ban with another suspended when an SFA-convened judicial panel convened on February 12. He missed the club's February 13 clash with Hibernian but has not played since after dropping down Gers' goalkeeping pecking order. Previous judicial panels have issued more severe punishments for betting offences, but they have involved players betting on games in which they were involved. In September 2013, Simonsen's Ibrox team-mate Ian Black was handed a 10-game ban - seven of which were suspended - and a £7,500 fine after admitted to placing 160 football bets over a seven-year period. Three of the matches involved bets placed against the former Hearts and Inverness midfielder's own team, which included a gamble that Rangers would draw against East Stirlingshire. Black scored the third goal in his side's 4-2 win, a result that scuppered his own accumulator. Five months later, Ayr United frontman Michael Moffat was given a four-game ban - with another two suspended - after he was found guilty of placing seven bets on six matches involving his own team. Moffat, who avoided a fine, was also found guilty of placing an additional 150 bets on other games. Simonsen placed bets on a total of 50 games over the course of a year and served a one-match ban .","The Scottish FA have failed in their attempt to have the punishment handed to Rangers' Steve Simonsen for betting increased .

"Officers who rushed to the scene of the Colorado theater shooting entered a hellish world of bloody victims, noxious smells and blaring sounds - a gloomy darkness pierced by bright flashes from a fire alarm, police testified Wednesday. 'It was dim, the movie was still playing, the alarm was going off,' Aurora police officer Annette Brook told jurors in the trial of gunman James Holmes. 'I began to notice the bodies, the live victims, the blood.' Prosecutors called Brook and two other officers as witnesses on Wednesday, and their descriptions of the chaos of inside the suburban Denver theater intensified the already disturbing scene described a day earlier by moviegoers who were badly wounded or saw loved ones gunned down in the July 20, 2012, attack. Scroll down for video . The third day of the trial against suspected Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes continued on Wednesday. If convicted, Holmes could be sentenced to death. Pictured above in court on Monday, far left . Twelve people were killed and 70 hurt when Holmes allegedly opened fire on a packed theater in Aurora, Colorado for a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises in July 2012. Above, the scene of the theater after the shooting . Twelve people died and 70 were wounded. Holmes is charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. He admits he was the shooter, his defense attorneys say, but schizophrenia had taken control of his mind and compelled him to kill. His lawyers are asking the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity, which would send him to the state mental hospital indefinitely. Prosecutors argue Holmes was sane and fully aware that what he was doing was wrong. They want the jury to convict him and sentence him to die. Holmes' defense attorneys want the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors say Holmes knew what he was doing, however. On the left, a sketch of Holmes in court on Monday and and 2012 mugshot on the right . In the opening days of the trial, prosecutors have appeared intent on planting a deeply upsetting image in the jurors' minds. 'It smelled very, very bad,' officer Tomas Campagna testified Wednesday, describing the mixed odors of blood, sweat, urine and feces. 'It's hard to imagine unless you've been there.' Spent cartridges and casings from a shotgun, a rifle and a handgun littered the ground, so thick that officers couldn't avoid stepping on them, Campagna said. In places, the floor looked like it had been painted in blood, he said. Cellphones left behind by the victims rang far into the night. More victims testified Wednesday, describing the booms and the brilliant flashes of light that burst from the muzzles of the weapons aimed at them and the hot pain of being shot. One of those victims was Joshua Nowlan, a former member of the military who worked on aircraft carriers. He went to the movie, 'The Dark Knight Rises,' at the Century 16 multiplex in the Denver suburb of Aurora with friends who had just returned from their honeymoon in Florida. About 15 or 20 minutes into the film, a tear gas canister was thrown into the theater, and then the shooting started. Nowlan, who shielded his friends from the bullets, was shot twice and has undergone multiple surgeries. He used the cane he now needs to walk to show jurors what he saw next. 'I assumed it had to be the shooter, from his stance ... He was walking around, and I can see him pointing the gun in a circular motion that looked like he was searching for more people ... I was terribly scared,' Nowlan told the court. 'My thought process was that he was searching for other people and that he was going to start going row by row, and that anybody he would see in that row who was still moving, he would shoot.' He described the shooter firing three-round bursts. Asked if the gunman moved fast or methodically, Nowlan said: 'He was definitely moving slowly.' None of the victims said they saw Holmes' face, but one of the police officers did. Sgt. Spc. Gerald Jonsgaard testified he saw Holmes lying on the ground in the parking lot outside the theater as two officers arrested him. Jonsgaard didn't identify Holmes by name Wednesday but said he was sitting at the defense table. Holmes' lawyers have not cross-examined any prosecution witnesses. They will call their own witnesses after the prosecution rests.","Victims of the 2012 Colorado movie theater shooting testified in court on Wednesday as the trial of suspect James Holmes continued .

"Microsoft hopes to lure more people to use its new Windows 10 software by making it easy to use many of the same apps they're already using on Apple or Android phones. The move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps. The company said at its annual Build conference on Wednesday that it will release new programming tools for software developers to rapidly adapt their Apple and Android apps to run on devices that use the new Windows 10 operating system coming late this year. Scroll down for video . Microsoft hopes to lure more people to use its new Windows 10 software by making it easy to use many of the same apps they're already using on Apple or Android phones. Pictured:  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers his keynote address at Microsoft Build in San Francisco, . New operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'. Various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. Users can create multiple desktops to keep things organised. Microsoft also announced a new name for the web browser that it plans to offer with Windows 10. The company promises its new 'Edge' browser is faster and more useful than the Internet Explorer that Microsoft has offered for the last 20 years. The tech giant is making its case for Windows 10 before an army of software developers who may be crucial allies in its campaign to build enthusiasm among consumers for the next version of Microsoft's flagship operating system, coming later this year. 'Our goal is to make Windows 10 the most attractive development platform ever,' Microsoft executive Terry Myerson told an audience of several thousand programmers and app developers. While Microsoft has already previewed some aspects of the new Windows, a parade of top executives is using the Build conference to demonstrate more software features and app-building tools, with an emphasis on mobile devices as well as PCs. Ultimately, they're hoping to win over people who have turned to smartphones and tablets that run on rival operating systems from Google and Apple. During the three-day conference, Microsoft is also expected to show off new Windows smartphones or other devices and reveal more details about such tech initiatives as the company's new Spartan web browser; its Siri-like digital assistant known as Cortana; and the HoloLens, a futuristic 'augmented reality' headset that projects three-dimensional images in a wearer's field of vision. But perhaps most importantly, this year's conference is an opportunity for Microsoft to persuade an audience of more than 5,000 techies and independent programmers that it's worth their time to create new apps and programs for Windows 10. Experts say Microsoft needs a rich variety of apps if it wants to appeal to people who are increasingly using mobile gadgets instead of personal computers. A woman wearing a HoloLens demonstrates how the technology can be used to test and develop robotics at the Microsoft Build conference in San Francisco. Internet Explorer, which was first called Windows Internet Explorer, was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 in 1995. Internet Explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers, attaining a peak of about 95 per cent during 2002 and 2003. However, it struggled in the face of competition, and in May 2012 it was announced that Google's Chrome overtook Internet Explorer as the most used browser worldwide. The brand has struggled to shake off the bad reputation of Internet Explorer 6, which was notoriously insecure. 'Getting developer buy-in is absolutely the crucial thing,' said J.P. Gownder, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. He said Microsoft has struggled with a 'chicken-and-egg' problem, in which developers have been reluctant to build mobile apps for Windows because relatively few people use Windows phones and tablets. Microsoft hopes it has solved that problem by designing Windows 10 so it's easier for developers to build 'universal' apps that work on a variety of Windows devices, from phones to PCs and other gadgets, Gownder said. Currently, there are more than 1.4 million apps for Android phones and about the same for Apple devices, while there are only a few hundred thousand apps that work on Windows phones and tablets. The company also has a big carrot to wave in front of those developers: Microsoft has already said it will release Windows 10 as a free upgrade to people who now have PCs or other gadgets running the previous two versions of Windows, provided they upgrade in the coming year. The offer could create a huge new audience of Windows 10 users in a relatively short time, Gownder said. Myerson predicted there will be a billion devices using Windows 10 - from PCs to phones, tablets, gaming consoles and even holographic computers - within the next two to three years. Microsoft has not said exactly when Windows 10 is coming, and some analysts are hoping the company will announce a release date at the conference, along with details about how it will distribute future upgrades. CEO Satya Nadella and other executives have hinted they'd like to move away from the old notion of selling each new version of Windows as a separate product. Microsoft's had early success in selling its Office productivity software on a subscription basis, in which customers pay an annual fee to use programs like Word, PowerPoint and Excel. A man demonstrates a device using Windows holographic technology during the Microsoft Build conference . Nadella is presiding over a major overhaul of a company that once dominated the tech industry, in the days when PCs were king. He has redesigned some of Microsoft's most popular programs for mobile devices and invested in new 'cloud-computing' services, in which businesses pay to use software that's housed in Microsoft's data centers. Microsoft still relies heavily on selling traditional software for PCs and corporate computer systems. But its latest quarterly earnings report, issued last week, offered some signs that the decline in that business is slowing, while Microsoft's cloud-computing business is growing rapidly. The news drove Microsoft's share price up 10 percent in one day. The stock has continued to rose, trading as high as $49.13 on Wednesday - within a dollar of its 52-week high.","New programming tools can rapidly adapt Apple and Android apps .

"A search for a sewage pipe beneath an Italian restaurant yielded two centuries worth of history. Lucian Faggiano bought the building in Lecce, Puglia in the south of Italy and had planned to turn it into a trattoria - but renovations were put on hold when he discovered a toilet on the site was blocked. And while attempting to fix the toilet he dug into a Messapian tomb built 2,000 years ago, a Roman granary, a Franciscan chapel, and even etchings thought to be made by the Knights Templar. Scroll down for 3D tour . Lucian Faggiano's dream of opening a restaurant was scuppered when a dig to find a blocked sewage point yielded some 2,000 years of hidden history, including vast rooms and pottery (shown in this image that features Mr Faggiano left and his son) In a bid to stop the sewage backing up, Mr Faggiano, 60, and his two sons dug a trench and instead of isolating the offending pipe found underground corridors and rooms beneath the property on 56 Via Ascanio Grandi,The New York Times reported. The search for the pipe began at the turn of the millennium. Lecce, at the heel of Italy’s ‘boot’ was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and an important trading post for the Romans. But the first layers of the city date to the time of Homer, according to local historian Mario De Marco. Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the building has been turned into Museum Faggiano (pictured) and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers discovered by the family . He imagined it would take a week to dig down and fix the plumbing beneath the building, but instead, the DIY mission led to the discovery of a Messapian tomb, a Roman granary (pictured left), a Franciscan chapel - and even etchings from the Knights Templar. An ancient room beneath the modern building is shown right . The search for the pipe (shown in this image of Mr Faggiano and his son) began at the turn of the millennium when no-one could have predicted the treasures hidden beneath the floorboards, which revealed a subterranean world dating back to before the birth of Jesus . It is not unusual for religious relics to turn up in fields or in the middle of the city itself, which has a mixture of old architecture . For example, a century ago, a Roman amphitheatre was recently found beneath a marble column bearing the statue of Lecce’s patron saint, Orontius in the main square and recently a Roman temple was found under a car park. ‘Whenever you dig a hole, centuries of history come out,’ said Severo Martini, a member of the City Council. Years of excavations have seen the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Here, Mr Faggiano carries a piece of Roman pottery from an underground room . The building yielded plenty of nooks and crannies including mysterious shafts (pictured left and right) which lead to older parts of the building deeper and deeper underground . Lucian Faggiano bought the seemingly standard building in Lecce, Puglia in the south of Italy, (marked on this map) but his dream of turning it into a trattoria was put on hold thanks to a broken toilet. Lecce, at the heel of Italy’s ‘boot’ was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and a trading post for the Romans . The origins of Lecce in southern Italy are thought to be more than 2,000 years old. It was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, explaining the city's Greek culture. According to legend, a city called Sybar existed at the time of the Trojan War and was founded by the Messapii. It was conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, who gave it the name Lupiae, which later became Lecce. Under the emperor Hadrian, in the second century AD, the city moved two miles (3km) northeast, got a theatre and an amphitheatre and was connected to the Hadrian Port. Oronotius of Lecce, who is known as Sant'Oronzo is thought to have served as the city's first Christian bishop and is now Lecce's patron saint. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city was sacked by king Totila in the Gothic Wars. After that it was conquered once again by the Byzantines in 549 and remained part of the Eastern Empire despite some small conquests. After the Normans arrived in the 11th century, Lecce grew in commercial importance again, having been an important trading post in Roman times. It grew rich and became one of the most important cities in southern Italy, evidenced by its many impressive Baroque monuments. Plague broke out in the 17th century and the city was briefly home to Allied fighters fighting the Nazis in the Second World War. Mr Faggiano asked his sons to help fix the problem with the plumbing so he could accelerate the opening of his restaurant, in a building that looked like it was modernised. But when they dug down they hit a floor of medieval stone, beneath which was a Messapian tomb, built by people who lived in the area before the birth of Jesus. Legend has it the city was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, but then the settlement was called Sybar. Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain, and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife, in part perhaps because he was lowering his youngest son, Davide, 12 though small gaps in the floor to aid his work. But his wife, Anna Maria Sanò suspected the work was more complex than it appeared thanks to the amount of dirty clothes she was washing, and because of dirt and debris being taken away. Investigators shut down the site, warning Mr Faggiano he was conducting an unofficial archaeological dig. After a year, work continued but had to be overseen by heritage officials who witnessed the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Retired cultural heritage official, Giovanni Giangreco, who was involved with the excavation, said: ‘The Faggiano house has layers that are representative of almost all of the city’s history, from the Messapians to the Romans, from the medieval to the Byzantine time.’ Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife. Here, he sorts though pieces of glass and pottery found in one of the rooms. There are even pieces embedded in the wall . Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. The cavernous property has been turned into a museum so visitors can easily see the remains (pictured) Mr Faggiano (pictured here with his son in an ancient underground room) admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant . Despite bearing the financial load of the dig, the family became fascinated about the history beneath their building and made ends meet by renting rooms in it. Mr Faggiano admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant. He said: ‘At one point, I couldn’t take it anymore I bought cinder blocks and was going to cover it up and pretend it had never happened.’ Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the incredible building has been turned into Museum Faggiano and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers. However, Mr Faggiano hasn’t given up on his culinary dream and is planning on opening a restaurant at a less complex location – even though he finally found the troublesome sewage pipe.

"Sweeping is a tedious task but now a new ‘smart bin’ could help save you from all that bending down with a dust pan. The Bruno Smartcan is said to be the first internet connected combined kitchen bin and vacuum cleaner. Using sensors on the front of the bin, it is able to sense when dust and debris from the kitchen floor is swept towards it with a brush, turning on a vacuum to suck up the offending mess. The Bruno Smartcan (pictured) uses sensors to detect when you want the lid to open or when dirt has been swept close so it can activate its integrated vacuum. It also has an integrated bag store and charging cord . Bruno comes with an integrated bag dispenser that additionally sends alerts to a smartphone when the owner is getting low on bags, and it can send reminders when it is time to take out the rubbish. Developed by inventors Jim Howard and Lori Montag, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, the bin is able to clean up dog hair and spilt breakfast cereal and crumbs, sucking it up directly into the bin bag. It is the perfect invention for the house proud - a substance that means clothes will never stain, glass will not mist and kitchen surfaces automatically shed their germs. Scientists  have developed a ‘self-cleaning’ coating that can be sprayed  onto materials. The substance, made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles, works because it is very, very water resistant. Any moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away, cleaning up dust in its path. The breakthrough, by chemists at University College London, comes after years of research into highly water-resistant - or ‘superhydrophobic’ - substances. It also features a motion sensitive hands-free lid that opens automatically. The inventors said: ‘Bruno and its patents pending technologies have been many months in the making. ‘The powerful vortex vacuum feature will deliver every dog hair, cheerio and grain of dirt directly into the trash bag. ‘No more stopping, no more scooping, just place the broom in front of the vacuum inlet to start the suction and Bruno will do the rest. ‘Bruno will also remind you to take the trash out on trash day, and alert you when you are low on Bruno Bags.’ The pair is hoping to attract support for their invention on Kickstarter. They said the Bruno ‘smartcan’ can run for 30 days on its battery before needing to be recharged. Dust swept close to the base of the Bruno Smartcan activates the vacuum, which sucks it directly into the bin. The vacuum  is powerful enough so suck up spilt breakfast cereal, dust and hair, while its integrated bag dispenser knows when you need to buy new bags . An extendable recharging cord is built into a flip up section just behind the main lid. Users can buy custom-fitted bags for the Bruno, which fit into its dispenser, or use standard bin bags. The bin has a capacity of 59 litres (13 gallons). It is expected to cost $248 (£160), although early buyers can pre-order it for $139 (£90). The Bruno bin comes in five colours including white (above) and will last for 30 days on a single charge .","Bruno Smartcan is world's first internet connected vacuum and rubbish bin .

"The Avengers have battled to save Earth from an alien invasion, the evil Loki and now, in the latest movie, face off against the killing machine Ultron. They do this, of course, with the help of numerous superpowers - including Iron Man’s suit, super-healing abilities and Captain America’s indestructible shield. But just how scientifically sound are some of these powers, and do any of them hold up to the laws of physics and chemistry as we know them? Scroll down for video . The American Chemical Society in Washington explained the science behind the Avengers in a video. It looks at the composition of Iron Man's suit - said to be a gold-titanium alloy in one of the movies - and Captain America's shield. The video also explains the science behind super-healing abilities . In a video for Reactions, the American Chemical Society took a look at the science of Marvel's Avengers. It begins looking at Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man when he dons his iron suit of armour. His original suit, made only of iron, would have weighed around 70kg (150lbs) according to the ACS - not very comfortable or easy to move around in. He later upgrades it to a gold-titanium alloy, but that would actually make things worse explained the video. ‘That suit would probably weigh around 160kg (350lbs), which might work for the Hulk but not for Tony Stark,’ said the narrator. However, Dr Raychelle Burks continued that it is later made of a nickel-titanium alloy called nitinol. This is ‘strong but light, and can be reformed after taking damage,’ she said. ‘There may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre, which can take a lot of heat - useful if Iron Man doesn’t want to singe his feet using those rocket boots.’ Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man when he dons his iron suit of armour and played by Robert Downey Jnr (pictured), made his original suit out of iron. He later upgrades it to a gold-titanium alloy, but according to the ACS that would be heavy and uncomfortable - perhaps better for the Hulk than Iron Man himself . None of this would work, though, without Stark’s own portable nuclear power station - the Arc Reactor. In Iron Man 2 this uses palladium - but we soon learn this is poisoning and killing the character. So instead, he creates a new element - and Dr Burks said this might not be as far-fetched as it seems. He uses his own particle accelerator to smash the nuclei of atoms together and make a new type of atom, which is not entirely dissimilar to the experiments taking place at real-life accelerators such as Cern. ‘Scientists have made 20 synthetic elements this way, so it’s not unbelievable that Stark would have made new elements to power his suit,’ said Dr Burks. The main skeleton of Raytheon;s exoskeleton, shown, is made from high-strength aluminium and steel, and weighs about 95kg (209lb) Iron Man’s superpowers don’t stem from a radioactive spider bite or exposure to gamma rays; they are simply the result of some very clever engineering - and quite a bit of money too. It makes sense then that we should try to replicate his powerful suit, and some companies are already coming incredibly close. Raytheon, an American defence contractor, has developed a super-strong robotic exoskeleton for the US Army. Soldiers can simply strap into the suit and its high-pressure hydraulic system will enhance their strength, agility and endurance, enabling them to be extremely physically active without risk of exhaustion or injury. The current version must be tethered to its power source, an internal combustion hydraulics engine, but an untethered version is expected to be operational by 2020. It’s not just the military that can benefit from exoskeletons, though, as Lockheed Martin has also designed a suit specifically to help workers operate heavy machinery. The Fortis helps to carry the weight of tools, enabling the operator to work for longer between breaks required to recover from muscle fatigue. Source: How It Works issue 72, 'Real-life superpowers' Tony Stark's suit is powered by his famous Arc Reactor, but in Iron Man 2, we learn that its palladium fuel source is slowly killing him. So instead, Stark creates a new element - and this might not be as far-fetched as it seems as it follows somewhat similar principles to those taking place at Cern . Stark isn’t the only one with super-human abilities, though. Both Captain America and Black Widow have super strength, quick reflexes - and, most interestingly - the ability to heal quickly. ‘In normal healing, a type of white blood cell called a macrophage fights infections and oversees the repair process,’ explains Dr Burks. While this can take two to five days in regular humans, the macrophages of Captain American and Black Widow appear to be super productive, helping them heal even more quickly. Both Captain America (left) and Black Widow (right) have super strength and quick reflexes, while and - most interestingly - the ability to heal  quickly. This could be due to having advanced macrophages, which let them fight infections and repair their bodies much quicker than us regular humans . And Captain America also has his shield as protection, which can deflect bullets, grenades, lasers and so on. Most of its protection appears to come from steel, although this is not a great shock absorber - and somehow Captain America is able to survive even the heaviest of blows from Thor’s hammer. The reason is thanks to the imaginary mineral called vibranium which, while fictional, has some science at its core. Captain America also has his shield as protection, which can deflect bullets, grenades, lasers and so on. The reason is thanks to the imaginary mineral called vibranium - which, while fictional, has some science at its core. It appears that this material can turn vibrational energy from an impact into light energy . ‘This material can absorb a near infinite amount of vibration energy without getting too hot or melting,’ explains Dr Burks. As evidenced by a flash of light as Thor’s hammer hits the shield, it appears this material can ‘convert vibrational energy to light energy,’ keeping the Captain safe. Of course, you have to suspend disbelief just a bit to assume this is possible - but perhaps the Avengers have more of a root in science than you thought.","Washington's American Chemical Society video explains the Avengers .

"Tim Cook may have described the Apple Watch as ‘the most personal device we've ever created’ but reports claim the gadget doesn't tolerate some individual’s tattoos. Owners of the coveted watch have found the timepiece's sensors malfunction when worn on tattooed wrists. Dark, vibrant ink seems to cause the watch’s heart rate monitor to lose connection and give inaccurate readings. Scroll down for video . Some owners of the Apple Watch have found that it malfunctions if worn on tattooed wrists (pictured). Some dark, vibrant ink seems to cause the watch’s heart sensor to lose connection and give inaccurate readings . The issue first came to light on Reddit and Twitter where a number of users reported similar issues, such as having to repeatedly enter a password to unlock the phone. This is required every time the device detects  it has left a wearer’s wrist. Tests suggest that tattoos in dark and solid colours interfere with the device the most. This is because the heart sensor reads a pulse by measuring light absorption though the skin - a process called photoplethysmography. 'This technology, while difficult to pronounce, is based on a very simple fact: Blood is red because it reflects red light and absorbs green light, Apple wrote on its support page. 'Apple Watch uses green LED lights paired with light‑sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment. 'When your heart beats, the blood flow in your wrist - and the green light absorption - is greater. Between beats, it’s less. 'By flashing its LED lights hundreds of times per second, Apple Watch can calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute - your heart rate.' It is thought that  red and green inks reflect light in a similar way and the sensor can't distinguish between the blood and tattoo. It appears  the pigmented ink of some tattoos affects the watch's sensor’s ability to read an individual’s heart rate, which in turn leads the watch to think it has stopped making contact with the skin. Apple has yet to comment on the problem, despite there being speculation that the apparent fault could also stop some people using Apple Pay. Tests conducted by iMore suggest that tattoos in dark and solid colours interfere with the device the most. This is because the heart sensor reads a pulse by measuring light absorption though the skin - a process called photoplethysmography. 'This technology, while difficult to pronounce, is based on a very simple fact: Blood is red because it reflects red light and absorbs green light, Apple writes on its support page.

'By flashing its LED lights hundreds of times per second, Apple Watch can calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute - your heart rate. So the problem seems to occur when a wearer has something on their skin that reduces the lights reflectiveness, such as ink under the skin’s surface. It appears that the pigmented ink of some tattoos affects the watch's sensor’s (illustrated) ability to read an individual’s heart rate, which in turn leads the watch to think it’s stopped making contact with skin . Reddit user guine55fan thought his 42mm Sport edition watch had a bad wrist detector sensor beacuse it locked every time the screen went dark and wouldn;r receive notifications. He tried holsing it against his hand, which unlike his wrists and arm, aren't tattooed. 'My hand isn't tattooed and the Watch stayed unlocked,' he wrote. 'Once I put it back on the area that is tattooed with black ink the watch would automatically lock again.' The user has told Apple about the problem who tried to solve the problem, but are also reporting it to their engineers. This doesn’t include natural skin pigmentation. iMore tested the watch’s sensors on tattooed and non-tattooed parts of wrists, as well as elsewhere on the body and found that on non-inked parts, the sensors gave uniformed readings. However, ‘on tattooed sections, sensor readings varied wildly depending on colours and shading,’ Serenity Caldwell reported. She said  solid colours in darker inks such as black and red ‘confused’ the sensor the most, causing misreadings of up to 196 beats per minute (BPM), for example. The average heart rate is 72 BPM. Tests on lighter colours such as purple and yellow caused slightly elevated misreadings of 80BPM, compared to 69BPM on the wearer’s non-tattooed wrist, but didn’t interfere with skin contact detection, unlike with darker shades of ink. The team was unable to reproduce problems reported on Twitter of light, but patterned tattoos creating errors, leading them to conclude that the design and type of tattoo makes a difference in how well the watch works. Apple has yet to comment on 'tattoo-gate' but admits on its support page that 'many factors' can affect the performance of the Apple Watch heart rate monitor. 'Skin perfusion is one,' it says. 'A fancy way of describing how much blood flows through your skin, skin perfusion varies significantly from person to person and can also be impacted by the environment. 'If you’re exercising in the cold, for example, the skin perfusion in your wrist may be too low for the heart rate sensor to get a reading.' Apple said that motion is another factor. 'Rhythmic movements, such as running or cycling, give better results compared to irregular movements, like tennis or boxing.' The sapphire glass screen in the Apple Watch has remained scratch-free after being subjected to being rubbed with sandpaper, keyed and even hit with a hammer. The test was carried out by Cardiff-based iPhone repairs specialist iPhoneFixed.co.uk, which used a sapphire screen from a 38mm Apple Watch for its experiment. Two out of the three models of Apple Watches have sapphire glass screens - the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition. The glass is made from synthetic sapphire, which is created by applying heat and pressure to aluminium oxide powder, before the crystals are processed to remove impurities. The tiny round disks created are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. Sapphire glass is said to be twice as tough as normal glass and almost as hard as a diamond. To test the durability of the screen, it was rubbed against a stone wall and then with a coin, before being ‘scratched’ by a key. The video capturing the attempts at destruction, shows no scratches were achieved to the screen. It also withstood being rubbed with abrasive sandpaper at some force and hit by a hammer – albeit not very hard. But most impressive, was the screen’s ability to withstand an electric drill being dragged across its surface, without leaving a mark. The test led iPhoneFixed to claim: ‘Sapphire glass is pretty strong and virtually impossible to scratch’.","Tattooed Apple Watch users  reporting problems with its heart rate sensor .

"The world's first robotic planet finder is hoped to help in the search for Earth-like planets that might support life in other solar systems. Now scientists have proven its capabilities by using the telescope to find a unique a planetary system orbiting a nearby star 54 light-years away. All three planets in the system orbit the star, HD 7924, at a distance closer than Mercury orbits the sun, completing their orbits in just 5, 15 and 24 days. The Automated Planet Finder (APF) consists of a 2.4-metre automated telescope and enclosure, and a high-resolution spectrograph. The spectrograph takes starlight from the telescope and spreads it into a rainbow of colours, splitting the light into a spectrum of thousands of different wavelengths that can be measured . The Automated Planet Finder (APF) consists of a 2.4-metre automated telescope and enclosure, and a high-resolution spectrograph. The spectrograph takes starlight from the telescope and spreads it into a rainbow of colours, splitting the light into a spectrum of thousands of different wavelengths that can be measured with great precision. Repeated measurement of a star's spectrum enables astronomers to detect the tiny wobble induced in a star by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. The telescope and spectrograph operate robotically every night and  target a preprogrammed list of nearby stars. APF observes them every night for months, in search of rocky planets with very low masses, similar to Earth. The ultimate goal of extrasolar planet research is to find planets like Earth that may support life. 'The three planets are unlike anything in our solar system, with masses 7-8 times the mass of Earth and orbits that take them very close to their host star,' explains UC Berkeley graduate student Lauren Weiss. While the planets are likely to be too hot to support life, their discovery reveals the powerful capabilities of the Automated Planet Finder (APF) in California. 'This level of automation is a game-changer in astronomy,' said Andrew Howard, an astronomers UC Berkeley. 'It's a bit like owning a driverless car that goes planet shopping.' AFP found the star system by tracing out the planets' orbits over many years using the Doppler technique to see shifts in the star's light. The planet system was also spotted by the Keck Observatory and the Automatic Photometric Telescope (APT) at Fairborn Observatory in Arizona. But unlike other telescope, the new APF facility offers a way to speed up the planet search as it robotically searches for planets every clear night. Training computers to run the observatory all night, without human oversight, took years of effort by the University of California Observatories staff team. 'We initially used APF like a regular telescope, staying up all night searching star to star,' said University of Hawaii graduate student BJ Fulton. 'But the idea of letting a computer take the graveyard shift was more appealing after months of little sleep.' The Kepler Space Telescope has discovered thousands of extrasolar planets and demonstrated that they are common in our Milky Way galaxy. Scientists have proven the APF's capabilities by using the telescope to find a unique a planetary system orbiting a nearby star 54 light-years away. All three planets in the system orbit the star, HD 7924, at a distance closer than Mercury orbits the sun, completing their orbits in just 5, 15 and 24 days . AFP found the star system by tracing out the planets' orbits over many years using the Doppler technique to see shifts in the star's light. The planet system was also spotted by the Keck Observatory and the Automatic Photometric Telescope (APT) at Fairborn Observatory in Arizona. However, nearly all of these planets are far from our solar system. Most nearby stars have not been searched for the small 'super-Earth' planets that Kepler found in great abundance. This discovery shows the type of planetary system that astronomers expect to find around many nearby stars in the coming years. 'Starspots, like sunspots on the sun, can momentarily mimic the signatures of small planets. 'Repeated observations over many years allowed us to separate the starspot signals from the signatures of these new planets,' explains Evan Sinukoff, a UH graduate student who contributed to the discovery. The robotic observations of HD 7924 are the start of a systematic survey for super-Earth planets orbiting nearby stars. Fulton will lead this two-year search with the APF as part of his research for his doctoral dissertation. 'When the survey is complete we will have a census of small planets orbiting sun-like stars within approximately 100 light-years of Earth,' says Fulton.

"It looks, and sometimes acts, like a huge sponge floating in space. But this crumpet-like rock is in fact one of Saturn's outer moons, measuring 255 by 161 miles (410 by 260km). Named Hyperion, the moon's porous surface can be seen in incredible detail in this image taken by Cassini as it performed a flyby of the satellite. The floating bath sponge: This image shows one of Saturn's outer moons, measuring 255 by 161 miles (410 by 260km). Cassini was around 38,500 miles (62,000 km) from Hyperion when the image was taken . Hyperion is shaped like a potato and is one of the largest bodies in the solar system known to be so irregular. Its odd, almost 'bubbly' appearance, can be attributed to it having a very low density for its size, according to Nasa. This low density also means that it is composed largely of water ice with only a small amount of rock. Because of these properties the entire moon is porous, like a sponge, with well-preserved craters of various sizes packed together across its surface. Scientists believe around 40 per cent of the moon is empty space. Cassini was around 38,500 miles (62,000 km) from Hyperion when the image was taken almost a decade ago. Esa has just released a refined, false-colour perspective of the moon in which its surface features were highlighted by toning down its natural redness. During the flyby, the probe got more than it bargained for as Hyperion unleashed a burst of charged particles towards the spacecraft, effectively delivering a giant 200-volt electric shock. It appears that Hyperion's surface becomes electrostatically charged as it is bathed in charged particles. These particles are constantly streaming out into space from the sun, but Hyperion also has to deal with ones trapped within the magnetic field of its host planet, Saturn. While astronomers expected many bodies throughout the solar system to be charged, the Cassini data represents the first-ever experience of a charged natural object in space other than our moon. 'This is comparable to what happens when you rub your hair against a balloon, or when a shirt or blouse rubs against a sweater,' said Professor Tom Nordheim at University College London. Hyperion is shaped like a potato and is one of the largest bodies in the solar system known to be so irregular. Its odd, almost 'bubbly' appearance, can be attributed to it having a very low density for its size . 'The large difference in potential between the surface and the spacecraft resulted in a flow of electrons being accelerated from Hyperion toward Cassini.

"A mid-air altercation over legroom turned into a brawl on a flight from London Heathrow to Oman, after one passenger allegedly attacked another with a shoe. The fight broke out on the Oman Air flight 102 to Muscat after one man decided to move seats because the plane wasn't full. However, a fellow passenger objected to the man moving near to him and a row broke out. After landing at Muscat, one man was taken away for questioning by police after being involved in a fight with another passenger on an Oman Air flight (file photo) Passengers were forced to intervene after the argument escalated into a full-blown fight on board. The Irish Mirror reports that one of the men involved threw punches at the other, and also took of his shoe to use as a weapon in the scuffle. One passenger screamed that there was a baby nearby, while others were woken from their sleep by the commotion. The pilot alerted Muscat Airport, and on arrival, one man was taken away for questioning. 'It really was a really nasty incident,' one passenger told the Irish Mirror. 'One guy completely lost the plot and started throwing several punches. Eventually the flight crew was alerted and managed to calm him down.' As the plane was not at capacity, one man decided to move seats on the Oman Air flight 102 (file photo) The Airbus A330 departed London Heathrow at 9.30pm Saturday night, with the fight believed to have taken place less than three hours into the journey. A spokesperson for Oman Air told MailOnline Travel: 'Based on the reports received by the Senior Flight Supervisor, there was a disagreement between two passengers. 'Oman Air cabin crew, who are trained to manage unforeseen circumstances such as this, intervened and contained the situation. No risk was posed to the safety of fellow passengers. 'The flight, WY102 from London Heathrow, landed on time and safely at the Muscat International Airport. On arrival, Airport Security carried out the usual procedures of investigation. 'Oman Air would like to thank the cabin crew for managing this situation calmly and professionally.' It's not the first time a row over passengers' space has caused problems mid-flight. Last year three incidents in one week saw three plane diversions in a period that became known as 'legroom wars'. A Delta flight from New York to Florida was forced to divert after a row broke out over a reclined seat. Flight 2370 left New York  en route to West Palm Beach, but was forced to land in Jacksonville. A woman reclined her seat so she could knit, but the person behind was trying to sleep on the table, and the two became engaged in a bitter argument. The issue of space on planes remains a key issue and means rows and disagreements are common . As the row ensured, the pilot took the decision to ground the plane 'out of an abundance of caution.' And an American Airlines Miami-to-Paris flight was rerouted to Boston after air marshals had to restrain a man as two passengers came to blows when one of them attempted to recline their seat. The male passenger, Edmund Alexandre, of France, continued to be disruptive when a crew member tried to calm him, following him down the aisle and grabbing his arm. Two undercover federal air marshals on the flight then subdued and handcuffed the 61-year-old traveler. And a few days prior to this, a fight started on a United Airlines flight when a male passenger resorted to using a Knee Defender, a $21 gadget designed to prevent the person in front from reclining. A female passenger, sitting in the middle of Row 11 tried to recline, but found she couldn’t. When it emerged that the man in the seat behind had attached a Knee Defender, she asked a member of cabin crew to remove it. He refused, saying that he would no longer be able to work on his laptop, and the situation escalated, with the woman hurling a glass of water in the man’s face. The New Jersey-to-Denver flight was diverted to Chicago, and both of the passengers were booted off.

"Protecting the FA Cup prize money is the biggest reason the FA is prepared to give away what amounts to almost title sponsorship of the tournament to Emirates Airlines. The proposed £30million, three-year contract for an Emirates FA Cup, revealed by Sports Agenda, gives the FA the resources to ensure the monies received by the clubs for progressing in the world’s most famous club knockout tournament. The figures range from £1,150 for winning the extra preliminary round through to the £1.8million either Aston Villa or Arsenal — on a par with the Wimbledon singles champions — will receive for lifting the trophy on May 30. Aston Villa will face the holders Arsenal in this season's final at Wembley Stadium . Should Arsenal repeat their 2014 FA Cup triumph, they stand to pocket £1.8million in prize money . The numbers will not register for Premier League clubs awash with TV money but £18,000 for winning a first-round Cup match would make a lot of difference to a non-League club. And the FA Cup fund — like the FA Trophy and Vase budget — was very likely to be raided before the Emirates deal to fund the £30m-a-year priorities of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission which centre on coaches and facilities that have seen all FA departments asked to make 15 per cent cuts. FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission is focusing on coaches and facilities . Frank Arnesen, the original technical director in the Premier League, was one of the delegates at the first sporting directors summit — co-founders include Joe Royle’s son Darren — held at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Wednesday. And Arnesen, who worked in the role at Tottenham and Chelsea, believes the position is now an integral part of a modern football club provided the owner agrees. While at Chelsea, Arnesen tried to sign three Leeds youngsters resulting in chairman Ken Bates making an official complaint about an illegal approach. Chelsea paid £5m in compensation. Ironically, one of that trio, Danny Rose, who decided to stay at Elland Road at the time, is now in the England squad. Arnesen said: ‘I’m delighted for Danny. He was a real talent from the start.’ Tottenham defender Danny Rose (right) competes for possession with Manchester United's Juan Mata . Sky staff have no doubts the £4.2billion spend on Premier League rights is responsible for the latest huge cost-cutting exercise — an ‘Agility and Flexibility’ strategy delivered to 600 production services personnel this week that is expected to result in at least 70 redundancies. Operations director Darren Long, now nicknamed David Brent for the way he delivered news of job losses dressed up as changes in working patterns, was heckled for refusing to take questions. Sky say this planning started long before the PL tender. Meanwhile, those heading for Sky’s exit door after the consultation exercise will be delighted to know mediocre £4m-a-year pundit Thierry Henry paid for his private jet flight to the Sunderland v Newcastle match out of his own pocket. Sky pundit Thierry Henry (centre) paid for his own private jet to the recent Sunderland vs Newcastle derby . The fallout from the Emirates FA Cup deal included former Minister for Sport Richard Caborn labelling the deal ‘commercialism gone mad’. This is the same out–of-touch Caborn who failed in a bid to become FA chairman and is still disliked by FA councillors after telling blazers they were ‘not fit for purpose’. However, even FA diehards including the traditionalist who told broadcasters there would never be a 5.30pm Cup final kick-off while he had ‘a hole in his a***’, accept sponsorships are critical for FA finances. Former Minister for Sport Richard Caborn has branded the FA Cup Emirates deal ‘commercialism gone mad’ GILES CAN TAKE TOP JOB . Ashley Giles hardly merits a mention for the England director of cricket role for which former captain Andrew Strauss is front-runner. But Giles is the most qualified after stints as an England coach and director of cricket for Lancashire, while he is also halfway through the part-time two-year Masters of Sport Directors degree at University of Manchester. Also part of the audience at the directors’ summit was former England team director Andy Flower, who is now happy to stay in the background running the cricket academy at Loughborough. David Sharpe, 23-year-old Wigan chairman and grandson of Dave Whelan, loves to socialise with the team, especially manager Gary Caldwell. But the pair’s celebration night out in Manchester bar Panacea after Caldwell’s first win as boss against Brighton on April 18 was somewhat premature. A week later they lost at home to Wolves and on Tuesday were relegated to League One.","The proposed £30million gives the FA the resources to ensure the monies received by the clubs for progressing in the tournament .

"In 2007, Machu Picchu was named a 'New Wonder of the World'. With the ancient Inca city featured on bucket lists the world over, visitors queuing up for the perfect photo of its other worldly beauty, it's not surprising that cracks are starting to show. Since 2011, the number of average daily number of visitors has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 agreed to by Peru and UNESCO. Last year 1.1million people reached its dizzying peak. Scroll down for video . Entry to the site will be moved to a visitor and orientation centre and there will be three routes through the site . And now a new master plan, to be implemented between 2015 and 2019, has been revealed, calling for the re-conceptualisation' of Machu Picchu. According to the Andean Air Mail and Peruvian Times, the idea is to change the 'axis of the visitor experience' making the mountain into a part of the tourist experience as well as the Inca city itself, with the hopes that this can control crowd flow - the project is set to cost around £28.5million. Entry to the site will be moved to a visitor and orientation centre in the jungle below, and there will be three different routes through the site. A staff of certified guides and guards will be employed, and security cameras installed. Certified guides and guards will be employed, and security cameras installed as part of the grand plan . Also, time limits will be imposed to keep traffic flowing. An online document outlining the plan states: 'Groups of 100 visitors will leave approximately every 10 minutes (from the visitor’s centre) toward any of the possible options, easing up the congestion on the heritage space with the aid of interpretive signs and a more efficient action by the guides.' So if groups of 100 are dispatched every ten minutes, the site would receive around 6,000 visitors per day, which works out as over two million a year. Plans have also been agreed for an exit ramp, as well as onsite toilets. Since 2011, the number of average daily number of visitors has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 agreed to by Peru and UNESCO . In 2008, UNESCO, the Ministry of Culture and the Peruvian Government agreed that no more than 2,500 people should visit the site per day. Due to a lack of emergency management, limited road access from Santa Maria and Santa Teresa and poorly managed waste facilities, increasing numbers of tourists would be potentially very dangerous. The new master plan aims to tackle all of those issues, but it could be argued that the sacred Inca city might never be the same again. Journey Latin America's Peru expert, Isabelle Mazille, told Mail Online Travel: 'Machu Picchu is not a museum, but an experience – and people go time and time again to visit certain areas. 'So with this idea of having a specific route from which you cannot deviate, being able to go with a guide only and in short slots will definitely affect the experience; it won’t be the same. 'But on the other hand – and this is the main issue – based on the increasing number of visitors, the authorities need to do something to accommodate (and control) them as otherwise the site will crumble. 'On the positive side, a visitor and orientation centre is a good idea which will help organise and disperse the crowds'.","Peru's famous Inca ruins received 1.1million visitors in 2014 alone .

"Whitaker on way out . James Whitaker's brief reign as the ECB’s head of selectors looks set to end when the new director of cricket is announced.

One county displeased by the Test squad that Whitaker and his panel picked for the current tour of the West Indies are Yorkshire.

Sam Allardyce's future as manager of West Ham is subject to much speculation at a time when an extraordinary letter sent by lawyers acting for Blackburn Rovers owners Venky’s to football agency Kentaro’s legal representatives is still doing the rounds. The letter, from December 22, 2011, makes numerous disputed claims about Kentaro’s involvement in Blackburn after Venky’s bought the club the previous year. Among other things, it alleges that it was Kentaro who persuaded the new Indian owners to sack Allardyce and replace him with Steve Kean, a client of Kentaro’s agency partners SEM. Sam Allardyce's future as West Ham boss is in doubt at the same time as a letter regarding the end of his tenure at Blackburn Rovers does the rounds . Kentaro are now in administration in the UK. But SEM say it was entirely Venky’s decision to dispense with Allardyce as they wanted ‘good entertaining football’, and that Kean negotiated his own contract to become caretaker manager. FA Cup, the oldest knockout football competition in the world, is set to be rebranded as the Emirates FA Cup in a new £30million sponsorship deal . In a move that will upset traditionalists, the FA are understood to have secured a three-year contract with Emirates Airlines. The deal, due to be rubber-stamped by the FA board on Thursday, is believed to be worth at least £10million a year — but comes at a cost for lovers of the 144-year-old competition. Arsenal won last season's FA Cup competition, which will be rebranded the Emirates FA Cup . Renaming it the Emirates FA Cup is a lot closer to title sponsorship than the previous ‘in association with Budweiser’ agreement, which was worth £9m annually. But the FA, after a highly embarrassing season without any Cup backer that has put huge pressure on their commercial department, needed to offer more to attract a significant sponsor to the table. The hunt proved hugely difficult even after the FA revamped their sponsorship team to bring in expertise honed at Manchester United. And it needed a bit of luck to attract Emirates Airlines, who have a massive sports sponsorship portfolio across the world that includes Arsenal’s stadium and kit. Emirates have big money to spend after deciding last November not to renew their £30m-a-year FIFA sponsorship for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The allegations of corruption surrounding those tournaments are said to have been a consideration. And Emirates are no longer involved, either, in the tender for a Champions League airline backer, allowing the FA to offer a major football sponsorship alternative. Aston Villa will face the holders Arsenal in this season's final at Wembley Stadium . Dubai-based Emirates have their arch Abu Dhabi airline rivals Etihad as Manchester City’s kit and stadium sponsors. But City foresee no problems with an Emirates FA Cup. The deal with Emirates will also allow for a further six subsidiary sponsors for the competition — with Budweiser, Nike and William Hill already signed up. And the ambition is for the whole FA Cup sponsorship portfolio to be worth £20m by 2018. The Emirates deal, likely to be officially announced nearer to the FA Cup final on May 30, is also well-timed for the FA’s commercial department, with the new chief executive Martin Glenn arriving at Wembley next month. Tickets for the all-French European Rugby Champions Cup final between Toulon and Clermont Auvergne at Twickenham on Saturday are selling so poorly that England Rugby Supporters Club members have been offered the chance to buy two seats for the price of one. Tickets for Saturday's European Rugby Champions Cup final at Twickenham aren't selling well . It has emerged that the final flashpoint in the breakdown of relations between the RFU hierarchy and Debbie Jevans, who quit as CEO of England Rugby 2015, was over a Twickenham hospitality box for the World Cup. Jevans wanted control over the guest list, while the RFU didn’t want it full of her friends and contacts. It is not clear if ER2015 will have such a facility during the tournament. Their spokeswoman refused to comment. ER2015 insist Jevans’s exit will not affect the smooth running of the World Cup. Yet the Northampton v Saracens game in Milton Keynes last Saturday, run as a test event for the tournament, has presented the organisers with significant traffic issues to resolve.","James Whitaker's brief reign as ECB head of selectors is coming to an end .

"There is a problem with England's top order and it is not an easy one to solve. Don't get me wrong. England's top three are exceptional players but the issue is that they are very one-paced and when the West Indies bowling was so disciplined, that became a problem on the first morning of the first Test. It is OK batting the way England did if they had got through to lunch on 60 without loss, but they will be exposed against better teams than West Indies, like Australia, if they crash to 34 for three in the first session as they did here. As a player I would never worry about the pace runs came as long as they came. You are there to win games. But now I appreciate the need to entertain as well and the way the top three go about things might become a bit monotonous. Joe Root (left) and Ian Bell (right) put on 177 runs for the fourth wicket on day one in Antigua . Bell raises his bat to the crowd after scoring his 22nd Test match century at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium . OK, if they stay in the runs will come and England supporters will be happy but it should be remembered that England have promised to play a certain way. You have to give Jonathan Trott huge credit for battling his way back to Test cricket but a bit of a risk has been taken with him because if it doesn't come off it will look like another big decision that England have got wrong. As for captain Alastair Cook, he has been working hard with Graham Gooch and has opened his shoulder up a bit, but the pitched up delivery continues to get him out. Ben Stokes was unbeaten on 71 at the close of play as England reached 341 for five . Bell and Root lifted England's run rate and got them out of a hole having fallen to 34 for three . Gary Ballance has got this big backwards movement so to get him driving, and dismissing him the way the West Indies did, represented a sucker punch. Then you looked at the way Ian Bell and Joe Root went about their business and they were just that bit busier. You can't bowl one way to them to dry up their scoring shots because they both drive and they both pull well. Thanks to those two and Ben Stokes, this turned out to be very much England's day. I was delighted that Stokes batted so well on his return to the side. He made no excuses when he was left out of the side and said he deserved to be dropped. I like that, and I like a player like him coming in at No 6 and taking the game away from the opposition. Alastair Cook is bowled through the gate by Kemar Roach for 11 on the first morning in Antigua . Jonathan Trott's first Test in 18 months ended in a third-ball duck as he was dismissed in the first over . Peter Moores and Cook are both genuinely good guys trying to do a good job, so when I received a text from Moores asking if I would have a motivational talk with the team on the eve of the Test I was happy to oblige. I have always said that if England ever want any input from me I will try to help. It's difficult to do that at times, being on the other side of the fence now with the media, but my heart is in English cricket and I want England to do well. It was only a 15-minute chat at the end of England's team meeting and, while not going into it too deeply, I just tried to give the team a sense of perspective. Gary Ballance was third to go for England on the first morning  as he was dismissed by Jason Holder . It's difficult at times when you are in the bubble to remember what it means to be an England cricketer and I tried to emphasise that it is important, but you have to try to play down in your mind quite how important it is and enjoy the journey. And when England were 34 for three, I was receiving a lot of comments in the commentary box about my supposed motivational skills! I replied that I only actually spoke to the England middle order.","England close day one of first Test against West Indies on 341 for five .

"A coroner has slammed the ease with which illegal drugs can be ordered over the 'dark web' after two student brothers died consuming ecstasy they had bought online. Astrophysics undergraduate Torin Lakeman, 19, died alongside his brother Jacques, 20, in a pub in Manchester after consuming six times the lethal dose of MDMA after ordering the drug via the web. At Bolton Coroner's Court today, Alan Walsh said he would be contacting Home Secretary Theresa May over the deaths, adding that it was unacceptable that 'intellectual people are able to access drugs in this way.' Torin Lakeman, 19 (left), and brother Jacques, 20 (right), died in a pub in Manchester after consuming ecstasy they had bough from an anonymous dealer via the 'dark web' The brothers were found dead in a room above this pub after going to watch Manchester United play a game against Hull at Old Trafford in December last year . The brothers, both from the Isle of Man, were found in a hotel room above The Grapes Pub in Bolton on 1st December last year after travelling to watch Manchester United play at Old Trafford. The court was told that Torin, a student of Physics and Planetary studies at Aberystwyth University, had bought MDMA from website Agora from an anonymous seller with the 'handle' Stone Island. Torin's housemate Ethan Bradley said he bought the drugs to 'have a good weekend', and that he would use the drug recreationally, but was not addicted to it. Coroner Alan Walsh today said he was concerned at the ease with which the boys bought the lethal drugs, adding he would be writing to the Home Secretary . Jacques was living in Chingford, London, at the time with his grandmother while training to be a chef, so travelled to meet Torin in Manchester, where the pair booked into the pub for the weekend. The hearing was told that both brothers had taken the drug on separate occasions. The pair watched as Manchester United won their match against Hull 3-0, and father Raymond Lakeman said he was overjoyed that the boys were spending time together. He said: 'They were brothers so they had fallings out but on the whole they got on as best friends. 'They wanted to go and watch Manchester United play Hull City. I booked the tickets and sent them over with two football shirts for them. 'It was the first time they had ever done anything together like this. They didn't know anybody in Manchester. They were looking forward to seeing each other. 'My wife and I were happier than we had been for weeks and months and years.' Landlord William Pilkington later saw them in the bar and when asked whether they appeared to be drunk, he said they were 'on something else'. Detective Inspector Joanne Clawson from Greater Manchester Police said CCTV from a local shop caught them buying two bottles of WKD and a packet of chewing gum which they took back to their hotel. The alcohol was never consumed. Torin was the last to be seen when he came down from their room at around 9.30pm to ask for the pub's WIFI password. Both of the boys' bodies were found on Monday morning, when pub worker Michael Lawrence went to clean the room they had been staying in. Bolton Coroner's Court was told that Jacques, along with his brother Torin, had both consumed the drug before on separate occasions (pictured, Jacques alongside an unknown friend) The court heard that Torin (pictured left, with a friend) bought the drugs via website Agora which cannot be accessed through regular websites, before travelling to Manchester to meet his brother . Mr Lawrence told the inquest: 'I went into room five and saw one of the males on the floor in the room. At that stage I didn't see the other one. 'My colleague went into the room and found the body of the other male in this was on the far side of the bed that would have been hidden from view. Ray Lakeman, the boys' father, said he was overjoyed that the boys were spending time together, and even bought shirts for the pair . 'I was asked to check by police whether there was any evidence of tablets or drugs or anything untoward and I didn't see anything.' A post mortem on Jacques body found he had 6.15mg of MDMA per litre of blood in his body - almost six times the 'lethal' amount of 1.7mg. He also had 229mg of alcohol in his blood - almost three times the drink drive limit. His brother Torin was found to have 7.08mg of ecstasy in his body, while his blood alcohol levels were lower at 87mg. Pathologist Dr Patrick Ward told the inquest: 'If a person is not used it on a regular basis the impact may be greater. In batches of any drug there are different levels of toxicity. 'They could have taken the same amount but the concentration could have been different. I would anticipate they took the same amounts each.' Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Walsh said: 'They had a great day which makes the tragedy of these deaths even harder to accept. 'There was concern as to the quality and quantity of ecstasy in terms of concentration and that may well have been a factor in terms of the ultimate impact. 'They were likely to be tablet form but when they were taken and where taken is unknown. MDMA is known as ecstasy and I accept there were sufficient quantities in the blood to cause death.' He added: ' I accept the drugs were obtained by use of the internet and the drugs delivered to him from an unknown source by use of the internet on the dark web. 'I am concerned about the ability of young people to obtain elicit substances using the internet. 'I am well aware that is a global problem and little can be done to avoid this supply line being used. The death of Jacques and Torin identify a great problem - the dark web. Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Walsh said the issue of the dark web concerned him 'as a father and a grandfather' (pictured, Torin Lakeman) 'The dark web identified an anonymous supplier and the supplier exists behind the veil - a confidential and sophisticated veil. 'In the case of Jacques and Torin I hear reference to Stone Island and reference to Agora. I believe these matter should be reported to the Home Secretary. 'Young people have a natural ability these days with regard interned who find it much easier to access these dark sites and have available to them supply of drugs by simply ordering on the internet and delivering to address. 'As a father and grandfather it is a frightening prospect.'","Torin Lakeman, 19, died in December last year with brother Jacques, 20 .

"Daniel Levy reportedly told the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust that after the problems reinvesting the money received for Gareth Bale, future transfer policy would entail the purchase of young players, priced between £10-15million with good potential for resale. This may be financially sensible, but it is hardly reassuring. Elite clubs, those who challenge for the biggest trophies, do not buy with one eye on selling and this strategy would set Tottenham back a decade to a time when they helped solve problems at Manchester United by trading top performers such as Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov. Indeed, the only time Tottenham demonstrated real Champions League potential was when Levy resisted the likes of Chelsea over Luka Modric. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is planning a new transfer policy for the club that centres on resale value . Spurs sold forward Gareth Bale (left) to Real Madrid in 2013 for a world-record £85 million transfer fee . Spurs' best chance of securing regular Champions League football came when Luka Modric played for them . Spurs allowed star performers Dimitar Berbatov (left) and Michael Carrick (right) to join Manchester United . The moment they started to sell again, Tottenham fell away. Not even having the Premier League's top goalscorer in Harry Kane has placed them among the elite again — and it is hard to see how that will change if this is the plan. Nobody overtakes Manchester United by offering a helping hand — no matter how favourable the price. Even the exploits of Premier League top goalscorer Harry Kane hasn't been enough to get Spurs top-four .","Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy has told supporters that future transfer policy will include developing young players with resale value .

"TESTOSTERONE . by Joe Herbert . (OUP £16.99) Testosterone doesn’t always get a good press. Everything that’s unpleasant about male behaviour has been ascribed to the effects of this much maligned hormone. Violence? It’s all testosterone’s fault. Sexual assault and rape? Just blame testosterone. Yet, as Joe Herbert makes clear in his engaging whistlestop tour of the science surrounding it, testosterone is at the heart of human life. ‘Without our father’s testosterone,’ as he writes, ‘none of us would exist.’ It has only one basic function — to enable a male to reproduce, and for that it’s essential. Although this is the case and it’s impossible to think of ‘maleness’ without testosterone, it’s also important for sexual behaviour in women. The blood of an adult woman before menopause actually contains about five times more testosterone than oestrogen, the supposedly ‘female’ hormone. However, it’s as a metaphor for masculinity that testosterone is best known. All that’s unpleasant about male behaviour is ascribed to testosterone, yet as Joe Herbert explains, testosterone is at the heart of human life . It begins its influence in the womb as it helps to shape the distinctive characteristics of the male body. This influence continues immediately after birth. That three-month-old baby boy, sweetly smiling at you from his pram, may well have testosterone levels that rival his father’s. We don’t know why but, starting two weeks after birth and lasting for four to six months, a little boy’s testes are producing testosterone in substantial amounts. The hormone’s power then recedes, but returns — and how! — in puberty. Post-puberty, testosterone drives the competition for females. In the animal world, stags lock antlers, elephants enter the aggressive state known as musth and male rhinos go horn-to-horn. Even male giraffes, aroused by the hormone’s influence, flail at one another with their long necks. Elaborate colourings emerge in some species, designed to emphasise masculinity and attract female attention. In guenon monkeys the scrotum turns bright blue. They don’t seem to mind. They adopt the habit of sitting with their legs apart to show the female guenons just how big and blue they are. We can only be thankful that testosterone’s effects on sexual display in humans are not so visually dramatic. Adult human males have varying levels of the hormone in different circumstances. Entirely unsurprisingly, having sex increases testosterone levels. So, too, does talking to an attractive woman and watching pornographic movies. Winning at sports sends the levels racing upwards. Just supporting a winning team can have the same effect. It works in politics as well. A study showed that, during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, Barack Obama supporters were pumped full of testosterone. Levels fell in the supporters of his defeated rival, John McCain. Testosterone also helps in the City. Another study, on a London trading floor, showed that male traders made more money on days on which their morning testosterone levels were higher than usual. A challenge is obviously stimulating. Surgeons facing difficult procedures often find their testosterone levels shooting up. One would assume that the theatre of war would have the same effect as the operating theatre, if not more so. After all, testosterone is supposed to be the hormone behind violence and aggression. In fact, soldiers in the heat of battle can have testosterone levels not much above those of men who have been castrated. It’s the appalling stress that reduces it. Once they leave the front line, however, the soldiers revert to more normal levels. When levels are high, the effects of testosterone on male behaviour are so strong that the human brain has had to find a multitude of ways of regulating and channelling them. The creation of laws, religion and customs has, to some extent, been shaped by the need to do so. In that sense, as Joe Herbert writes, ‘testosterone lies at the heart of much of our history’. His own fascination with the ‘simple but wondrous chemical’ that is his subject is clear. His book does a fine job of conveying that fascination to the rest of us.","The male hormone testosterone doesn’t always get a good press .

"SKYFARING . by Mark Vanhoenacker . (Chatto & Windus £16.99) Our fascination with aeroplanes, and the men who fly them (it is still overwhelmingly men), has acquired a morbid flavour since Germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by its troubled co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. The tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots, and airline vetting procedures, in which just about all of us have a vested interest. This makes Mark Vanhoenacker’s book, unwittingly, very timely indeed. When he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets. Like me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life. But for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience. Mark Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job . Vanhoenacker, an American, worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession. He learned to fly in Britain, tempted by our ‘historic relationship with aviation’. Coincidentally, his first job was to pilot the Airbus 320 on medium-distance European flights — exactly what Lubitz was doing on that catastrophically fateful day. But Vanhoenacker moved on to Boeing 747s, and they are his great love. He admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso, observing how pleasing they are to the eye. Vanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing Virginia’s great blue heron as ‘the 747 of the swamp’ and notes how this would delight the aircraft’s chief designer, Joseph Sutter, who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds. But Sutter (now in his mid-90s) once stated that the 747 is more ‘a place’ than a conveyance. Pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons, Vanhoenacker tells us, but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic: unlike the Airbus, in which pilots usually wear heavy socks, they have foot heaters. And the ‘frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean looks better — everything looks better — when your feet are warm’. He writes elegantly about his pilot’s eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time, ie how long they take to cross. Thus, Russia is a seven-hour country and Belgium, with a tailwind, is merely a 15-minute country. Noting the vast, desolate regions he routinely flies over, it does not surprise him that, according to one calculation, the portion of the Earth’s surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent. But of even more interest, certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long-haul, are the nuts and bolts of those journeys. Vanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to Los Angeles or Tokyo, and there will meet the rest of the crew, 20 or so strong. And ‘meet’ really means ‘meet’: air crews do not move as a pack, and are usually strangers to each other. As he puts it, ‘our nametags are not worn only for passengers... There is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives.’ Before boarding, he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect, while they will tell him if there’s anything noteworthy about the passenger roster, and whether any of the BA staff on board have friends or family on the flight, people known, splendidly, as ‘Klingons’. Unsurprisingly, life on a 747 is full of jargon: a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as ‘the heavy’, one acting as ‘heavy out’, the other as ‘heavy home’. And for a pilot, the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints, with names usually comprising five capital letters. These often relate directly to the place below, so above Boston in Vanhoenacker’s home state, there is the waypoint LBSTA, referring to the region’s prized shellfish, and another, NIMOY, after one of the city’s more notable sons, the late actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr Spock in Star Trek. But other names are harder to explain. Above St Louis, Missouri, are the waypoints ANNII and LENXX. Vanhoenacker’s best guess is that an air-traffic controller there was a fan of Eurythmics’ singer Annie Lennox. Who would have thought that the mysteries of flying would embrace Mr Spock, Klingons and Annie Lennox? Skyfaring is crammed with these revelations and more, while the acknowledgments end on a plaintive note. Maybe one day, Vanhoenacker hopes, wide-eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight. In the meantime, he does a very good job of telling us what happens in there, and why we should still trust the men at the controls.","The Germanwings tragedy has ignited debate about depression in pilots .

"Samsung retook the lead in the global smartphone market in the first quarter, as gains in emerging market sales helped it overtake Apple, a research group said Wednesday. IDC said Samsung sold 82.4 million smartphones in the first three months of the year, for a 24.5 percent market share. However, Samsung said its first quarter net profit plunged 39 percent as consumers switched to bigger iPhones, squeezing earnings from its mobile business to less than half what they were a year earlier. Samsung retook the lead in the global smartphone market in the first quarter, as gains in emerging market sales helped it overtake Apple, a research group said ©Jung Yeon-Je (AFP/File) Samsung sold 82.4m smartphones in the first three months of the year, for a 24.5 percent market share. Apple held an 18.2 percent market share after selling 61.2 million iPhones. Even though the number of handsets sold was down seven percent from a year ago, it outpaced Apple, whose iPhone sales slipped slightly from the final quarter of 2014. Apple held an 18.2 percent market share in early 2015 after selling 61.2 million iPhones. The figures were impacted by seasonal and other factors. Samsung notably launched its flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge phones at the end of the quarter in April, while Apple iPhone sales dipped compared with the stronger holiday quarter. In the fourth quarter, Apple and Samsung were virtually tied with around 20 percent of the market each, according to several surveys. 'The challenge made by Apple for the top spot in the fourth quarter returned to a clear lead for Samsung in the first quarter, despite the soaring global demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,' said IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella. 'Samsung's shipments, given that the S6 was not launched into the market for the full quarter, were driven by large volumes into emerging markets and steady demand for its midrange and lower-priced smartphones.' Chinese manufacturer Lenovo was third after completing its acquisition of Motorola from Google. Its 5.6 percent market share placed it ahead of fellow Chinese group Huawei, with 5.0 percent, and South Korea's LG at 4.6 percent. IDC said the overall global smartphone market grew 16.7 percent from a year earlier, with total shipments of 337 million units. 'Apple soared 40 percent annually... Apple's new iPhone 6 portfolio is flying off the shelves in China and the United States, its two biggest markets,' said Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics ©Peter Parks (AFP/File) Strategy Analytics, which released a similar report, said the figures show Apple is a 'star' performer because it posted strong sales compared with the same period last year. 'Apple soared 40 percent annually... Apple's new iPhone 6 portfolio is flying off the shelves in China and the United States, its two biggest markets,' said Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics. Microsoft meanwhile struggled as it took over the Nokia brand of mobile phones, once the world's biggest, according to the research firm. Figures for Microsoft smartphone sales were not included in the two surveys but the company said it sold 8.6 million Lumia handsets in the quarter, only about half the total of Huawei. Samsung notably launched its flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge phones at the end of the quarter in April, while Apple iPhone sales dipped compared with the stronger holiday quarter ©Manan Vatsyayana (AFP/File) In the broader market, 'Microsoft's eight percent global mobile phone market share is sitting near an all-time low,' said Ken Hyers at Strategy Analytics. 'Microsoft continues to lose ground in feature phones, while its Lumia smartphone portfolio is in a holding pattern awaiting the launch of new Windows 10 software later this year.' Juniper Research said meanwhile it expects Samsung's performance to improve in the coming months because 'the S6 and the S6 Edge have had a better reception than the S5.' Juniper said BlackBerry lost further ground, delivering just 1.5 million handsets in the quarter. It came as Samsung Electronics Co. said its first quarter net profit plunged 39 percent as consumers switched to bigger iPhones, squeezing earnings from its mobile business to less than half what they were a year earlier. The company reported Wednesday that its January-March net profit was 4.63 trillion won ($4.35 billion), compared with 7.49 trillion won a year earlier. That was lower than the forecast of 4.97 trillion won in a survey of analysts by financial data provider FactSet. The larger-than-expected drop was due to a big profit plunge in Samsung's mobile business. The maker of Galaxy smartphones said its mobile division generated 2.74 trillion won in quarterly profit compared with 6.43 trillion won a year earlier. The Korean firm lost ground in the more profitable high-end market to Apple after the maker of the iPhone began offering models with bigger screens last fall. Before that, large screens were a feature that set Samsung phones apart.

The video was apparently filmed during LA Galaxy's day off on Tuesday with Keane choosing a song that was released when he was just three years old. Boy George, real name George O'Dowd, is a noted fan of the Galaxy and regard Keane as a friend from the Irishman's days in the Premier League where he lead the line most notably for Tottenham, Liverpool and Leeds. Karma Chameleon was the second Culture Club song to go to No 1 in the UK, after Do You Really Want To Hurt Me?, and also peaked at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1983 .

"House leaders have reached a bipartisan compromise on a bill that would end the National Security Agency's controversial collection of American phone records, but the measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate. The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday overwhelmingly passed the latest version of a bill known as the USA Freedom Act by a bipartisan vote of 25 to 2. The measure seeks to codify President Barack Obama's proposal to end the NSA's collection of domestic calling records.  It would allow the agency to request certain records held by the telephone companies under a court order in terrorism investigations. The authority to collect those records and other related surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act will expire June 1 unless Congress passes a law reauthorizing it. The House bill would do that, with changes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . UNHOLY TRIUMVIRATE? CIA Director John Brennan (center), National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers (right) and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (left) will soon be handed new rules of the road for mass-surveillance efforts . REMEMBER ME? NSA leaker Edward Snowden is still taking refuge outside the US, nearly two years after exposing the depth of the agency's eavesdropping program . Republican Representatives Bob Goodlatte and Jim . Sensenbrenner, and Democrats John Conyers and Jerry Nadler . introduced the 'USA Freedom Act.' It would result in phone companies, not the NSA, collecting so-called 'metadata' on trillions of phone calls. Government agencies could get access to it by applying to a judge empowered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Similar legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by . Democrat Patrick Leahy and Republican Mike Lee. But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch . McConnell is seemingly out of phase, sponsoring his own bill to extend the PATRIOT Act – unchanged – until the end of 2020. McConnell said he intended his bill to be a starting point for legislative debate, not a complete solution. A similar bill to the one that cleared the Judiciary Committee passed the full House last year by a bipartisan vote of 303 to 121 but narrowly failed a procedural vote in the Senate. The Judiciary Committee chairman, Virginia Republican Rep.  Bob Goodlatte, said the bill's provisions had been carefully negotiated with both the intelligence committee and intelligence agencies. During the hearing, lawmakers said a deal had been reached to bring the USA Freedom Act to the floor without going through the intelligence committee, where many Republicans support continuing the NSA bulk collection. The NSA's collection and storage of U.S. 'to and from' landline calling records – times, dates and numbers, but not content of the calls – was the most controversial program among many disclosed by former NSA systems administrator Edward Snowden. CONTRARIAN: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, is trying to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act without changes . Some NSA officials opposed the program, and independent evaluations have found it of limited value as a counterterrorism tool. Goodlatte said the House bill would create a 'narrower, targeted program,' that will still allow the NSA to hunt for connections between foreign terrorists and U.S. residents. 'We must act decisively to end bulk collection in the United States,' said Rep. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat, in an Associated Press interview. 'For years, the NSA has collected our phone records, yet it cannot point to a single attack that the collection has stopped,' added Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who was one of the Patriot Act's original authors. Some lawmakers offered amendments they said would toughen the bill's civil liberties provisions, but those were voted down, with other lawmakers saying they would kill the deal and empower those who want to continue NSA phone records collection. A civil liberties group praised the bill. 'The USA Freedom Act of 2015 offers an effective path forward in reforming overbroad domestic surveillance and putting an end to the bulk collection of Americans' communications,' said Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, in a statement.","FREEDOM Act would replace PATRIOT Act when it expires on June 1 .

"A New York woman who appealed to her Facebook friends last week asking to pray for the safe return of her fiance who went missing 11 days ago after his kayak capsized has now been charged with his murder. The Orange County district attorney's office said Thursday that 35-year-old Angelika Graswald, of Poughkeepsie, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 46-year-old Vincent Viafore. Troopers have said Viafore, also of Poughkeepsie, was kayaking with Graswald on the Hudson River April 19 when his vessel flipped over near the town of Cornwall-On-Hudson. Scroll down for video . Merry widow: Angelika Graswald (left), 35, has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of her missing fiance Vincent Viafore (right) Graswald called 911 telling the dispatcher she had fallen out of her own kayak. She was later picked up by a boater. Police have yet to find Viafore's body. According to a criminal complaint unveiled Thursday afternoon, prosecutors allege that Graswald intentionally caused Viafore's death. The complaint states that rough waters combined with strong winds caused Viafore’s kayak to overturn. The man was not wearing a life jacket at the time and was unable to turn the capsized boat right-side up. Authorities did not specify what led them to conclude that Graswald was responsible for her fiance's death, only saying that she had made statements implicating herself in the crime. She was arraigned Thursday and ordered held without bail at the Orange County Jail with no bail. She is due back in court May 5. In the days leading up to her arrest, Graswald had been active on her Facebook page, sharing cellphone videos of her cat and uploading a dozen romantic photos of her and Viafore from their time together. As recently as Tuesday, she shared a picture of the happy couple at a lakeside cabin, accompanied by the caption: 'I miss you, my love...' Lingering questions: According to a criminal complaint, prosecutors allege that Graswald intentionally caused Viafore's death - but they wouldn't say how she did it . 'Clever ruse': She managed to make it out of the water and call 911. Last Monday, she asked friends on Facebook to keep praying for her partner and hoped for a miracle . The couple, who had been together for many years, were kayaking on the Hudson River between Plum Point and Bannerman’s Island at around 7.30pm April 19 when Viafore's vessel overturned, sending him into the frigid water. Initially, police believed that Graswald tried to help her fiance and fell into the water. She was eventually scooped up by a passing boat and called 911 after reaching land to report Viafore missing. The 35-year-old was taken to hospital and treated for hypothermia but her fiance has not been found. Viafore's friend Wes Gottlock said he saw them out on the water, but did not discover there was a search underway until later on that evening. A friend in need: Initially, police believed that Graswald tried to help her fiance and fell into the water . Doomed: Viafore was not wearing a life jacket. He was unable to get back into the kayak .

He added that the couple had been together for a long time and have a 'wonderful relationship'. He said the water at this time of the year is 'precarious' as the water is still cold. Last Monday, she asked friends for their prayers as the search continued. She wrote on Facebook: 'I just want to thank everyone for reaching out. Please, keep your prayers for Vince. 'Miracles ARE possible. The authorities are doing everything they can. 'We do not need anyone else getting hurt, as it is very dangerous out there, especially without daylight.

"Since Herman Melville penned his novel Moby Dick more than 150 years ago, scientists have been fascinated by the remarkable attributes of the sperm whale and its kin - the smaller pygmy and dwarf whales. Now, fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago, have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales. The remains, which were discovered in Panama, indicate that the organ involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the whale’s evolution. Fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales. This image shows the right lateral view of the skull of Nanokogia isthmia . Although why this is so remains a mystery. While many whales, dolphins and porpoises have a long fossil record, enabling scientists to understand their evolution, there is limited evidence of sperm whales and smaller pygmy and dwarf whales, which are capable of navigating the ocean deep underwater. Now an international team of scientists, led by the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County has discovered a new species of extinct pygmy sperm whale, called Nanokogia isthmia, which clarifies key aspects of the evolution of these  animals. The  well-preserved skulls of two individuals were unearthed at a sea cliff along the Caribbean coast of Panama. The find will help experts fill in gaps in the evolution of cetaceans. This is the evolutionary tree of sperm whales showing links between extinct and living species, and when the spermaceti organ changed shape . The remains, which were discovered in Panama, indicate that the bone involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the evolution of the sperm whale. In contrast modern sperm whales (a stock image is shown) are much larger than their extinct relatives . The sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. It's only one of three living species in the sperm whale family, along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale. Mature males reach an average length of 52 ft (16 metres) with their head making up one third of their length. They mostly dine on squid and swim to depths of 7,380 FT (2,250 metres) to hunt for prey. They are the second deepest diving mammal, following only Cuvier's beaked whale. The sperm whale's clicking vocalisation - a form of echolocation and communication - can be as loud as 230 decibels underwater, making it the loudest sound produced by any animal. It has the largest brain of any animal on Earth, more than five times heavier than a human's and can live for more than 60 years. It reveals an unexpected level of complexity in the evolution of the spermaceti, which is an organ located within the head that plays a key role in the generation of sound and in the whale’s capacity for echolocation. The study, published in the journal Plos One, shows that at one time small sperm whales measuring  around seven feet (two metres in length) had a much larger spermaceti organ relative to their size than  modern day relatives. It got downsized at least twice during their evolutionary history, including the evolutionary event that gave origin to the living pygmy and dwarf sperm whales. Lead researcher Dr Jorge Velez-Juarbe said: ‘The new discovery gives us a better understanding of the ancient distribution of these poorly known relatives of the sperm whale. ‘Previously we knew of similarly-aged pygmy and dwarf whales from Baja California and Peru, but this new fossil fills in an important geographic gap in the group’s ancient distribution.’ He added: 'Our study is part of a larger scientific effort aimed at understanding the changes in the marine habitats that resulted from the complete closure of the Isthmus of Panama,' referring to the separation between the eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea that took place sometime within the last 10 million years. The new fossil is known from the well-preserved skulls of two individuals which were unearthed at a sea cliff along the Caribbean coast of Panama, shown on this map . The fossils show that at one time small sperm whales measuring  around seven feet (two metres in length) had a much larger spermaceti organ relative to their size.

"After four years orbiting the closest planet to our sun, the Messenger spacecraft will this week make a death-dive into Mercury. But the probe hasn't finished its mission  yet, with new, detailed views emerging of the planet as Messenger spirals closer to its surface. Now Nasa has released an image taken by the probe's Visual and Infrared Spectrometer (Virs) revealing distinct features such as volcanic vents and fresh craters. Nasa has released an image taken by the probe's Visual and Infrared Spectrometer (Virs) to reveal distinct features such as volcanic vents and fresh craters. To highlight the geological features, the images have been overlain on a black and white mosaic from the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) To highlight the geological features, the images have been overlain on a black and white mosaic from the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS). This is an instrument with wide- and narrow-angle cameras that has been mapping the rugged landforms on Mercury’s surface. The spacecraft is expected to smash into the planet's surface at 2.4 miles per second (3.9km/s). The event will take place on Thursday 30 April at 3:30pm Eastern Time (7.30pm GMT). However, when it does, Messenger will be behind Mercury, and hidden from Earth. 'The last couple of hours will probably be pretty quiet,' Mercury mission head Sean Solomon told Nature. 'There will be a final orbit when the spacecraft passes behind the planet and we won't hear from it again. 'I have worked on the mission for 19 years. It's like losing a member of the family. Even pre-knowledge doesn't prepare you completely for the loss.' The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) is an instrument with wide- and narrow-angle cameras that has been mapping the rugged landforms on Mercury’s surface. It was used to helped create these images of Mercury . The spacecraft is expected to smash into the planet's surface on Thursday 30 April after a four-year mission . Among the features Messenger has revealed to scientists in the past month are patterns of distinctive hollows - each around a couple of hundred metres wide - in the bottom of a huge impact basin. It has also sent back detailed images of huge 1.2 mile (2km) high cliffs that cut across a crater named Duccio on the surface. Another image shows a 621 miles (1,000km) long cliff that rises 1.8 miles (3km) above the surface, called Enterprise Rupes. Researchers have uncovered the mystery of Mercury's 'stealth' colour scheme. The say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted Mercury black over billions of years. It solves the mystery of Mercury's unusual colouring - which has baffled scientists. On average, Mercury is much darker than its closest airless neighbour, our Moon. Airless bodies are known to be darkened by micrometeorite impacts and bombardment of solar wind, processes that create a thin coating of dark iron nanoparticles on the surface. But spectral data from Mercury suggests its surface contains very little nanophase iron, certainly not enough to account for its dim appearance. As comets approach Mercury's neighborhood near the sun, they often start to break apart. Cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight, so Mercury would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets. Scientists have calculated that after billions of years of bombardment, Mercury's surface should be anywhere from three to six percent carbon. Data sent back by Mercury suggests these cliffs, or lobate scarps as they are called, have formed as Mercury has cooled and contracted over time, creating dramatic tectonic faults on the surface. Another image shows a meteorite crater that has almost completely filled with lava on Mercury's northern volcanic plains, leaving just the hint of a rim behind. It also shows how the contracting surface of the planet has also created strange formations where ridges and cliffs have hit other lava filled craters. Among the images sent back by Messenger as its mission draws to an end is this picture of 1.2 mile-high (2km) cliffs cutting through the Carnegie crater. They are thought to have formed as Mercury cooled . Distinctive hollows on the floor of the Zeami impact basin on Mercury can be seen in this Messenger image . Andy Calloway, Messenger Mission operatoins manager at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, said: 'The Messenger spacecraft operates in one of the most challenging and demanding space environments in our solar system. 'We have met that challenge directly through innovation and hard work, as exemplified by the stunning discoveries and data return achievements. 'Our only regret is that we have insufficient propellant to operate another 10 years, but we look forward to the incredible science returns planned for the final eight months of the mission.' Launched in August 2004, Messenger has traveled more than 4.9 billion miles (7.9 billion kilometers) during its mission to Mercury. Its journey included 15 trips around the sun before it entered orbit around Mercury in 2011 - the first spacecraft to ever do so. During its mission is has acquired more than 250,000 images and collected more than 10 terabytes of data with its suite of seven instruments. It has helped reveal volcanic vents that measure up to 15 miles (24km) across that were once sources for the large volumes of lava that have covered the surface and carved out valleys. It has also revealed Mercury's complex internal structure and that the planet has an unusually large core that is still partially liquid. On 6 April engineers used the last of the Messenger spacecraft's hydrazine fuel to try to push it into a higher orbit. However, the tanks ran dry before they could raise it to more than 11 miles (18km) above the surface. This image shows some of the mysterious irregularly shaped hollows on Mercury's surface in greater detail . The above artist's impression shows Messenger as it orbits above the surface of Mercury. It is due to impact on the surface at the end of April as the planet's gravity slowly pulls it down out of its current orbit . Messenger has also revealed the temperature of Mercury's surface.

"Jimmy Anderson is unique. From the moment he emerged as a raw youngster in the England team you could see that. England have always produced swing bowlers but not one with Anderson’s skills. It did not take long to realise he would have an outstanding career. He knew what he was doing, too, as soon as he came into the England side ahead of the 2003 World Cup. He did not need coaching and he did not need telling what to do. Jimmy Anderson edged closer to Sir Ian Botham's record for England's leading wicket-taker in Tests . Look at him on Tuesday. If you had asked anyone which end he would choose, almost everybody would have said the other end to the one Anderson picked. It would just seem natural that he’d want the wind to assist his outswing. Not Jimmy. He wanted to swing it away from the left-hander so he started at the other end and his stats will tell you that you can’t argue with him. It is to his credit that he knows his own mind. There have been a lot of English cricketers over the years who need telling what to do but Jimmy is stubborn and I like that. His attitude is almost: ‘You do what you want to do and I’ll do what I want to do.’ It’s a great advantage for a captain to have someone like that. Anderson celebrates the dismissal of Devon Smith on day two in Antigua, his 381st Test wicket . The 32-year-old is playing in his 100th Test match for England this week in Antigua . Yes, he can be a bit difficult. You talk to Andrew Strauss about Anderson and he’ll tell you about the arguments they had. Strauss would want to attack and have an extra slip if the ball was swinging but Anderson would want an extra cover if he was pitching the ball up because he hates going for runs. You have to take him on occasionally and that’s healthy. Reaching 100 Tests as a fast bowler and being on the brink of becoming England’s leading wicket-taker is more about character and the fight in Jimmy than about his skills. He has had to be tough to get this far. He remembers very well the bad times — putting out the cones, bringing out the drinks and the time spent on the sidelines with injury. He had to go back to county cricket and watch people not as good as him play for England. Anderson has been the leader of England's bowling attack for a while and will be vital in the Ashes . It is far from easy for a fast bowler to play 100 Tests and in Anderson’s case you cannot say he has lost a yard of pace because of all that hard work he has put in. He will be sorely missed when he does call it a day. England must be careful with him now they are in a run of 17 Tests in nine months. If Anderson were to miss any Ashes Tests it would be a serious blow to their hopes of regaining the urn because Stuart Broad is not at his best and Chris Jordan and Ben Stokes are still making their way. Don’t wrap him up in cotton wool, because he is a bowler who needs overs in his legs. But I’m not sure Anderson, who will be 33 in July, should be playing one-day cricket, in which he has never been a world-beater. England need him in Test cricket as long as possible. Anderson was presented with a special silver cap by Michael Atherton (right) for reaching 100 Tests . A youthful Anderson pictured on Test debut against Zimbabwe at Lord's in May 2003 . He wants to carry on for as long as possible, that’s for sure, but he will have to set goals for himself, like coming back at Australia after being on the end of the second 5-0 Ashes defeat in his career. Anderson has said he has changed since the shoving incident with Ravindra Jadeja at Trent Bridge last summer but I haven’t noticed any less aggression… and nor should there be. He needs that aggression in his game and he knows where the line is.","Jimmy Anderson two wickets behind Sir Ian Botham's record of 383 .

"Both Chelsea and the Premier League are furious with the BBC for allowing it to be known that the Premier League trophy was being displayed on the centre circle at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. There is great sensitivity at Chelsea about not presuming their title success before they are crowned champions and manager Jose Mourinho has warned players and fans to concentrate on first beating Crystal Palace on Sunday before celebrating. Yet a 20-strong stadium tour group at Chelsea clearly saw the Premier League silverware on the pitch although a security guard attempted to cover it up to prevent photographs being taken. Didier Drogba celebrates against Leicester as Chelsea took a step closer to the Premier League title . Jose Mourinho has warned players and fans to concentrate on first beating Crystal Palace before celebrating . The Premier League had agreed to a request from the BBC to film the trophy at Stamford Bridge to help with their programme preparation in advance of Chelsea’s two games this week. But it was on the strict understanding that the big prize was not seen at Chelsea by members of the public, who would then assume the club were taking their Premier League triumph for granted. A BBC spokeswoman said: ‘We were filming a sequence for use in the event that Chelsea win the Premier League and the footage will only air on that basis. We made every effort to ensure the trophy wasn’t exposed to the public, but unfortunately it was briefly visible from a distance to a stadium tour.’ Chelsea allowed the Premier League trophy, lifted by John Terry in 2010, to be displayed at Stamford Bridge for the BBC on the strict understanding that the big prize was not seen by members of the public . On Thursday night, Tony McCoy received what is sure to be the first of a whole host of awards to mark his retirement as the greatest ever jump jockey when given the Sport Industry’s Outstanding Contribution to British Sport accolade. The presentation was made by Clare Balding, who opted to present the Boat Race rather than McCoy’s last Grand National, and Thierry Henry, who was originally due to hand over the jockeys’ championship trophy to McCoy at Sandown last Saturday before being replaced by Ian Wright. Recently retired jockey AP McCoy was in attendance with his wife Chanelle for the BT Sport Industry Awards in Battersea on Thursday and received the  Outstanding Contribution to British Sport accolade . There is still plenty of uncertainty around the exact responsibilities of the England director of cricket with only a skeleton job description having been sent out. And another win by Peter Moores’s side in the third Test against West Indies will further advance the view that the ECB should wait and see how the New Zealand and Ashes series play out before making their choice. Meanwhile, although new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison gives the early impression he has little or no time for the media, at least his director of communications appointment Chris Haynes has ordered daily newspapers to be delivered again to the ECB HQ at Lord’s - certainly a step in the right direction.

Tigers are putting on dinners, big-screen showings of matches, entertainment on Leicester match days and even a rival fan zone to the official one in the city. Both ER 2015 and World Rugby are annoyed with Tigers’ tactics. But with no major events legislation in place they are relying on Leicester Council to halt the ambush marketing. Meanwhile former England captain Will Carling, who runs his own business, is on ER 2015’s radar as he is looking to set up an unofficial hospitality venue as close as he can to Twickenham. The Portuguese Open tennis in Estoril this week is being staged thanks to the patronage of football super-agent Jorge Mendes who is leading a consortium that has rescued the event from closure. Organisers did not have the funds to carry on the 25-year-old tournament this year until tennis fan Mendes, whose clients include Jose Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo, became involved.","Chelsea agreed to request from BBC to film the trophy at Stamford Bridge .

"At half-time, everything pointed to another humiliating English defeat in Dublin. Such was the control Leinster had been able to exert on Bath in an utterly one-sided first half punctuated only by a single piece of individual brilliance by fly-half George Ford, it was impossible to see a way back into the contest for the West Countrymen. Outmuscled at the breakdown, bullied in the scrum and laboured in the line-out, Bath were in danger of going down every bit as tamely as England had a month ago. Bath fly half George Ford ghosts past Leinster full-back Rob Kearney on his way to fine individual score at the Aviva Stadium . The England No 10's solo-try was the only score that the West Country outfit managed to register in the first-half . By the end, remarkably, the three-time champions Leinster were hanging on for dear life as wave after wave of Bath attack threatened to deliver one of the great European comebacks. They fell short, but there was pride to be taken in this. Driven on by their pocket general Ford, Bath somehow came within a whisker of finding a way into the last four. Had it not been for a penalty conceded by replacement Matt Garvey with seconds on the clock, they may well have won. ‘There’s a lot of disappointment,’ said Bath head coach Mike Ford. ‘Certainly in the second half we are a lot better than the first. We’re so disappointed because we are a lot better than we showed today, especially in the first half. Ford is congratulated by Bath substitutes Sam Burgess (left) and Max Lahiff following his touchdown . Kearney is taken out in the air by Anthony Watson leading to the full-back being dispatched to the sin-bin for 10 minutes . ‘But it doesn’t dent our belief in what we’re doing. It reinforces it. We lost the game in the first half but I believe that will make us stronger. I’m proud of the boys, but we’ll be even more gutted when we watch the video. It comes down to small margins and I thought the penalty at the end was a dead-set penalty to us.’ He would say that, of course. But his sentiment was correct and Ford insisted his team will retain their determination to attack for the remainder of the Aviva Premiership season. Fly-half Ford was exceptional. Rarely making a false move, dragging his side along with some intelligent kicking, brave distribution and a sharp eye for the gap. His first-half try was a masterpiece of fly-half play as he took the ball flat to line, flashed a dummy and scooted through a non-existent gap before rounding full-back Rob Kearney to score. Bath lock Stuart Hooper crashes over for his side's second try following another dazzling break from Ford . But despite his 21st-minute moment of brilliance, it looked for all the world as if Leinster would repeat Ireland’s Six Nations strangulation of England as Bath’s discipline failed under the pressure of Leinster’s superior set-piece and domination at the breakdown. That impression was compounded when Bath full-back Anthony Watson, one of four visiting players who only a month ago suffered Six Nations heartache on the same Aviva Stadium pitch, spent 10 minutes in the sin-bin for a reckless aerial challenge on Kearney. Referee Jerome Garces showed Watson a yellow card, despite the shameful pleas by three Leinster players for him to be shown red, and Leinster centre Ian Madigan kicked two more penalties in his absence to send his side in 15-5 up at half-time and seemingly in complete control. Ian Madigan was in imperious kicking form as the Leinster centre fired over six penalties . But Bath showed their mettle with a wonderful second-half revival. Despite their disappointment at failing to progress, Bath should take enormous confidence in knowing that with more precision they could, should even, have won this game. Their determination to put width on the ball and play at high tempo must be applauded, even if it hasn’t yet brought the silverware the huge investment in their squad will demand sooner rather than later. Leinster scrum half Isaac Boss fires out a pass during a frantic opening quarter in Dublin . The 22-year-old Ford was at the heart of everything they did while Watson proved razor-sharp every time he received the ball. With 47 minutes gone, and Leinster winger Fergus McFadden off the field with a concussion sustained in a tackle from Kyle Eastmond, Ford produced his second moment of magic. This time he stepped on the inside of Devin Toner, before turning on the after-burners and feeding inside to his second-row captain Stuart Hooper to crash over. Suddenly, Bath believed. Another Madigan penalty — his sixth of the afternoon — made it 18-12 to Leinster but Bath had the bit between their teeth. Watson fells the full force of Ben Teo'o's tackle as Kyle Eastmond (left) moves in to support his team-mate . Bath flanker Carl Fearns eyes up Madigan in defence as Jimmy Gopperth (right) looks to make the hit . Watson made a scintillating break from deep within his half before feeding the ball to Ford who in turn flipped a pass to Horacio Agulla. Agonisingly, with the line beckoning, the winger dropped the ball and the chance was lost. It proved a critical moment in an absorbing game. Ford kicked another penalty to drag the score back to 18-15 with six minutes left but the visitors were unable to land the killer blow as Garvey was harshly penalised by Garces with seconds on the clock. Ultimately the first half had cost Ford’s men a crack at Toulon or Wasps in the semi-final. ‘It was a pretty stressful last 15 minutes,’ Leinster director of rugby Matt O’Connor said. ‘I was pretty relaxed before that but they came back really strong. Watson is dangerous from broken field and he cut us up a couple of times. They had threats all over the field. I was pretty relieved by the end.’ Leinster flanker Jordi Murphy rises high to claim a lineout as the Bath pack get ready to defend another attack .

"One in every six species of animals could face extinction if we do nothing to combat climate change, scientists claim. The bleak study says animals are most at risk in South America, Australia, and New Zealand. While another group of researchers have added to the forecast with a separate study, which warns that marine animals near North America, Antarctica and New Zealand are most likely to die out. Scientists warn that one in every six species of animals could face extinction if we do nothing to combat climate change and those in South America, Australia, and New Zealand are most at risk. A stock image of an endangered flightless kākāpō parrot, native to New Zealand, is shown . Scientists from the University of Connecticut warned that one in six animals are at risk of extinction, particularly in regions where shrinking habitats and barriers to migration compound the problem. Dr Mark Urban  studied data from 131 biodiversity studies to come to his bleak conclusions, which are published in the journal, Science. He proposes that the rate of extinction will speed up in line with rising temperatures. If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2 per cent. Researchers from the University of Connecticut warned  animals in regions where shrinking habitats and barriers to migration compound the problem are most at risk. Antarctica, which is home to many species of penguins (stock image) is one of these places . But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16 per cent, he said. 'If the world does not come together and control greenhouse gas emissions and we allow the Earth to warm considerably we will face a potential loss of one in six species,' Dr Urban told the BBC. 'Many species will be able to shift their ranges and keep up with climate change whereas others will not either because their habitat has disappeared or because they can't reach their habitat anymore.' If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2%. But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16%, the study warns, which could be bad news for endangered jaguars . In a separate study from the University of Berkeley in California, scientists examined extinction rates in fossils over 23 million years. They found that the tropics and Antarctica are most at risk and animals such as whales and dolphins are especially vulnerable . Another study published at the same time has compounded the warning. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and other institutions examined fossils to determine which marine life is most at risk of dying out, based on previous rates of extinction. A study by the University of Connecticut has found that global warming is accelerating the world’s extinctions. One in six species could face extinction due to the effects of climate change if carbon emissions continue at current rates, it warns. Dr Mark Urban from the university came to the conclusion by correlating information from 131 biodiversity studies. If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2%. But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16%, he said. Animals in small geographic ranges are most at risk - with whales, dolphins and seals proving particularly vulnerable in the past, the study, which is also published in Science, says. The researchers used patterns from the fossil record to assess the natural extinction risk of animals living in the oceans today. Comparing these patterns with areas where human activities, such as fishing, impact the oceans revealed areas that may be particularly sensitive. These areas included  regions of the tropics such as the Indo-Pacific and the Caribbean, as well as regions such as Antarctica that harbour many unique species. ‘The implications of these patterns for the future of coastal marine ecosystems will depend on how natural risk and current threats interact,’ said co-author Dr Paul Harnik, an assistant professor of geosciences at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. ‘By understanding these patterns in the past, we hope to provide a framework for understanding global change.’ The detailed study examined 2,397 fossil types over the past 23 million years. They found that worldwide patterns of extinction remained remarkably similar over the whole period, with the same groups of animals showing similar rates of extinction. The researchers used patterns from the fossil record to assess the natural extinction risk of animals living in the oceans today. On the left in this image are fossil examples used, and on the right are living examples, with whales and sharks shown top and bottom respectively . The detailed study examined 2,397 fossil genera over the past 23 million years across a variety of animal groups. The team then compared the 'natural' risk of extinction, based on historic evidence, with current threats from humans and climate change . By combining this ‘natural’ extinction risk with threats from humans and climate change, they created a global map of future hotspots of extinction. ‘Our goal was to diagnose which species are vulnerable in the modern world, using the past as a guide,’ said lead author Dr Seth Finnegan, an assistant professor of integrative biology at UC Berkeley. ‘We believe the past can inform the way we plan our conservation efforts. ‘However, there is a lot more work that needs to be done to understand the causes underlying these patterns and their policy implications.’ England will experience a significant increase in the number of record-breaking warm years due to geenhouse gas emissions, scientists have claimed. A study of the Central England Temperature (CET) record, which dates back to 1659, found exceptionally warm years have become 13 times more likely as a result. Shown are the top here are echinoids (sea urchins), and at the bottom are clams. Clams and mussels - so-called bivalves - had about one-tenth the extinction risk of mammals .","Two studies warn that rising temperatures could wipe out animals .

"When Instagram users try to search for the aubergine, or eggplant, emoji hashtag no posts appear - even if there are posts tagged in this way . Last night Instagram rolled out its latest update that lets users create and search for hashtags using emoji. But it appears not all emoji hashtags are created equal. When people try to search for the aubergine, or eggplant, emoji using a hashtag on the app, no posts appear - even though there are posts that have been tagged with it. And it is believe to be because the emoji is commonly used to represent male genitalia and may be attached to images containing nudity. The anomaly was discovered by Katie Notopoulos from Buzzfeed. Emoji hashtags were released as part of Instagram's latest app update, which also added three new filters and a redesigned Love button. Hashtags can now be used with single emoji, multiple emoji or can be combined with text in post, comments, captions and when using the Explore tab. Instagram told MailOnline it is not commenting on the eggplant anomaly. But, given that the emoji could potentially be tagged onto images that contain nudity, it is likely the app is restricting its use under its community guidelines. It also appears the hashtag itself isn't banned across the app, instead it just can't be searched for. Instagram's guidelines explain: 'We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. 'This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. 'It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.' Ms Notopoulos has even created a hashtag called #freetheeggplant. Despite issuing an apparent ban on searching for the aubergine, searches for emojis such as the gun (left) and a syringe (right) are allowed. Instagram doesn't ban pictures of guns, although it doesn't allow the sale of guns. In terms of the needle, many images posted using this hashtag include tattoos and giving blood . Following yesterday's update, Instagram users can post, explore other people's photos and interact with captions using emoji. Emoji are popular in the Instagram community, with nearly half of Instagram captions (pictured on Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's page) already featuring the small pictures . But she also noted that despite issuing an apparent blanket ban on searching for the aubergine emoji, searches for emojis such as the gun and a needle and syringe are allowed. Instagram doesn't ban pictures of guns on the app, although it doesn't allow the sale of guns. In terms of the needle emoji, many images posted using this hashtag include tattoos and giving blood. However, if an image was to be posted of a person using drugs or guns in an illegal way Instagram would remove it. From sending countless 'poops' to adding hearts to sentimental messages, your choice of emoji says a lot about you. And experts recently analysed more than one billion uses of the tiny icons to see how they are used across different languages. Study found that the French are the most loved-up, sending more hearts than any other region, while Australians use double the average amount of alcohol-themed emoji. Swiftkey recently analysed more than one billion sets of emoji data, covering 800 emoji across 60 categories. The most popular categories for each language are pictured . In the US, gadget users send 30 per cent more LGBT-related emoji than the average, including a rainbow, men holding hands or women holding hands. This is followed by Canada and Malaysia. To plot the differences in use, London-based keyboard app firm SwiftKey analysed more than one billion sets of emoji data, covering 800 emoji across 60 categories. The findings of the report came from an analysis of data over a four-month period between October 2014 and January 2015, and includes both Android and iOS devices. The languages studied include English, including US, UK and Australian, Spanish, Vietnamese, French, Malaysian, Arabic, German, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Italian and Russian. Canadians are twice as raunchy as all other languages, according to the emoji study. They use twice as many so-called 'raunchy humour emoji', including the banana, eggplant, peach, cherries and Cancer astrological symbol than average. Vietnamese and French are half as raunchy as the average and US English speakers are the top users of the eggplant emoji at more than double the average. Italians use the banana emoji the most. Canadians are twice as raunchy as all other languages, according to the emoji study. They use twice as many so-called 'raunchy humour emoji', including the banana, eggplant, peach, cherries and Cancer astrological symbol than average (pictured) This would rely on either the image being reported by a fellow member or Instagram seeing the image itself. Subsequently, this suggests it will potentially allow images of illegal activity to appear in search, when tagged in this way, and act on it retrospectively but won't allow images of nudity to appear in the search results at all. Following the launch of the new feature, Instagram told MailOnline: 'Over the past few years, emoji have become part of a universal visual language. 'From today, on Instagram emoji will now work within hashtags, so you can add them to your posts, search for them on the Explore page, and tap on them in captions.' Emoji are popular in the Instagram community, with nearly half of Instagram captions already featuring the small pictures. The most popular emoji on Instagram is the crying with laughter face, followed by the face with love hearts for eyes and blowing a kiss emoji. Other popular emoji are the OK hand gesture, two hearts, clapping hands, another crying with laughter face, thumbs up, smiley face and kiss mark (pictured left to right) Instagram also unveiled three new filters.

"For one rail passenger it was like being ‘held hostage’. Another compared conditions in her carriage to an oven. Stranded for up to five hours, they endured discomfort, frustration and danger more associated with travel in the Third World. In fact they were among thousands on two commuter trains near Clapham Junction – Britain’s busiest interchange station – during morning rush hour as services descended into chaos.

Waiting game: London Victoria station earlier this evening after a power cut in led to severe delays . Extremely busy: MailOnline reader Junior Imode sent in this picture of queuing at London Bridge station earlier tonight, at the entrance to the Jubilee line on the London Underground . Assistance: Staff were on hand to help passengers facing a difficult journey home from London Victoria . Furious passengers were stuck between stations in South London after a power supply problem led to four lines being closed. On platforms, fights broke out when trains did arrive as passengers pushed their way through the doors. Police boarded the stranded trains to hand out water, and paramedics were on hand in case travellers, including pregnant women, were affected as the crowded carriages became unbearably hot. Passengers were not allowed to leave the trains by themselves due to safety concerns. As the chaos unfolded across the network, there were at least 338 cancellations and 138 part cancellations that either missed stops or terminated before their destination. In all, 321 trains were delayed for a total of more than 600 hours. Some 1,200 people on the 7.02am from East Grinstead to Victoria were evacuated from the train after it was stuck for four hours a quarter of a mile south of Clapham Junction. Firefighters used a ladder to help them down before they were led along the track to safety. British Transport Police started evacuating passengers on the stranded service at 10am and passed water to others trapped on board with no air conditioning. Emergency services: British Transport Police officers began evacuating stranded train passengers to waiting buses at around 10am and water was passed through to others still stuck in sweltering temperatures on board . Aid: Fire officers help a man disembark from the  stranded 7.02am service to London using a makeshift ladder . Helped off: One train carrying more than 1,200 passengers between East Grinstead and Victoria was evacuated . PC James Vernon, 40, was one of the 900 passengers rescued and admitted conditions on board were 'horrendous'. A planned strike by rail workers on Bank Holiday Monday in a dispute over the sacking of a colleague has been called off. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union on East Coast trains based at Edinburgh's Waverley station were due to walk out for 24 hours. The union said the dispute had been resolved and the sacked employee has reached a 'satisfactory settlement' with the company. He said: 'It was absolutely stifling on board the train, it was horrendous. There was so much mis-information about what was going to happen. 'When they decided we were going to be evacuated, we had to wait for everyone to go down two metal steps and go one person at a time along the railway line.' Around 1,000 passengers on the 6.56am from Brighton, East Sussex – also a Southern Rail service – were stranded for nearly five hours. The train should have reached Victoria at 8.15am, but it was finally towed into Wandsworth Common station just before 1pm. One of its passengers, student Hannah Phillips, 20, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: 'I was lucky that I was carrying a bottle of water with me as it was getting very hot on the train. 'This is probably the worst train journey I've experienced.' Walking off: Commuters on board the stranded 7.02am service took photographs of the evacuation process . Stranded: Up to 2,000 commuters were eventually led along tracks onto rail replacement buses today . Another passenger on the held-up Brighton train was Ben Goode. He tweeted: 'This is a shambles.' As the service went into meltdown, with the Gatwick Express unable to run and office workers hours late for work, tempers frayed among passengers on platforms. 'Brighton train on, Brighton train cancelled, on, cancelled etc. Not having fun heading from Lndn. Network rail is a shambles.' - Donna Burtchaell . 'I used to work for a train operator so understand but today was a shambles....' - Chris Scott . 'I see Network Rail are making peoples lives a misery again, stuck on trains outside Clapham for four hours, railway in this country, joke.' - Johnny Wishbone . 'Network rail get us off this train and let us walk to clapham! We've been here nearly 2 hours and taking us to Wandsworth is a joke!' - Katie Glaysher . 'Train 28 minutes late....missed 2 connections but Network Rail don't think that's worthy of any compensation.' -Victoria Slater . One tweeted: ‘Absolute chaos @ #Claphamjunction. Fighting to get on trains, falling down gap between train & platform. It’s dangerous.’ Anna Roberts, a journalist on the Brighton train, reported: ‘It’s been nearly four hours now. Police and paramedics boarded because there is no air conditioning. 'They were bringing water. With the power off, it’s like an oven. Police said it’s too dangerous to walk down the track.’ Another passenger tweeted: ‘I’m being held hostage by @SouthernRailUk. There are hundreds of us packed in sweaty carriages. No demands have been made yet.’ Veterinary student Farid Rahman, 19, who was on the evacuated train, said: ‘After three hours the fire brigade came and everyone was evacuated one by one from one door – so the process was lengthy.’ The cause of the power failure was being investigated last night amid claims by railway staff that it could have been down to work done by Network Rail the night before. A broken third rail – which supplies power from the track to the trains – led to the mayhem by disabling the trains’ ‘shoe’, which conducts the power. The chaos came after Sir Peter Hendy, transport chief for London, said commuter services into the capital were appalling, with ‘Gestapo’ ticket inspectors and ‘Wild West’ conditions. Single file: The problem struck between Wandsworth Common and Clapham Junction in the middle of the morning rush hour. People are pictured being evacuated from one of the trains .

Sam Burgess made his first Premiership start at number six and, despite making a few handling errors, impressed in his new position. Bath head coach Mike Ford praised Burgess's efforts following the game and stated 'you've seen the future tonight', with regards to the former rugby league star's role going forward.

Newcastle responded with a Sinoti Sinoti try but Anthony Watson's score on the stroke of half-time earned Bath a 19-13 lead at the interval, and then Matt Banahan went over in the 42nd minute to give the visitors their bonus point. Bath are now six points behind Premiership leaders Northampton in the table and four above third-placed Saracens. Rory Clegg's fourth-minute penalty after Bath dropped the scrum gave Newcastle the lead, but it did not last long with Ford putting a penalty in the corner which led to a scrum. From that set-piece, No 8 Leroy Houston picked up and Ford fed Devoto for the big centre to score under the posts. Ford slotted over the conversion to make it 7-3 in the ninth minute and he went to the corner again with another penalty soon after, which led to centre Jonathan Joseph's long cut-out pass finding Rokoduguni to score in the corner in the 16th minute. Bath winger Semesa Rokoduguni dives over for a try following a sweeping attack from the visitors . The extra points were missed on that occasion and Clegg was able to cut the difference to six with a second penalty in the 23rd minute. Rokoduguni crossed again in the 27th minute but after checking with the TMO, referee JP Doyle ruled out the score because of a Bath knock-on close to the line. The Falcons made the best use of the let-off with a try from Sinoti in the 31st minute. The winger looked to be going nowhere with a run from right to left but he brushed off four successive tackles with an aggressive run along the touchline to score in the corner. Clegg's conversion put Newcastle 13-12 in front, but they could not hang on to the lead with Bath scoring their third try right on half-time. And what a cracker it was with Ford using a subtle delayed pass to allow full-back Watson to scythe through under the posts for another converted try. Anthony Watson runs a sublime line off Devoto to score Bath's fourth try of the night . Bath's bonus point score came just two minutes after the break with Banahan sailing through a gap which was made by the dummy runner. Ford converted but Newcastle replied with a 47th-minute Clegg penalty five minutes later. Tom Catterick added another penalty in the 68th minute to put Newcastle in losing bonus point range at 26-19 after the Falcons had pummelled away with successive line-out drives and Bath replacement Carl Fearns was sin-binned for dragging it down. The majority of the 7,492 crowd were not happy with the decision to take the points but with just over 10 minutes left it looked the right one, until Ford kicked a 73rd-minute penalty to deny Newcastle their bonus.","Ollie Devoto, Semesa Rokoduguni, Anthony Watson and Matt Banahan all crossed for Bath .

"A veteran Georgia middle school teacher has been removed from the classroom after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and some parents complained. Nancy Perry will no longer teach students at Dublin Middle School and will retire at the end of the year, city schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter announced on Tuesday. Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained . A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments. Scott said he immediately requested a parent-teacher conference to which Perry brought along her husband Bill, who sits on the county Board of Education. Instead of discussing Nancy Perry's classroom comments, Scott says that she and her husband showed him what he described as internet propaganda. 'She showed it to me and said, ""See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old as they're coming through the birth canal.""' Superintendent Ledbetter said Perry was already planning on retiring before the complaint about her behavior. 'On behalf of the School District, we want to apologize to the student and to his parents,' he said at a school board meeting. Scott said he requested a parent-teacher conference, but Nancy Perry brought along her husband Bill, pictured above, who sites on the Board of Education.  The pair showed him what he described as anti-Obama internet propaganda . City schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter says school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on parent-teacher meetings . 'It is not the place of teachers to attempt to persuade students about religious or political beliefs.' Scott also addressed the community at the meeting, saying his family had been ridiculed and had racial slurs thrown at them. Scott is black and Perry is white. 'We've lost loved ones in the community because a line was drawn,' Scott said. 'Either you were for my son or you were for the teacher.' Ledbetter also apologized for the actions of Perry's husband, who he said shouldn't have attended the parent-teacher conference. Ledbetter said school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on a parent-teacher meeting. 'See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old' Nancy Perry is alleged to have told Jimmie Scott .","Nancy Perry won't teach again at Dublin Middle School after giving students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama .

"Neuroscientists have succeeded in creating 'ghosts' in the laboratory by tricking the brains of test subjects into feeling an unexpected 'presence' in the room. The spooky experiment which conjured up a ghostly illusion in the laboratory has proved once and for all that it's only our mind playing tricks. The invisible, creepy presence reported by so many people over the centuries is just a set of mixed-up signals in the brain, the researchers say. Scroll down for video . The scientists say the experiment that what some people believe to be a ghostly presence is just a trick of the brain. 'This confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain,' said Professor Olaf Blanke of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland . Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling. The sensation was re-created by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers. Under normal circumstances the brain is able to form a unified self-perception, but lead researcher Olaf Blanke explained that when this malfunctions the brain creates a second representation of its body. 'Most of the research predicts that we cannot tickle ourselves because our brain precisely predicts of one hand, of my hand, touching my body or touching one or another position. However, if this is not fully integrated because I'm doing it or if I cannot correctly predict because somebody else were to touch me; in those cases of uncertainty, very often in those cases of double touch, the response is that you feel ticklish or tickled by somebody else,' said Blanke who is leading the research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL). The findings appear to explain the common experience people have of feeling an unseen presence, even a guardian angel, demon or apparition stalking their movements. These are frequently reported by people in extreme physical or emotional situations, such as mountaineers and explorers, or those grieving for a lost loved one. They are also associated with medical conditions that affect the brain, including epilepsy, migraine, schizophrenia and cancer. Blanke's team began by analyzing the brains of 12 patients with neurological disorders who have reported having such a secondary representation of their body, in other words a ghost sensation. MRI scans revealed abnormalities with three brain regions involved in self-awareness, movement and the sense of position in space. These brain regions together contribute to multi sensory signal processing, important for the perception of one's own body. The scientists then conducted an experiment to 'trigger' a similar neurological sensation in healthy subjects. Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling. 'We built a robot which allows us to distort this signal, which makes it hard - or impossible actually - our robot makes it impossible for our healthy subjects now to predict those signals. Artificial 'ghosts' have been conjured up by scientists in an experiment so spooky that two participants asked for it to stop. By having signals mixed up in their brains (shown), volunteers were made to feel that a creepy 'presence' was behind them. They counted up to four phantoms positioned where no-one was standing . 'And one side effect of this was, instead of saying that I'm touching myself or that I'm touching with my index finger my own body; subjects reported in those scenarios where we distorted the signal that somebody else was touching them. 'And this somebody else; actually some subjects reacted very strongly and they reported that not only that somebody else was touching them, but somebody else was also present. 'So strong, that some of them decided not to finish the experiment,' said Blanke. The robot creates a disconnect between the movements subjects make and the sensations they were expecting, mixing up 'sensorimotor' brain signals of individuals so that their brains no longer recognized input signals as belonging to their own body. Blanke said the system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances. The study, published in Current Biology, said that 'simple sensorimotor conflicts induced, in healthy subjects, an experience that shares crucial aspects with positive, first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia'. Blanke says the main aim of the study is to better understand some of the symptoms of neurological or psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia. He hopes the research could lead to a similar robotic system that doesn't induce neurological symptoms, but helps patients overcome such sensations. 'We are very interested in pursuing this line of work to build similar robotic devices based on our prototype that do not induce psychotic symptoms in healthy subjects but a similar robot that could be used to down regulate psychotic symptoms in actual patients.' Here an unamed participant takes part in the experiment. The robot made humans feel the illusory presence of a non-existent 'ghost'. The study was conducted on 12 individuals with various neurological conditions such as epilepsy, stroke, migraine and tumours . Such therapies, he says, could include a wearable device that would help neurological patients down-regulate - or reduce - these feelings; in effect a device to reverse the sensations they created in the lab. 'A more future version we are still working on at the moment could be a completely wearable set-up of the device that you have seen. So this is something that the patient will have maybe inserted in his clothes; smart textiles in a way. And should there be strong manifestations in this case, one could provide feedback in a way that is now not optimized to induce such a psychotic state but to dis-regulate or to down-regulate such a state.' Two of the 12 healthy participants were so disturbed by the experience that they asked the scientists to halt the experiment, the results of which appear in the journal Current Biology.","Swiss researchers carried out an experiment to make artificial 'ghosts'

"A Muslim cleric has issued a fatwa ordering a woman to agree to sex with her husband even if they are on the back of a camel, as he denounces the idea of marital rape as 'made up by European people'. Perak Mufti Tan Sri Harussani Zakaria claims that, according to the Prophet Mohammed, a wife can only refuse her husband sex if she is menstruating, sick or just given birth. Her right to say no, he asserted, was lost the moment her father handed her to her new husband. Outrageous: Perak Mufti Tan Sri Harussani Zakaria said women should never say no to their husbands - and claimed marital rape was 'made up' by Europeans, so there was no need for Muslims to take any notice . Zakaria told Malay Mail Online:  'Even the Prophet says even when they're riding on the back of the camel, when the husband asks her, she must give. 'So there's no such thing as rape in marriage. This is made by European people, why should we follow?' Unsurprisingly, his religious edict and outrageous comments have horrified many in his home country of Malaysia and beyond. Writing in MalaysiaKini.com, Joshua Teh, an advocacy officer at the Women’s Centre for Change in Penang, said: 'Have we not provided excuses for rapists long enough? 'We need to recognise that women, both married and not married, have the right over their own bodies, and that includes the right to reject sex. 'To turn a blind eye to that right is to reduce the woman’s dignity as a person and to further normalise the prevalence of sexual crimes in our society.' Disgusted: His claim that women couldn't even say no if they were on a camel has horrified many in the mainly Muslim country, where an estimated 3,000 women a year are raped . However, another mufti has said sex between a married couple must take place in a 'harmonious situation so as not to hurt each other' - which means rape is not possible. What's more, Dr Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin - known as 'Dr Maz' - has said a man is not allowed to refuse sex with his wife, nor is he allowed to stop without 'getting consensus from his wife for fear that she did not have time to enjoy'.","Malaysian cleric claims marital rape is  'made up by European people'

"Laura Robson put her injury frustrations to one side over the weekend by heading to Tortuga, a country music festival in Florida. The 21-year-old shared a photo on Instagram of her soaking up the sun with two friends and captioned the image 'Country music is the best music #tortuga.' In recent weeks, Robson has been stepping up her attempts at getting back on the tennis court after a lengthy absence. Laura Robson (centre) shared a picture on Instagram of her at Tortuga festival with two friends . Robson's last appearance came in the 2014 Australian Open first round where she lost in straight sets . Robson (left) had to wear a protective cast last year but tweeted a picture back on the court last month . Her last appearance was over a year ago, in the first round of the 2014 Australian Open, where she was swept aside in straight sets by Kirtsen Flipkens and she has not played since due to a left wrist problem. She had tendon surgery  and is now nearing a return, although she withdrew from a qualifying event for the Miami Open last month and also removed her name from a WTA Tour event in Bogota later in April. It appears her next target with be the French Open, with the first round starting on Sunday, May 24. Should she make it out on the clay at Roland Garros, it will end a 16-month absence from the court that has left one of Britain's brightest hopes in women's tennis without a world ranking. She has been practising in the United States, in Tampa, as she aims to build up form and fitness. A previous Instagram post on March 26, of her doing a handstand on a tennis court to show off her new shoes, showed supporters she was back training and the strength in her wrist was returning. Her manager, Max Eisenbud, gave an update on her progress at the end of March and sounded cautiously optimistic about how Robson is improving. Robson is now said to be nearing a return and is  targeting the French Open in May . The 21-year-old Robson also missed out on Wimbledon last year but could be in line to play in 2015 . 'I’m happy with the way it’s been going and she’s been hitting the ball great in practice,' Eisenbud said. 'It’s a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week. 'It’s all about when she is ready to compete. We don’t want to put her in a situation where she can’t play a full tournament.'","Laura Robson has not played since January 2014 due to a wrist problem .

"The saying 'two is company but three's a crowd' clearly didn't apply to James Corden as he met two Beckham sporting stars.

Corden was all smiles as he posed in between the duo. James Corden (centre) posted a picture alongside Odell Beckham Jnr (left) and David Beckham via Twitter . Both Beckhams, who are of no relation, were pictured in America with the 36-year-old - who is currently filming late-night talk show Late Late in the States. Last month David Beckham lifted the lid on his son Brooklyn's first date, in which the former Manchester United midfielder watched on from a nearby table in a London restaurant. Speaking as a guest on Corden's show, the ex-Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star told the hilarious story of his 16-year-old son's first foray into the world of dating. When probed by Corden, who asked, 'He must be getting quite big into the dating circuit now?', Beckham replied: ''Yeah, it's happening. He's going to hate me for this. 'I'm fine with it, because on his first date - when he was about 14 and a half - it was Valentine's Day so he said, ""I'd love to take this girl to dinner."" David Beckham embarrassed his son Brooklyn on James Corden's Late Late Show in America last month . Brooklyn watched on from the audience as his father told the story of his first date, at a sushi bar in London . 'I said, ""Okay, great."" I spoke to Victoria, and she was like, ""Really?"", so I said, ""Yeah, he's going to do it."" 'She said, ""Okay, make sure you take him and then make sure you sit in the restaurant."" So I was like, ""Really, you're going to make me do that?"" and she said ""Yeah, that's the only way I'm going to let him go.""' 'So we took him to a small sushi restaurant and he sat at the sushi bar and I sat about five tables back. By the way, my daughter is four years old. When she gets to that age, I will be closer than that!' Beckham's son Brooklyn, who was sat in the audience as his dad retold the embarrassing story, is aiming to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a professional footballer.

"A Michigan woman who was expecting to find a tax refund in her mailbox was shocked when she instead received a letter from the IRS informing her that she had 'died'.

"Sally Cox, 39, stopped her son Jed Pearce, 10 (pictured together above), from going on the mosque trip, expressing fears of 'violence and guns' Children as young as eight have been banned by their parents from attending a British mosque as part of a school trip over 'safety' fears, with one mother claiming she 'doesn't want to put her son at risk of being shot'. Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon, as part of an RE trip to learn about different faiths. The schoolchildren, from years three to six, were due to visit the city's cathedral before taking a tour of the mosque and observing a congregational prayer. However, about 10 pupils have now pulled out of next week's school trip after their parents said they  would be exposed to 'violence and guns' and expressed 'grave concerns' about the teaching of Islam. Christine Trevethen, 47, a housewife from Lostwithiel, Cornwall, has stopped her 10-year-old daughter Keira going on the visit. She said: 'We are not the only ones that don't want our kids to go - but a lot of the others haven't been honest enough to do so in the consent form. 'I do not want my daughter going to the mosque for personal reasons. I don't agree with the religion and what it stands for - but I am not prepared to go into the reasons why. 'We have now been told our children are going to be excluded from RE lessons as a result, which is a big concern. 'We tried to go through the right channels but the school handled it very badly.' Sally Cox, 39, a self-employed cleaner from Lerryn, Cornwall, has also blocked her son Jed Pearce, 10, from going on the visit. She said: 'I did not want him to go because they are a violent religion and many of them have guns. 'You can see what they are like every day on the news. There was a Muslim bomber in Exeter just a few years ago. 'We were just being honest saying we did not want them to go. 'It is unsafe. I don't want my son being shot. Also this is not a religious school yet they are willing to take a whole day out for religion. 'I don't want them to do that. I want him to be in school learning Maths and English - not being put at risk of being shot. 'They decided to take him out of RE, but I said I am fine with that.' Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon (pictured) as part of an RE trip  but 10 pulled out after parents expressed 'grave concerns' Another parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'We have grave concerns about the children's safety during the trip due to the horrific events that occur every day. 'We have therefore decided not to send our children on this trip. This decision is not one based on ignorance or racial or religious beliefs, but one based purely on safety concerns.' The parent said she was furious after the pupils who pulled out of the trip were singled out in a school assembly. She said: 'They were made to stand up after assembly. The sitting non-attendees were then asked individually why they were not going on the trip. 'This is not a decision the children have made, so discriminating against these children in this fashion is disgraceful, unacceptable and unprofessional.' However, not all parents are opposed to the trip, with some backing the school and suggesting the visit is a positive move. Alice Mitchell, 35, a playworker from Lostwithiel, said: 'I think we need to educate our children to be tolerant and dispel the rumours the media can congregate. 'I am all for my children going on the trip. I think celebrating diversity is a great thing. 'It is all down to fear. People are scared of other religions. There is a lot of misconceptions.' And Sian Cornish, 41, a self-employed retailer, from Lostwithiel, added:' 'I did not even realise it was an issue. I was delighted my child had the opportunity to experience another culture in their ways of worship. 'I think it is important to celebrate other cultures - even if you don't agree with them.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of Lostwithiel School (pictured), which has just 156 pupils on its books, said the trip would still take place on May 7 to 'show children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam' Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the school, said a group of parents had expressed concerns about the trip due to recent terror attacks by groups such as ISIS. She said: 'This is the first time pupils from the school have visited a mosque and it's an exciting opportunity for them to learn about different faiths and ensure that they're aware of the diverse nature of modern Britain. 'Because of recent news reports about extremist groups, such as ISIS, that identify themselves with Islam, a small number of parents have expressed concerns about the trip and the teaching of Islam in school. 'In response, the school held a special assembly with children to discuss these issues, and the head teacher has met and sent letters to parents with specific concerns. 'A full risk assessment has been conducted for the trip and there is no more risk attached to this trip than any other school trip.' Ms Smith said the school had a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities. She said: 'Religious Education forms part of the basic curriculum in schools and its teaching is enshrined in law. Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the Lostwithiel School, said parents expressed concerns about the teaching of Islam at the school . 'The school recognises that parents have the right to withdraw their child from RE in whole or in part, and provide alternative work to further their child's knowledge and understanding of the parents' beliefs and values. 'However, the school is aware that children growing up in Cornwall may have little contact with Muslims and it is aware that it has a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities as part of its single equality duty. 'The Governing Body fully supports this trip and the teaching of RE, including Islam. 'It is the governors' hope that the visit to the mosque will provide an insight for pupils into the nature of British Islam, help them understand how Islam is presented in the media and that groups like ISIS are not a true reflection of the Islam followed by the vast majority of Muslims in Britain.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of the primary school which has just 156 pupils on its books and teaches those aged four to 11, said the trip would still be taking place on May 7. She said: 'Our hope from the visit to the mosque is that children will be given a view as to what are the values and beliefs of a British Muslim. 'This trip will show the children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam as a religion.' Exeter Mosque, described as the 'Islamic Centre of the South West', is open daily for prayers and also welcomes those wishing to learn about the Quran and basics of the Deen. The Mosque also welcomes groups as part of education programmes and regularly hosts school trips. Lostwithiel School, which has around six teachers, said the trip was planned to enable children to learn further about different religions. The school said it follows the Cornwall Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education and part of the curriculum encourages children to study Christianity in great detail, as well as finding out about Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam through school trips, visits from outside speakers and class teaching. The Muslim Council of Great Britain said it was concerned by the views of some of the parents who strongly opposed the trip. A spokesman said: 'We would have thought a well-rounded education involves learning about those of a different faith. 'These laudable initiatives take place across the country. It is therefore disappointing to hear that some parents have chosen to pull their children out of a visit to a mosque due to events elsewhere in the world. 'We hope this incident is atypical and not reflective of a growing sentiment against Muslims in this country. 'We commend the headteacher for rightly stating that such a visit will help her pupils to understand real Islam and dispel the myths and hysteria that surrounds our religion.' MailOnline has contacted Exeter Mosque for comment.","10 pupils pull out of trip to mosque after parents express 'grave concerns'

"A Hollywood-inspired experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place in New York. The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York . 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation . Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, ""Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?"".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'","Residents at Hebrew Care Home in New York are woken by video recordings from loved ones to help ease their confusion and agitation .

"Given Manny Pacquiao is on his show next week it's just as well Jimmy Kimmel didn't offend the Filipino fighter with his rendition of his inspirational ballad Lalaban Ako Para Sa Filipino. On his show Jimmy Kimmel Live the comedian sang an excerpt of the song, penned and recorded by Pacquiao to be his walk-out music for the richest fight of all time against Floyd Mayweather. Kimmel's appreciation of the song, an earnest work dedicated to Pacquiao's fellow Filipinos and with footage after the devastating Typhoon Haiyan in the video, appeared tongue in cheek. Manny Pacquiao wrote and recorded Lalaban Ako Para Sa Filipino for his walk-out music when he fights Floyd Mayweather and US talk show host Jimmel Kimmel has performed it on his live show . The Jimmy Kimmel Live crowd get into the piano ballad with some old-fashion hands in the air . Kimmel's sidekick Manuel sways to Kimmel also as he sings the song dedicated to the Filipino people . We are going to fight . I am going to fight to the world . Fight for your name . I am Filipino . We are Filipino . 'I humbly submit this for consideration at next year's Grammy Awards,' Kimmel said introducing a clip. 'I never heard a song that summed up my emotions so completely.' After singing a few lines, he said: 'That translated into England means ""I'm gonna beat Floyd Mayweather's face in"".' The boxer was nevertheless impressed, and a little amused. After Kimmel's effort sung in the Tagalog, a language spoken by about 57 million of the Philippines' more than 98 million people, went viral Pacman took to Twitter to thank the comedian for singing his song. Pacquiao's 80s-style music video includes a montage of the boxer's fights and his humanitarian efforts . Multi-talented Pacquiao  not only wrote and sang the touching tune but also directed the music video . 'Thank you Jimmy for singing my new album - it was good,' Pacquiao said laughing. 'You were practicing hard for that song. I am excited to be in your show next week. Thank you so much to all your support.' Pacquiao's song translates to English as 'I Will Fight For The Fillipino' and will be blasted through the MGM Grand Arena on May 2 before he bids to end Mayweather's 47-fight unbeaten run. Pacquiao saw the funny side of Kimmel's spoof of his tune and thanked him on Twitter and in a video . Pacquiao works up a sweat during his media workout at Wild Card Boxing gym on Wednesday .

Known as 'The Nation's Fist', devout Christian Pacquiao is also a politician, has appeared in nine films and has a noted soft side when it comes to his musical exploits in his home country. The likelihood Kimmel's viewers will hear the song as Pacquiao intended it next week is high given his was the first US talk show the boxer ever appeared on back in 2009. On that show  he sang a rendition of Dan Hill's classic 1977 ballad Sometimes When We Touch. Pacquiao later released the song as a single in 2011 and it even made No 19 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary top 20 list.","US comedian Jimmy Kimmel sang Lalaban Ako in Tagalog on his show .

"Quinton ‘Rampage’ Jackson has admitted he has already been through the wringer, even before he steps back into the Octagon. Jackson returns to the UFC after two years with Bellator when he takes on Fabio Maldonado in Montreal on Saturday night. But he had to first endure a protracted legal battle before he was permitted to feature at UFC 186. Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson and Fabio Maldonado face off during the UFC 186 weigh-in on Friday . ‘Everything happens for a reason,’ he said. ‘It was a very stressful period, it was so stressful preparing for this fight. I've never went through this type of thing before. I felt like I had to fight to get here, and that's been a tough fight. 'I probably won't feel any emotions until after the fight or right before the fight. I just wanted to make it here for the fans, though. I feel like the fans wanted to see me fight, a lot of fans bought tickets and wanted to watch the pay-per-view and see this fight so I'm glad to be here. 'He's [Maldonado] good on paper. He's a stand up fighter; on paper it's the type of fight I love so it should be a good show for the fans. But I've heard he's been doing a lot of wrestling so we'll see what happens.’ Jackson, the former light-heavyweight champion, takes on Maldonado at a catchweight of 215lb. Former light-heavyweight champion Jackson has been through a stressful fight to make UFC comeback . 'I'm tired of fighting guys who are cowards, who just want to take you down and lay on top of you. In fights like that, the fans lose,’ he added. 'I am a true definition of a fighter, you know what I'm saying. My style is a brawl, a street fighter. I like the excitement of the surprise of what he's going to bring at me. 'We're both pretty big guys. It was stressful preparing for this fight - it was kind of hard for either of us to keep our weight down. I just think it's fair for both of us [that this is a catch weight fight at 215lbs]. ‘Fighting is mostly mental, even the weight loss part of it. When you're stressing out, there's nothing you can do. The thing you guys want to see is two healthy, strong fighters fighting each other, not people who are killing themselves trying to get down to weight the night before.'","Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson returns to the UFC after two year absence .

"Memories of drunken escapades may make us blush, but now a computer can use similar facial flushes to recognise people who have had one drink too many. Greek researchers created the algorithm, which determines a person’s state of intoxication by looking at the temperature of their face - especially the forehead and nose. And they say the technology could one day be installed in cars to spot drink drivers and stop them starting the ignition. Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers’ faces, before and after drinking four glasses of wine. The scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober (left) and drunken images (right) pixel-by-pixel (a single pixel is shown above the left eyebrow) Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers’ faces, before and after drinking four glasses of wine. Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the spectrum and create images of the radiation, where warm areas are shown red and cooler areas, blue, for example. Many people feel warmer and have hot flushes after drinking alcohol, caused by the drug affecting brain chemistry and the circulatory system. When alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream it increases heart rate and blood pressure and blood vessels open wide to allow for more rapid flow, which causes some people to flush. Alcohol also affects the hypothalamus, which regulates the body's temperature. Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the spectrum and create images of the radiation, where warm areas are shown red and cooler areas, blue, for example. In the study, the researchers found that the temperature of the forehead and to a lesser extent, the nose, is the best indication of a person’s drunken state and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90% accuracy. While the alcohol got some volunteers more tipsy than others, they all had a blood alcohol content of at least 50 milligrams of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of blood. This figure is the drink driving limit in Scotland as well as most European countries – but slightly below the English and Welsh limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober and drunken images pixel-by-pixel. They found that the temperature of the forehead, and to a lesser extent the nose, is the best indication of a person’s drunken state and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90 per cent accuracy. The scientists wrote in the study, published in the journal Forensic Journal International: ‘It was found that it was mainly the face forehead that changed thermal behaviour with alcohol consumption.' The algorithm worked even on faces that it hadn’t been trained on, and without comparing them to images of people when they were sober. Many people feel warmer and have hot flushes after drinking alcohol, caused by the drug affecting brain chemistry and the circulatory system.

Alcohol also affects the hypothalamus, which regulates the body's temperature. Just three hours behind the wheel at night can make motorists drive as badly as if they were drunk, scientists claim. Driver tiredness after a few hours has the same effect as being over the drink-driving limit, a 2011 study revealed. Even two hours of motorway driving in the dark can affect performance so severely it is the same as having a couple of drinks. It's estimated that one-fifth of all traffic accidents are due to sleepiness behind the wheel and one in three people admit to nodding off while driving at night. The researchers hope their technology could be used by the police to spot intoxicated people who might start trouble at football matches, for example and say it could be installed in cars and lorries to spot potential drink drivers. It could perhaps work in tandem with other technology to stop a car from being able to be driven. Scientists in Germany are already working on a way to stop drink drivers getting behind the wheel by analysing their speechm for example. They announced in December they have created the first library of drunk speech patterns, which could be used to predict drunkenness by listening for vocal cues. Called the Alcohol Language Corpus, the database was made by researchers from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Institute of Legal Medicine between 2007 and 2009 by giving people too much alcohol to drink, before recording conversations conducted in a stopped car, where the drunk person was sitting in the passenger seat. There are currently conversations from 162 German men and women in the publicly-available audio database. While the alcohol got some more tipsy than others, all the volunteers in the study had a blood alcohol content of 50 milligrams of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of blood, which is the drink driving limit in Scotland as well as most European countries. A stock image illustrating drink driving is shown . The researchers hope their technology could be used by the police to spot intoxicated people who might start trouble at football matches, for example and say it could be installed in cars and lorries to spot potential drink drivers. Currently, breathalyzers (pictured) are used to measure alcohol content . From this, an algorithm capable of detecting whether someone is drunk by listening in on slurring speech patterns, was created by computer scientists at Queens College and Columbia University. They found they could detect drunken speech patterns much like identifying an accent. Drunken speech hallmarks include stammering and stuttering. Voices also tend to rise in pitch and words begin to slur, they said. It is hoped that the software could be used alongside devices such as locks and immobilisers to make it impossible for people to drive when drunk – perhaps by asking them a few questions while analysing the driver’s voice. ‘The cars themselves could listen to the driver, detect that the potential driver is intoxicated, and prevent the car from starting,’ the researchers explained.","Researchers from the University of Patras, in Greece created the algorithm .

"It's no secret celebrities spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on maintaining their looks.

"The dawn of a new era of space travel may be upon us after Amazon's Jeff Bezos successfully tested a vehicle that will take tourists into space. Mr Bezos' firm, called the Blue Origin company, has long spoken of its desire to take paying astronauts into the cosmos. And now it has performed the first successful test of the vehicle they hope will make that dream a reality. Scroll down for video . Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company has completed a successful spaceflight test in West Texas (shown). The New Shepard vehicle rose to a height of 58 miles (94km) - four miles short of space - before landing. It was unmanned, but will ultimately take six people into space . The test took place from the company’s launch site in West Texas. Called New Shepard, the vehicle consists of a main booster rocket and a six-seater capsule on top, standing 60ft (18 metres) tall. The New Shepard system will take astronauts to space on suborbital journeys. It includes a Crew Capsule carrying six astronauts atop a separate rocket-powered Propulsion Module, launched from the firm's West Texas Launch Site. Following liftoff, the combined vehicles accelerate for approximately two and a half minutes. The Propulsion Module then shuts off its rocket engines and separates from the Crew Capsule. The Propulsion Module will finish its flight, descend to Earth, and autonomously perform a rocket-powered vertical landing. The Crew Capsule will go on to coast to the edge of space, providing astronauts with a view to the curvature of the Earth and the beauty of our planet. After descent and re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere, the Crew Capsule will land under parachutes no more than a few miles from the launch site. In addition, the New Shepard vehicle will provide opportunities for researchers to fly experiments into space and a microgravity environment. For this, the first test flight of the entire architecture, it was unmanned - but the company hopes to soon start taking customers into space. The cost of a ticket has not yet been announced, but estimates suggest it will be around £130,000 $200,000 - similar to a flight on Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. The difference, however, is that while Galactic relies on using a plane to slowly rise into the atmosphere, New Shepard takes off straight up and lands back on the ground. This is known as vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL). And Blue Origin is also much more secretive - with this successful test flight taking many by surprise. In video released by Blue Origin, the booster - using liquid hydrogen and oxygen - lifts the New Shepard vehicle to an altitude of 58 miles (94km). This is four miles (six kilometres) short of the official boundary of space - the Karman Line - although there does not seem to be any problems with reaching this boundary in future. Once it reached its peak altitude, accelerating at 3Gs, the booster separated from the capsule. ‘The in-space separation of the crew capsule from the propulsion module was perfect,’ Mr Bezso said in a blog post. ‘Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return.’ The flight came as somewhat of a surprise because the company didn't make any announcements in the build up that it would be launching a rocket - unlike its rivals Virgin Galactic and SpaceX who are very open about the tests they will be performing . At peak altitude, 307,000ft (58 miles, 94km) up, the main booster separated from the capsule. On the left, the booster can be seen falling away, while on the right a distant view of the separation is seen. The booster failed to land successfully but the capsule landed without a hitch . Ultimately, the flights will enable six people to go to space. While in space, huge windows will give the customers a stunning view of Earth (artist's impression shown), and they'll also have several minutes of weightlessness, before the capsule falls to Earth and lands using parachutes . Here the capsule is seen returning to Earth on this test flight with its three parachutes. ‘Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return,' Amazon's Jeff Bezos said in a blog post announcing the successful flight . The booster is designed to be able to land on the ground and be reusable, much like rival SpaceX’s own reusable rocket system. On this occasion, however, the booster lost pressure in its hydraulic system and was not recovered. Mr Bezos said the firm was already working on an improved system to make sure the error doesn’t happen again. ‘Assembly of propulsion module serial numbers 2 and 3 is already underway - we’ll be ready to fly again soon,’ he said. In a video a small crowd was seen watching the successful flight from the company's launch site in West Texas - but for the most part the launch was kept a secret . Jeff Bezos (pictured) is better known as the CEO and founder of Amazon, with a fortune of £22.5 billion ($34.7 billion). He founded his Blue Origin company in 2000 . Elon Musk, the PayPal co-founder and electric car maker, is competing against Bezos to develop a re-usable rocket . An isolated edge of vast West Texas is home to a highly secretive part of the 21st-century space race, one of two being directed in the Lone Star State by internet billionaires whose personalities and corporate strategies seem worlds apart. The presence of Blue Origin, LLC, the brainchild of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, barely registers in nearby Van Horn, a way station along Interstate 10, a full decade after he began buying land in one of Texas' largest and most remote counties. At the opposite end — of Texas and the competition — is the highly visible SpaceX venture, led by PayPal co-founder and electric car maker Elon Musk. His company contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and is building a launch site about 600 miles from Van Horn, on the southernmost Texas Gulf coast, with the much-publicized goal of sending humans to Mars. SpaceX and Blue Origin are among several U.S. companies engaged in the private space business. Both men have seemingly unlimited resources — Bezos' wealth is estimated at nearly $35 billion, Musk's at $12 billion — and lofty aspirations: launching a new era of commercial space operations, in part by cutting costs through reusable rockets. Earlier this year a dispute over a design of a floating landing platform - which would be used to launch and land rockets in the middle of the ocean - was dragged through the courts. But a judge said the confrontation would be allowed to continue. In part they are racing to be the first to manufacture and successfully operate reusable rockets - making space flight cheaper. According to The Washington Post, SpaceX has been working on the technology for years, and in January attempted the unprecedented landing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket on a floating barge it calls an autonomous spaceport droneship. However the barge and the rocket exploded. SpaceX founder and Musk, center, and Texas Governor Rick Perry turn the first shovel-full of sand at the groundbreaking ceremony for the SpaceX launch pad at Boca Chica Beach, Texas, in September 2014 . Combined, the booster and capsule stand 60ft (18 metres) tall, with a feather painted onto the side . This is the walkway astronauts will ultimately use when the company stars its manned flights . In this first test flight, the New Shepard vehicle rose to an altitude of 58 miles (94km). This is four miles (six kilometres) short of the official boundary of space - the Karman Line - although there does not seem to be any problems with reaching this boundary in future . The flight of the capsule, however, passed without a hitch and it successfully landed on the ground with the help of three parachutes. The company is keen on VTVL because it is ‘scalable to a very large size,’ according to Mr Bezos. And he noted that the company was already working on a larger vehicle, New Shepard’s ‘Very Big Brother’, which is apparently many times New Shepard’s size with five times as much thrust. The company has not yet revealed when it’s next flight will be, or when manned flights will begin. 'We won’t be publishing a calendar for our test flight programme. And, nothing further to contribute regarding pricing,' a spokesperson from Blue Origin told MailOnline. But following this successful flight, many will be expecting the company to go from strength to strength.","His Blue Origin company completed a successful test in West Texas .

"Former Leeds captain Trevor Cherry has branded the six United players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match against Charlton a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club. Italian quartet Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro and Marco Silvestri, Frenchman Souleymane Doukara and Albanian Edgar Cani all told beleaguered head coach Neil Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. Redfearn, speaking after his side lost 2-1 at The Valley, described it as a 'freakish' set of events. According to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Canu declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday. Neil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six Leeds United players pulled out at late notice . Mirco Antenucci was among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton . But Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road. 'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek. 'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful. He added: 'I don't know exactly the players and it might be one or two of them have got a good excuse, but it sounds too stupid to be true.' Striker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night. However, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw. 'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said. 'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.' Giuseppe Bellusci, Antenucci and two other Italians were among those who made themselves unavailable . The withdrawals are just the latest incident in another turbulent period at Leeds. Redfearn's position at Elland Road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. The withdrawals, including Souleymane Doukara's, are the latest incident in another turbulent period at Leeds . Club president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time. Cherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club. 'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said. 'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened. 'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'

"The Pillars of Creation are one of the most iconic images ever to be captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Now, astronomers have produced the first complete three-dimensional view of these beautiful columns of interstellar gas and dust. The image, together with data collected by Nasa, suggests these structures only have three million years left before they fade away - a relatively short time in cosmic terms. Scroll down for video . The new observations, taken by the European Space Agency, reveal many new details — including a previously unseen jet from a young star. The original  Hubble Space Telescope image of the famous Pillars of Creation was taken two decades ago and immediately became one of its most famous and evocative pictures. The jutting structures, along with the nearby star cluster, NGC 6611, are parts of a star formation region called the Eagle Nebula, also known as Messier 16 or M16. The nebula and its associated objects are located about 7000 light-years away in the constellation of Serpens (The Serpent). Located in the Eagle Nebula, Messier 16, researchers used the Muse instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) create the 3D view. The new study reports fresh evidence for two gestating stars in the left and middle pillars as well as a jet from a young star that had escaped attention up to now. For more stars to form in environments like the Pillars of Creation, it is a race against time as intense radiation from the powerful stars that are already shining continues to grind away at the pillars. By measuring the Pillars of Creation's rate of evaporation, Muse has given astronomers a time frame for when the pillars will be no more. They shed about 70 times the mass of the sun every million years or so. Based on the their present mass of about 200 times that of the sun, the Pillars of Creation have an expected lifetime of perhaps three million more years. Some scientists have put forward the theory that the Pillars of Creation were already killed by a neighboring supernova some 6,000 years ago. If this is the case, astronomers on Earth won’t know for another 1,000 years, when the light from the descruction reaches our planet. 'The original Nasa/Esa Hubble Space Telescope image of the famous Pillars of Creation was taken two decades ago and immediately became one of its most famous and evocative pictures,' said Esa.' This view shows how the MUSE instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope has created a three-dimensional view of the iconic Pillars of Creation in the star-forming region Messier 16. Each pixel in the data corresponds to a spectrum. The 'slices' of data correspond to some of the different chemical elements present. 'Since then, these billowing clouds, which extend over a few light-years, have awed scientists and the public alike.' The jutting structures, along with the nearby star cluster, NGC 6611, are parts of a star formation region called the Eagle Nebula, also known as Messier 16 or M16. The nebula and its associated objects are located about 7000 light-years away in the constellation of Serpens (The Serpent). The Pillars of Creation are a classic example of the column-like shapes that develop in the giant clouds of gas and dust that are the birthplaces of new stars. The columns arise when immense, freshly formed blue–white O and B stars give off intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds that blow away less dense materials from their vicinity. Denser pockets of gas and dust, however, can resist this erosion for longer. Behind such thicker dust pockets, material is shielded from the harsh, withering glare of O and B stars. The original NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image of the famous Pillars of Creation was taken two decades ago . This shielding creates dark 'tails' or 'elephant trunks', which we see as the dusky body of a pillar, that point away from the brilliant stars. ESO's Muse instrument on the Very Large Telescope has now helped illustrate the ongoing evaporation of the Pillars of Creation in unprecedented detail, revealing their orientation. MUSE has shown that the tip of the left pillar is facing us, atop a pillar that is is actually situated behind NGC 6611, unlike the other pillars. This tip is bearing the brunt of the radiation from NGC 6611's stars, and as a result looks brighter to our eyes than the bottom left, middle and right pillars, whose tips are all pointed away from our view. Astronomers hope to better understand how young O and B stars like those in NGC 6611 influence the formation of subsequent stars.

"You get the impression around English cricket at the moment that people have a bit of a downer on Stuart Broad. I have heard the comment ‘how much longer before Broad comes under pressure for his place?’ from a few people in recent times. There should always be scrutiny on England players’ places, I have no problem with that, but we have to be careful we do not get confused between Broad the bowler and Broad the batsman. Fact is, in the last 14 Tests Broad has taken 63 wickets at 24 apiece which is pretty good considering he’s been carrying niggles and injuries. So there has not been much wrong with his bowling even though, as I said on Wednesday, he’s not quite at his best following his long lay-off after surgery. Stuart Broad (right) was dismissed for a duck in England's first innings against West Indies in Antigua . Broad will always give you something different even though he can overdo it at times, and has always had the ability to get something out of a flat pitch. I still like the fact that he can turn into the enforcer, as he did before lunch on day three, and that he’s a clever bowler, as he showed on the second day when he rolled his fingers down the side of the ball and dismissed Marlon Samuels with a leg-cutter. Broad and Jimmy Anderson are an outstanding combination, taking 526 wickets between them in the 70 Tests they have played together — a record that has seen them stand comparison with the partnership of Sir Ian Botham and Bob Willis. The 28-year-old has seen his place in the side questioned, but he still produces with the ball . Broad celebrates the wicket of Denesh Ramdin on day three of the first Test against West Indies in Antigua . And they complement each other as we saw again on Wednesday when it was flat and there wasn’t much happening for Anderson. That’s when Broad, with his ability to make things happen, is so crucial for a captain. He has an ability to come up with that magic spell, one that changes the whole course of a match as we have seen him do in big Ashes Tests. He gets under the skin of the Aussies, too, which is never a bad thing. So this downer that I am sensing among the English cricket public clearly comes from the complete demise of Broad the batsman. Not only does he appear to have lost all confidence in his batting but he seems a bit scared, too. Broad said in Australia that he suffered nightmares after being struck in the face by India’s Varun Aaron last summer at Old Trafford, which is something I personally would never have done. Broad admitted he had nightmares about being struck in the face by India's Varun Aaron last summer . Broad can expect to face a barrage of short deliveries from the likes of Mitchell Johnson in the Ashes . Broad scoring a century against Pakistan in 2010 . You can imagine what the Aussies felt when they heard an Englishman saying he was having nightmares about the short ball. No one truly fancies the short stuff but most people do not admit to it publicly. The result is that Broad has become a bit gun-shy, he stays leg-side of the ball and tries to play a shot every delivery. And everybody wants their England cricketers to show a bit of character and fight. It’s not going to be easy for Broad. He is going to have Mitchell Johnson steaming in at him this summer bowling yorker, bouncer, and that is probably going to carry on for the rest of his career. He won’t be seeing too much spin. That’s why Test cricket is the hardest game. There is no place to hide and there’s no let up. Broad will have to solve the problem himself and look at team-mates who have overcome adversity in their career like Anderson and Ian Bell. We described Broad as an ‘all-rounder’ in a graphic on Sky the other day and immediately got some tweets querying that. But that’s what Broad looked like becoming when he scored that big Test hundred against Pakistan. What he needs to do now is sit down with a recording of that century at Lord’s five years ago and watch every single ball to see what he did then. Broad needs to remind himself that he can bat, that he can keep the ball out, and then get in the nets and get someone to hurl short ball after short ball at him. That’s what I saw Michael Clarke doing at the World Cup after he had been bounced out a couple of times. Broad’s batting woes must not affect his bowling as England need him at his best. He shows a lot of character with the ball and is a steely performer. But with the bat he’s showing no character and it’s time he said ‘enough’s enough’.","Stuart Broad was dismissed for a duck in England's first innings .
The 28-year-old has had a complete demise in his batting .

"Leeds striker Steve Morison admits he has never experienced anything like the current circus surrounding the SkyBet Championship side. Six players - Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario Del Fabro, Marco Silvestri, Souleymane Doukara and Edgar Cani - withdrew from the squad on the eve of Saturday's trip to Charlton citing injuries, and this is just the latest incident in another turbulent period at Elland Road. A 'freakish set of events' was how beleaguered boss Neil Redfearn described the sextet's absence after the game but Morison, who scored Leeds' goal in the 2-1 defeat at The Valley, told BBC West Yorkshire Sport: 'We're around it every day. Leeds United striker Steve Morison (centre) admits he is surprised by the chaos at Elland Road at the moment . Giuseppe Bellusci and three other Italians were among those who withdrew form the Leeds squad . Souleymane Doukara was another player that withdrew as part of the latest drama at Elland Road . 'People draw their own conclusions over what happened (with the withdrawals). It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.' When asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened. 'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit. 'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.' Former Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club. Italian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. According to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday. But Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road. 'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek. 'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.' Striker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night. However, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw. 'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said. 'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.' The withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds. Mirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton . Neil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game . Redfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Club president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time. Cherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club. 'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said. 'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened. 'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'","Leeds forward Steve Morrison is surprised by the drama at the club .

"Creating romantic, sepia-toned images is a cinch now that we have Instagram filters to play with. But back in the early 21st century, taking a picture was an entirely different process, requiring patience, precision and a very talented eye. Dreamlike snaps of a young woman in red posing at Lulworth Cove, Dorset, in 1913 have now been revealed as some of the earliest surviving colour photographs. Scroll down for video . A collection of pictures of Christina O'Gorman posing for her father, electrical engineer and photographer Mervyn O'Gorman, back in 1913 have been revealed as some of the earliest colour photographs ever taken . The ethereal images were taken on the beach at Lulworth Cove, Dorset, when Malcolm was 42 . The images are part of the Royal Photographic Society, held at the National Media Museum, and are currently on display at the National Media Museum, Bradford. They are among a collection of the world's oldest surviving photographs. The woman in question was teenager Christina O'Gorman, posing for her father, electrical engineer and photographer Mervyn O'Gorman back in 1913. Mervyn was 42 at the time when he took the images of his daughter, who languidly sits, in an array of vibrant red outfits, including a swimsuit, a cloak and a shirt. The teen, characterised by her long strawberry-blonde hair, poses in different scenarios on the beach at Lulworth Cove in the English county of Dorset and appears unaware of her father. The delicately-coloured images are on display at the National Media Museum in Bradford . Christina is seen sitting on the Dorset beach with friends in the 102-year-old images . The strawberry-blonde teenager wore red, probably at the request of her father as the vibrant colour captured particularly well via the autochrome process . Mervyn was known as an early pioneer of colour photography and used the autochrome process to capture the haunting images. Patented in 1903, the process involved using glass plates covered in potato starches grains to filter pictures with dye. Mervyn was known as an early pioneer of colour photography and often used the autochrome process, which involved using glass plates covered in potato starches grains to filter pictures with dye . Christina's life remains a mystery as there are no recorded detail of the then-teen's life . The National Media Museum explained: 'The comparatively long exposure time has given the sea a glassy quality and the large aperture setting and narrow depth of field has put Durdle Door in the background into soft focus.' The repetition of the red attire was due to the fact that the vibrant colour captured particularly well in an autochrome process. Mervyn died in 1958, with his wife Florence passing 27 years beforehand in 1931. As to Christina's life, there are no recorded details.","Photographer Mervyn O'Gorman was 42 when he snapped the pictures in 1913 .

"Thirty years after the Bradford City fire which killed 56 football supporters, a new book written by a survivor of the disaster claims it was not an accident. Author Martin Fletcher points the finger at the late Stafford Heginbotham, Bradford City's chairman at the time and a businessman who had been linked to eight previous blazes. 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham?' writes Fletcher, after 15 years spent researching the fire in which four members of his family died. The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . The 30th anniversary is approaching since the tragic fire that killed 56 people at Bradford's ground in 1985 . Fire engulfs Valley Parade on a day nobody can ever forget as 56 were killed at the football stadium .

Coronet a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham . 7: Nov 1977: fire with toxic fumes at his Douglas Mills factory . 8: June 1981: fire in a plastics factory at Douglas Mills . His brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were among the 54 Bradford supporters and two Lincoln supporters who did not survive. Fletcher, who was 12 at the time became determined to challenge the accepted theories which he believes were founded upon a flawed investigation. He discovered that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to at least eight other fires at business premises and insurance claims dating back to 1967. His findings have been published in Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire, which is being serialised in The Guardian. It stops short of a direct accusation of arson but inferences are clear and he is certain more should have been done at the time to investigate the disaster and those responsible. He hopes these questions can be officially addressed and that his research will prompt a new investigation into the disaster as the 30th anniversary approaches next month. No-one has sought accountability for the fire since the official inquiry chaired by High Court judge Oliver Popplewell recorded its findings following five days of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. The inquiry found that a small fire was probably caused by a spark from a discarded cigarette or match dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. It was the final game of the season and should have been a day of celebration. Before kick-off Bradford were presented before with the trophy for winning the Third Division title. The fire was noticed towards the end of the first half and within four minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. There were no fire extinguishers and no designated fire escapes. A 12-year-old Martin Fletcher is comforted by his mother Susan in 1985 after the Bradford Fire disaster .

Prime minister Margaret Thatcher visits the scene of the disaster with her husband Dennis in 1985 . Tributes paid to the 56 who were killed by the fire on the same day Bradford should have been celebrating . His many businesses included toy company Tebro Toys. He once described football as 'the opera of the people'. After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around £30,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. The tragedy, followed by Heysel, less than three weeks later, and Hillsborough in 1989, accelerated safety changes in football ground. The community turned inwards to comfort each other. They raised money for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary and supported friends through the aftermath of loss, physical pain and the psychological problems. They were not inspired by the need to fight and clear their names like the families of those killed at Hillsborough. As a whole they accepted it was a terrible accident and nothing came from the media or the courts to change that view. Bradford City reacted to early criticism that it had failed to honour the tragedy and there are memorials in the city centre and at the stadium and an annual memorial service, attended mostly by a few hundred of the people most closely affected. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. Times have changed and social media has fuelled a craving for public outpourings of sympathy. Football's authorities decided that this year there would be a minute's silence before all games on April 25, when Bradford play Barnsley at Valley Parade. It is the final game of the season and Bradford always remember the victims of the fire at the home game closest to the anniversary. Representatives from Bradford and Lincoln have also been invited to Wembley for the FA Cup semi-finals this weekend and the FA will be represented at the annual memorial service in Bradford on May 11. These are specific to the 30th anniversary and yet are in tune with a general increase in attention which has coincided with an upturn in the club's fortunes. But it sits uneasily with many at Valley Parade. Then-Bradford chairman  Heginbotham (left) outside Valley Parade, where 56 people died and 265 were injured .

Investigators look around the burned out stand at Bradford's ground following the tragedy in 1985 . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Many supporters were unsure about a memorial flag which was taken to Wembley when Bradford reached the League Cup final two years ago. Arsenal and Hull fans then applauded in the 56th minute of last year's FA Cup final, a well-intentioned mark of solidarity copied by Oldham fans at Valley Parade, this season. Others have turned up and started to sing 'Stand up for the 56'. Again, this has provoked a mixed response. Some Bradford supporters believe the victims should be remembered in this way, others prefer it to keep it private. A stage documentary called The 56 is touring local theatres and children's entertainers the Chuckle Brothers have launched a charity single with members of Black Lace. Another fan has been selling old seats numbered 1-56 which were reclaimed from the stand this year while '56' branded hoodies and T-shirts are on sale, some more tasteful than others. Profits from some of these ventures will go to the Plastic Surgery and Burns Research Unit (PSBRU) at the University of Bradford, set up by Professor David Sharpe after the fire. In another year of success for Bradford City, with FA Cup wins against Chelsea and Sunderland, the club has found the dynamic is altering around what was once called football's less remembered tragedy. It may never be the same again after Martin Fletcher's book. He started his own investigations in 1994, when his mother told him Valley Parade had not been Heginbotham's first fire. The more he unearthed, the more his mind was made up. His findings will disturb the peace in Bradford.","Fifty-six people were killed and 265 were injured on May 11, 1985, when the Bradford City fire disaster occurred at Valley Parade .

"Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper Scott Bain, but the Turkish midfielder was the one left blushing as his side lost away at rivals Dundee. Former Portsmouth ace Ciftci briefly levelled the scores at Dens Park when he slotted home a penalty after Greg Stewart had given the hosts the lead. The 23-year-old celebrated by trying to rile Dundee No 1 Bain, but his actions came back to haunt him as The Dark Blues earned all three points thanks to further goals from Jake McPake and Paul Heffernan. Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper Scott Bain . Bain refuses to react as the Turkish striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at Den Park . Turkish forward Ciftci celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match . It was Dundee's first win in a derby for more than 10 years and breathed further momentum into their push for a top-six place, as United's poor run of domestic form continued. In front of a sell-out crowd, Dundee started well with midfielder Jim McAlister trying his luck early on with a 25-yard snap-shot on his left-foot which Radoslaw Cierzniak in the visitor’s goal held. United's reply was a sweeping move involving Paul Dixon and Chris Erskine who, in turn, fed Ciftci - but his low shot was saved by Scott Bain. Jake McPake wheels away in celebration as helps Dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . However, Dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through Stewart. The home side's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by Cierzniak, but the Polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net, leaving him red-faced. The lead, however, was short-lived as United levelled two minutes later. Chris Erksine's powerful shot came off the hand off Dark Blues skipper Kevin Thomson's hand, and referee John Beaton pointed straight to the spot. Up stepped Ciftci to send Bain the wrong way and square things up. Dundee Utd goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak looks back at his goal after Mark Stewart opened the scoring . Stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at Den Park . However, Dundee regained the lead in the 23rd minute when Stewart's corner was met by McPake, who rose above Jaroslaw Fojut head past Cierzniak from six yards. As the half-hour mark approached, United came close to equalising when Aidan Connolly jinked in from the left before unleashing a venomous shot which Bain was relieved to see clear his crossbar. The Tangerines were desperate for an equaliser before the break and in the 35th minute Dixon's whipped cross was met by Connolly - but his left-foot effort went wide. Dundee Utd's Chris Erskine goes down under a challenge from Stephen McGinn during the Dundee derby . United attempted to step up a gear and John Rankin's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by Stewart for a corner. At the other end, Dundee's Paul McGowan released Paul McGinn down the right and his cross picked out Heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken. However, Heffernan was not to be denied and the Irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half. Dundee's Paul Heffernan taps home his side's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . Skipper Thomson sent Stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for Heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post. McGowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining, only for Cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header. However, the hard work had already been done by the hosts - who were by far the better team on the night.","Nadir Ciftci celebrated by blowing a kiss at rival goalkeeper Scott Bain .

"It's official, darling – the stars of hit BBC show Absolutely Fabulous are set to reunite for a film. Jennifer Saunders, who wrote and starred in the series, confirmed yesterday the cast will begin filming in the autumn. She revealed that Joanna Lumley, who plays Patsy in the comedy (pictured with Saunders) had told her to ‘do it before we die’ and she was spurred on to finish the script by a £10,000 bet with Dawn French. Jennifer Saunders (left) and Joanna Lumley (right) are set to reunite for a film of Absolutely Fabulous . The film will be based in London, with some scenes in the south of France, or in the Bahamas if the budget allows. Saunders, 56, who plays immature Edina, told ITV’s Loose Women that she had been 'nervous' about writing the film script. She said: ‘I think that’s why I didn’t do it for a while. I thought, wouldn’t it be awful if it was awful but now we’re all so old, Joanna said to me “Do it before we die!” We’re all on the brink.’ When pushed for details about the film’s plot, she said: ‘There is a plot and that’s the miracle! ‘It involves all the main characters and virtually everyone that’s ever been in the series, all those characters, and we’re in London and sometimes we might go to the South of France, I’m hoping. 'I’m waiting for the budget! It could be anywhere – if it’s a big budget it will be the Bahamas!’ The film will be based in London, with some scenes in the south of France, or in the Bahamas if the budget allows. Jennifer Saunders plays Edina Monsoon while Lumley plays Patsy Stone . Miss Saunders said she was hurried along to finish to script because of a bet with Dawn French, 57. She said: ‘Dawn bet me on live radio a year and a half ago, that if I didn’t write it that year, I’d have to pay her £10,000, which was a good kind of motivator and I just got it in on time. New Years Eve I gave it to her.’ The award-winning comedy is set in the world of fashion and PR. Jennifer Saunders plays immature and fun-loving mother Edina Monsoon and Julia Sawalha stars as her sensible daughter Saffron.","Cast will become filming in London, France and Bahamas in the autumn .

"Campaigners against the new Protein World 'Are You Beach Body Ready?' adverts are celebrating today after learning that they are being taken down. Transport for London (TFL) has revealed that the controversial posters around the London Underground, featuring a bikini-clad model called Renee Somerfield are being removed. The sight of the 24-year-old's toned figure towering above train platforms has caused a stir among  feminists and body image campaigners - a change.org petition calling for the adverts to be pulled has already attracted more than 50,000 signatures. One of the many Protein World posters on the London Underground that have been defaced . Several of the images have also been defaced by bloggers, angry at the perceived insinuation that only women who look like Renee are ready to go to the beach. The Advertising Standards Authority has also received more than 200 complaints from people saying that the adverts promote an unhealthy body image. But today, TFL confirmed that it was pulling the posters down, because they had come to the end of the three-week advertising period that Protein World had paid for. The company also said it had taken note of the reaction from customers to the advert and that they would bear it in mind if they received a request to put up posters of a similar nature in future. The posters are now being removed from the London Underground . A TFL spokesperson told MailOnline: 'This advertisement will begin to be removed from our network as scheduled from tomorrow. 'We have received one complaint about it and we will be guided by The Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) if a similar advert were to be submitted again. 'We have zero tolerance towards graffiti on the network and take action to prevent it and remove it.' The removal of the posters comes as a protest organised against Protein World in Hyde Park on May 2 gathers steam - hundreds of people are expected to attend the rally in central London. The posters have caused a huge backlash on social media, with thousands of tweets directed at the campaign. One user called Catrin Stewartwrite: 'You clearly know what you're trying to sell with that offensive, unrealistic and sexist advert.' Another called Livy Christophers ‏said: 'YOU don't get to tell women what is offensive. ""Are you beach body ready"" really means ""why don't you look like this.""' Online fitness store Protein World, who claim that the image is entirely unPhotoshopped, have been actively engaging in the furore on social media, strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved Tweeters . Online fitness store Protein World, who claim that the image is entirely unPhotoshopped, have been actively engaging in the furore on social media, strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved Tweeters. 'We are a nation of sympathisers for fatties,' a spokesperson for Protein World tweeted to one user after she signed the change.org petition calling for the removal of the advert. 'Why make your insecurities our problem?' TV presenter Susanna Reid described the campaign for protein shakes, which features a toned swimwear-clad model alongside the slogan 'Are you beach body ready?', as 'anxiety inducing' during an interview with the fitness brand's Head of Global Marketing on Monday morning. The Good Morning Britain presenter and her co-host Ben Shephard grilled Richard Staveley about the uproar surrounding the poster, which has attracted the wrath of many social media users. Many have been outraged that the advert appears to suggest women cannot go on the beach in a bikini unless they look like the slim model in the advert. 'What if my only goal is to be on a beach?', Susanna asked Richard, adding, 'Am I irrational by finding that advert a little bit anxiety inducing?' Weighing in on the debate: Susanna Reid revealed she found the controversial Protein World advert 'anxiety inducing' on Good Morning Britain on Monday . Security threat: Staveley revealed police were investigating a bomb threat made to the company . The Protein World boss defended the campaign, saying: 'That may be but we are a fitness brand, our own aspirations are to make the nation healthier and ask each one of us to set our sights higher, to be fitter, to be healthier and actually have an inner and outer confidence within ourselves.' The TV stars also addressed the company's blunt responses to Twitter complaints, including 'why make your insecurities our problem' and 'grow up'. But Staveley believes the reaction is justified, saying, 'There is an irrational minority who have decided to interpret it in that way.' Susanna, 44, retorted: 'Do you think everybody who objects to it is irrational? Am I an irrational extremist?' Defending Protein World: Richard Staveley, Head of Global Marketing, insisted the company's advert wasn't meant to offend and was targeted at health-conscious individuals looking to get fit in time for summer . The company boss revealed Protein World has received 'threats on our head office, physical and violent threats'. He added: 'We had a bomb threat ... that’s been reported to the police. It’s currently being investigated.' Staveley concluded his appearance on the ITV show by declaring that it had been a 'fantastic campaign' for the brand and they won't changing their advertising methods in future. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it has received 216 complaints about the advert and is 'carefully assessing' the complaints to 'establish if there are grounds for further action'. Sales of protein powder - which can be priced up to  £45 per kilogram tub - are rocketing in the UK, growing from £73m in 2007 to £170m in 2012. They are expected to reach £358m by 2017, according to the market-analyst Euromonitor, as gym-going Brits add the stuff to post-workout smoothies and drinks in a bid to build muscle. Meanwhile, Katie Hopkins came to Protein World's defence, tweeting: 'Chubsters, quit vandalising Protein World ads and get your arse running on the road. Feminism isn’t an excuse for being fat. Eat less, move more.' And writer Samantha Brick, who is open about feeling confident about her looks, posted a provocative update on Facebook: 'Just ordered MY size 8 yellow bikini for my beach hols in June. I WILL be bikini ready. *That* ad TOTALLY worked for me.'","Transport For London are removing 'Are You Beach Body Ready?' posters .

"The FA Cup, the oldest knockout football competition in the world, is set to be rebranded as the Emirates FA Cup in a new £30million sponsorship deal . In a move that will upset traditionalists, the FA are understood to have secured a three-year contract with Emirates Airlines. The deal, due to be rubber-stamped by the FA board on Thursday, is believed to be worth at least £10million a year — but comes at a cost for lovers of the 144-year-old competition. Arsenal won last season's FA Cup competition, which will be rebranded the Emirates FA Cup . Aston Villa will face the holders Arsenal in this season's final at Wembley Stadium . Renaming it the Emirates FA Cup is a lot closer to title sponsorship than the previous ‘in association with Budweiser’ agreement, which was worth £9m annually. But the FA, after a highly embarrassing season without any Cup backer that has put huge pressure on their commercial department, needed to offer more to attract a significant sponsor to the table. The hunt proved hugely difficult even after the FA revamped their sponsorship team to bring in expertise honed at Manchester United. And it needed a bit of luck to attract Emirates Airlines, who have a massive sports sponsorship portfolio across the world that includes Arsenal’s stadium and kit. Emirates have big money to spend after deciding last November not to renew their £30m-a-year FIFA sponsorship for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups with the corruption allegations surrounding those tournaments said to be a consideration. And Emirates are no longer involved, either, in the tender for a Champions League airline sponsor, allowing the FA to offer a major football sponsorship alternative. Dubai-based Emirates have their arch Abu Dhabi airline rivals Etihad as Manchester City’s kit and stadium sponsors. But City foresee no problems with an Emirates FA Cup. Villa beat Liverpool in their semi-final to deny Steven Gerrard (centre) the chance of a final trophy . The new FA deal with Emirates will also allow for a further six subsidiary sponsors for the competition, with Budweiser, Nike and William Hill already signed up. And the ambition is for the whole FA Cup sponsorship portfolio to be worth £20m by 2018. The Emirates deal, likely to be officially announced nearer to the FA Cup final on May 30, is also well-timed for the FA’s commercial department with the new chief executive Martin Glenn arriving at Wembley next month.","FA Cup is set to be named Emirates FA Cup as part of sponsorship deal .

"A British grandmother on death row in Bali for smuggling cocaine has condemned the execution of the Australian Bali Nine duo as 'senseless and brutal'. Lindsay Sandiford, 58, from Cheltenham, now fears she will be the next to face the firing squad and said she 'feels like giving up' and 'just wants to get it over with'. Australians Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 33, were executed  along with six other prisoners by an Indonesian firing squad. Scroll down for videos . Lindsay Sandiford, pictured, believes that she will be executed by the end of the year for smuggling drugs . She was sentenced to death after Indonesian police linked her to almost five kilograms of cocaine . One of ambulances carrying the bodies of Australian death-row prisoners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran arrives at a funeral home in Jakarta, Indonesia . An ambulance carrying the coffin of one of eight executed drug convicts seen as it exits Nusakambangan port . Ambulances with the bodies of the eight men executed by Indonesia overnight, including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were pictured arriving at Cilacap port from the prison island . The grandmother told a friend she was 'utterly heartbroken' at the news about Chan, who she had befriended in Bali's squalid Kerobokan prison. The Australian pair were the first to die in the latest round of executions  after a final KFC bucket meal. She said: 'The men shot dead were reformed men – good men who transformed the lives of people around them. Their senseless, brutal deaths leave the world a poorer place.If they kill someone as good as Andrew, what hope is there for me? 'I just want to get it over with. I feel like just giving up.' Andrew Chan (right), who befriended Sandiford in prison, and Myuran Sukumaran (left) were killed by firing squad . At Cilacap port, anti-death penalty protesters began playing 'Hallelujah' just prior to news of the deaths . A group of Christians pray and hold a candlelight vigil to protest against the death penalty at Nusakambangan port . Sandiford says Chan – who was sentenced to death in 2005 for masterminding the so-called Bali Nine heroin smuggling plot – helped her cope in jail after she was given her death penalty two years ago. She said: 'I really admire Andrew. He's been an incredible help to me and he would be there for anyone who genuinely needed help inside the prison. 'The heart of the prison has gone since they left. They organised rehabilitation projects. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have running water on the blocks, or the classes in painting, cookery and computers. I would like to send my deepest condolences to their families and loved ones. 'Many things have been said about whether Andrew and Myuran deserved to die for their crimes. I didn’t know those men at the time they committed those crimes 10 years ago. What I can say is that the Andrew and Myuran I knew were men who did good and touched the lives of a great many people, including myself.' Chan – who turned to Christianity and was ordained in prison earlier this year – told Sandiford shortly before his transfer to Execution Island that he was reconciled to his fate. He said: 'I'm not afraid to die but I am afraid of dying. I'm scared of the bullets and I'm scared it won't be a quick death.' The Australian pair were killed by a firing squad on Bali's 'death island', Nusa Kambangan . Sandiford has been languishing on death row in Bali since being convicted of attempting to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine through the island's airport in 2012. She maintains she was forced to transport the drugs to protect her children, whose safety was at stake. The British government refused a request to pay Sandiford's legal fees for her appeal. The British grandmother said she 'really admired Andrew', who was executed  by the firing squad . Reformed drug smugglers Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) were put to death . Earlier ambulances carrying the corpses of Chan and Sukumaran arrived from the 'death island' where they were shot dead. The families of Chan and Sukumaran released a statement following the executions. 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. Our sons, our brothers,' they said. 'In the ten years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others. They asked for mercy, but there was none. 'They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. We too, will be forever grateful.' The others executed were Indonesian Zainal Abidin, Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, Nigerians Sylvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Raheem Agbaje Salami and Okwudili Oyatanze, and Ghanaian Martin Anderson. A law enforcement official was quoted saying: 'The executions went well, without any disruptions.' Armed police lined the road at Cilacap port as the ambulances carrying the coffins of the executed men were transported through a crowd . One of the lawyers for the Bali Nine drug traffickers took to Twitter shortly after their deaths were confirmed . He tweeted, 'I failed. I lost', which was followed by another message apologising for their deaths . Myuran Sukumaran's grief-stricken mother, Raji, pleads for her son's life as her husband Sam looks on . An Indonesian mobile brigade police team, believed to be an execution team, were photographed being taken on a boat to Nusakambangan island . A local television station broadcast a chilling re-enactment of how executions are carried out in Indonesi . In following through with the killings, the Indonesian government ignored agonised pleas for clemency from the prisoners' families and Australian and international officials. All eight death row prisoners refused to wear blindfolds, choosing instead to face their executioners. Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso - the Filipino drug mule who was the ninth convict sentenced to death - was spared after new information emerged about her case. As news filtered through to the nearby port of Cilacap, supporters prayed and sung 'Amazing Grace' Bali Nine supporters comfort each other at Cilacap after the harrowing news came through . 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. 'Our sons, our brothers. 'In the 10 years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others. 'They asked for mercy, but there was none. 'They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. 'We too, will be forever grateful.' The Chan and Sukumaran families were staying together in a hotel in Cilacap when the murders occurred. Some relatives who were on the island reportedly heard the deadly shots ringing out and 'became hysterical'. A Twitter account purporting to belong to Chan's brother, Michael, tweeted: 'I have just lost a Courageous brother to a flawed Indonesian legal system. I miss you already RIP my Little Brother.' One of the pair's lawyers, Peter Morrissey, told the Nine Network: 'It's a very sad time.. the two boys are gone. 'They were beautiful blokes. It is really sad. 'We did have a good (legal) argument. We still have a good argument. We just don't have anything to (argue) it for. 'We'll all keep fighting the death penalty for sure but it's not going to bring the boys back.' One of the lawyers for the Bali Nine, Todung Mulya Lubis, saw the loss of the young Australian men as a personal failure. 'I failed. I lost,' he wrote on social media. 'I am sorry'. Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso (centre) survived - spared after her alleged recruiter turned herself in . Mary Jane Veloso's family appear relieved after arriving at Nusa Kambangan port in Cilacap after their loved one was spared at the 11th hour . As the executions occurred, at nearby Cilacap port anti-death penalty protesters lit white candles and sang 'Hallelujah' and just outside the gates. Later, a silence fell over the area with only singing voices, music of Amazing Grace and prayers heard for the doomed Bali Nine duo. The Australian government is expected to retaliate for Wednesday's executions, which Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had long lobbied against. Even in the final hours, officials were fighting the death penalty ruling. Indonesia has some of the toughest drug laws in the world. It ended a four-year moratorium on executions in 2013. The country, which has now carried out 15 such executions in four months, has vowed to kill all of its 58 foreign drug convicts by the end of the year.","Lindsay Sandiford fears she will be next to face the firing squad .

"Michael Bisping is eyeing a long-awaited homecoming ahead of his fight against CB Dollaway. The Manchester middleweight takes on Dollaway in Montreal on Saturday night bidding to avoid losing successive fights for the first time in his career. And assuming he does so, Bisping is open to fighting again in Glasgow this July, five years since he last fought in the UK. Michael Bisping gets up close to CB Dolloway during the UFC 186 weigh-in at Metropolis on Friday . ‘I know it’s a cliche but I feel like I’m in the best shape of my life. I’m ready to take on the world, and by world I mean CB Dollaway,’ he said. ‘For me it’s just another day in the office. This is what I love to do, this is what I was put on this earth to do. ‘Make no mistake, I’m going to deliver for the fans in Montreal. ‘He’s going to look for a takedown, I’m going to stop that takedown. ‘I’m in the best training situation of my life – if I had this type of training my entire career, I’d have been a world champion five years ago. I just have to prove to the world I’m still one of the best. I’ll beat CB, then I’ll beat someone else and then you’ll hear me start talking about that title shot again. ‘I haven’t fought in the UK in five years. After this fight, if the UFC wants me to fight on the Glasgow card I’ll do it. I’ll fight anywhere in the UK. I’m an Englishman at heart and it’s been far too long since I’ve been able to fight in the UK.’ Bisping looks to get back to winning ways against Dolloway  in Canada this weekend . Bisping is coming off the back of a defeat by Luke Rockhold last November but still considers himself among the best in the world. ‘I’m expecting the best CB Dollaway there is, and I expect him to be confident. But his courage will diminish as the fight goes on, and I will knock him out,’ he added. ‘CB Dollaway is a very good athlete. He’s a great wrestler, he’s a mediocre striker – I’m by far a better striker. ‘I’ve never lost two fights back to back. I need to put a win streak together. But I still consider myself one of the best in the world. ‘The last fight against Rockhold, we clashed heads and I couldn’t see too well – he caught me with a head kick and that was it. ‘I know I’ve had my setbacks, they’ve been well documented. There’s no shame in losing to the guys I’ve lost to; they’re all guys who could be world champions. Dana White called me after the Luke Rockhold fight and told me the reason I was losing fights is because I’m consistently fighting the best guys in the world – not everyone can say that. ‘I’m going to prove that I’m still one of the best in the world.’","Michael Bisping targets impressive win when he returns to the Octagon .

"Carl Frampton has been offered a huge £1.5million payday to face Scott Quigg in one of the biggest all-British fights in recent memory. Talks between the two super-bantamweight world champions have reached a standstill, but Quigg’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, attempted to jolt Frampton’s camp into a July 18 fight in Manchester by offering the biggest cheque of the Northern Irishman’s career to date. The proposal was made live on television, with Frampton’s team, led by Barry McGuigan’s Cyclone Promotions, given until the end of the week to accept the terms. Eddie Hearn presents the cheque for £1.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Matchroom Sport boss Eddie Hearn said the cheque offered 1.5m reasons for the two boxers to fight . Quigg stares down the camera to tell Frampton to 'put his money where his mouth is' It’s a bold move that could see Quigg pocket substantially less Frampton if the pay-per-view purchases do not meet Hearn’s predictions. But with the fight more than a year in the making a low revenues seems unlikely, although at present there is only a moderate chance Frampton’s camp will accept the terms, having released their own statement to demand further talks.

If it doesn’t do the pay-per-view buys that we anticipate, Scott might get a third of that (£500,000 to Frampton’s £1.5m). We take the risk. Carl does not have to take any risk.’ Hearn and McGuigan met in London a fortnight ago to discuss the bout, as reported by Sportsmail. Those talks ended in stalemate, with Cyclone Promotions insisting on Tuesday that Hearn would have to return to the negotiating table if the fight is to happen.

"FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto has admitted that he is still considering whether to join Premier League leaders Chelsea this summer. Earlier this month club president Naoki Ogane claimed that the Blues have made an offer - believed to be around £4million - for the  Japan international. Chelsea would look to loan Muto to partner club Vitesse Arnhem next season but the 22-year-old is keen to join a club where he will play regularly and realise his potential. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto has a shot against Shonan Bellmare during a J-League clash . Chelsea have made an offer for Muto according to FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane . Asked about a potential switch to London this summer after scoring the winner against Shonan Bellmare last week, Muto said: 'I want to think about it carefully. 'Where can I go to develop? A team that suits me, where I can play and develop. I'm thinking about that, and for now I just want to take my time and think it through.' Real Zaragoza boss Ranko Popovic gave Muto his debut for FC Tokyo in July 2013 and he believes the pacey forward could be a big hit at Stamford Bridge. Speaking to Bleacher Report, Popovic said: 'His potential was amazing, I didn't see for a long time such an intelligent player like Muto. He's a different guy, he's not such a usual player. 'Muto is something like a noble. He has something different to all other players because he comes from a good family, he has good education, he was at university. A very smart, intelligent guy. He has something which you cannot learn. 'He was so fast. So speedy and, for a Japanese guy, so strong. And also so confident. He has a lot of confidence. In our training games Muto always had chances. Amazing. He had 10 or 12 chances in every game.' Muto says he is still considering a move to Chelsea as he wants to join a club where he will 'play and develop' Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had admitted that he is aware of the Japan international . Chelsea signed a £200million sponsorship deal with Japanese tyre manufacturer Yokohama Rubber in February and Jose Mourinho has admitted that commercial interests do play a part in the club's transfer policy. Asked about Muto earlier this month, Mourinho said: 'I know a little about him. I don't think it is nice for me to talk about a player who plays for FC Tokyo. 'If a FC Tokyo manager talks about my player I wouldn't be happy.It is not nice for me to speak about other players. 'In modern football and football is a business, an industry, you have to think about the financial situation, especially a club like Chelsea that wants to be in the rules like Financial Fair Play. 'But we want to win matches and don't get a player unless he is a good player or a good prospect.'","Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Yoshinori Muto .

"If Charlie Austin played for a big club he would be in the England team by now. That’s the populist stance, anyway, and parroting it is much easier than working through the logistics. If we think a squad should contain four strikers, who should Roy Hodgson drop to make way? Wayne Rooney, the captain, poised to overtake Sir Bobby Charlton as the greatest goal-scorer in England’s history? Danny Welbeck, the top scorer across this European Championship qualifying round, with six goals in five games? Harry Kane, English football’s leading goalscorer — or Daniel Sturridge, the man whose partnership with Luis Suarez almost propelled Liverpool to the title last season?

Austin scored in QPR's 3-3 draw with fellow Premier League strugglers Aston Villa on Tuesday night . Harry Kane (left) and Wayne Rooney (right) started in England's recent 1-1 draw with Italy . Every few years an England manager must ride this accusation of big-club favouritism. Remember when Grant Holt of Norwich City was thought to have been unjustly ignored by Hodgson in 2012? Not hearing so much of that since his career nosedived into the Championship, and probably League One, with Wigan Athletic. Austin is different from Holt, whose finest form came towards the end of his career. He will probably move on from Queens Park Rangers at the end of the season and may even earn an England call-up then. Critics will say it is because he now plays for a fashionable club. That isn’t true. Austin has had an excellent year but England have goal-scorers who are in even better form, or have earned their place in the squad. Make no mistake, if he was playing this well as a right back or centre half, he’d have made his debut long ago. Daniel Sturridge (left) and Danny Welbeck are also ahead of Austin in Roy Hodgson's pecking order .

Many people are still ignorant of the dangers of eating chicken despite campaigns to highlight risks, a report says (file picture) More than 70 per cent of Britons rightly identified chicken as the main source of food poisoning and most know it should be cooked until all the pink bits are done. But Lucia Juliano, of Harris Interactive, which polled 2,000 people for the magazine, said: ‘Only 55 per cent of Londoners and 51 per cent of under-25s mentioned chicken as the main source of food poisoning, indicating education among these two groups needs to be ramped up.’ Worryingly, 32 per cent of young people believe washing raw chicken before cooking is a good way to avoid poisoning – the opposite of Food Standards Agency advice. Richard Griffiths, of the British Poultry Council, said: ‘It is clear more work needs to be done to reinforce good habits.’ More than 70 per cent of Britons rightly identified chicken as the main source of food poisoning (file picture) Last month the Mail reported how supermarkets were blocking efforts to tackle the deadly bug.

"A high-level ministerial briefing exclusively obtained by Daily Mail Australia reveals an 'unprecedented' number of Australians could face the death penalty in China for drug smuggling. The revelation follows widespread public anger at Indonesia's executions of Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan despite the pleas of the Federal government. It also comes as one of the few Australians known to be facing death row in China - Sydney man Peter Gardner - had his case pushed forward by six months. 'The number and seriousness of current cases of Australians potentially facing the death penalty in China is unprecedented,' said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document, which was dated December 2, 2014. Chinese authorities have said that eleven Australians were apprehended on suspected drug smuggling charges in Guangzhou alone in 2014 - a crime punishable by death. Scroll down for video . Australian citizen Ibrahim Jalloh (pictured) is reportedly facing drugs charges in Guangzhou province . Peter Gardner (left) and Kalynda Davis (right) were apprehended in Guangzhou. Davis was allowed to go free when charges were withdrawn but Gardner's case has been brought forward by six months . Jockey Anthony Roger Bannister (pictured) was charged with importing 3kg of methamphetamine . The exact number facing possible death sentences was redacted in the briefing, obtained under freedom of information laws, which added: 'None of those detained was born in China or is a former Chinese national. 'All were arrested for drug-related offences'. The document said consular assistance was provided to the Australians, including monitoring developments, prisoner welfare visits, and keeping in contact with family or nominated contacts. Other possible steps appeared to be redacted. Chinese prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty against jockey Anthony Roger Bannister, 43, from Adelaide, who was charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle 3kg of methamphetamine from Guangzhou to Australia. Another citizen, Ibrahim Jalloh and his friend Bengali Sherrif were arrested at Guangzhou Airport in July over alleged drug crimes. Sherrif is reported to have been granted a suspended death sentence and Jalloh has not yet faced trial, according to the ABC. Other names have not been released. Do you know more? Daniel.Piotrowski@mailonline.com . Drug ring? Many of those facing death row were trying to import or export the drug 'ice' into or out of Guangzhou. Pictured above is Guangzhou International Airport . The confidential DFAT briefing concerned Gardner and his then-girlfriend, Penrith woman Kalynda Davis. Ms Davis was freed without charge following a traumatic month in a Chinese prison last year where she was forced to crop her hair short. The pair had met on Tinder. Ms Davis's friends realised something was wrong when she failed to appear as a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in early November. The file also revealed the importance the government placed in not speaking publicly about her case at the time of her imprisonment. 'Given the timing of the investigative period and the possible death penalty involved,' DFAT asked that 'no information about this case be disclosed.' Authorities alleged Gardner tried to smuggle 30kg of methamphetamine out of China to Australia. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared by Chinese authorities because she had carry-on luggage only . Rose Kulak, death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told Daily Mail Australia: 'China executes more people than the rest of the world combined.' 'With a 99 per cent conviction rate in China, once you are sentences to death, it is a very precarious situation you are in,' Ms Kulak said. Approximately 8 per cent of all recorded executions in China last year were carried out for drug-related crimes, Amnesty said. The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Minister was approached for comment but was unavailable to respond by Daily Mail Australia's deadline. A spokesman for Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said Australia should lead efforts against the death penalty, 'in particular working with the United Nations'.

"A young woman on Reddit has shared a set of inspiring before and after images, which showcase how an exercise plan she began 20 months ago in an effort to lessen her depression has not only helped her mentally – but has also ensured a dramatic physical transformation. Aliesha Peterson, 22, detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs – and enabled the Alberta, Canada, resident to gain a noticeably fitter, and much more muscular, physique, as well as an impressive six-pack. 'I can honestly say I am sooo thankful I started taking better care of myself [sic],' she wrote under her Reddit name ahhhgodzilla. 'My progress has been fairly slow but, to me, the most important thing is that I didn't give up.' Scroll down for video . Impressive results: Aliesha Peterson, 22, first started exercising in August 2013, left; as of April 2015, right, she has lost nearly 20lbs and gained a six-pack . Aliesha wasn't always a fan of working out - and explained that she didn't start hitting the gym to look better in a bikini, either. 'I was extremely depressed and refusing to go back on anti-depressants,' she explained. 'I went and saw a therapist, and she recommended that I join a gym and start working out three times a week. 'I reluctantly obliged and to be completely honest, I absolutely hated it. 'I hated how uncomfortable I felt there, that I obviously had no idea what I was doing.' But after three months of sticking with it, she admitted that she started to 'somewhat enjoy it'. Aliesha's routine is made up of exercises that focus on a different part of her body for each day of the week, and she will often do cardio on the weekends. Her workouts include several sets of squats, bench presses, crunches, curls, and planks. On Wednesdays, she works on her back, which she said is her favorite part of her body. Her back exercises include deadlifts, hyperextensions, and chin ups. Bringing sexy back: The 22-year-old says her back is her favorite part of her body, and she focuses on exercises to strengthen it every Wednesday . 'Before' body: Aliesha, pictured here in 2013 before she started exercising, was by no means overweight, but she has since become more toned by sticking to a demanding workout schedule . After about six months, Aliesha started changing her eating habits, too. While she once stuck to an unhealthy diet which included fast food 'at least twice a day', she began cooking her own meals and choosing to eat healthy food. Now, her diet consists of eggs, yogurt, fruit, chicken, seeds and nuts, green smoothies made with vegetables, protein shakes, turkey, and salmon. Aliesha admits that her story isn't one of shocking rapid weight loss - but she says her slow progress is the reason she's been so successful. 'I'm sure if I completely changed my lifestyle all at once that my results would have been a lot more impressive in a much shorter amount of time, but it would not have been sustainable,' she wrote. Because she's worked at a slow, steady pace, she's been able to maintain her new figure - which has been a boon to her self-esteem. 'I am much more confident in my body,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'I no longer hate looking in the mirror and have learned to accept my flaws and am able to see the positive qualities I possess as well.' Barely-there biceps: In October 2013, pictured, Aliesha had only just started going to the gym to help her improve her depression . Welcome to the gun show: Pictured this month, Aliesha's arms have grown much more muscular; she says she now loves going to the gym . Of course, Aliesha added, it isn't always easy to maintain the motivation to work out five to seven days a week, but sticking to a routine has helped. 'I truly believe the key to bettering yourself is to cultivate and preserve healthy habits,' she continued. 'The first few months are the hardest, but once you make it through that stage it becomes a lot less painful, and you may even learn to enjoy it like I have.' She is also enjoying what working out has done for her mental health. 'While I still struggle with depression, it is much, much less severe,' she said. 'Instead of laying in bed all day crying, letting it consume me, I get up and do things - go to the gym, do yoga, walk my dogs, see friends. 'The best part of getting into this routine has definitely been the mental change,' she concluded. 'My friends and family have all noticed the difference, my relationships are stronger, I feel better about myself, and I'm constantly striving for self improvement.'","Aliesha Peterson, 22, from Canada, says a therapist recommended she start exercising to improve her depression .

"Reality TV star and singer Lil' Chris who died last month was found hanging at his home by a friend, the inquest into his death has been told. The 24-year-old pop star, whose real name was Chris Hardman, died on March 23 in his hometown of Lowestoft after a long battle with depression. Suffolk coroner Peter Dean today told the inquest that Mr Hardman's that friend AJ Sutton later identified the body. Scroll down for video .

He said that paramedics and police were called to his home in Union Road, Lowestoft, that morning and death was confirmed at 11.48am. He added: 'He had been found at his home by a friend. Emergency services were called but attempts at resuscitation failed.' In a previous statement Mr Hardman's family said he had been fighting a long battle with depression, and was determined to find a cure . Pathologist Richard Ball confirmed the cause of death as hanging. Dr Dean said: 'I would like to offer my thoughts and condolences to the family, friends and all those close to him for their loss.'

"A Saudi Arabian citizen has captured intense footage of a sandstorm sweeping its way across a street, engulfing everything in its path. Sandstorms caused havoc in Saudi Arabia last week with a number of flights being cancelled and schools being forced to close. Car crashes were also reported in other areas as parts of the Arabian Peninsula   were plunged into darkness. Strong winds are believed to have caused the disruption, which resulted in nearby Dubai’s skyline almost disappearing and people suffering from respiratory problems. The footage, captured on camera in Saudi Arabia by Mohammed Mohsen, shows the sandstorm sweeping into the area in which he stands at a staggering speed. Like the aftermath of an explosion, the orange cloud engulfs the road and nearby buildings while it continues to move forward. Mohammed Mohsen captures the orange cloud getting thicker as it disperses and engulfs the road . The orange cloud gets thicker and drastically reduces visibility across the entire Arab state . Getting thicker, the cloud suddenly becomes darker and is it disperses further  sunlight becomes drastically reduced. A number of people stand alongside the video maker, staring in awe and filming the large cloud on their own camera phones. The video concludes with the filmmaker moving the camera around to show the sheer capacity of the cloud, which he is now very much encapsulated within. Mohammed Mohsen films the cloud above his head and captures the moment he becomes engulfed within it . Last week the storm filled Saudi Arabia’s air before spreading across the peninsula into the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Yemen. Despite sandstorms being a relatively common occurrence in this part of the world, they are not generally this big and rarely wreak so much havoc. Many people took to social media to upload the images they had taken of the sandstorm and share their experiences.","Citizen captured sandstorm sweeping its way through part of the state .

"Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden may look like the epitome of good health today, but the 44-year-old has revealed that she has fought through dark times to get here. In a new interview Holden has admitted that her traumatic childbirth experiences left her needing therapy, but have also inspired her to live life to the full. In her cover interview for the June issue ofGood Housekeeping, the mother-of-two talks about how it was therapy that saved her after she lost one child and nearly died after having another. Scroll down for video . Amanda Holden, 44, stuns on her cover shoot for the June 2015 issue of Good Housekeeping . Holden, who married record producer Chris Hughes in 2008, has two daughters, nine-year-old Alexa and three-year-old Hollie. Although the actress now has a beautiful family, her pregnancies have been complicated, with one even ending in tragedy as Amanda suffered a devastating miscarriage in 2011, giving birth to a stillborn baby, Theo, at seven months. And with the birth of now three-year-old Hollie, the television star encountered serious medical complications and nearly died in the process, losing a dangerous amount of blood. Following this near-death experience, Holden was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the Britain's Got Talent judge initially struggled to cope with the trauma, turning to therapy to help. The blonde talks about her traumatic childbirth experiences as well as maintaining her youthful appearance . In the interview, Holden says: 'My therapist told me I had no more tools or coping mechanism left. She was very good at giving me sentences to say to myself to make me stop panicking about my own mortality. 'I think you have none of these worries unless you’ve got children. If it had just been me and Chris and I’d died, it would have been awful for him but nowhere near as bad as a child losing their mother. She adds: 'It makes you suddenly think, I have to live. I’ve got to live, but I’ve got to try and live a good, happy life for me too and I think that’s why I faced up to the fact that I needed to speak to somebody. It was a really good thing. I’m probably too open but I have no secrets.' The radiant TV star also ruled out the possibility of trying for another child, but has found peace with it. Holden says: 'I’m not allowed. I would be dead the next time. And I think Chris would say you can have them but you’re not having them with me. 'I’ve got the two I’m supposed to have. I just had to complete my family to feel like I could be me.' The presenter (pictured right) is best known as a judge of ITV's show Britain's Got Talent, with (l-r) Alesha Dixon, 36, David Walliams, 43, and Simon Cowell, 55 . The stunning blonde always looks stylish for the shows in an array of on-trend outfits . Through traumatic times, Holden admits that her husband, Chris Hughes, has been a constant source of reassurance. She gushes: 'The minute I met him, my life changed so much for the better. He has a great perspective on life. 'He makes me stop, he’s given me my children and literally stood by my death bed and I really fancy him…' Although they have a happy marriage, Holden admits that nothing is perfect. She adds: 'How I feel about Chris still feels new. We try to do date night but it fails dismally. We’re doing everything that you could possibly do wrong in a marriage!' 'We’re ignoring date nights and watching box sets but it’s working! We feel stronger and it just feels new. Chris is very funny, and in the face of adversity he’s so bad and verging on politically incorrect!'

Amanda Holden's sister, Deborah is currently caught in the chaos of the Nepal earthquake . The TV presenter is currently consumed putting on a brave face, as recently news hit that sister Deborah Holden, is caught in the chaos of the Mount Everest avalanche disaster, which has so far killed 18 people.

"There will be calls for England to get rid of Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott on the back of their failures here but I think they should both play all three Tests against West Indies before any sort of decision is made. We are talking about two batsmen with phenomenal Test records who have done it against Australia in the past and, with good players like that, you do not jettison them easily. Cook, for instance, will end up with one of the greatest of all England records and you have to give people of that calibre every possible chance to show they are worth a place. Jonathan Trott (left) and Alastair Cook head out to open England's second innings against West Indies . Trott walks past Cook after he was dismissed for just four runs by Jerome Taylor on day three . I said after the first day of this Test that England’s top order was a bit one-paced which could be an issue but that does not mean I think they should be dropped unless there is conclusive evidence they are in decline. England’s new opening pair have very different issues. Trott will have played all sorts of mind games with himself ahead of this game, telling himself to enjoy it and trying to forget how people perceive him after leaving Australia. He will have desperately tried not to build this Test up too much but, once out in the middle, he will have known how important it is. You could see how frenetic he was and how much he was moving at the crease. When you are nervous and desperate to do well your movements can become exaggerated as emotion takes hold. He has got to tell himself to stay still at the crease. The Trott I remember was almost Jacques Kallis-like in how still he was. If it were not for his scratching around you wouldn’t notice him. The Trott I remember would get to 70 before you knew it and we can’t judge his comeback on a Test where he has received good deliveries in both innings. Trott was making his first Test appearance for England in 18 months against the West Indies . He has to tell himself to calm down, stay still and chill a bit at the crease and it will be hard because the Duke ball is swinging and he is not accustomed to being an opener. He has been at three his whole career. If he does not make runs in the next two Tests and England are convinced he won’t be able to become the player he was then that is the time to have a look at someone else. Not now. The captain, in contrast, has a technical issue. Cook is mentally one of the strongest cricketers England have ever produced, an incredible fighter and an incredible bloke who has such a burning desire to prove people wrong. Trott leaves the field in Antigua following his poor showing on day three of the first Test . Yes, form is a concern — he hasn’t scored an international century in two years but this is a man who reached 25 Test hundreds in record time. And it is true to say he has been found out. Cook based his game around three shots — the cut, the pull and clip off the hip — and he would get lots of runs. Now opponents are bowling at him in the areas he doesn’t want them to and he has a problem when the ball is moving. But the swinging ball is not a new phenomenon, especially to an opener brought up in England, and Cook has to score runs against the moving ball now if he is going to prolong his Test career. Trott was very much in the mould of South Africa batsman Jacques Kallis (above) when he was on form . Cook has now gone 61 combined Test and ODI innings without making a century . West Indies will be very disciplined for an hour but their third seamer is Jason Holder. This is not Australia. If Cook can just sit in, be a bit more disciplined outside off stump and see off that new ball then the run-making opportunities will come. Bowlers will get bored before he does. It is not that he cannot score when the ball is pitched up. You don’t score 8,423 Test runs without being able to play off the front foot. Of course he can. But in his first 10 or 15 minutes he is pushing too hard at the ball rather than letting it come to him. These are both exceptional players and you are always a better player when you are out of a side. It takes a long time to make a Test player —don’t discard them until you are absolutely sure the time is right.","Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott have both struggled with the bat .

"Khloe Kardashian has hit back at critics of her Instagram post reaction to Monday night's riots in Baltimore saying she is 'Damned if I do. Damned if I don't'. The 30-year-old reality TV star posted - then later deleted - the message 'Pray for Baltimore' to Instagram on Monday night as protests about the unexplained death of Freddie Gray turned to riots in the hours following his funeral. While over 417,000 followers liked the photo, it did not escape criticism. Khloe Kardashian posted this photo to Instagram on Monday night as protests turned to riots in Baltimore, while more than 400,000 followers liked it, the post - now deleted - also drew criticism . Some critics went after her privileged background and accused her being unable to relate to those involved in the protests. Others accused her of insincerity, and still more aired shockingly racist feelings. Another group felt her prayers were misplaced and were instead needed elsewhere, such as for the victims of the Nepal earthquake.

"A woman has been arrested after she allegedly broke into a home on Martha's Vineyard, lived inside for at least a week and sold items belonging to the owners in a yard sale. Michelle Filkins, 44, of West Wareham has been charged with breaking and entering, larceny over $250, and malicious destruction of property. She was discovered at the Court Street property in Edgartown by owner Mark Conklin on April 17. Michelle Filkins, 44, of West Wareham has been charged with breaking and entering, larceny over $250, and the malicious destruction of property after she was arrested on April 17 . Filkins was arrested on April 17 after owner Mark Conklin found her sitting in his summer home . According to the police report, Conklin found Filkins sitting in his living room of the property estimated to be worth $800,000. When he confronted her she claimed that she owned the house. She then fled in a gray Nissan pickup truck when Conklin called the police at about 8 a.m. When police arrived, they discovered a large glass window to the left side of the front door had been broken and covered by a blanket, reports The Boston Globe. Filkins was arrested several hours later after she attempted to get back into the home thinking that Conklin had left. She is next scheduled to be in court on May 14. A construction worker in the neighborhood has told police that he saw Filkins outside with items from the home, and that she appeared to be having a yard sale or giving the items away. According to a post on the department's Facebook page, items missing include four deck chairs from Crate & Barrel, a Weber grill, two side tables from Ethan Allen, one Ann Chase lamp, two lamps from Crate & Barrel, two framed posters, various pots, pans, and linens, and a painting by the owner. Police are asking anyone who received items from the home to return them to the Edgartown police department. 'If in fact you did purchase something you are a victim as well and EPD will assist you in seeking restitution via the court prosecution of this case,' the police department said on Facebook. Anyone with information can also contact the police department at 508-627-4343.

"The fact Jimmy Anderson and Sir Ian Botham are the leading wicket-takers in England Test history proves cricket is a game in which players of completely different character can thrive. It takes a range of types to make a successful team and you could not get more contrasting personalities than Sir Ian and the quiet lad from Burnley who broke his English Test wicket-taking record on Friday night. When I played for England we had Alec Stewart, meticulous and well organised, opening the batting with that scruffy herbert Mike Atherton. Jimmy Anderson celebrates taking a record 384th Test wicket for England against the West Indies on Friday . The 32-year-old is congratulated by his England team-mates following the dismissal of Denesh Ramdin . Then we had Andrew Caddick, who needed reassurance and an arm round the shoulder, opening the bowling with a character in Darren Gough who loved the limelight and wanted to be the centre of attention. Botham was always larger than life and in your face, had huge self-belief as a player and still has an aura about him now. When Sir Ian walks into a room everybody notices him. Anderson, by contrast, would go unnoticed if he walked into a room. He shuns the limelight — so unlike the angry youth we so often see on the field. Sir Ian Botham watches on and applauds as Anderson beats the former England cricketer's Test record . Botham gives two thumbs up as he watches the action unfold during the Test match in Antigua . The quality they do share is their stubbornness. I have never heard Beefy admit he was wrong about anything. The only smidgeon of self-doubt came when admitting he perhaps shouldn’t have taken on the West Indies so often with the hook. That absolute belief that he is right about everything was what made Botham the cricketer he was. Jimmy, too, knows the way he wants to do things and doesn’t like to be told to do it any other way. He had a bit of an argument with Alastair Cook on the fourth evening of this Test. Cook wanted to keep the slips in but Anderson has been worried about batsmen rotating the strike and taking singles his whole career and wanted the chance to go at certain players for the whole of an over. Botham will be very happy for Anderson He is not one of those former players who look at records and hope they stay at the top of the tree. The 59-year-old was one of the first people to congratulate Anderson after the Test match had finished . Cook had to remind the leader of his attack that England had more than 400 to play with and needed to attack so the captain got his way, even though Anderson looked grumpy about it. The point is, you do not have to have the same rules for every player in your team. There really can be one rule for Sir Ian Botham and there can be a different rule for Jimmy Anderson. Jimmy Anderson was one of the nicest blokes I captained and I was delighted when he broke Sir Ian’s record here. You could see how much it meant to the England team, too, who were urging him towards this landmark. Botham, up in the commentary box with us, was very happy for Anderson. He has been waiting to give Jimmy some wine and now he will hand it over gladly. Botham has always been larger than life and showed huge self-belief as a player and he still has an aura . England's Alastair Cook takes the catch as Anderson celebrates taking his record-breaking wicket . Clearly a popular figure, Anderson is swamped by his team-mates following the all-important wicket .","Jimmy Anderson becomes England's leading Test match wicket-taker .

"Disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams has threatened to make his departure from the channel 'really ugly', it has been reported. The 55-year-old newsman is refusing to go down 'without a fight' as he looks to return to his post on NBC Nightly News, according to a source close to the network. It comes after it was revealed that an internal inquiry found Williams's had lied in his reporting to make himself look good at least 11 times. Disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams (pictured) has threatened to make his departure from the channel 'really ugly', it has been reported . He was suspended in February with no pay for six months after it emerged that he repeatedly told a false story about being aboard a military helicopter hit by an RPG over Iraq. A source said to be close to NBC has told The New York Post how Williams 'is saying he’s not going down without a fight and (is) threatening to make it really ugly'. Williams is currently halfway through his six-month suspension from his roles as anchor and managing editor of the Nightly News. He was replaced by Lester Holt, who has kept ratings relatively steady. It is unclear whether NBC will put Williams back in the top slot when the suspension ends. Iraq shame: Williams fell from grace after veterans called him out after he lied about being on board a US military chopper which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade . Yesterday it was reported that NBC News chief Andrew Lack wanted Williams to resume his role. But this contradicted earlier claims that NBC executives wanted Williams out and were trying to negotiate his resignation. A source told the New York Daily News 'Andy (Lack) believes viewers want him (Williams) back. 'The feeling is that (Williams') problem seems to be more with the media and other reporters than his viewers - if Andy can figure out a way to get him back on the air he will do it.' The source added that Lack 'will not make a decision about Williams' fate until the network's internal probe is complete.' On Tuesday, a report emerged in the Hollywood Reporter that Lack was in fact not convinced that Williams would be able to return. Williams has reportedly been banned from speaking publicly about the investigation, or defending himself against any new claims. He is reported to have signed a deal with the network last year to continue at the network thought to be worth $10million a year. According to the New York Post, NBC News has yet to make any decision's about the newsman's future.","The former NBC Nightly News anchor was suspended over false Iraq story .

"It has been almost 20 years since a 21-year-old Tiger Woods stormed the course at Augusta en route to his first victory at the Masters in 1997, and now there is a new American star on the block in the form of 2015 Masters champion Jordan Spieth. Spieth shattered record after record on the way to his triumph at Augusta on Sunday. The 21-year-old held a a four-shot lead heading into the final day of action and never looked back as he became the first man ever to reach 19 under par in the Masters. Having finished joint-second, along with Jonas Blixt, to Bubba Watson at last year's tournament, Spieth stormed to a final round of 70 to cap off an incredible few days on the Georgia course.

Spieth kisses his girlfriend Annie Verret following his record-breaking title win on Sunday . Born in Dallas, Texas - Spieth grew up the oldest of three siblings to Shawn and Chris Spieth. Spieth began gaining attention in the golf world when he was just a teenager, becoming the only American besides Woods to claim two US Junior Amateur titles after winning in 2009 and 2011. As a result of his accomplishments in junior play, he even gained entry into a PGA event, becoming the sixth youngest player to ever make the cut when at just 17 years of age he began the third round in the PGA Tour's HP Byron Nelson Championship, ultimately finishing in an impressive tie for 16th place. Soon after he decided to attend the University of Texas, leading them to the NCAA Championship in his first year and getting to play in the US Open in 2012, where he finished as a low amateur.

"Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee recovered from a fall to claim victory in his return to World Triathlon Series action in Cape Town. The 27-year-old, who missed the first three events of the season due to an ankle injury, sprinted away to beat rival Javier Gomez with Frenchman Vincent Luis in third. Brownlee led into transition at the end of the cycling stage but dropped off the leading group after being tripped due to contact with Gomez. Alistair Brownlee won on his World Triathlon Series return in Cape Town after tripping during the run leg . Brownless was able to fight his way back into contention, however, and warned his rivals he can only improve from this point. Brownlee told BBC Sport: 'I knew I wasn't that fit, I didn't have good legs to be honest, then Javier tripped me up and I had to run back so the whole thing was tough. 'I should only get fitter from here so give me another three weeks and hopefully I will be another notch up.'

"The romantics will pick Sean Dyche or Ronald Koeman, the statistics lovers will go for Jose Mourinho or, at a push, Arsene Wenger. But for me there is one standout contender for manager of the year and that's Louis van Gaal. Think about what he walked into and what he was expected to achieve in a short space of time. You can only be impressed. The stricken patient was fading fast, but the Dutch doctor hasn't just stuck plasters over the wounds, he's breathed life into a giant and resurrected it back to rude health. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is among those in the running for manager of the year . United's players celebrate together during the derby win against rivals Manchester City . Wayne Rooney, Ashley Young and Juan Mata celebrate during the 4-2 win against City . Manuel Pellegrini is punching above his weight at City... the club MUST think big or forever remain small . Forget Eden Hazard and Michael Carrick... the best player in the Premier League this weekend was Leicester's Jamie Vardy . How stupid do some English football 'experts' look now? After the early-season defeats at MK Dons and Leicester City, they were laying into Van Gaal. They should have known better. When a manager as great as Van Gaal turns up in the Barclays Premier League, we should all be grateful to witness his genius at close quarters. So while he was busy trying to rectify the massive problems he inherited at Manchester United, there were too many who couldn't wait to hammer him for every single slip-up. And now they've all gone quiet as United cement their place in the top four. Job done – so far, at least. The critics will probably say he hasn't won anything. Listen, United were seventh last season, their defence was decimated in the summer, and this season the two big signings – Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria – have, for different reasons, failed to hit the heights they achieved previously. Marouane Fellaini celebrates scoring in this brilliant photograph taken by Sportsmail snapper Ian Hodgson . Despite all of that, Van Gaal has taken United back to where they wanted to be – into the top four. In fact, it's mid-April and United are still in the title race (unlikely, but they're just a point behind Arsenal so of course they're still in it). Sunday's derby victory was utterly convincing. And it highlighted one of the biggest strengths of Van Gaal's reign at United so far – the way he has worked with and improved individual players. All of a sudden Ashley Young looks brilliant – it wasn't just Sunday, he's been arguably United's best player this season. How many managers could have made Young look convincing in a United shirt? At the start of the season I was asking the question about Chris Smalling and Phil Jones – could they make the centre-half spots their own? I think that question is still pertinent, but those two played very well against City and are starting to look the part in the Old Trafford back four. Players once moaned about, such as Fellaini and Young, are now pivotal parts of the team under Van Gaal . Van Gaal’s belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like Young and Fellaini have benefited . Michael Carrick looks indispensible again, when even I was doubting if he would recover from the David Moyes debacle. And who knew Marouane Fellaini could be so influential for Manchester United? Even Van Gaal's decision to give Wayne Rooney the captaincy looks inspired. He's had a brilliant season and he's led the United resurgence on the field superbly. Impressive stuff, so all the critics need to calm down and pay a bit more respect to Van Gaal, he deserved a better reception from the English football public based on his career record alone. A little more than a year ago Manchester United were humiliated at home by City. Van Gaal has single-handedly raised the sinking ship back to the surface, steadied it, and got it sailing full steam ahead. He just needs to add a bit of polish next season.

"Is this confirmation that Angel Di Maria is happy as a Manchester United player? The 27-year-old has endured a mixed start to his United career on-and-off the pitch since joining the club last summer - which has included an attempted burglary at his family home in Cheshire back in February.

"When Dulwich picture gallery began discussing the idea of introducing a fake painting to their collection, no-one could have imagined it would have led to the quadrupling of visitor numbers. But that is exactly what happened when Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s 18th-century work Young Woman was replaced by a hand-painted replica, produced in China and ordered over the internet for £70. It has hung in among 270 Old Master paintings since February 10 after a challenge was laid down to the public to 'spot the fake'. Now, three months on, the gallery has revealed that only 10 per cent of the 3,000 people who visited during the experiment guessed correctly. Scroll down for video . Can you spot the difference? A member of the public compares the original painting by Jean-Honore Fragonard (left) and the replica ordered on the internet from China (right) at the Dulwich picture gallery . But the gallery's chief curator, Xavier Bray, said that he was impressed a number of people had managed to spot the imposter hidden among the Rembrandts, Rubens and Murillos. He told MailOnline: 'It was a fascinating experiment which gave us a chance to test art connoisseurs and we saw visitor numbers quadruple because of it. 'It made people look closely at a painting and discern what might be a replica and why. Ten per cent got it right, which means Britain as a nation is still a nation of connoisseurs, which is great. 'Unfortunately others got it wrong. A number of visitors presumed the imposter was a female portrait by Rubens, which had been restored 10 years ago, because it appeared brighter. But that was interesting as it allowed us to find out more about the way the public look at our paintings.' The idea for the exhibition, titled Made in China, came from American artist Doug Fishbone. Its aim was to make people think about the way they look at, appreciate and value artistic masterpieces. Mr Bray said Dulwich was keen to challenge the public to 'spot the fake' as a way of engaging with visitors and making the picture gallery more interactive. Visitors were challenged to spot the replica among 270 Old Master paintings. Only 10 per cent of them guessed right. The original and fake are now hanging together, making the difference more obvious . 'Fascinating experiment': The gallery's chief curator, Xavier Bray (pictured), said visitor numbers quadrupled after the 'spot the fake' challenge was laid down to the public at the beginning of February . The power of the museum: Mr Bray said the gallery was not planning any similar experiments. Instead, his attention has turned to whether the fake will now become a work of art in its own right . 'It was a risk, no doubt about it,' he said. 'You wouldn't expect the National Gallery or the Tate to display a replica on their walls but because we're an independent charity and don't rely on public money it means we're relatively free to do what we want. 'But that doesn't mean there couldn't have been repercussions. We are a temple of art and as soon as people cross that threshold they expect everything you are told on a label to be correct. 'Our aim was to get people to engage and learn - that is what was really exciting. Can they spot a replica by comparing it with the magical, beautiful originals we have?' The way to distinguish the real from the fake, Mr Bray said, was to look at the lack of warmth in the background canvas of the imposter and the modern pigment of acrylic paints. 'If you look closely, the brushwork on the fake is trying to be expressive but it comes across as dead because it's an attempt to replicate something else. There's no magic to it like there is with the real one.' The original painting was put back in its frame yesterday and hung beside the replica, allowing people to compare the differences between the two. Mr Bray said the gallery was not planning any similar experiments. Instead, his attention has turned to whether the fake will now become a work of art in its own right. 'It will be very interesting to see what happens when the counterfeit leaves the gallery,' he said. 'Will it achieve significance and become a work of art? 'This is where the power of it being displayed in a temple of a museum could give it extra significance in the art world - that is also part of the experiment.' Original: Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s Young Woman . Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s 18th-century work Young Woman is one of his famous Fantasy Figures, a series of quickly executed studies intended to showcase the artist’s virtuoso handling of oil paint. It was painted in 1769. The unidentified woman is portrayed in Spanish dress, with a lace collar and slashed sleeves suggesting the dramatic costume of the stage. It was Spanish painter Diego Velázquez (1599-1660) who inspired the depiction of Spanish dress in 18th-century French art. Once thought to be by French artist Jean-Alexis Grimou (1678-1733) on the strength of his signature, closer examination revealed that this was false. Fragonard's genuine signature, ‘Frago’, is discernible above, although partially obscured by overpainting. It is believed Fragonard was paying a playful homage to Grimou, a fellow artist who was well known in France at the time, particularly as a copyist . It is thought Fragonard's intent was not to deceive, but rather to excite connoisseurs with amusing visual ambiguity.","Dulwich picture gallery challenged public to spot fake among 270 paintings .

"The celebrations will continue long after Barnet’s delirious supporters are cleared off the pitch as the club returned to the Football League following a two-year absence. Three points were all that separated Barnet from the Conference title, and two goals from Mauro Vilhete ensured Martin Allen’s fourth spell in charge of the club would be his most successful.

Subs not used: Dixon, Allan, Orrell . Referee: Darren England . Attendance: 5,233 . Gateshead played their part in the script to perfection, and were continually on the back foot. Allen made sure of that by being the most animated figure at the sold-out Hive. There is just something about this club that keeps attracting the man nicknamed Mad Dog back. Yet he looked ready to pull his hair out after just four minutes when John Akinde cut the ball back for Michael Gash, only for the Barnet attacker’s tame shot to be cleared off the line by Jamie Chandler. Barnet were dominating, while Gateshead were simply surviving. Yet the breakthrough arrived in the 25th minute. A straightforward set-piece resulted in a free header for one of the smallest men on the pitch. Vilhete rose highest, and eased the tension. No reaction from Allen. No clenched fist. Nothing. He simply turned away, and walked back to his seat. There was still work to do. They could have made it two shortly after, when captain Curtis Weston’s volley met the crossbar. It was beginning to look like Gateshead were in for a long afternoon, and so they were. The daylight arrived in the 48th minute. Michael Gash’s header was instinctively kept out by Gateshead goalkeeper Adam Bartlett, but the rebound was not. Vilhete made no mistake, thumping the ball home from just three yards out. This time, Allen celebrated. Yet Gateshead wanted to remind them they were still there. A header from Carl Finnigan was denied by the out-stretched hand of goalkeeper Adam Bartlett. As good a save you would ever see, no matter which division. That was about as close Gateshead came to threatening the champions on a day that belonged to Barnet. Champions: Barnet .

Regaining their Football League status after a two-year absence came down to 90 minutes against Gateshead. Win, and the title was theirs. Lose or draw, and it went to Bristol Rovers.

The title-winning victory ensures Martin Allen's fourth spell in charge of the club would be his most successful . 'Nobody expected us to do it,' said Allen, currently in his fourth spell in charge of the club. 'The bookmakers never said we would do it. The pundits and the experts said we would be nowhere near it. 'I knew a week before the season started we were going to be champions. I just knew it. There was no-one that could stop us. No way. 'We had too much power. We had too much pace. We had too much of everything. Privately and quietly behind the scenes, I knew that we were going to get 90-plus and win the league. It was obvious to me.' No-one told those in Bristol that. Rovers ended their season with a 7-0 humiliation of Alfreton Town with six different players on the score-sheet, but finished a point behind Barnet. They will have to make do with the play-offs, with their semi-final first leg away to Forest Green Rovers on Wednesday. There were no twists or turns in north London, where Gateshead played their part in the script to perfection. Barnet took the lead in the 25th minute after Mauro Vilhete was gifted a free header. No reaction from Allen. No clenched fist. Nothing. He simply turned away, and walked back to his seat. Yet, when Vilhete's second in the 48th minute all but confirmed they were champions, Allen let loose. Full time was greeted by the almost obligatory and seemingly inevitable pitch invasion, and the celebrations will stretch all the way to Alicante. Barnet manager Allen celebrates with goalkeeper Graham Stack after securing the Conference title . Despite promotion to League Two, Allen's on-off relationship with Barnet could see him leave the club for a fourth time. Their chairman Anthony Kleanthous will join him in Spain this week, having likened his manager to a girlfriend you cannot get rid of. Allen agrees. 'I think I owed the supporters something,' he said. 'Walking out of the relationship, ditching them, going for money, which is what I have done. I never made any secret of that. 'My future? I'm going to Benidorm on Wednesday. The only thing I've got to think about at the moment is what sun factor to use in Benidorm.' At this point, a journalist asks whether that is an open invitation, to which Mad Dog replies: 'No. It's only for the champions, and you're not a champion.' Fortunately for Barnet, they are, as they wave goodbye to the non-League and hello to sunny Spain.

"Zenit St Petersburg striker Hulk lived up to his nickname on Monday night by dressing up as the aforementioned superhero at the premiere of the Avengers: Age of Ultron movie. The 28-year-old, who acquired his nickname due to his likeness to the actor Lou Ferrigno who played the Incredible Hulk in The Incredible Hulk television show in the 1970s, was all smiles as he posed for photos ahead of watching the film. Accompanied with the caption: 'Hulk at the premier of the blockbuster «Avengers: Age of Ultron» @hulkparaiba #Avengers' the Brazil international was pictured wearing the superhero's iconic green hands via Zenit's official Instagram account.

The 28-year-old (right) recently signed a new long-term deal at Zenit until the end of the 2018-19 season . Hulk, who has 41 caps for Brazil, recently signed a new long-term deal at the Russian club until the end of the 2018-19 season. Zenit's No 7's previous deal, reportedly worth more than £5million a year, had been due to expire in summer 2017. The club did not provide any financial details of the new contract - with the striker having netted 15 goals in 33 appearances for the Russian giants in all competitions at present. Hulk's new contract comes at a time when many Russian football clubs are struggling with financial problems because of the low value of the ruble, which has lost almost half of its value against the dollar in the last 12 months - with Rotor Volgograd going bankrupt earlier this month. Top players in Russia are typically paid in dollars or euros, but club budgets are in rubles, putting pressure on clubs' finances.

"Demetrious Johnson retained his UFC flyweight champion title on Saturday night, controlling Kyoji Horiguchi for nearly the entire five-round bout before scoring the latest submission win in UFC history - tapping out his opponent with a second left. 'I didn't want to be stupid and get knocked out,' Johnson said. 'I had 25 minutes. I just took my time, and with 1 second left, I figured I better finish him.' Demetrious Johnson retained his UFC flyweight title with a win over Kyoji Horiguchi in Montreal . Johnson celebrates after a successful defence of his title at th Bell Centre in Canada on Saturday . The American secured a submission victory over Horiguchi in the latest UFC pay-per-view event . Horiguchi was dangerous in the opening round, as his blend of unorthodox, karate-based movements and impressive speed gave the champ some pause in the early going. But the Japanese contender was unable to truly capitalize on the opportunities, and it would cost him. Johnson (22-2-1) simply took over in the second round, showing the wide range of skills that have earned him recognition as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters. Constant pressure from the champ left Horiguchi (15-2) struggling to find any opportunity to attack. Instead, the challenger was constantly forced to try and prevent Johnson from taking his back, as they battled routinely against the fence and in the clinch.

It was one-way traffic until the final round, and the 23-year-old challenger was simply overwhelmed by the more experienced champ. Horiguchi tried to attack until the end, briefly threatening with a fifth-round triangle choke, but he was simply overwhelmed. While he was clearly ahead on the scorecards in the final seconds, Johnson turned up the volume, transitioned to an armbar and scored the submission win. Johnson successfully defended the title for the sixth time. In the co-main event, Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson (36-11) earned his first UFC win since 2011, scoring a unanimous decision over Brazilian slugger Fabio Maldonado (22-8).","Demetrious Johnson retains his UFC flyweight title .

"Diddy certainly isn’t pulling any punches when it comes to putting his money where his mouth is ahead of the mega-fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.

"Manchester City supporters sing a song with the line: 'We're not really here.' It sums up the approach of many of their fanbase – they haven't fully bought into the idea that City could be one of the giants of Europe. Celebrity fan Ricky Hatton wants 'the old City back', while rock-God City lover Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the fans. Manuel Pellegrini could be worried about his position at Manchester City after losing against their fierce rivals . (Left to right) Segio Aguero, Yaya Toure and James Milner look dejected as they await kick-off after a goal . Boxer Ricky Hatton, pictured at the Etihad for a press conference in 2008, says he wants 'the old City back' Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the City supporters . 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of their last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. One of the weirdest things I've been hearing lately is people saying Manuel Pellegrini was the right man at the right time for Manchester City. Their logic is that his calm was needed after the Roberto Mancini reign ended with a fractured dressing room, and an FA Cup final defeat at the hands of Wigan Athletic. Pellegrini is calm but it was the worst kind of short-term thinking which has led to City now clinging on to fourth place. The dressing room calmed down temporarily, but he doesn't have the character or gravitas to galvanise a group of players when the going gets tough. He's punching above his weight at Manchester City. City need to stop pussy-footing around and drag the fans into the modern game. They need to fill up the half-empty glasses of the supporters at the Etihad. Pellegrini's appointment would have suited those fans who resist the charge towards potential greatness. He is not a great manager. Look at his record before he arrived in England. He's done well but there is no evidence of greatness, and no suggestion of greatness to come. Frank Lampard applauds the travelling fans at Old Trafford as he leaves the pitch with goalkeeper Joe Hart . Louis van Gaal shakes hands with his opposite number Pellegrini after the final whistle at Old Trafford . Jose Mourinho? Ronald Koeman? Sean Dyche? Not even close... Louis van Gaal should be crowned manager of the year . Forget Eden Hazard and Michael Carrick... the best player in the Premier League this weekend was Leicester's Jamie Vardy . And so it has proved. The signings Manchester City have made have also smacked of small-time thinking. They don't go for the great players anymore, they're not in that market. Jesus Navas is the perfect example: he is quick and that's it. He missed a great chance at the start of the Manchester derby because his end product is so poor. He cost a relatively cheap £15million, but at 29 years old (he was signed in 2013), you wonder what the logic was behind this purchase. He's not good enough to be a regular in the starting line-up at a club with ambitions of dominating the Champions League and Barclays Premier League. Why weren't City in the market for Cesc Fabregas? Or Diego Costa? How come they didn't sign Angel di Maria? Financial Fair Play is often used as the excuse – it's holding City back apparently. Look at United, look at Chelsea – be cleverer with the spreadsheets and FFP isn't a problem. Aguero and Jesus Navas prepare for a free-kick at Old Trafford as the latter struggles to inspire the side . Navas is not good enough to be a regular in the starting XI at a club with ambitions of dominating Europe . City opted against going in the market for players such as Cesc Fabregas (left) and Angel di Maria . City's failure to make any kind of serious progress in Europe reflects badly on English football, but the fault is with the club. They need to think bigger and drag themselves towards greatness. Make big signings, they will improve the team, and if they arrive, they will motivate the big players already at City. Yaya Toure strikes me as the kind of player who will raise his game significantly if he had Sami Khedira alongside him, rather than Fernando. The big message out of City this season has been how brilliant and shiny their new academy set-up is. And it is truly spectacular – a world-class facility. But they don't have the team to match it and they absolutely don't have the manager. If they choose to lose Pellegrini, then they need to think big next time and go for a manager showing true potential to be great – like Diego Simeone or Jurgen Klopp. Pellegrini has been accused of punching above his weight at Premier League champions City . Diego Simeone (left) or Jurgen Klopp could be potential replacements for the City manager . Carlo Ancelotti is another that fits the bill if he was to leave current club Real Madrid at the end of the season . Two managers at less fashionable clubs, trying to fight with the big boys in their domestic league and in Europe. Or go for greatness itself – Carlo Ancelotti fits the bill, and so does the man we all expected the hierarchy at City to deliver – Pep Guardiola. When Sheik Mansour arrived at Manchester City he declared that he wanted the club to be winning in Europe. They're still not doing that, and it's about time City went to the next level, for their own good, and for the good of English football. It's like they poked their head out of United's shadow for a few seconds and got burned by the sunshine. Think big City, or forever stay small.","Manchester United 4-2 Manchester City: Click here to read the match report .

"Toni Duggan says free-scoring England will fear nobody at this summer's World Cup finals as they aim to make history by winning their first major tournament. Having recovered from a serious knee injury earlier in the year, the Manchester City striker is working hard to rediscover her best form ahead of the finals in Canada in June. England have never progressed beyond the quarter-finals in their three previous World Cup appearances but Duggan, who has 11 goals in 16 games for her country, is convinced Mark Sampson's team can go further this time. England forward Toni Duggan holds aloft the St George's flag as part of the 'Road to Canada' campaign . Duggan pictured in action for the England team during a match earlier this season . She told Sportsmail: 'We don't fear anyone, we have lots of belief. We've come up against the likes of Germany, the USA and Brazil before and one of our aims is to overcome the mental block we seem to get at the quarter-final stage. 'We play with freedom, we have no fear and we enjoy expressing ourselves. I don't think you've seen the best of England yet and we have so many different goalscorers. We're getting better all the time.' St George's Day allows Duggan the opportunity to reflect on the achievements of her England career so far, with highlights including hat-tricks for the Three Lions against Turkey and Montenegro in qualification for the finals. In all, she found the net on 10 occasions as England coasted through their qualification group with 10 wins from 10 in the perfect start to Sampson's tenure after he replaced Hope Powell following the 2013 European Championships. In the process, England scored a remarkable 52 goals and the task now is to translate that prolific scoring form into the tournament itself. Duggan said: 'It was the perfect qualfying campaign for us, the whole team pulled together and we were able to get 10 wins out of 10. Mark Sampson came in as coach and took everything in his stride. 'It was nice to score 10 goals myself and that included my first hat-trick, against Turkey, which was a nice feeling. Duggan chases for the ball during a Women's Super League match with former club Everton . The 23-year-old gained previous tournament experience with England at the 2013 European Championships . 'We conceded just the one goal, which is obviously almost perfect and I think we showed that we have strength in the squad from No 1 to No 23 and that's what you need at a World Cup.' But just as her thoughts were starting to turn towards the new Women's Super League season and the World Cup in Canada beyond, Duggan suffered the worst injury of her career. The knee problem kept her on the sidelines for eight weeks, required surgery and ruined pre-season plans. It left Duggan needing to prove her form and fitness to the England management team all over again. She said: 'The timing was very unfortunate, coming in a World Cup year. It really killed my confidence and was difficult to deal with because it was the first time. 'I needed major surgery and missed pre-season but I knew it was going to be a big year for both Manchester City and England and it has made me appreicate my time on the pitch a little more. 'I'd like to think I'm good enough to make the World Cup squad but Mark will definitely have a selection headache because it is such a good group. But I will put in the hard work and hopefully will get in.' She made her Three Lions return in the recent friendly with China, playing the last half-hour of a confidence-boosting 2-1 success on her home ground of Manchester City's Academy Stadium. Duggan scored 10 times in a World Cup qualification campaign that saw England with a 100 per cent record . Manchester City are among the favourites for the Women's Super League title this year . June 9 France . June 13 Mexico . June 17 Colombia . Hailing from Liverpool, Duggan started out at Everton Ladies, working her way through the youth ranks and into the senior side during the 2007-08 season. She didn't look back, becoming a first-team regular and earning a first England cap in September 2012 having gained tournament experience at under 19 and under 20 level. Duggan was then signed by City in 2013 as they started out in the Women's Super League. They announced themselves as a force in the game by winning the Continental Cup and are set to challenge for the WSL title this year. Duggan said: 'We won the Continental Cup last season and hopefully we can continue that in the Super League this year. We need to be more consistent over a longer period. 'The title race is going to be a close one but we've made a good start and are positive about our chances. 'We have a winning mentality at City that goes hand-in-hand with England. It's an honour to play for them and we have a fantastic opportunity to go out and win trophies.' On her journey with England, which she hopes will inspire the next generation, Duggan adds: 'It is a dream come true for me to represent my country. 'To be in the first team for England hopefully to be on the verge of a World Cup call-up. As a kid, I didn't even know there was an England team for women so wearing that shirt, whether it's your first cap or your 25th, is amazing.'

"There won’t be many who can guess which Barclays Premier League player picked up my first 10-out-of-10 performance of the season this weekend. Eden Hazard? Well, he was brilliant but no. Mesut Ozil? Haha, dream on. My favourite player, Michael Carrick? No, not even him. Step forward Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy. I’ve seen him plenty of times this season and he’s always worked extremely hard, never been lower than a 7/10. But he added class and quality to that workrate at West Brom on Saturday and I couldn’t fault him. The perfect 10. Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy celebrates scoring their late winner to keep their survival hopes alive . Vardy was being criticised two years ago at Leicester but now is a pivotal part of their team . Jose Mourinho? Ronald Koeman? Sean Dyche? Not even close... Louis van Gaal should be crowned manager of the year . Manuel Pellegrini is punching above his weight at City... the club MUST think big or forever remain small . Two years ago Vardy was being hammered by Leicester fans who thought he was useless. The criticism was so bad the player started to doubt himself and admits he almost gave up football. Credit to Nigel Pearson and his staff – they supported their striker and pulled him through a tough time. A year later he was in the Premier League and picked up the Players’ Player of the Year award at the club after a prolific season. With the top flight came new signings up front for Leicester. Last summer Leonardo Ulloa arrived, and then in January it was Croatia international Andrej Kramaric, the pair setting the Foxes back £17million, and obviously Vardy has had to fight for his place. He’s playing on the left this season and the goals have dried up – he’s only scored three. But he is in the team on merit. At The Hawthorns on Saturday I witnessed a match-winning performance from the most expensive player ever to come from non-League football. Vardy put in a 10-out-of-10 performance at the weekend as he inspired Leicester to an unlikely victory . Credit must go to Nigel Pearson (bottom left) and his staff who supported Vardy through a tough time . It’s Vardy’s hold-up play that wins the free-kick for the first Leicester goal. His pace and persistence that hounded Joleon Lescott into giving him the ball as he drove Leicester forward and helped win the corner for the second goal. And it was his strength that won the ball off Gareth MacAuley on the halfway line - then you can only admire his storming surge towards goal and the quality finish as he rifles the ball into the back of the net for the winner in injury time, embarrassing Lescott again. When Leicester weren’t in possession Vardy was chasing everything. When they had the ball, his movement was good – he took up a great position when Ulloa missed a sitter just before half-time. When Vardy himself was on the ball, he usually had an impact, in spectacular style at the end. I don’t think he’s the best player in the Premier league, I don’t think he’s good enough for England. And who knows if Leicester can survive this season. But what I saw on Saturday was 10 out of 10 from Jamie Vardy. Good on you lad. Vardy is not world class or England material yet but put in a brilliant performance on Saturday for Leicester .","West Brom 2-3 Leicester City: Jamie Vardy's injury-time winner seals it .

"Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Christian Eriksen has warned that they will struggle to attract top players if they miss out on qualifying for next season's Europa League. Spurs are sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which would bring European qualification, but there has been talk in the past that Europe's second-tier competition does them more harm than good. Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying outweigh the negatives, though, and admits that the prospect of Europa League football played a big part when he decided to move to White Hart Lane in 2013. Christian Eriksen has warned Tottenham they will struggle to attract top players if they miss out on Europe . Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying for the much-maligned Europa League outweigh the negatives . The lack of Champions League football - which Spurs have missed out on since the 2010-11 season - is seen as a barrier to signing top-class players for clubs of Tottenham's size, but Eriksen says missing out on the Europa League would have the same effect. 'Is it a factor when the club are trying to sign players? I think so,' Eriksen said. 'It certainly was for me when I moved from Ajax two years ago. 'I always want to play in Europe, to be seen on that stage or in the Premier League. It was a big chance and for me it was a nice thing when I came to Tottenham.' Tottenham have been linked with Marseille midfielder Florian Thauvin and Dynamo Kiev forward Andriy Yarmolenko, and Eriksen worries that Spurs could have to lower their sights if they are not on the European stage next season. Mauricio Pochettino's side currently sit sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which is enough to qualify . Eriksen says the lure of Europa League football was important in his decision to join Spurs back in 2013 . And while he admits that missing out makes finishing higher up the table easier, Eriksen doesn't see many issues with the competition itself. 'I'd rather play in Europe than nothing,' he told the Evening Standard. 'There are many games, of course, but if you have a big squad as we have, it shouldn't be a disappointment to play in Europe. A lot of players want to be in Europe. We've been fighting to get into the top four and we still have a little chance. Florian Thauvin (right), the Marseille midfielder, is one player who has been linked with a move to Spurs . Dynamo Kiev's Andriy  Yarmolenko is thought to be another target for Tottenham in the summer market . 'Of course, it is easier to get into the top four if you are not in Europe. There are so many games and we have played more games than most teams in the Premier League this season.' As it stands, the Premier League's top six will all qualify for Europe but if Arsenal win the FA Cup final against Aston Villa that number would extend to the seventh-placed side. West Ham could also find themselves in the Europa League next season if they qualify via the Fair Play Table.","Tottenham are sitting sixth in the Premier League after a long season .

"Alastair Cook has been working on a new, more open stance with former England batting coach Graham Gooch over the past few months. But in the first Test against the West Indies, I think he overdid it. The picture below shows Cook playing against India at Lord's in 2007 — when he was playing well — with a near perfect stance. His front foot is slightly open but not too far past the line of leg stump. Compare that to the other picture from last week, in which his front foot is far too open. It means that he has a long way to go to get to off stump, and he doesn't have time to adjust to the delivery and set himself. Alastair Cook has been working on a new stance, but he appears to have overdone it against the West Indies . England head coach Peter Moores and Cook stand together during a nets session in Grenada on Monday . Cook prepares to play a shot during a training session at the Grenada National Stadium in St Georges . Cook plays a shot during a training session at the Grenada National Stadium in St Georges on Monday . In this scenario, because his front foot is still landing as the ball is halfway down, he is forced to play the shot with his hands away from his body, which is when you're most likely to nick the ball to the wicketkeeper or slips. He's clearly trying to open up his shoulders — perhaps he felt a bit closed off last summer — but he moved his front foot way too far against the West Indies and when you're out of nick and under pressure, your movements become exaggerated. It's important to note that in the second picture he has already started to move, making his footwork look worse than it is, but also that Cook has never been a brilliant front-foot player. He's at his best when he gets his movements out of the way early, giving him time to move to the pitch of the ball and bend his front knee into the drive. Of course, when you're in form you don't think about these things. But this is the hardest thing to do. Cook's greatest asset is his mental strength, and what he needs to do in matches is give himself 20 minutes to get settled. After a few boundaries it'll all come naturally. Saying that, I saw him in the nets on Sunday and he looked bloody good! So don't write him off yet.

"'You guys ready to play some golf?' asked the starter. And, yes he was. That's exactly what Tiger Woods was ready for. Some golf. He smiled, slapped his playing partner Rory McIlroy on the back. Damn right he was ready. Not to win maybe. Not yet. By the summer, though, who knows? There have been enough sightings of the old Tiger at Augusta this week not to give up on him yet. The problem with new Tiger, though, is that as desperate as he appears to march on, obstacles line his path, like tree roots. In some cases, exactly like tree roots. At the ninth, playing out of the Augusta pines, Woods found such a root at full pelt on his follow through. He dropped his club like a red-hot poker, face creased with pain. Woods claimed that a bone popped out in his right arm, right there, but he reset it. There was a degree of scepticism about the extent of that injury, but either way it continued to bother him for several holes and was rotten luck. There is, however, a well-worn method of avoiding such misfortune. Hit it on the fairway. Woods did not find a solitary preferred landing area until the 13th, when he was rewarded with an eagle. Up to that point, he spent so much time in the trees he should have been fitted with a lumberjack shirt. At the tenth he was in so deep they were thinking of sending Lassie for help. Tiger Woods looks over his second shot on the seventh hole as the Augusta crowd look on . Woods (left) speaks to playing partner Rory McIlroy as the pair wait to tee off on the first tee . Woods reacts in pain after hitting a shot out of the pine straw on the ninth hole . Still, it could have been worse. This was the Masters that Tiger was advised to miss. There were some sage voices out there, saying his old friend would turn on him, that he might be embarrassed by his favourite homeland course. His game was broken, he was broken, it was argued. This was no country for an old man with faltering short irons. Some folk wanted their happy memories preserved. These four days, however, have revealed a healthier reality. Woods didn't come back too soon, he just took his leave too late. Looking at the tournaments he played in January and February, it was plain he didn't want to be there. He should have called time out then. Had he done so, had he started his recovery earlier, who knows where his game would have been by the time he reached Augusta? Were it not for the phenomenon of Jordan Spieth's first 54 holes, he would have been in contention here starting the final day. Woods, like McIlroy, began six under par but with Spieth ten shots ahead, it was idealistic to even contemplate a charge. Woods would have needed a score approaching the course record, and Spieth a collapse – and he is not well-placed for miracles yet. Another major? Well, you wouldn't bet against that one. Woods tees off on the tenth but in the end he did not manage to challenge runaway winner Jordan Spieth . Woods plays out of the bunker by the sixteenth green at Augusta National . It could be argued that the enthusiasm for Tiger's performance this weekend shows how far he has fallen. After all, two of his four rounds – the first and last – were over par, and in the head to head on Sunday McIlroy beat him by seven shots. This was far from tournament winning golf. Then again McIlroy is the world No 1, Woods 110 places below and has barely played this year. He has reshaped his swing which continues to be a work in progress. He would not say when he will play next after this. 'It won't be for a while,' Woods confirmed. 'I like what I'm doing, so I'm going to go back and work on that.' Where this will leave him for the Majors short-term it is hard to say. He finished in the top 20 here, his best return since 2013 and many rated this as the best of several recent comebacks, one that inspired speculation about his readiness for St Andrews in July. He loves the Old Course almost as much as he loves Augusta. It brings the best out of him – and Tiger's best may still be good enough, somewhere, some day. He was blown away here – they all were – by a 21-year-old Texan who has rewritten the record books. By the time Woods and McIlroy stood on the tee at 2.30pm local time, Spieth had spoiled it for just about everyone. Only two men – Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson – were deemed capable of catching him. The world finally saw the two biggest names in golf paired in the final round of a major, only for it to be part of a distant undercard. Maybe that was why Sunday's round fell flat – for Woods, not McIlroy. McIlroy (left) celebrates after sinking a birdie putt on the eighteenth green as Woods looks on . McIlroy (right) taps Woods on the shoulder after the pair shake hands following the end of their round . The Ulsterman finished fourth and shot 66 to equal the best round of the day. Once again, inconsistency cost him dear at Augusta. He was three over par through the first 27 and with Spieth scoring so fiercely the Masters was gone from there. It is Woods's record of 18 under par that Spieth has equalled. In the difficult circumstances that preceded this tournament, Tiger most certainly brought his A game, circa 2015; how was he to know he also required a time machine to make it 1997 again and stay in the mix? What is plain, despite Sunday's disappointment, is that rumours of Tiger's demise were exaggerated. He was diagnosed from afar as having the chipping yips, and there were plenty of amateur physicians declaring his condition at best chronic and at worst incurable. Phil Mickelson, however, offered a second opinion. Speaking at Torrey Pines, where Woods quit after 12 holes to rebuild his short game, he was a rare voice predicting this cautiously positive return. 'I think Tiger's going to have the last laugh,' Mickelson said. 'I think his short game, historically, is one of the best of all time and when you haven't played it's the first thing to feel uncomfortable and the quickest thing to get back. I don't think he's going to have any problems. We have all had stretches where we don't hit it solid and usually it's just a small tweak. It's such a short swing that it's not a hard thing to fix. I don't see that lasting more than a week or two.' Last year's champion Bubba Watson (left) presents winner Spieth with the green jacket at Augusta . Woods reacts after missing a birdie putt on the twelfth hole on Sunday afternoon . Woods hits from the edge of the pine by the tenth hole as the large crowds behind him watch on . It took a little longer than that – with considerably harder graft – but considering some feared we had seen the last of Tiger, this was a tentative return to form. If there was a turning point, it came at the 11th on day one, when he missed the green right and saved par with a quite fabulous chip. Anyone who had the chipping yips, it was said, would still be there now, trying to get up and down. Woods would have known the world was watching his every tic, too. His golf has not been without flaws since, not least his driving, but his short game was a weapon around Augusta, as it once was. There had been a practice round earlier in the week in which Woods was rumoured to have outplayed Spieth down the back nine. There was no sign of that individual superiority over the ensuing four days – 19 shots between them and Spieth leading wire to wire – but this was never about Woods winning at Augusta. This was about him being back in the game, holding his end up, about him looking like he was enjoying golf, and life, and there was certainly evidence of that. He will probably need to work sun up to sun down again, and to win a minor, before he can land a major, but would anyone bet against it given the sight of him walking Augusta on Sunday in the company of the world No 1? Ready to play some golf? One day Tiger may face down Rory and it will matter. And maybe even one day soon.","Tiger Woods finishes tied for seventeenth in the 2015 Masters at Augusta .

"Manchester United fear Daniel Levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in Hugo Lloris. And their worries look set to be realised with Spurs planning to slap a £35million price tag on the keeper to ward of his potential suitors, while the north London club are determined not to sell the Frenchman to a domestic rival. United are considering a move for the France goalkeeper as fears grow over a David de Gea's future, while he is also a long-term target for Paris Saint-Germain. Hugo Lloris has established himself as one of the Premier League's top keepers with some fine displays . Spurs are determined to keep Lloris at White Hart Lane and will put a £35million price tag on his head . But Spurs are determined to keep their No 1 at White Hart Lane and will demand a sky-high price for the keeper. The current world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper is the £32.6million Juventus paid Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001. But Tottenham chairman Levy values Lloris even higher than that fee and won't consider any offers for a penny under £35million. And it is for that reason United, despite their interest, are already showing hesitancy regarding a summer switch. Daniel Levy (right), alongside Spurs owner Joe Lewis, is known to drive a hard bargain . Gianluigi Buffon is the world's most expensive keeper after his £32.6m move from Parma to Juve in 2001 . Levy is known to be one of the toughest negotiators in Europe and will not let Lloris leave on someone else's terms. His reputation for getting maximum value from the club's assets was underlined when Real Madrid paid a world record £85million for Gareth Bale after a summer of hardball tactics from Levy. And the Spurs supremo will take a similar stance in their attempts to keep Lloris, who signed a five-year deal last summer.","Lloris has established himself as one of the Premier League's best keepers .

"Children are known to copy the actions of their parents. And one adorable little girl has mastered a brilliant impression of her pregnant mother. Captured in a 15-second clip, the youngster emulates the way her pregnant mother walks - and the result is hilarious. The 15-month-old girl arches her back and pushes out her belly while strutting around the room . The youngster pulls a cheeky face while her father also mimics the mum's pregnant walk in the background . The clip begins with mum, American Teri O'Neil, 30, asking 15-month-old Olivia: ‘How does mama walk?’ while filming at her home. Suddenly the youngster appears from the side of the shot and with her back bent and tummy pushed forward she struts past. She pulls a cheeky face as she continues around the room – in the background her father can be seen emulating the walk with her. The video concludes with Olivia briefly interacting with the dog, who jumps out of the way, and walking towards the camera with a beaming smile. According to Teri, she recorded the video when she was six months pregnant with her son Liam. The mother of two writes about her children on her blog and has documented everything from their birth stories to the everyday things they get up to. She also uploads numerous videos to her YouTube channel, which shows the youngsters taking their first steps and of course, imitating her.

"A 12-year-old boy has succeeded where many in the media have tried and failed by fearlessly cutting President Obama off mid-ramble during a Q&A session on Thursday. Osman Yaya from Bennett Middle School in Salisbury, Maryland, was moderating a town hall event when the president started getting a little long-winded when answering a question about how to avoid writer's block. As the president started to repeat himself, Osman politely stepped in: 'Yeah. I think you've sort of covered everything about that question,' he said as the audience laughed. Osman Yaya, 12, from Bennett Middle School in Salisbury, Maryland, moderated a town hall session with the president on Thursday . During an answer about writer's block, Obama started getting a little long-winded and Osman stepped in . Obama grinned and replied, 'Osman thinks I've been talking too long.' 'No, I think you just…' Yahya hesitated. 'No. Let's move it along, I got you,' Obama agreed. The president had been talking about the topic for more than three minutes when Yahya politely intervened after shifting nerviously in his seat. Obama was at the Anacostia Library in Washington for a 'virtual field trip' with students to promote White House initiatives to make free e-books available to low-income students and to get cities to provide access to universal library cards. Yaya also managed to skillfully tease details about Obama's early reading habits, his post-presidency plans and his facility with digital media. Middle schoolers at a Washington library and students watching online may have puzzled over Obama's reference to the Hardy Boys, just like Obama appeared stumped by Osman's mention of Alex Rider. 'Yeah. I think you've sort of covered everything about that question,' he said as the audience laughed . Obama grinned and replied, 'Osman thinks I've been talking too long' 'And our first question is from Mrs. Cook's second-grade class at Pinegrove Elementary School in Alabama,' Osman began. 'They asked: ""As a child, did you enjoy reading?"" Well, you said you loved reading, so that question is done. And they also asked: ""If so, what type of books spark your imagination and interest?'"" Obama conceded that the youngsters probably didn't read the Hardy Boys mysteries anymore and said he had been fond of the book Treasure Island. What did Osman read, he asked. Osman described the Alex Rider spy books and their gadgets and offered to lend Obama some books. Then, with a bit of sympathy, he added: 'To make you feel younger, my best friend read Treasure Island.' When Osman asked why it was important to have access to electronic books, Obama, a father of two teenage girls, revealed every parents' knowledge of the digital age. Obama was at the Anacostia Library in Washington for a 'virtual field trip' with students to promote White House initiatives to make free e-books available to low-income students . 'So you're texting all day and you're looking at Vine and Instagram, and you're looking at Grumpy Cat or some video of your favorite singer, rapper,' Obama said. 'What that means is, is that we want to make sure that that becomes a tool not just for entertainment, not just for talking to your friends, but also for learning. ' Asked what inspired him to be president, Obama conceded he had once harbored wishes to be an architect or basketball player but was ultimately inspired by the civil rights movement. As for his post-presidency career, the president seemed to suggest he might just return to his old job as a community organizer. 'I'll still be pretty young,' he said. 'And so I'll go back to doing the kinds of work that I was doing before, just trying to find ways to help people — help young people get educations, and help people get jobs, and try to bring businesses into neighborhoods that don't have enough businesses.'","Osman Yaya, 12, from Bennett Middle School in Salisbury, Maryland,  moderated a town hall session with the president on Thursday .

"A taxi driver channelled his inner Pavarotti and produced an emotionally charged opera performance to the surprise of his customers. The Uber driver was filmed by passengers as he sang along to a radio broadcast while driving in Boston, America. At first the driver lets the radio take command and Pavarotti’s distinctive voice can be heard from within side the cab. At first the driver lets the radio play before he begins singing along to the Pavarotti song in perfect tune . He then begins singing along himself – loudly so that he is audible above the radio and the sounds of the road. While looking around as he drives, the Uber worker continues to sing along to the song both in tune and word perfectly. The song then concludes with the video maker saying: ‘Wow’ and the taxi driver falling silent as the outro music plays. The passenger filming then says: ‘Wow, that was brilliant. Thank you very much.’ He then asks whether the man was singing along to Pavarotti, to which the driver says yes. Reality is then restored as the passenger finishes praising the driver and instructs him to keep going straight. The passengers are amazed as they film the driver who sings along   to the opera song word perfectly . Later, the film maker wrote: ‘We were heading out to meet some friends at a party in South Boston and had a wonderful journey with the Uber Opera Man.’ Luciano Pavarotti was one of the most commercially successful tenors of all time and one of the Three Tenors. Gaining worldwide fame for the tone of his voice, Pavarotti made a number of televised concert performances.

"This is the dramatic moment a brave village watchman fought off a wild leopard armed with only a stick in India. The incident took place in Olani village, four kilometres from Manpur, in central India and was recorded by terrified villagers from the relative safety of hut rooftops. To try and protect his fellow villagers, the fearless ward ran towards the leopard brandishing the weapon. The brave village watchman stands on guard with his stick as the leopard moves towards him . Watched on by a crowd of bystanders, the ward beats the leopard twice on the head as it tries to slash him with its claws . Even though the man sits defenceless on the dusty earth, he continues to fend off the leopard with his stick . After a few terrifying seconds, the leopard - inches away from the man's bare feet - eventually runs off . He managed to strike the big cat on the head twice before it retaliated, dumping the ward to the ground. Astonished bystanders could be heard screaming as the leopard stood at the feet of the seemingly doomed man. Despite being injured on the floor and unable to move, the courageous ward continued to fend off the leopard with his stick and after a few seconds the animal ran off. Mahendra Sharma, a school teacher, said: 'Even the armed forest officials seldom muster courage to fight a beast.' According to local media, the man did not suffer any serious injuries as a result of his death-defying encounter. In last year's Indian elections, rural communities blamed the government for placing them at risk of leopard attacks by failing to provide basic infrastructure such as electrical lighting and street lighting.

"Rita Wilson appears with an ensemble of actresses in a satirical new video promoting gender equality which ironically proclaims: 'It's only fair that men should have it all.' The clip, which was created by the Make it Fair Project, presents a string of statistics that highlight the disproportionate presence that men have in influential industries like Hollywood, which means that, more often than not, males hold 70 to 95 per cent of the industry’s most important positions. 'We won't relent 'til it's 100 per cent,' the women sing in a tongue-in-cheek refrain that repeats throughout the PSA. Scroll down for video . Poor guys: Rita Wilson pretends to be sad that men don't completely dominate film industry in a new gender-equality PSA by the Make it Fair Project . 'In the past three years, only 93 per cent of films were directed by men, and only 80 per cent were written by them,' the actresses, including Meryl Streep’s actress daughter Mamie Gummer, say at the beginning of the video. They go on to note, completely dead-pan, that in 2014, 'only' 88 per cent of box office hits featured a man in the leading role. 'Sadly', they say, 'only' 70 per cent of speaking roles in films are also given to men, and women 'get to be naked' in movies twice as often as men do. The problem exists even on the Broadway stage, they point out, with 13 out of 13 plays last year being written by men. Speaking up: Actress Mamie Gummer (pictured, in a photograph by Nadia Quinn) sings in the video that it's 'only fair that men should have it all', not just 80 or 90 per cent of an industry . Far-reaching issue: Though the actresses highlight gender inequality in Hollywood, they also point out similar problems in government and Fortune 500 companies . Rita, who is known for her roles in Sleepless in Seattle and Runaway Bride, looks distressed as she lists the unfavorable statistics. The video comes just weeks after Rita revealed her battle with cancer and double mastectomy. Now, the actress, who has had devoted husband Tom Hanks by her side, is making more headlines for speaking out about another issue that effects women, this time in the film industry. But while these actresses have a particular interest in Hollywood's status quo, they insist that 'showbiz' isn't the only place where there is startling gender inequality. 'Men make up only 88 per cent of Congress, 80 per cent of governors, 95 per cent of Fortune 500 CEOs, [and] 97 per cent of creative directors in advertising,' they continue. No laughing matter: The cast of actresses sing and clap in an imitation of musical numbers performed during more serious telethons and PSAs . Social savvy: The creators of the project are promoting their message on social media with the hashtag #MakeItFair . Making a point: The YoutTube video was created by an all-female crew to demonstrate the range of talented women available . The women also point out that men continue to hold the top roles in big industries and get paid 30 per cent more than women despite the fact that women make up almost 60 per cent of college graduates. The group wraps up with a rousing telethon-style musical number, singing together: 'We stand here together, and together we'll break down this wall.' These numbers impact everything, the video explains: 'The stories we tell, the wages we earn, the future we shape.' For their part, the creators of the video worked with an all-female team: The PSA is completely written, produced, and starred in my women, a fact that the project says underscores 'the wealth of female talent that often goes untapped'.","The PSA spoof highlights a series of shocking statistics about the number of women working within the movie industry .

"This is the chilling moment a mysterious hairless creature chews its way through a steel cage. The description for the unsettling video - uploaded to YouTube last week by Raymond Yeung – claims it was captured in the Shenzhen Reservoir in China's Sand Bay. The clawed creature - which some say is a rare bear - can be seen aggressively biting through the cage with a visibly bleeding mouth before ripping the metal wire apart with its limbs. The vision has fuelled heated debates around the species of the ambiguous beast, with a string of different accounts coming to light. The dsiturbing video shows a mystery clawed creature  biting through a steel cage with a visibly bleeding mouth . According to the video description, the animal was discovered swimming in Shenzhen Reservoir in China's Sand Bay. It was reportedly fished out of the water by workers from the Department of Drainage, who later captured the animal in a steel cage. The clip has sparked heated debates on Chinese social media site WeiBo, with some users claiming it depicts a 'water monster' from Chinese folklore. Other users alluded to the creature being impacted by pollution, with Shenzhen Reservoir being recently deluged with toxic sewerage that turned parts of the region blood red. Some claimed it was in fact a Malaysian Bear who was suffering from alopecia, a disease which causes baldness. The description for the unsettling video claims it was captured in the Shenzhen Reservoir in China's Sand Bay after local workers found the animal swimming . The video has been the subject of heated online debates over the species of the animal, with some users claiming it is a mythical 'water monster' and others that it's a diseased Malaysian Bear . A similar video surfaced in January of an ailing sun bear in Borneo island in Malaysia, which had been beaten by local plantation workers and driven into the bush. It was reported this month that the animal was discovered at another nearby plantation, where it is being nursed back to health. David Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia the caged animal 'looks like a bear cub which is suffering from some medical condition which has caused it to loose all of its fur.' While he was unable to confirm if it was the same bear from the Borneo clip, he said he suspects it is and that the footage originates from Borneo not China. A heavily-polluted field in Shenzhen Reservoir, where the mystery beats was apparently captured, has fuelled accusations the animal may have been contaminated . Internet users have also claimed the animal in the clip is a Malaysian sun bear (pictured) which is suffering from alopecia, a disease which causes baldness .","The disturbing video was uploaded last week by Raymond Yeung .

"Organic milk could contain a third less iodine than normal milk, scientists claim - but the organic milk industry has issued a swift rebuttal (file picture) Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers who drink organic milk may be putting their child’s health at risk, scientists claim. They say it contains a third less iodine than normal milk – which could affect infant brain growth and intelligence later in life. UHT longlife milk was also found to have similarly low levels of the mineral, academics from Reading University found. Because milk is the main source of iodine in the British diet – providing 40 per cent of the average daily intake – switching to organic may have a significant impact on health, they warn. The organic milk industry last night issued a swift rebuttal. Organic milk is often drunk for its supposed health benefits, with claims that it contains omega-3 fatty acids that are good for the heart. And in response to environmental and animal welfare concerns, the sector is growing. One in every 20 pints of milk bought is now organic and more than 300 million pints were sold in the UK last year, worth £160million. But researchers said that because organic farmers do not give their cows as many artificial supplements the milk lacks iodine, which is important for the healthy development of babies in the womb and in their first months of life. The mineral is thought to have a major impact on the formation of the brain, with repercussions for IQ and school success later in life. Study author Professor Ian Givens said the findings could have ‘serious implications for public health’. He stressed that organic milk was not ‘bad’ for health, and said Britons could get the same amount of iodine as in a pint of normal milk by drinking an extra half-pint of the organic variety. But he warned that without careful monitoring, the country risks ‘sleepwalking’ into a new health crisis in the 21st century. Iodine deficiency was once endemic in parts of the UK, with thousands in the 1930s and 1940s suffering from the thyroid condition goitre. The latest findings, published in the journal Food Chemistry, were based on skimmed, semi-skimmed and full-fat milk purchased at four unnamed supermarkets. But the organic milk industry last night said the research – conducted in January last year – was out of date. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers who drink organic milk may be putting their child’s health at risk due to the smaller amount of iodine in the product. Iodine is essential for brain growth . OMSCo, which provides two-thirds of Britain’s organic milk, said procedures had been changed over the past 18 months to ensure more iodine is fed to dairy herds. Peter Melchett, of the Soil Association, also dismissed the findings, saying organic milk had ‘scientifically proven’ health benefits. Research in 2013 by experts in Bristol and Surrey found that children born to women deficient in iodine have a 60 per cent risk of lower IQ scores at the age of nine. Professor Jean Golding, one of the authors of that study, last night welcomed the new findings, saying: ‘Milk is a major source of iodine, but it is important to know which sort of milk is most appropriate.’","Milk is main source of iodine in British diet, providing 40% of daily intake .
