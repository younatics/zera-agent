"The first farmers came to Europe 8,000 years ago and spread early agricultural practices, starting in Greece. But Northern Europeans during the Neolithic period, initially rejected the practice of farming, which was spreading throughout the rest of the continent, researchers claim. Their findings show a bump in the road in the adoption of farming, which enabled groups of people to move away from foraging and hunting as a means for survival and sparked a ‘major economic revolution’. Experts from Centre for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences (CIRHUS) in New York City studied neolithic ornaments (pictured) to understand how farming spread. These beads are examples of personal ornaments worn by the first European farming societies . ‘This discovery goes beyond farming,’ said Solange Rigaud, the study's lead author and a researcher at the Centre for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences (CIRHUS) in New York City. ‘It also reveals two different cultural trajectories that took place in Europe thousands of years ago, with southern and central regions advancing in many ways and northern regions maintaining their traditions’. To come to their conclusion, the researchers looked at the adoption or rejection of ornamental beads or bracelets worn by different populations in the Early Neolithic period, which stretched from 8,000 to 5,000 BC. Based on discoveries of different types of Neolithic ornaments in different parts of Europe, they concluded that Northern Europeans in the Neolithic period initially rejected the practice of farming, which was otherwise spreading throughout the continent. Examples of ornaments worn by European foraging societies are shown . Scientists recently discovered that stone-age hunter gatherers in England were trading with continental wheat farmers 8,000 years ago - long before agriculture came to Britain. Farming is thought to have arrived in Britain around 6,000 years ago so experts think that local hunter gatherers bought wheat by trading with European farmers from as far away as the south of France or the Balkans. This means that even 8,000 years ago there must have been trade routes winding their way across the European continent to Britain across an ancient land bridge. The scientists say that the discovery shows that Britain was no-where near as isolated or insular as had been originally thought. They say the findings may also force a complete rethink about how agriculture first arrived in Britain. Dr Robin Allaby, a plant geneticist at the University of Warwick who led the research, said: 'Eight thousand years ago the people of mainland Britain were leading a hunter-gatherer existence, whilst at the same time in southern Europeans farming was gradually spreading across Europe. Previous studies have shown a link between the embrace of survival methods and the adoption of particular ornaments, so by looking at the ornaments, the experts were able to understand the spread of farming practices for the first time. They examined some 200 bead-type objects found at more than 400 European sites over a 3,000-year period, tracing the adoption of ornaments linked to farming populations in order to explain the patterns of transition from foraging and hunting to farming. They found that the pathways of the spread of farming over 3,000 years, are less clear than previously thought. They found ornaments linked to farmers, such as human-shaped beads and bracelets composed of perforated shells, from eastern Greece and the Black Sea to France’s Brittany region and from the Mediterranean Sea northward to Spain. But the researchers did not find these types of ornaments in the Baltic region of northern Europe, according to the study, published in the journal Plos One. This area held on to decorative wear typically used by hunting and foraging populations, such as perforated shells rather than beads or bracelets found in farming communities. Dr Rigaud explained: ‘It's clear hunters and foragers in the Baltic area resisted the adoption of ornaments worn by farmers during this period. ‘We've therefore concluded that this cultural boundary reflected a block in the advancement of farming - at least during the Neolithic period.’ Their findings show a bump in the road of the adoption of farming, which enabled groups of people to move away from foraging and hunting as a means for survival and sparked a ‘major economic revolution’.

"While many tattoos hold a certain symbolism to their bearer, the design chosen by someone getting their first ink at the age of 80 must have an incredibly special meaning. ABC2's new show, Tattoo Tales, follows the journey of some of the customers of Bondi Ink, a busy tattoo parlour on Sydney's Eastern beaches, including Jan Bearman, who was prompted by the death of her beloved daughter to make a decision that took the rest of her family and friends by surprise. 'Before I lost my darling Shell I wouldn't have dreamed of having a tattoo. But when something like that happens you're left grasping at straws. There's a hole left in your life and all you can do is say your prayers,' Jan told Daily Mail Australia. For the past three years, Jan Bearman has had a new tattoo inked on her shoulder every birthday in memory of her daughter Shell, who died of complications from diabetes in . Jan's daughter Shelley died in 2011 at the age of 56 of complications from her diabetes . 'There were reminders of her all around me, and I decided to get a reminder of her on me,' Jan, now 83, said. When Shelley, who was fondly nicknamed Shell, died in 2011 at the age of 56 from complications of the diabetes she had lived with for nearly all her life, two of Jan's granddaughters and Shell's husband decided to get tattoos in memory of her. 'And then I just couldn't think of a reason to not get one,' Jan said. 'Shell was just such a gorgeous girl. It's a loss that leaves a hole in your heart that's never filled again. You do these things as a memorial, to carry [her] with you,' she said. Jan said that when she announced her decision to her family, they were quite surprised but supportive the unexpected move from the now 83-year-old. 'I think they were a bit surprised but they didn't say ""don't do it"", they said ""go ahead if it will make you feel better"",' she said. 'I tried to con my other daughter into getting one too but she wasn't having any of it.' Soon after the decision had been made, Jan was spending the day with one of Shell's daughters, when they passed Bondi Ink. 'Shell was just such a gorgeous girl,' said Jan (left) of her eldest daughter, with her other daughter Lisa (right) Jan getting her third tattoo, a shell, by tattoo artist Shaun 'Bones' from Bondi Ink . Jan said that her tattoos are a memorial and a way for her to carry her children with her . 'She popped in and asked if they had a spare moment to chat about getting a tattoo. They asked her ""oh, are you thinking of getting one"", and she said ""no, it's for my grandmother"",' Jan said. 'The man at the counter said ""that's gold"", and it went from there,' she said. For her 80th birthday, Jan had Shell's name inked on her upper arm near her shoulder, along with a cross, and said that she was surprised at how painless it was. 'I was surprised to be honest. I don't know if I'm a bit tough, but it certainly wasn't unbearable,' Jan said. 'There are parts of the body that are easier, and one of those is the arm, which is where I got mine,' she said. The now-83-year-old wasn't done with just the one tattoo, and continued coming back to the studio each year for another tattoo to commemorate her daughter, tattooing the initials of her three children above the cross on her second run. In the second episode of Tattoo Tales, Jan gets her third tattoo- a beautiful coloured shell below her daughter's name. 'Nobody sees it but me, it's just my family who knows and the friends I've mentioned it to,' Jan said. Jan got a shell as her third tattoo, in memory of her daughter Shelley, who was nicknamed Shell . 'I don't know if I'm a bit tough, but [the pain] certainly wasn't unbearable,' Jan said of her experience in the chair . Jan with her daughter and granddaughters at one of their 'girls lunches' in Sydney . 'Shell didn't have any tattoos but I'd like to think she'd have a smile to herself if she saw them on me,' she said. Jan said that she used to not be a fan of tattoos, but that now she doesn't assume that people are different simply because they are inked. 'I'd be a hypocrite if I did. I don't hold anything different against them, although I do worry when I see young girls with tattoos all over them that they'll go through life and get older and be sorry they got so many,' she said. Jan is unsure whether she will continue to go back for more tattoos on her birthday as has become the tradition. The owner of Bondi Ink, John, said that this year's tattoo was his 'birthday present' to Jan, and insisted she come back for her gift next year. 'He always gives me a big hug, and says ""see you next year"",' she said. Jan said that the restaurant where she has her birthday lunch each year is right across the road from Bondi Ink, which may prove tempting. 'I think I've done my dash. The birthday lunch get-togethers are always so nice though, so maybe I will get another one later,' she said. Jan features in episode two of Tattoo Tales which airs on ABC2 on Wednesday April 9 at 9.40pm.

"An artist with a penchant for snapping urban architecture has come up with an innovative new way of making the most of his photography. French photographer and illustrator, Thomas Lamadieu, takes snaps of the sky in courtyards and built-up areas to create a frame of buildings. The space in between then acts as a canvas for his playful illustrations which he has dubbed 'sky art'. On his website Thomas says that his artistic aim is to 'show a different perception of urban architecture and the everyday environment around us, what we can construct with a boundless imagination'. Before and after: Lamadieu's original  shot (left) and after it is transformed into 'sky art' (right) Lamadieu, who is also known as Roots Art, is based in France but travels the world to photograph the space between buildings in various cities. In the past year alone he has visited Belgium, Germany, Canada, the United States and South Korea in his quest to find the perfect sky canvases for his illustrations. Since he began creating sky art in 2011,  Lamadieu has made a name for himself among critics, art lovers and journalists all around the world. Speaking to the Independent, Lamadieu said: 'The sky drawings series really started with as a way of playing with my imagination to show how these seemingly empty spaces in the urban environment could be reinterpreted in different and creative ways.' 'The bearded man in my images stands for the sky itself, the big man in the sky, but it’s not meant to be religious in any way'. Surreal: Three characters draw their own illustrations in an inverted sky shot . Upside down: A bearded figure rides a cat in between the buildings . Peace out: An illustration of a man playing an electric guitar fills the sky space in this photograph . Cheshire cat: A drawing of a couple embracing behind a grinning cat fills the gap where the sky would have originally been . Using a fish-eye lens camera to capture the perfect vertical shot, Thomas Lamadieu then illustrates the graphic shape created between buildings using Microsoft Paint. These abstract canvases depict a collection of humorous characters and surreal scenes. One inverted upshot depicts three bearded men drawing a picture of the night sky; meanwhile another shows a woman with hair not dissimilar to that of Marge Simpson reclining between two buildings. Self portrait? A man spray painting clouds on a canvas fills the skyscape in this photograph taken in a courtyard . Twit twoo: A black and white illustration of an owl looks down upon this oval shaped void . Thumbs up: An image of a man holding a Polaroid of a smiling cloud is superimposed onto a shot of town houses . A signature Lamadieu figure appears to be a bearded man in a Breton striped top who features in various guises throughout the 'sky art' images. In one picture he appears as a giant rock star wielding an electric guitar, and in another he has a camera around his neck whilst presenting a Polaroid of a cloud. As well as surrealism, optical illusion is also a key theme in Lamadieu's work - these confusing images combining photography with clever illustration are certainly hard to get your head around. Jack in the box: An illustration of a masked man holding a Jack in the box toy overlooks this snap between two brick buildings and a washing line . Optical illusion: This sky shot has been transformed into a clever optical illusion thanks to Lamadieu's illustration . One image that plays a trick on the eye is a vertical sky photograph combined with a horizontal illustration of a game of cat and mouse to mind-boggling affect. Similarly, an image of a bearded man in a striped top holding some cloud shaped balloons creates a trompe l'oeil that the facade of the building is a pavement with illustrated figures superimposed on it. Meanwhile, the sky becomes the sea in another illustrated image of a man on a boat surrounded by circling sharks. Trompe l'oeil: It's difficult to tell which way is up thanks to this clever and confusing illustration . Sea-ing double: The distorted angle of this photo combined with sea illustration make it a mind-bending photo to look at .

"The blood of hundreds of baby seals has stained the pristine white snow of Canada's ice floes as the world's largest annual marine mammal slaughter begins. Horrifying images taken only yesterday show seals being shot and wounded before they are dragged onto a vessel - where they clubbed to death for their fur. Photographs of this year's commercial hunt off the coast of Newfoundland were captured by animal rights charity Humane Society International (HSI) who say the baby animals 'are dying a violent death for fur products that nobody is buying'. Horrific: Humane Society International has captured shocking images of seals being clubbed to death on Canada's ice floes (pictured) as this year's 'commercial hunt' gets underway . Cruel: Images show the animals - who are eventually skinned for their fur - being shot and wounded on the thin ice before being dragged (pictured) onto vessels . Chilling: The seals who do not die from the gunshot wounds are dragged onto ships (pictured) where they are clubbed to death . Gruesome: The baby animals (pictured) are suffering a violent death 'for fur products nobody wants' according to Humane Society International . Inhumane: Some seals die from the gunshot wounds (top) while others escape into the water where they slowly die from their injuries (bottom) Blood-stained: Once the animals are shot, sealers retrieve the bodies by impaling them with a sharpened hook (pictured) which forces the seals that are still alive to violently thrash out . Cruel: The images HSI took from a helicopter above Newfoundland's ice floes show sealers (pictured) pulling the seal's blood-stained carcasses onto their ship . The disturbing images show the animals thrashing in pain as they are pulled across the blood-stained snow while others are seen impaled on the boat's deck. HSI's executive director Rebecca Aldworth said: 'This is the 17th year that I have witnessed the seal slaughter. The suffering I have seen is impossible to forget. If the killing happened in view of the public, it would have been shut down decades ago. But it occurs far offshore. 'We saw one baby seal clearly raise her head from the massive pool of blood she lay in. Another was shot and thrashed on the ice only to slip into the blood-slicked water. 'It is reprehensible that these baby seals are being killed with government financing, even as the largest seal processor in Canada admits to warehousing a stockpile of seal fur.' The Newfoundland government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 harp, hooded and grey seals, according to HSI. They claim the seals - many of which are just a few weeks old - are shot, clubbed and skinned for their fur despite a decreasing global demand for them. Killing: Even Sir Paul McCartney who visited a seal nursery with HSI in 2006 has made an emotional plea for Canada to stop the seal hunt (pictured) Unforgiving: The animals are slaughtered in a remote region off the coast of Newfoundland (pictured) - HSI says if the killing happened in view of the public 'it would have been shut down decades ago' Brutal: Veterinary experts claim the seals are killed inhumanely in the commercial hunt (pictured) because of the harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which they are killed . Barbaric: HSI's executive director says 'it is reprehensible that these baby seals (pictured) are being killed with government financing' Demand: The country's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase the fur from seals who are killed and skinned (pictured) during commercial hunts . Innocent: Government reports found 98 percent of the seals (pictured) killed in the Canadian commercial seal slaughter are less than three months of age, according to HSI . The demand for seal products diminished greatly after the European Union, United States, Switzerland, Mexico, Taiwan and the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Armenia banned the trade of some or all products of commercial seal hunts. With China also blocking attempts to import seal meat into the country, the price of seal products from Canada declined rapidly and convinced many 'sealers' to abandon the act. Sir Paul McCartney who visited a seal nursery with HSI in 2006 has made an emotional plea for Canada to stop the seal hunt. The former Beatle said: 'Canada's brutal commercial seal hunt has begun, and once again thousands of baby seals will be shot and bludgeoned to make fur products that nobody wants or needs. 'Videos of the bloody seal slaughter provide the only vital evidence to demonstrate year after year that these seals are dying a horrible death for their fur.' In recent years, Newfoundland's government has reportedly dished out £6million in subsidies to seal processing plants to 'prop up the dying industry' - and announced a further £1.3million earlier this month. 'It is a double tragedy,' according to HSI spokesperson Wendy Higgins who told MailOnline: 'They [seals] are suffering for frivolous fur products and Canada can't even sell the fur because more and more countries around the world are boycotting sales because of the horrendous cruelty.' 'We want the Canadian government to offer a buy-out to the sealers and put and end to this senseless slaughter. 'The hunt is legal but that doesn't mean that the killing is always done according to what few guidelines govern the industry and HSI has frequently documented breaches. 'Even if they did always kill the seals according to the rules, it's still a dreadfully brutal process... This hunt is taking place many hundreds of miles out with absolutely no-one there to monitor what they're doing.' Immoral: Even though the hunt (pictured) is legal in Canada, animal rights campaigners say it's still a dreadfully brutal process . Shocking: The Newfoundland government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 seals (pictured) this year, despite declining global demand for their fur . Hunted: The boss of a company who accepted government funds to continue purchasing sealskin said 'it's probably not a really good time to get in this industry' Death: As many as half-a-million seals (pictured) will be hunted and killed in this year's cull . Only this week the country's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase seal fur, citing a lack of demand and a warehouse full of it. Carino Processing Ltd also refused over £600,000 in financing from the Newfoundland government. But a new company PhocaLux International is accepting government funds and has stated it will purchase around 30,000 seal furs, according to CBC. The firm's Chief Executive told the news channel 'the markets aren't really great around the world... it's probably not a really good time to get in this industry.' Government reports confirmed that 98 percent of the seals killed in the Canadian commercial seal slaughter are pups less than three months of age, according to HSI. Veterinary experts have stated that Canada's commercial seal hunt is inherently inhumane because of the remote, harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which the killing is conducted for commercial and safety reasons.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A 19-year-old Minnesota teen has been charged with fatally stabbing a 34-year-old father-of-five after an argument on the Wisconsin side of the St Croix River.about swearing took a deadly turn. Peter Kelly, who leaves behind a wife in addition to five children under the age of nine, was killed on Tuesday night when he was stabbed in the chest after he and a friend argued with three teens. One of the teenagers, Levi Acre-Kendall, was charged with one count of first-degree reckless homicide on Friday by the Polk County attorney's office. Scroll down for video . Peter Kelly was fatally stabbed on Tuesday night at the St Croix River after an argument with three teenagers . Levi Acre-Kendall, 19, was charged with one count of first-degree reckless homicide on Friday . Kelly and his wife Christie, pictured, have four sons and a daughter all under the age of nine. He was just 34 . The suspect, who was held on $125,000 bail, is now facing a maximum sentence of 60 years of combined prison and extended supervision. During the alleged incident, Kelly and Ross Lechman were fishing on the Minnesota side of the St Croix River when they heard three teens being loud and rude on the Wisconsin side. They asked them to quiet down and heated words were exchanged for the next three hours. The suspect's mother, Lavonne Acre, said of her son: 'Levi's a good kid. He was just fishing' Kelly and Lechman eventually drover over to Interstate Park and confronted the three teenagers. There are differing accounts about what happened, but Lechman told investigators Acre-Kendall showed a knife during the argument, the Pioneer Press reported. He later reportedly said: 'Yes, yes, I stabbed him.' Lechman called 911 after the stabbing and Kelly was taken to St Croix Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Acre-Kendall's mother, Lavonne Acre, turned a knife and clothes her son was wearing on Tuesday over to police, the Star Tribune reported. She said: 'All I can tell you is that it would have never happened if it weren't for those two older men coming to the boys, because the boys were just fishing. 'Levi's a good kid. He was just fishing.' There is still uncertainty about stabbing and the argument that caused it. Polk County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Steve Moe said: 'I think it's just something that we're still aggressively working on, is all.' Acre-Kendall is now facing a maximum sentence of 60 years of combined prison and extended supervision . Now the small community in St Croix Falls, which has just 2,100 people, is mourning the loss of Kelly, who volunteered as a coach at the high school's football, baseball and wrestling teams. He would often go to work at 4am so he could get back in time to coach before dinner, fellow high school coach Dan Clark said. His day job was at Andersen Windows in Bayport, where he worked in quality control. 'He worked 10 to 12 hours a day at Andersen Windows, and he would come home and volunteer four hours a night to our wrestling program for four or five months a year,' Clark told Fox9. 'He was one of the greatest human beings that I ever hoped to meet.' His wife, Christie, stays at home to care for their children. They have four boys, Kellen, Payton, Miles and August, and last year welcomed a baby girl, Molly. Kelly and Ross Lechman were fishing on the Minnesota side of the St Croix River when the argument began . 'I don't think they fully understand the implications of what happened,' his brother, Mike Kelly, told KARE. 'His daughter will never even get to know him.' Friends and family added that they do not believe Kelly was to blame for the confrontation. 'He did good things, and did what was right all the time,' his brother added. 'And that's probably what cost him. Some knuckleheads swearing and being silly.' Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 715-485-8300. A GoFundMe page has also been set up for the family.

"It's been just a few days since Andy Murray tied the knot to his long term girlfriend Kim Sears. But already his mother Judy is hopefully that he will soon take the next step and start a family. The 55-year-old tennis coach told Closer magazine this week: 'I'm really looking forward to being a granny. I've always wanted to have grandchildren, but I had to be patient and let them get married first.' Scroll down for video . Andy Murray's mother Judy has revealed that she can't wait for her son to have children with his new wife Kim Sears . Judy went on to reveal that she wasn't sure when her 27-year-old son would have children but she knows that he wants them. She said that she will take an active part in their lives and that she can't wait to teach them about tennis. Judy also said that following her stint on Strictly Come Dancing last year she taught her tennis champion son some basic dance moves. 'I showed Andy part of the basic steps for the waltz, as he was going to be best man at his friend's wedding. So before his own wedding he already knew some steps and was confident about taking to the dance floor.' Andy and Kim married this weekend at a service in Dunblane Cathedral, with the bride wearing a Jenny Packham dress . The ceremony was followed by a reception at Cromlix House, Murray's luxury hotel near Dunblane . In a later interview on the BBC's One Show Judy spoke about the wedding itself. She said that it was a prouder moment than when Andy won Wimbledon in 2013: 'Yeah, I think so. I mean it was just such a happy family occasion. 'It was the perfect day from start to finish even despite the hailstones and the snowstorms that we had during the course of the morning. It was lovely, just lovely.' Judy continued: 'It really was a perfect day. It was a very, very happy day and I think everybody was very relaxed and very chilled. 'They've been together for a long time so to see them getting married with all their friends and family around them, and in Dunblane, for me that was very, very special to be able to share it with the people in Dunblane who give so much love and support all the time for him. 'They made such a huge effort and so many of them turn out in not great weather and were there for hours.' Andy and Kim married at Dunblane Cathedral with a service led by the Rev Colin Renwick. The British tennis number one sported a blue and green kilt for the occasion while Sussex-born Sears, 27, wore an embroidered Jenny Packham gown with three-quarter-length sleeves and a long veil. Among the guests were Murray's brother Jamie, divorced parents Judy and William, grandparents Shirley and Roy Erskine and former British tennis number one Tim Henman and his wife Lucy. The ceremony was followed by a reception at Cromlix House, Murray's luxury hotel near Dunblane. Judy attended the wedding wearing a smart white dress coat with taupe coloured heels . In a note written to staff at the hotel Kim said: 'Thank you to Graeme and every single one of you at Cromlix who worked so hard to make this weekend the best of our lives – a special place filled with very special people! X' Andy and Kim met at the US Open in 2005 when they were both aged 17, and became engaged in November. They are believed to have asked guests to make a donation to charities rather than buy wedding presents. Before the big day Andy revealed that he was not nervous about the wedding, but he is nervous about having children. He told BBC Sport: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. 'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. 'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.'","Judy Murray has revealed to Closer that she can't wait to be a granny .

"Andrew Hennells, pictured, posted a message on Facebook admitting his plans to rob a Tesco supermarket 15 minutes before holding up staff . A man who boasted about plans for an armed robbery on Facebook minutes before he threatened staff in Tesco has been jailed for four years. Andrew Hennells posted details of his plan to the social networking site - stating he was 'Doing. Tesco. Over' at 7.25pm on February 13. A quarter of an hour later, Norfolk Police were alerted by a member of the public to a man brandishing a knife demanding cash from staff working at the supermarket giant's King's Lynn branch. Hennells fled the scene before police arrived, but he was quickly arrested in a nearby pub with £410 in stolen cash. Norfolk Crown Court heard that officers also recovered a knife. Last month, the 31-year-old, of Gaywood, King's Lynn,admitted robbery and carrying a knife as an offence. Sentencing him to four years in prison for armed robbery today, judge Anthony Bate said Hennells posed a 'high risk of serious harm to the public'. The court heard how armed police were deployed after the alarm was raised. Hennells had escaped after stealing a car belonging to a retired couple who had stopped to use a cashpoint. But officers tracked him down in a nearby pub, finding him carrying a knife and £410 in stolen cash. Another count of robbery relating to the car-jacking was left to lie on file, Norfolk Police said. Outside court, Sgt Pete Jessop, from King's Lynn CID, said that the Facebook confession made it easier to prove the case. Hennells posted this message only 15 minutes before threatening staff at Tesco's in King's Lynn . A member of the public alerted police to a man threatening a member of staff in the store (pictured) Hennells, 31, was then found by police in a nearby pub, with £410 in cash on his person . Speaking after the first hearing, Sgt Jessop had said: 'We have not got to the bottom of why he posted the pictures and words on Facebook, or why he did the job in the first place. 'It was bizarre and an unusual set of circumstances. 'While the message and pictures on Facebook did not solve the case, it did confirm what we already knew. Hennells held up staff at the Tesco store in King's Lynn, pictured on Friday, February 13 . 'But the thing that made it easier and quicker for us to solve the case was the assistance from the public. 'However, the quickness does not take away from its seriousness or how traumatic it was for the victims of the robbery.' Hennells made a series of other posts to Facebook in the hours before the robbery, including a picture of a large knife, and sharing a Bare Knuckles Gypsies' 'The hardest man in Ireland' video.","Andrew Hennells threatened staff in Tesco with a knife of February 13 .

Sensors and roof-mounted radar are used to map the environment nearby for self-driving mode, and you can even turn on the car with your eyes, thanks to its iris recognition start. The car is self-driving, electric, and the front chairs can swivel round (shown). And using iris recognition software you can start it using only your eyes . The car was unveiled at the Shanghai General Motors Gala Night this week (shown) Chevrolet said the car offered a ‘glimpse at mobility of the future' The ‘aim was to create a unique, intelligent vehicle for tomorrow’s younger consumers by utilizing innovative car networking technology,’ said the company . While in self-driving mode, the front seats of the vehicle swivel 180 degrees to face the rear seats, so the driver can talk to their passengers. Using a gesture control feature, though, the driver can switch to manual control mode whenever they want. Chevrolet notes that the car is just a concept, so there is no release date or planned production date yet. ‘The FNR concept reaffirms Chevrolet’s commitment to offer electric vehicles that meet customer’s lifestyles and are within their reach,’ said Alan Batey, head of global Chevrolet. At the event Chevrolet also unveiled a new car in its Malibu range, the Bolt EV Concept vehicle and the 2015 Captiva. Self-driving cars may be a way to take your eyes off the road and relax a little, but they can also increase travel sickness, research has found. The research was carried out by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. They asked more than 3,200 adults across the US, India, China, Japan, Great Britain and Australia what kinds of activities they would do instead of driving in a fully self-driving vehicle. More than a third of Americans said they would do things that increase the likelihood and severity of motion sickness, including reading, texting, watching movies or television, playing games or working. More than half of Indians, 40 per cent of Chinese and up to 30 per cent of adults in Japan, Great Britain and Australia said they would also engage in these kinds of activities. The figures suggest that once autonomous vehicles become more mainstream as many as 12 per cent of people will feel ill in the vehicles at some point during a journey. The car also has magnetic hubless electric wheel motors and a wireless autocharging system . Sensors and roof-mounted radar are used to map the environment nearby while in self-driving mode .

"A beach-side apartment complex in the Hamptons has been obliterated by flames. Smoked poured over Westhampton Beach on Wednesday at 3pm as a fire spread through 90 condos before the building eventually collapsed. It is not known what started the blaze, which was so intense it melted the paint off nearby buildings. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ravaged: Ninety condos on the beach in Westhampton were obliterated by flames on Wednesday afternoon . Intense: Smoke poured toward the ocean and could be seen from three miles away as 12 fire crews tried to control the flames . Before: This is what the pristine complex looked like before the fire. It is used as a holiday home by residents between May and November . Twelve fire teams were deployed in a bid to control the flames but could not get inside any of the summer homes. Nobody was hurt. Janice Sklarek, who owns one of the apartments in the Sandpiper complex which is open between May and November, told NBC: 'We saw the big black smoke coming off the ocean and couldn't get down here fast enough. 'Flames were coming out of every window. 'This is something that you think happen to other people, but when it happens to yourself, it's just unbelievable.' 'Lost everything': The building manager who lived and worked in the Sandpiper complex was distraught watching the fire . Best efforts: Firefighters used cranes to approach the fire which was so strong they couldn't get inside the building . Intense: Residents said the fire, whic is being investigated, was so intense it melted the paint off buildings nearby . Her partner, building manager Rob Taber who lived and worked in the building, said he has lost everything. A witness, Dave Rose, told ABC 7: 'You could see flames from about three miles away and you still saw all the flames going up.' Westhampton fire chief Ross Donneson told NBC: 'Luckily the wind was offshore, so we had good visibility of the front of the structure and we set up our apparatus to combat the fire.' He told ABC 7 they are investigating claims the fire started near a car parked by the complex.","The 90-condo holiday home building in Westhampton collapsed at around 3pm on Wednesday .

"Do you have white spots on your nails or bleeding gums? Pimples on your arms or a dodgy stomach? These are in fact signs your body is under stress, a nutritionist has warned. Charlotte Watts argues that stress drain nutrients from the body, meaning it shows up in some surprising ways. These seven symptoms are an indicator you are stressed, warns nutritionist Charlotte Watts. Below, she recommends the best foods to get rid of each one . Writing for the Healthista website, she said: 'Periods of stress use up nutrients more quickly. 'This is because our whole system - including energy, brain responses, hormones and immunity - is working at a higher and faster rate.' As a result, some symptoms associated with vitamin or mineral deficiencies can also be a warning sign of the deeper, long-term effects of chronic stress. Here, in an extract from her new book - The De-Stress Effect: Rebalance Your Body’s Systems for Vibrant Health and Happiness - she reveals seven surprising signs of stress and what to eat to replenish lost nutrients... CRACKS AT THE SIDE OF THE MOUTH . What’s causing it? Need for vitamin B6 . Those unpleasant little sore fissures we can get at the corners of the lips are a sure sign that B vitamin status is low and particularly B6. B vitamins are important for the health of the nervous system and are needed to get energy from the carbohydrates, fats and proteins that we eat, so we use them up during the energy-rich stress response. Cracks at the side of the mouth are a sign the body is low on vitamin B6 . Important for the nervous system, B6 is involved in the production of the neurotransmitters (brain chemicals) serotonin and dopamine that regulate mood and motivation and also melatonin, that governs sleep, so we also see these suffer when stress is prolonged. We have a higher need for B6 with during contraceptive/HRT and antidepressant medication use. Food sources: carrots, chicken, eggs, fish, meat, peas, spinach, sunflower seeds, walnuts, avocados, bananas, beans, broccoli, brown rice, whole grains, cabbage, corn and potatoes . JAW GRINDING . What’s causing it? Need for vitamin B5 . Another B vitamin, B5 is often referred to as the anti-stress vitamin, as it helps with the production of adrenal hormones, cholesterol and immune antibodies, all of which have a higher turnover during the stress response. Note here that this cholesterol production is not all ‘bad’, we need it to produce new cells and the steroid hormones like cortisol and DHEA that are part of the stress response. Long-term stress often shows up as jaw clamping and teeth grinding, partly as tensing muscles around the face increases brain alertness, which the body senses it needs to deal with danger, but it is also associated with lowered levels of B5. This vitamin is also needed for production of the memory neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which also calms us down after stress has past. Lowered levels mean difficulty self-soothing after stress has passed and the memory issues we see with chronic stress. Taking B vitamins together in supplement form (eg. in a B complex or a multivitamin) is advised as they all work together for energy production and nervous system health. Food sources: beef, eggs, fresh vegetables, kidney, legumes, liver, mushrooms, nuts, saltwater fish, whole rye flour . Sunflower seeds are a good source of zinc. Zinc is easily used up by stress, and a stressful period can often be charted from where white spots grow on the fingernails . WHITE SPOTS ON NAILS . What’s causing it? Need for zinc . Although white spots on the nails are often assumed to be a calcium deficiency, it is actually another mineral loss they are indicating. The mineral zinc is very important for many of the enzyme systems in the body, for immunity and for the production of hormones, including insulin and sex hormones. It is the most abundantly used mineral in the body and allows energy production, but also all healing and replication (like fertility and sexual health) rely on good levels. Alternating constipation and diarrhoea is a sign of a magnesium deficiency . It is easily used up by stress and we can often chart a stressful period from where white spots appear grown from the nail bed. Zinc in plant foods is less bioavailable that in animal foods because it binds to phytate (a fibre) that makes it difficult to absorb, so vegetarians may want to consider a supplement of about 15-20mg a day. Food sources: fish, meat, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, pine nuts, nuts, oysters and other shellfish, crab, rye flour, cheddar cheese . ALTERNATING CONSTIPATION AND DIARRHOEA . What’s causing it? Need for magnesium . Magnesium is an essential mineral with about 70 per cent in the bones and the remaining 30 per cent in the soft tissues and body fluids. We use up massive amounts in the stress response and when we eat sugar. Our ability to calm muscles and brain after stress rely on this ‘calming mineral’ and you can see a vicious cycle can be set up when stress depletes it and our coping capacity is diminished. Low levels are associated with classic stress-related symptoms like anxiety, irritability, insomnia, depression and muscle pains. As the muscles of the digestive tract also rely on magnesium for calming and we feel stress keenly in the enteric nervous system in the gut, low levels often manifest there as difficulty regulated digestive muscle function and we can tend to constipation (seizure) or diarrhoea (spasm). Often these can alternate as the body struggles to find ‘normal’. Plenty of food sources and perhaps a supplement of 300-500mg magnesium citrate a day may help. Food sources: buckwheat, nuts, soybeans, dark green vegetables, carrots, peas, sweet potato, sunflower and sesame seeds, lentils, avocado, cauliflower, fish, meat . BLEEDING GUMS . What’s causing it? Need for vitamin C . Vitamin C is an antioxidant and needed for at least 300 metabolic functions in the body. It aids in the production of anti-stress hormones, interferon (immune-system protein) and is needed for the production of collagen, from which we make all body tissues. This is why the classic vitamin C full-on deficiency, scurvy involves haemorrhaging – body tissues are unable to be replenished and break down. Citrus fruits are a rich source of vitamin C. If the body is deficient in this nutrient some people suffer bleeding gums and bruise easily . A very mild form of this can be seen in easy bruising and bleeding gums when brushing teeth, signs we are probably using up vitamin C very quickly in the stress response. Other signs of deficiency include susceptibility to infection/colds and difficulty recovering from illness. It is depleted by smoking, alcohol, analgesics, oral contraceptives, steroids and with antidepressant use. Food sources: berries, citrus fruits, green vegetables, asparagus, avocados, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cantaloupe, kale, mangos, onions, papayas, green peas, pineapple, radishes, spinach, strawberries, tomatoes and watercresss . HARD PIMPLES AT THE TOP OF ARMS AND THIGHS . Hard spots at the top of the thighs and arms reveal a vitamin E deficiency . What’s causing it? Need for vitamin E . Follicular keratosis is also associated with lowered vitamin A levels, as it is also a fat-soluble antioxidant and works with vitamin E. Another nutrient that can contribute to easy bruising, Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that protects fatty body areas and is needed for fertility – the meaning of the Greek word tocopherol, its chemical name. Low levels of vitamin E and also omega oils can be seen as hardened, raised pimples at the tops of arms and legs that show abnormal skin growth called follicular keratosis, where too much of the skin protein keratin builds up. Vitamin E may also help with improved circulation, the promotion of normal blood clotting, scarring, blood pressure and enhanced sperm production. Food sources: cold-pressed vegetable oils, dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, brown rice, eggs, kelp, milk, oatmeal, organ meats, soybeans, sweet potatoes and watercress . FREQUENT THROAT AND CHEST INFECTIONS . What’s causing it? Need for vitamin A . Vitamin A is essential for night vision (yes, carrots can help you see in the dark!) and the health and resiliency against infection of the outer skin and the mucous membranes that line the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. Stress can cause people have trouble shifting colds and they commonly move to the chest and throat. Increasing vitamin A - found in fish liver oils can help replenish the body . When you have trouble shifting colds and they commonly move to the chest and throat, increasing levels through plenty of greens and (if you eat) high-quality organic meat can help, in a stew helps deliver the nutrients efficiently and hydrate tissues at the same time. Sufficient supply of zinc is needed to mobilise and release stores of vitamin A. Food sources: animal livers, fish liver oils and green, red, orange and yellow fruits and vegetables. Foods that contain significant amounts include apricots, asparagus, broccoli, cantaloupe, carrots, papayas, peaches, pumpkin, red peppers, spinach, watercress and yellow squash .

"A former soldier has been reunited with his long-lost son after 25 years - after he spotted his Facebook page appealing for help finding his father. The post by Lewis Helget, 27, appeared on Darren Goddard's timeline when he logged into the social networking site with the intention of deleting his account. A quarter of a century earlier, the 48-year-old had made the heartbreaking decision to leave behind his 18-month-old son, who he thought he would never see again. Finally reunited: Darren Goddard (right) finally met his son Lewis Helget, 27, last month after 25 years apart . Mr Goddard 'cried himself to sleep' when he parted ways with Lewis in 1989 after his marriage broke down following a horrific car accident. Just six years earlier, he had moved to Germany to pursue a career in the Army and met Lewis' mother Aggi, who he married two years later. Following his return to the UK from Germany, where he had been based as a soldier, he endured a 'real struggle' to move on with his life. He eventually came to terms with the fact he would never see his son again. Around three years ago, Mr Goddard's daughter Cally, 15, created a Facebook page for him. The former soldier never used the account and was about to delete it when Lewis' appeal turned up on his newsfeed. Happy ending: Former soldier Mr Goddard says his life is now 'complete' after seeing his 27-year-old son . Mr Goddard, of Basingstoke, Hants, said: 'Cally set me up with a Facebook account but I had no clue how to use it. 'I opened up my Facebook to shut it down and get rid of it and then Lewis was there and it said he had been looking for his father for four years. 'When I left the Army and came over here, I cried myself to sleep for two years. I knew his mum was a good mother and had lots of family so I was happy in the knowledge of that. 'But it still took me two years to get over the fact I was never going to see him again.' Lewis, who lives in Emsdetten in north west Germany, was finally reunited with his father in March. Mr Goddard made the first contact and the pair now speak to each other every day via Skype. They met at Stansted Airport last month as Lewis flew to the UK from Germany to attend his grandfather Ron's funeral - a man he never met. They spent a week together before Lewis returned to Germany on March 25 - and Mr Goddard says his life is now 'complete'. Troubled past: Mr Goddard's marriage to Lewis' mother ended after he was involved in a serious car accident which ended his career as a solider and led to him getting depression and leaving Germany . Describing how his marriage to Lewis' mother ended, the father-of-two spoke of the terrible injuries he suffered in a car accident. Following a year of agony, he was taken to a hospital near his Army base in Munster, Germany, to have an operation to remove a smashed disk in his back in 1988. It soon became clear he would not be able to carry out his Army duties and his career came to an abrupt end. Mr Goddard then began suffering from depression - which led to the breakdown of his marriage to Aggi. He added: 'Lewis has always been in my heart and I have never stopped thinking about him. 'When we met you wouldn't believe we have spent any time apart and we had our arms around each other and hugged. 'It has been so lovely and we have had the most fantastic week. He is a lovely man and is quite a bit like me.' Lewis said: 'It was very important for me to know my dad so that is why I came to England to meet him.'","Darren Goddard met first wife Aggi while based in Germany with the Army .

"Diane Priestley was struggling to breathe and was starting to turn blue. She died of an aneurysm . An ambulance service has apologised to the family of a woman who died after errors by emergency call operators meant she was not classed as having a life-threatening condition. David Priestley called 999 three times and had to wait an hour for an ambulance to reach his wife Diane, who was struggling to breathe and whose tongue and lips had turned blue. An investigation has found that an ambulance should have been given a response priority of eight minutes to reach the 57-year-old at her home in Shildon, County Durham. Instead, a longer 30 minute response time was assigned - which North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) still failed to meet - and the grandmother-of-nine died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm on arrival at Darlington Memorial Hospital. In a letter to Mr Priestley, NEAS admitted: 'The delay in an ambulance arriving was initially due to the call handler error which resulted in an incorrect priority. 'However, as already acknowledged, we failed to attend within the timescale for the case priority that was in place. 'This was as a result of high demand on that day for emergency responses, compounded by a lack of resources to meet that demand.' Mr Priestley, 59, said he remains tormented by the thought his wife might have survived had paramedics reached her sooner on the afternoon of Saturday, September 30, last year. He described his wife of 40 years as his best friend. He added: 'It's like they say don't get bad on a weekend, as you won't get the proper treatment. 'She was my life. We did everything together.' Following the investigation into Mrs Priestley's death, NEAS found errors were made by the emergency operators during the first two 999 calls at 1.21pm and 1.47pm. David Priestley, 59, said he remains tormented by the thought his wife might have survived had paramedics reached her sooner. North East Ambulance Service admitted delay was initially due to the call-handler error . Grandmother-of-nine Mrs Priestley died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm on arrival at Darlington Memorial Hospital (pictured). Mr Priestley described his wife of 40 years as his best friend . In a letter to Mr Priestley, the North East Ambulance NHS Foundation Trust said the first operator failed to enter details about his wife's deathly colour into the system - meaning a 30 minute response priority was activated rather than eight minutes. During the next call, the second operator failed to check further about Mrs Priestley's temperature and it was not until the third 999 call at 2.13pm that an ambulance crew was assigned - eventually arriving at 2.33pm. The trust apologised and said the call handlers had received coaching on the issues identified. Mr Priestley said he felt the apology was insincere and believes the call handlers should have been dismissed. A spokesman for NEAS said: 'We would like to offer our condolences to Mr Priestley and his family, and our sincere apology for the errors made by the ambulance service.' She said a thorough investigation had been carried out and the case had been reported to the NHS commissioners as a serious incident. She added: 'Any actions resulting from a full investigation are at the discretion of NEAS and, in this case, we believe we have taken appropriate action. 'We are sorry to hear that Mr Priestley is unhappy with the outcome of the investigation. If he would like to contact his family liaison officer or our Patient Experience Team, we would be happy to go through his concerns with him.'","David Priestley called 999 three times and waited an hour for ambulance .

"A teenager suffering from cystic fibrosis is battling to be allowed to take part in her high school graduation after school officials told her she couldn't. Victoria McKennon is just one class short of fulfilling the necessary requirements to graduate from Plano Senior High School in Texas. The 17-year-old has had to miss dozens of lessons for frequent hospital visits as she struggles with her life-threatening condition. Scroll down for video . Cystic fibrosis sufferer Victoria McKennon is desperate to take part in the graduation ceremony at Plano Senior High School in Texas but is one class short of the credits she needs . Despite that she is only just short of being able to officially graduate and her family appealed to the school to allow her to take part in ceremony at the Dallas Convention Center in June. The plan was that she would finish the outstanding work necessary to graduate in the summer and earn her diploma that way. But officials initially refused to allow Victoria to join her friends at the prestigious event, which draws a crowd of hundreds to see students proudly don their graduation caps and gowns in the school's maroon colours. Plano High instead told her she could participate in a small summer ceremony, according to the Dallas Morning News, yet she is desperate to take part in the real thing. The school has since set out a way in which Victoria could make up the missing credit and graduate in time for the main summer ceremony. But her mum Grace McKennon said this won't work if her daughter has an unforeseen hospital stay and wants a guarantee from the school she will be able to take to the stage in June no matter what. She told WTHR: 'I don't know how long Victoria is going to live. Of course, we always aim for the moon, the sky, and the stars, but in reality her life span is limited and so every experience is very important for her,' Victoria and her mum Grace McKennon (right) say they do not want her to be awarded credits she didn't get, but allowances made to accommodate her disability . The 17-year-old has to manage a complicated programme of medicines to fight her condition, which has often resulted in hospital stays causing her to miss class . Officials acting on behalf of Plano Senior High School (pictured) have refused Victoria's plea to be allowed to take part in the graduation ceremony in June if she hasn't got the right number of credits . The family say they are not asking the school for Victoria to be awarded credits she didn't get, but to accommodate her disability and allow her to take part in the ceremony with her friends. Victoria says she wants to be seen as a 'normal kid' which is why taking part in graduation is so important to her. The family has filed a civil rights complaint with the Department of Education over the dispute, under a law which aims to protect disabled people from discrimination. Lesley Range-Stanton, speaking for the Plano Independent School District, said all its schools follow Texas board of education policy, which state that a student must 'meet all state and local graduation requirements, including all applicable state testing,' in order to be allowed to graduate. Victoria was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis 10 years ago. The condition has no cure and greatly affects the lungs and digestive system. Her father Larry McKennon said it had been 'heartbreaking' watching her grow up fighting the disease.","Victoria McKennon, 17, is student at Plano Senior High School in Texas .

"With superfans already eagerly camped out at St. Mary's Hospital ahead of Kate Middleton's due date, it seems that the birth of Prince George in 2013 did nothing to diminish the undeniable global fascination surrounding royal babies. And it's not just Brits that are starting to make excited estimations, the frenzy has reached America where there are more than a few guesses about royal baby particulars. International research firm, YouGov, has conducted a poll asking the UK and the US their opinions on the second child, and it turns out, views are not too different. Scroll down for video . William and Kate are currently prepping for the birth of the second royal baby, which has spurred guesses on the sex and name . Questioning 1713 Brits and 1124 Americans, the survey revealed that after the excitement of a baby boy in blue in 2013, this time around, both desire a baby girl. In fact, this landslide opinion was only contested by two per cent of Brits and seven per cent of Americans, who alternatively want Prince George to have a baby brother. When it comes down to a name for William and Kate's potential little girl, the survey revealed discrepancies between what Brits and Americans want. In the UK, Charlotte, Alice and Alexandra are the leading names, with Charlotte scooping the lead with 13 per cent. Americans instead favour distinctively prominent royal names, with the top three being Diana at 19 per cent, and Elizabeth and Victoria tying at 12 per cent in terms of popularity. The 2013 birth of Prince George did nothing to diminish the undeniable global fascination surrounding royal babies, with many having placed bets on the sex and name of the second child . Princess Diana was the much-celebrated first wife of Prince Charles, and also the mother of Prince William, before passing away in 1997. The popularity of the name Elizabeth is most likely derived from the name of the current queen, Elizabeth II. Similarly, the popularity of the name Victoria, is from Queen Victoria, whose reign of nearly 64 years is the longest of any other British monarch. When it comes down the names for a potential baby boy, the survey revealed much more unified results. Both Brits and Americans agree on James, Richard and Arthur as their favourite top three boy names, with James scooping the lead, at 27 per cent in the UK and 15 per cent in the US, in terms of popularity. Americans have picked Diana and Elizabeth as their favourite names if the royal baby is in fact a girl. The popularity of these names could have stemmed from prominent names of other royals, including the late Princess Diana (pictured left) and Queen Elizabeth II (pictured right) And it's not only immediate particulars about the unborn baby's life being discussed; people were also keen to throw in their two cents about the most suitable roles for the child's later life. Both were in agreement that in the future, baby number two should focus on acting as a good role model for young people. Opinions divided when it came to the second most important role.While Brits believe the second child of William and Kate should also prioritise having a job, Americans feel that the next priority should be raising money for charity. Although American are showing some interest in the new royal baby, the majority of the US are far less interested in the latest arrival, in comparison to Prince George's birth in 2013. A poll by YouGov revealed that both Brits and Americans want royal baby number two to be a girl (picture posed by model) According to a new survey by the University Of Southern California, American are five times less interested in the new royal baby than they were with George. Jeetendr Sehdev, professor of marketing at USC, told the Sunday Times:  'They were three times more interested in the birth of Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake's baby and equally excited by the [forthcoming] birth of Sophie Hunter and Benedict Cumberbatch's child. 'Only one in 10 Americans describe themselves as excited about the second royal baby. Some of this is inevitable but it also represents a wider attitudinal shift across the US. 'Americans still love Great Britain ... but the royals are now part of that, not the face of it.'","A new poll has asked Brits and Americans questions about the royal baby .

Pietro Boselli, 26, originally from Brescia, Italy, says that he originally tried to keep his modelling a secret from his colleagues at the University College London (UCL) where he taught for fear they might 'look down on him'. In an interview with the Times, Boselli, an advanced maths lecturer with a PHD, said that when he was trying to establish himself as a teacher, he didn't want to include his work for fashion companies such as Abercrombie and Fitch on his CV and was less than proud of his alternative career. Scroll down for video . Not your average teacher: Wearing a tiny pair of green shorts, 26-year-old advanced maths teacher Pietro Boselli admits he tried to keep his double life as a model a secret from colleagues and students at UCL . The Italian model, whose looks have seen him amass a following of nearly half a million users on Instagram, isn't afraid to whip off his shirt to show his hard-earned muscles, pictured above with 'lifelong friend' Carmelo . More than just a pretty face: The lecturer has now achieved his PHD and is hoping to earn enough money from modelling to set up his own engineering consultancy . He told the newspaper he didn't want students in his classroom or his teaching peers to know, saying: 'I think, in a way, I was ashamed. I thought people in academia would look down on me.' Growing up in Italy, the young Boselli was scouted by Armani Junior which started off a double life of studying hard for his exams and posing in front of the lens whenever he could. He calls himself a 'nerd' and says that his studies were his priority growing up, forcing him to turn down lucrative jobs that would take him away from his books. His students at UCL, where he taught while studying for his PHD, did eventually discover the fitness fanatic's secret, after Googling him. When one maths student, Arief Azli, discovered his 6ft 1in lecturer's Instagram account, which has now amassed more than 480,000 followers, and has plenty of images of him in varying states of undress, he tweeted: 'That moment when you realise your maths lecturer is a top designer model.' Azil posted a picture of his lecturer scribbling equations on the whiteboard next to one of him shirtless with the caption: 'Only at UCL‬ ‪#‎MechanicalEngineers‬ ‪#‎ModellingandAnalysis ‪#‎Bromance‬.' Other students soon followed suit and posted pictures of him taking classes, with one saying: 'This is why I never miss a class'. Boselli says he knew his students had cottoned on when they started to take 'sneaky' images of him while he was at the front of the lecture hall. Cycling in the sea? He must be clever! Pietro says he trains once or twice a day to keep fit and is proud to show of his amazing body . A gruelling exercise regime keeps the model in tip-top condition: Pietro posted this image of a recent rock-climbing expedition on his Instagram account . Huge following: Pietro, pictured centre right with friends on a recent trip to Brooklyn, has now finished his stint as an advanced maths teacher at UCL (right) to concentrate on being a full-time model . Now the secret's out, the model, who has signed for top agency Models 1, says he's not worried about them seeing him posing topless. 'People ask me ""why are you topless in pictures? Why don’t you have any clothes on?"" But training is a big part of my life. 'I started going to the gym when I moved to London and, like everything I do, I’m very focused. I train once or twice a day and I’m happy to get recognition for having a good physique.' Boselli has a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and is hoping that the money he earns from modelling will help him to establish his own engineering company in London. And the bad news for all those currently brushing up on their algebra? He's got a girlfriend. Although the model won't be drawn on her identity and there is little sign of her on his Instagram account, he has confirmed that he is off the market. The fashion model posted this picture on his Instagram account with a caption 'post-workout selfie' He describes himself as 'addicted to training' and said he works out at least two or three times a day . One of his students, Arief Azli tweeted: 'That moment when you realise your maths lecturer is a top designer model' Pietro's academic achievements are easily as impressive as his six-pack. He was awarded the Undergraduate Faculty Excellence Scholarship for the most outstanding academic achievement in his first year at UCL, before going on to get first-class honours. The fashion model was discovered at the age of six by renowned designer Giorgio Armani who saw potential and said he should be a model. His Instagram account gives an insight into his fitness regime as he posted a picture of himself in the pool, saying: 'Boosts circulation, gets metabolism up to speed and strengthens immune system!' Mr Boselli revealed he works out two to three times a day and said his best feature is his 'perseverance and inconsistency'. In an interview with F Tape he said he would be concentrating on 'engineering, teaching maths and personal training' if he was not modelling. He posted a picture of his washboard abs on his Instagram, saying: 'Lying in bed.. My point of view' Mr Boselli revealed he works out two to three times a day and said his best feature is his 'perseverance and inconsistency' He also revealed that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oscar Wilde and The Rolling Stones were among his idols. Hundreds of fans have taken to social media to say they would have concentrated slightly harder in lessons if Mr Boselli had been their teacher. Rachel Ruane said: 'Would trade my maths teacher for him in a heartbeat oh my god #PietroBoselli #teachmealgebraanyday.' Cassy Chavez said: 'I would never miss a class too!' Aly Dos Equis said: 'Good thing this guy wasn't my math teacher I'd have a hard time paying attention.' Pieter Botha ‏said: 'No fair! I never had a math teacher like you? I would've passed.' He won first prize in the tall fitness model category at the WBFF European pro-am fashion event .

"A group of Nevada sex workers have come out in favor of Democratic contender Hillary Clinton for president. The group, calling themselves Hookers For Hillary, all work at Dennis Hof's infamous Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Carson City. The legal brothel, which was the subject of HBO's Cathouse series, has drafted a four-point platform explaining their endorsement. Scroll down for video . A group of Nevada sex workers, Hookers For Hillary, have come out in favor of the Democratic contender for president . According to their website, they’re supporting the former secretary of state because of her work on health care reform, foreign relation experience, tax reform and responsible government oversight on public health issues. 'Hillary Clinton, as part of her husband's administration, envisioned health care reform in the 1990's, long before President Obama was able to sign it into law,' they write. 'The Affordable Health Care Act made health insurance available for the first time ever to the 500 independent contractors employed by Dennis Hof. With any Republican nominee likely to work for its' repeal, the Bunnies want to protect the quality health coverage that they now enjoy.' 'As Secretary Of State, Hillary Clinton gained invaluable experience negotiating with foreign leaders, and the Bunnies can definitely relate to negotiating through a language barrier,' they state. The group cite Clinton's work on health care reform, foreign experience, tax reform and responsible government oversight on public health issues as reasons to vote for her . The hookers all work at Dennis Hof's Moonlite Bunny Ranch, a legal brothel in Carson City . 'The Bunny Ranch entertains customers from all around the globe, and the girls have great respect for any woman who can take powerful men from oppressive cultures and make them bend to her will.' 'Bill Clinton presided over the most prosperous time in Bunny Ranch history, which coincided with a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans such as brothel owner Dennis Hof,' the Bunny Ranch writes. 'The Bunnies recognize that thriving economies are built from the bottom up, where the vast majority of their clients originate. 'A return to relying on the disproven theory of trickle-down economics would only serve to exclude the vast majority of hard-working Bunny Ranch clients from having the discretionary income to enjoy with their favorite Bunny.' Citing Nevada's mandatory testing of legal prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases, the Bunny Ranch also applauded Mrs. Clinton for recognizing 'the fact that responsible government oversight is a key to protecting the public's health from widespread disease.'","A group of Nevada sex workers, Hookers For Hillary, have come out in favor of the Democratic contender for president .

"Kim Jong-un learned to drive when he was just three years old and won a yacht race at the tender age of nine. At least that's according to a new school textbook that takes the meaning of the phrase 're-writing history' to a whole new level. The bizarre claims are being taught to pupils across North Korea as a way of indoctrinating future generations into glorifying their dictator in much the same way that his father, the late Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, were blindly heralded in days gone by. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the manual contains now mention of the country's history, instead devoting its chapters to minor – and questionable – details about Kim Jong-un's childhood. Like a duck to water... apparently: A new North Korean school textbook claims that dictator Kim Jong-un (pictured, above, on a boat with military chiefs) learned to drive aged three and won a yacht race aged nine . The book, called Kim Jong Un's Revolutionary Activities, has been distributed to middle and high schools for study during the 2015 school year, it was reported by the UPI news agency. Subjects include Kim's incredible ability to drive a year as a toddler and his remarkable sailing prowess before he'd even reached double figures. 'At the age of ine, Kim Jong-un raced the chief executive of a foreign yacht company, who was visiting North Korea,' the text reads, adding that Kim won the race despite the odds. South Korea's TV Chosun reported that the text also claimed Kim can draw well and knows how to compose music. Lee Seok-young, the South Korean director of Radio Free Chosun, said it remains to be seen just how teachers would credibly impart this wisdom to the schools. Cementing a false image: The bizarre claims are being taught to pupils across North Korea as a way of indoctrinating future generations into glorifying their dictator in much the same way that his father, the late Kim Jong Il (left), and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, were blindly heralded in days gone by . The hermit state fights a constant PR war in its bid to portray a fanciful image of wealth and prosperity to its persecuted people. One example came recently when it became embroiled in an escalating international row over Kim's lurid depiction in Hollywood film The Interview. The United States claims that the film's presentation of Kim – whose family has ruled the reclusive, impoverished state for more than six decades – prompted Pyongyang to launch a massive cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, the studio that made it. Meanwhile, images emerged today of Kim Jong-un apparently showing that he has hurt his wrist. The 32-year-old was inspecting a weapons factory in the country's capital of Pyongyang in a visit filmed by North Korean Central TV. The footage shows the mysterious dictator waving and smiling to the crowds, with his right-hand wrist wrapped up in a white bandage. Pictures from state-controlled media show the dictator smiling and waving, with his right wrist in bandages .","Pupils are taught manual called Kim Jong-un's Revolutionary Activities .

"Master patissier Eric Lanlard is on-stage recalling how he once refused to bake a 'very rude' cake for Naomi Campbell. 'Her PA said: ""But it's for Naomi!"" I told her that I didn't care if it was for the Queen,' says Eric. Learning from the master: Tamara shows off the cooking skills she has picked up from Eric Lanlard . As it happens, when HM toured the cruise ship Britannia after the naming ceremony last month, one of the areas she was most impressed with was Eric's atrium-based Market Café, where the centrepiece is a beautiful, mouth-watering display: dainty, neon-hued raspberry macaroons, Eton Mess served with popping candy and chocolate salted caramel mille-feuilles. Atul Kochhar and Mary Berry are some of the other foodies Britannia's owners, P&O, have enlisted. At a dinner hosted by Eric in the Cookery Club, I watch my canard à l'orange being prepared on a screen while Eric reels off anecdotes about baking one-ton cakes for sheikhs and having his bottom pinched by Mary Berry. Then I sign up for a cookery lesson with him in the Cookery Club, where wall-mounted screens are connected to cameras positioned over Eric's workspace, allowing us to follow his every move. I whip up a chocolate soufflé, although sadly, I later drop it face-down on the floor of my cabin. The 3,600-passenger, Union Jack-adorned Britannia is the largest ship built for the UK market. My shore excursions on a dash around the Mediterranean include a coach tour through Corsica's snowy mountains above Ajaccio, where we sample wild boar meat. All aboard: With a 3600 capacity, Britannia is the biggest cruise ship built for the British market . In Cartagena in Spain, guide Pedro teaches us about traditional Spanish cuisine on a wine and tapas tour, then shows us around the city's Roman theatre. Britannia basks in its Britishness. In Brodie's, the pub, there are beers from 56 UK counties and in the library an entire shelf is dedicated to the British monarchy. A handful of guests bemoan the lack of a wrap-around prom deck (to walk off some of those calories) but the intimate Limelight Club, where you dine to a soundtrack of performances by singers such as Kiki Dee, and the Oasis spa, with its hydrotherapy centre and fruit-scented showers, are hugely popular. I love the wood-panelled Crow's Nest, with its sumptuous armchairs and tinkling piano music. Put through her paces: Tamara's gourmet tuition continues as Britannia sails the Mediterranean . Passengers can sample gins from 20 British counties. When sugar cravings strike, I head for the quirky afternoon teas in Epicurean. Dinners there are just as much fun - my palette cleanser is a lipstick-shaped sorbet which the elderly passenger next to me mistakes for actual make-up. The entertainment is as varied as the cuisine: I cringe at the jokes by mononymous comedian Tucker, whose opener mocks his 'half-Taliban' neighbour, but love Dickie Arbiter's talk about life as the Queen's press secretary. The final stop is the Spanish port of Cadiz, where boats spouting water fountains accompany our arrival. That evening, I join my fellow passengers for a glass of something fizzy. The band strikes up. The tune? Rule Britannia, naturally.

"British officers were forced to accept the four-day inspection from the experts from Moscow despite heightened tensions with Vladimir Putin . Russian military inspectors have arrived at a huge Nato war games exercise off the coast of Scotland, it emerged yesterday. British officers were forced to accept the four-day inspection from the experts from Moscow under a European arms control treaty despite heightened tensions with Vladimir Putin. They are attending Exercise Joint Warrior, designed to send a signal to the President in the face of continuing aggression. Britain and 11 other Nato countries are set to contribute to the naval exercise, which was hailed by the Government as one of the largest land, air, and sea training exercises run in Europe. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the exercise, involving 58 warships and submarines, 50 aircraft and 3,000 land forces would show the world how ‘powerful’ Nato was. But last night it emerged that despite tensions with Mr Putin, Britain was still obliged to allow military inspectors into the country. The visit began on Monday at Lossiemouth and involves experts from the Russian National Nuclear Threat Reduction Centre, international officials said. Russian state media said the team from the centre, part of the counry’s defence ministry, would conduct ‘a series of checks’ at the exercise. Britain has not inspected Russian since 2010, however Russia is still obliged to accept inspections twice a year from other countries. Under the terms of the Vienna Document 2011 agreement, nations are permitted to conduct a limited number of inspections on the territories of other signatory states. The UK regularly conducts similar inspections on other nations’ territories. Sergey Ryzhkov, head of the centre, said: ‘During the event, the inspectors will visit ranges and plan to hold command briefings on the conducted military activities.’ It is the first time Russian inspectors have attended Nato manoeuvres since relations between Moscow and the alliance plummeted after the annexation of Crimea. Nato has withdrawn all cooperation from Russia in protest at its aggression in Ukraine and stepped up exercises to try to reassure eastern allies who feel threatened by the Kremlin. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (pictured) said the exercise, involving 58 warships and submarines, 50 aircraft and 3,000 land forces would show the world how ‘powerful’ Nato was . David Cameron reiterated Mr Fallon’s comments last month that the exercise would ‘send a clear message to those who threaten us’ that the UK and alliance could protect themselves. Members are still bound by several arms control and cooperation treaties though. The Russian team will be escorted at all times and will only be given unclassified information, the MoD in London said. Defence sources said it was ‘routine’ and Russian officers had last made similar official visits last year. An MOD spokesman said: ‘This routine inspection, which forms part of our obligations under the Vienna Document 2011, will have no impact on Joint Warrior. The inspection party will not have access to any sensitive information and will be accompanied throughout.'","British officers forced to accept four-day inspection from Moscow experts .

"A Michelin-starred restaurant burned its first batch of asparagus  after the drone flying it in crashed live on TV. Ronald Peijenburg, owner of the De Zwann restaurant in Etten-Leur, has previously used  a Formula 1 racing car, hot air balloon and a helicopter to deliver the first crop of the seasonal vegetable. But the drone, which had a metal can attached containing several asparagus stalks, crashed and exploded  mid-journey in the Netherlands. Scroll down to video . Crash and burn: The asparagus-delivering drone crashed part-way through its journey to the Dutch restaurant . Special delivery: The first batch of asparagus of the season was placed in a can and attached to a drone . 'You think you have a cool idea with a drone – how original can you be? Picking up asparagus with a drone,' Mr Peijenburg told Netherlands regional broadcaster Omroep Brabant. 'This is very, very sad because it was an amateur pilot, the owner of the drone, who organised this especially for me and brings his own toys. So this wasn't supposed to happen of course.' The pilot had followed the remote-controlled craft in the back of a pick-up truck while the stunt was filmed by a local TV channel. The Dutch restaurant had to settle for a more traditional method of delivery following the crash. Personal drones have surged in popularity with Amazon alone selling 10,000 of them every month. However, learning to fly a drone — flying devices that often carry cameras and can be navigated remotely by smartphones or controllers — is something that requires some time and patience say experts. In flight: The drone carrying asparagus tips was flying them to a Michelin-star restaurant in the Netherlands . Up in smoke: The drone operator looks on as the machine crashed into a field as it went to make an asparagus delivery to a top Dutch restaurant . A TGI Friday restaurant in New York launched mistletoe drone to tempt diners into kissing which backfired when a photographer, who was invited to cover the event, was struck in the face by the four-bladed machine. In February, a restaurant chain in Singapore announced that it will start using drones as waiters operating from the kitchen and bar to the dining areas.","Owner had used Formula 1 car and hot air balloon to deliver in the past .

"The Arkansas judge who posted private details of Charlize Theron's adoption of her son has been forced to hand in his law licence because of a bribery conviction in a separate case. By surrendering his licence, circuit Judge Michael Maggio has avoided a disciplinary hearing over the conviction, for which he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced in July. Maggio, 52, sparked controversy last March when he admitted posting a series of comments that were racist, sexist and offensive towards the LGBT community over the past several years. Charlize Theron pictured with Jackson, the boy she adopted from her native South Africa. Michael Maggio revealed the Hollywood actress had adopted two months before she announced it publically . Theron with her partner Sean Penn. Maggio initially pretended a friend had been the judge who oversaw the star's adoption hearing . Using the under the pseudonym 'geauxjudge', Maggio made the comments on the on a Louisiana State University fan message board. His comments in January 2012 divulged details of Theron's adoption - two months before she publicly released the information. On the message board, Maggio said a 'judge friend' had handled  Theron's adoption, before admitting that he was also involved in the case. When a poster asked if she had adopted a black child, he said that she had. Such proceedings are confidential in Arkansas. Theron adopted the boy, Jackson, from her native South Africa. In a June 2011 posting, 'geauxjudge' suggested that women who seek divorces after their husbands cheat may be better off financially by staying married. 'I see it everyday,' he wrote. 'A woman makes (an) emotional decision to divorce because the husband stepped out. When otherwise he was a good provider, father, and husband. 'Then a year or two later realizes uh oh I am worse off financially, emotionally and relationship wise but hey they showed that SOB. Too many times the women get their advice from other divorced women.' In another, Maggio, who has three sons and two daughters from a previous relationship and lives with his partner, Dawn, made derogatory comments about women, saying they needed to take care of a man's two basic needs for sex and food, adding: 'It takes two to pull the wagon'. Responding to a story about a woman who was arrested for allegedly having sex with a dog, 'geauxjudge' wrote that it was 'just a small step' from having 'TGGLBS' sex, an apparent reference to transgender, gay, lesbian or bisexual sex. Two months after he pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges Maggio filed a request with the Arkansas Supreme Court in March to voluntarily surrender his law licence in order to 'avoid the expense, stress and publicity of further addressing his [bribery] conviction', according to court notes. Now he has been completely barred from practising law in Arkansas and removed from the state's registry of licensed attorneys. A call to his lawyer for comment by the Associated Press was not immediately returned yesterday. Theron with Jackson in LA in February. Adoption proceedings are confidential in Arkansas but Maggio leaked details of the actress's hearing . Maggio, who has five children from a previous relationship, is pictured with his partner, Dawn, left and right . Postings on the website TigerDroppings.com show Maggio discussing confidential information about Theron's adoption application . Prosecutors in Maggio's bribery case said he accepted campaign donations from nursing home owner Michael Morton and a lobbyist in exchange for reducing a jury award in a negligence case. In that case, Maggio reduced the jury award from $5.2 million to $1 million in a lawsuit stemming from the death of a nursing home patient. Campaign finance records showed Morton's political action committees contributed money to Maggio's campaign for the Arkansas Court of Appeals. The family of the woman who died, Martha Bull, filed a lawsuit late last year against Maggio, nursing home owner Michael Morton and lobbyist Gilbert Baker protesting the reduction of the award. A circuit court judge dismissed Maggio from the civil case last month, but not the other two defendants, saying Maggio had judicial immunity because he was acting in his official capacity as a judge.","Michael Maggio is already banned for life from holding judicial office for revealing actress's adoption of boy two months before she went public .

"A fully grown New Yorker has filed a lawsuit claiming he got seriously injured playing a popular children's game. Amol Gupta, from Manhattan, is suing ZogSports kickball league claiming that during a match two years ago he ran into a brick wall, breaking his nose and elbow, and also injuring his spine. Kickball is a popular American schoolyard game akin to baseball where players kick the ball to bat instead of using bats. Dropped the ball: Amol Gupta (not pictured), from Manhattan, is suing ZogSports kickball league claiming that during a match two years ago he ran into a brick wall, breaking his nose and elbow . Filed of dreams: The match at the center of the lawsuit took place April 27, 2013, on Roosevelt Island . Child's play: Kickball is a popular schoolyard game similar to baseball where players kick the ball to bat instead of using bats . According to court papers filed in Amol Gupta's lawsuit, the young professional joined ZogSports' kickball league in April 2013. On April 27, Gupta attended a match on Roosevelt Island, during which he slipped on a patch of grass and slammed his body against the retaining wall. In his lawsuit, cited by New York Post, Gupta accuses the organizers of the match of setting the foul and base lines too close to the brick wall. On its website, ZogSports is described as a co-ed social sports league for young professionals in New York, New Jersey, Washington DC, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Besides kickback, the league offers a variety of throwback, schoolyard-themed games, including dodge ball, wiffle ball, ultimate Frisbee and bocce ball. ZogSpots also has a philanthropic component to its business model, donating money to the winning team's favorite charity each season. According to its site, the league has contributed more than $2.6million to teams' charities to date. Amol Gupta's lawsuit alleges that officials with ZogSports acted in a negligent, careless and reckless manner by 'failing to lay out, set up, operate, manage, maintain and inspect, design, and control' the layout of the kickball field. Famous player: In October 2012, actor Bill Murray (center) caused a stir when he stumbled upon a ZogSports kickball match on Roosevelt Island and joined in the fun . Documents filed in court detail Gupta's injuries, which are said to have been 'severe, protracted and incapacitating.’ As a result of his fall, the kickball enthusiast allegedly required surgery on his broken elbow that involved the installation of a rod with screws and braces. Doctors also inserted plates and screws in his damaged wrist. Gupta's lawyer said in a statement that ZogSports 'dropped the ball' in providing a safe environment for its players on April 27. The plaintiff is suing for unspecified damages. In October 2012, eccentric actor and comedian Bill Murray made headlines when he stumbled upon a ZogSports kickball match on Roosevelt Island and joined in the fun. After playing about 10 minutes with a group of 20-somethings, Murray's team lost but he happily posed for pictures with his new pals.","Amol Gupta was playing in a match on Roosevelt Island in April 2013 when he injured himself .

"An Indiana woman who police say duped a new mother into believing she was a child-welfare worker so she could stab the mom and steal her baby to pass off as her own was charged Monday. Madison County prosecutors filed paperwork in Circuit Court charging Geraldine Jones, 36, with murder, kidnapping and criminal confinement in the death of  Samantha Fleming, 23, of Anderson. Police Sgt Chad Boynton said Monday afternoon police had not yet been in contact with Jones, of Gary, who police say is being treated in Texas for depression. Scroll down for video . Geraldine Jones, 36, of Gary, Indiana, was charged with murder, kidnapping and criminal confinement . Samantha Fleming and her three-week old baby went missing from her home in Anderson, Indiana, on April 5 . Police believe Fleming, 23, was lured from her home by Jones and the new mother brought Serenity with her . Authorities in Texas have taken precautions to make sure Jones can't leave the hospital and Indiana police are hoping to begin extradition proceedings, Fox 59 reported. Sgt Boynton said: 'We are making preparations to initiate conversation just as soon as possible.' Fleming was living with her boyfriend, but disappeared with her three-week-old baby Serenity on April 5. Police investigating Fleming's disappearance on Friday found her body in Jones' home in Gary, about 165 miles northwest of Anderson. She had been stabbed, wrapped in plastic and soaked with bleach. When police arrived, Fleming's daughter was being held by Jones' sister, who told police she had been caring for her sister's child while her sister was in Texas. Police determined the child was Fleming's and the baby was returned to relatives in Indianapolis. Authorities say they believe Jones got Fleming to travel to northwest Indiana by telling her she worked for the Indiana Department of Child Services and she needed to attend a hearing. Serenity was being held by Jones' sister, who told police she had been caring for her sister's young child . A woman called Fleming's mother before she disappeared saying she was with DCS and wanted information . Indiana State Personnel Department spokeswoman Ashley Emsweller Hungate said no one named Geraldine Jones or with the name of her sister has ever worked for DCS. Police believe Jones may have faked being pregnant, telling family she was expecting twins. Boynton said police don't know how the woman was able to convince Fleming she worked for DCS, but he said Fleming did have previous contact with DCS. He said: 'So therefore the ploy that the suspect used to get her to leave Anderson and head to Lake County may have been more believable in her mind.' Police say a woman called Fleming's mother before she disappeared and said she was with DCS and was seeking information about Fleming and her daughter. The body of Fleming was found stabbed, doused in bleach and wrapped in plastic inside this home in Gary . Authorities said the woman provided legitimate names of DCS employees and implied she was familiar with Fleming's case history. DCS spokesman James Wide said he couldn't comment on whether Fleming had a DCS case because of privacy laws. Wide said DCS is leaving the investigation into how the woman may have tricked Fleming into thinking she worked for DCS up to police. 'There's nothing internally being initiated from it, but we definitely will comply with law enforcement and help them where we can,' he said.","Geraldine Jones charged with murder, kidnapping, criminal confinement .

"What would high fashion adverts look like if the designers used real women, rather than teenage models or celebrity faces, to showcase their latest clothing and beauty lines? Photo stylist Nathalie Croquet, from Paris, has recreated a series of glossy commercials for her project SPOOF. The exhibition includes parodies of ads from Givenchy, Lancome, Lanvin and Acne. In the images Nathalie has recreated the adverts completely, from the clothes the model wears, to the poses, make-up, hair colour and surroundings. Scroll down for video . Lancome: Nathalie Croquet a photo-stylist from Paris created a photo series called SPOOF in which she recreated the ads of famous designers and brands . Natalie said: 'SPOOF is an artistic project of 11 photos, we did an exhibition in February in Paris with my pictures in a big size. 'I had the idea in October and we worked on it for two months. I have worked in the fashion business as a photo stylist for magazines and advertising for 25 years. 'So I am the person who  has ideas for ad campaigns. It was a strange idea for for me to be on the other side of the camera!' During the course of her career Nathalie has worked with over 200 different photographers on various campaigns. ELEVENPARIS: In this image a smiling Nathalie emulates the pose Kate Moss adopted for the French brand . Lanvin: The series of pictures took two months to create and Nathalie said it was interesting to be on the other side of the camera . Nathalie said that the project helped her to understand her job on a deeper level: 'By changing role I discovered my craft from another angle.' She said that she hoped the humour in the images would provide people with the opportunity for, 'laughter and reflection.' She told Buzzfeed: 'I don’t really see myself. You know, like how you don’t recognize your voice in a telephone message?' Eric Bompard: Just like the real life adverts Nathalie's pictures were retouched, for example her eye colour was changed to blue for this Eric Bompard-inspired  shoot .

Daniel Schweizer the photographer who shot the images said: 'Most of the time we look at advertising images without analysis, without fully perceiving the extent that they have been worked on. 'Changed clothes and accessories, digital retouching, skin cleansed, faked decor, body stretched; it is only when we take a closer look at these images that we get the full measure.

"A mother-of-two who was abused by her own father throughout her childhood has spoken out after he was jailed for 22 years. Mandy Greenwood, 39, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, said: 'My dad used to tell me he only did it because he loved me. I was more like his wife than his daughter. 'Now he's in jail the sense of freedom and relief is incredible. He can never hurt another child again.' Brave: Mandy Greenwood has spoken out about the father who abused her as a child . Mandy carried the terrible secret around with her for more than 20 years – and it was only after she confided in her husband, Dave, that she felt strong enough to seek help. She has waived her right to anonymity in the hope that other victims of abuse will come forward too. Mandy's abuse began at the age of seven, when her father, Keith Whitworth, now 61, came into her bedroom and woke her up during the night. What began as touching became rape on an almost daily basis. Mandy said: 'I would cry myself to sleep each night. There was nobody for me to confide in. I felt so alone and so sad. I wasn't close to my mum at all. 'Sometimes he would take me to the park – what seemed like a nice trip out – but he would abuse me then too. Guilty: Keith Whitworth has been jailed for 22 years for a catalogue of abuse against three children . 'He would tell me: 'I'm only doing this because I love you.' 'In my child's mind, I thought of myself as his wife rather than his daughter.' As a child, Mandy was given a choice at bedtime; she could either go to bed early or take a beating with her father's belt. She said: 'My siblings would go to bed but I would take the belt because I didn't want to go to bed. I was scared of going to bed. 'It was a no-win situation and it was only as an adult that I realised how twisted and cruel he was.' New family: Mandy escaped home life by getting pregnant with her daughter at 15, and son four years later . In a desperate effort to escape her home life, Mandy became pregnant. At 15, she had a daughter, and four years later she had a son. She said: 'To me, sex was nothing special. It was a dirty, unpleasant thing. I wanted a baby because I needed my own family. 'When my daughter was born, I felt a surge of love and happiness that I had never experienced before. I left home and I was determined to be a good mum. It was my focus in life.' Mandy did not return home and the abuse stopped. But her father lived nearby and she saw him on a regular basis. She said: 'At first, I tried to keep a friendly relationship, for the sake of appearances. But he was very touchy-feely – always pushing the boundaries. 'The abuse was never mentioned. It was like the elephant in the room. It weighed me down, physically, all through my life. 'Once, I plucked up courage to ask him why he did it, and he replied: ""I only did it because I loved you."" Realising she could no longer cope with him in her life, Mandy stopped all contact. At the age of 20, Mandy met Dave, a friend of her brother. Despite being a single mother to two children already, she and Dave hit it off immediately. Mandy said: 'Dave was like a breath of fresh air. He was a real giggle.' Fresh start: Mandy met her husband Dave at 20. 'He was like a breath of fresh air,' she said . As the couple grew closer, Mandy decided to confide in someone about the abuse – for the first time in her life. She said: 'Until then, I had bottled it up inside. I hadn't told anyone. But I felt I could trust Dave. I knew he was there for me.' Dave urged her to seek help. But Mandy could not face telling the police. Trust: Mandy felt she could trust Dave and, for the first time in her life, confided about the abuse she suffered . Moving on: Mandy had severed all contact with her father by the time she married Dave and admits that she was never very close to her mother . She said: 'Dave was very supportive. I had a lot of problems sexually – I would sometimes freeze when he touched me, and after sex I would have to have a bath. I felt dirty and upset. 'But Dave was very patient and understanding. 'I tried to bury it all, and concentrate on my children. They brought me so much happiness. And Dave was my rock. 'But I could not forget the abuse. It was there, at the front of my mind, each day. I kept hearing his voice, in flashbacks.' Two years ago, Mandy finally plucked up courage to go to the police. In February 2013, her father, Keith Whitworth - who committed a catalogue of sexual abuse against three children – was jailed. Whitworth was found guilty of 23 historic child sex offences, including rape, attempted rape, buggery, indecent assault and indecency against a child. Hoping to help: Mandy, from Greater Manchester, has waived her right to anonymity in the hope that other victims of abuse will come forward too . At Bolton Crown Court he was sentenced to 22 years and made subject to an indefinite sexual offences prevention order. Detective Constable Lesley Nolan-Brennan, said: 'The detail of the shocking abuse suffered by the victims is quite frankly stomach-churning. 'Over a prolonged period Whitworth repeatedly abused three very young children. The consequences of his actions have been life-changing for them all. 'They have had to relive their ordeal in open court and I must commend their courage in doing so. 'I hope they feel a sense of justice now he has been sentenced.'","Keith Whitworth was jailed for 22 years in 2013 for abusing three children .

"As Jeremy Clarkson continues to battle to save his career after being sacked form Top Gear, his estranged wife has been enjoying a family break in the Caribbean. Frances Clarkson showed off her tanned figure in a white bikini as she relaxed on a beach in Barbados. The 53 year old revealed the results of a week sunbathing over Easter in the skimpy swimsuit, which was covered in a black palm tree print. Scroll down for video . Frances Clarkson showed of her holiday tan in a white bikini during a dip in the sea on her Barbados holiday today . Frances appeared to be deep in thought as she paddled around in the clear blue waters, where she had been jet skiing two days beforehand. She accessorised with a Help For Heroes wristband and swept her sun-bleached hair up into a butterfly clip. Frances has previously holidayed in the area with the 54-year-old broadcaster - they headed to the island together after he was first pictured with his reported girlfriend Phillipa Sage. But Frances and Jeremy, who have two daughters and a son, are said to have lived apart for  years. The 53 year old appeared deep in conversation as she headed across the beach to take a dip . Frances accessorised her look with a Help For Heroes wristband . The BBC announced last month they were dropping Clarkson from the hit motoring show after a 'fracas' involving a Top Gear producer. Clarkson left Oisin Tymon needing hospital treatment after punching him at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire, after staff wouldn't serve him a hot meal following a day of filming. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately and it was announced today that he will not face any criminal charges for the attack. Holiday: Frances Clarkson, 53, spent the Easter Bank Holiday weekend with family and friends in Barbados . Rushing to his side to comfort him throughout the ordeal has been events organiser Phillipa Sage, 45, who became a feature in his life in 2010 when he was still in a relationship with Frances. It was claimed last year that his marriage had been under strain after reports he had engaged in extra-martial affairs. Last summer he told the MailOnline's Piers Morgan he was 'going through a difficult divorce'. In April 2011 Clarkson was accused of having an affair with Miss Sage while touring Australia, South Africa and Norway with his Top Gear co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May. Sunshine: Frances was spotted in a black bikini as she drove a jet ski and caught some rays in the sun . Relax: The 53-year-old has previously holidayed on the island with her estranged husband Jeremy Clarkson . He was alleged to have spent several nights with Miss Sage and kissed her on the lips in full view of observers on one occasion. Clarkson shrugged off the claims at the time, saying that he and Miss Sage had been simply 'colleagues fooling around'. But shortly afterwards it was revealed that he was spending time during the week living in a bachelor pad in London. He denied that he had moved out of the family home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, saying he used the London flat when he was editing Top Gear. Clarkson was photographed kissing Miss Sage while on holiday with her in Greece in 2013, and they also visited Australia again. In October 2011 Clarkson lifted a High Court gagging order preventing his first wife, Alex Hall, from claiming that he had had an affair with her after he married Frances. Split: Frances has two daughters and a son with the 54-year-old broadcaster, but the pair are said to have been living apart for years . Distant: The BBC announced last month they were dropping her estranged husband from the hit motoring show after a 'fracas' involving a Top Gear producer . Break: Frances walks along the beach with an unidentified man during the Easter holiday to the Caribbean . Mrs Hall, who married him in 1989 but separated from him after less than two years, alleged that they rekindled their relationship from 1999 onwards – something he denied. Clarkson married Frances in 1993 and she encouraged him to cultivate a more aggressive on-screen persona to make Top Gear more controversial, say friends. In recent years he has been caught up in other controversies, including being accused of racism after he called an Asian man a 'slope' when he joked about the construction of a bridge in Thailand during an episode of Top Gear. Estranged: Jeremy and Frances Clarkson married in 1993 but the pair have not lived together for years. Friends claim that it was Frances who pushed him to cultivate a more aggressive on-screen persona . In April 2011 Clarkson was accused of having an affair with Phillipa Sage (pictured kissing) while touring Australia, South Africa and Norway with his Top Gear co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May . There was outcry when Clarkson used the word, a derogatory term for people of Asian descent, during the show's two-part Burma special, screened in March last year. In 2013 he came under fire after he allegedly used the n-word in leaked footage while reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. But he escaped disciplinary action by the BBC with the Complaints and Appeals Board agreeing that the 'incident did not engage editorial standards as the material had not been broadcast'.","Frances Clarkson, 53, is holidaying in Barbados with family and friends .

"When booking a holiday it is easy to be confused when it turns out your flight to Vancouver in Canada goes to airport code YVR, or why you will be landing in Malaga, Spain, at an airport with the code AGP. While many main airports have codes which make sense, such as JFK for John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, of LHR for London Heathrow, others can leave passengers baffled - or in fits of laughter. From unfortunate codes such as OMG and SUX to the funny LOL, there are some seemingly very random three-letter combinations around the world. Scroll down for video . Airline Codes features 438 airports from 94 countries, allowing users to finally understand why certain airlines are tagged as they are . Two aviation fans set out to document the world's airport codes and explain how they were chosen with their website Airport Codes. Listing the origins of 438 airports from 94 countries, they explain the reasons behind the unusual acronyms, such as why many Canadian airport codes begin with the letter Y. COK - Cochine International Airport in India takes its code from the fact it is based in the city of Kochi. DOH - Qatar's glitzy new airport is named for the capital Doha. AGP - Malaga Airport didn't want to take its first three letters from the city name as mal means bad in Spanish. So instead it is AGP, taking 'AG' from the middle of the word and filling with the letter 'P'. SUX - Iowa's Sioux City airport ended up with the unfortunate three letter code SUX and have tried to change it many times. Now it has embraced the name with the tag line 'Fly Sux'. ORD - Chicago O'Hare endedup with the unusua;l flight code which points to its past as Orchard Field. MSY - New Orleans Louis Armstrong's code reflects aviator John Moisant and the nearby Moisant Stock Yards. OMG - Omega Airport in Namibia has the somewhat hilarious code of OMG, which is often used as shorthand for 'oh my God'. LOL - in the spirit of unusual acronyms, the term usually use din text messages to signify 'laugh out loud' is actually Derby Field airport in Nevada, serving Lovelock City (hence the code). When codes were generated in the 1930s, old broadcast radio codes were sometimes used. In Canada, radio stations used Y, and this was reflected in the majority of their airport codes starting with the same letter, as shown with YWG representing Winnipeg. The Australian Business Traveller stated that during the first days of air travel, airports were given a two letter 'weather station' code. As the amount of airports increased worldwide, this two-digit number rose to three so each could be given a unique code. Cities with similar starting names like Dublin and Dubai caused the labelling to deviate from a regular system, with Dubai adopting DXB, when DUB was already assigned to Dublin. The codes are known as IATA location identifiers, and are set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The triple characters are displayed on luggage tags at airport check-in desks, to ensure they reach the correct destination. Full lists of the code are published biannually in the IATA Airline Coding Directory. Co-creator Lynn Fisher said she was inspired following hearing a talk about the rationale behind IATA airport codes. 'Ever since I’ve found it interesting and recently did a web search to see if there was a site that compiled all of those stories,' the Arizona-based designer said. 'Nothing came up, so we decided to make one. 'Many airports change names over the years so their airport codes might reflect a previous identity or purpose. 'It’s especially surprising (and interesting) when the code comes from very early or even unofficial designations.' Homer's favourite airport! Airline Codes explains why Hamad International Airport ended up with the DOH code . Many recognise LAX to be the code for Los Angeles Airport, but the extra X on the end has baffled travellers for a while, and can be explained by the transition from two letters to three . The inclusion of an extra letter is the explanation behind the famous LAX code, which was just LA during the 1930s. The airport added the extra X around 1947 to reflect the change in the number of required letters. Several others similarly adopted the X, which can be seen in airport codes such as PDX for Portland, and DXB for Dubai. Codes were sometimes worked out using the city it was located, followed by the name of the airport itself, for example LHR was used for London Heathrow and LGW for London Gatwick. One of the funnier airport codes is Cochin International Airport in Kochi in India, which reverses the first three letters of its place name . Portugal’s second busiest airport, Porto uses the code OPO. It is named after  its alternate English spelling: OPOrto. Confusingly there are exceptions to the rule, with London Stansted airport being given the STN as its code. Perhaps the most entertaining tale on the site is the story of Iowa's Sioux City airport. The unfortunate code for this airport is SUX, which they tried multiple times in vain to change. Once accepting defeat, they used the code to their advantage, using the memorable phrase 'Fly Sux.' Co-creator software engineer Nick Crohn said: 'That’s probably one of the things that’s most enjoyable about the codes. 'They are keys to the airport’s history. 'ORD for Chicago O’Hare points to its past as Orchard Field and MSY for New Orleans Louis Armstrong reflects aviator John Moisant and the nearby Moisant Stock Yards. Lynn admitted the codes that make words like FAT, for Fresno in California, are her favourite. Instead of Malaga Airport using the code MAL, which translates in Spanish as bad, they opted for taking the middle letters from Malaga, and adding a P . Travellers going to Beijing Capital International may be confused to see PEK on their luggage tags. However this is from older English spelling of Beijing, which was PEKing .","The three-letter airport codes are known as IATA location identifiers .

"Kaitlyn Granado, 24, was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil, 15, in her car on consecutive nights in January . A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the Dallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her. A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved. 'That information came from within the school, and it turned out to be true.' Granado, who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas (pictured), was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy, also 15, and lettin him touch her breasts . Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a $50,000 bail. It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her. A spokesman for Irving school district said: 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details, we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action. 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property.'","Kaitlyn Granado, 24, first arrested March 19 for relationship with boy, 15 .

"Hillary Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin didn't leave a tip during their now infamous stop at an Ohio Chipotle on Monday - despite there being a jar on the counter. 'Her bill was $20 and some change, and they paid with $21 and left,' Charles Wright, manager of the Maumee, Ohio, restaurant, told Bloomberg. To be fair, multimillionaire 'Clinton didn't pay' for the meal, according to Wright. 'The other lady paid the bill,' he said, referring to Abedin, the vice chairwoman of Clinton's campaign. She was spotted standing next to Clinton in security camera footage released by the Toledo-area store. Scroll down for video . Spotted: Hillary and Huma order at Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio, at lunchtime Monday- the first time they had been seen since they started their cross-country road trip. But nobody in the restaurant recognized them during their 45-minute meal. The manager says they didn't leave a tip . Do you tip at Chipotle if there is a jar? Do you tip at Chipotle if there is a jar? Now share your opinion . Not every Chipotle restaurant has a jar for change. And many customers pay with a card. But Wright assured Bloomberg that his location does, and customers usually leave a little something behind. 'We get a bunch of tips,' the 29-year-old said. 'If we're doing our job right, people tip.' Clinton and Abedin dropped by the Maumee restaurant incognito for lunch just after 1 pm on Monday during their road trip from New York to Iowa for the first round of campaign events. Traveling in an armored van they fondly call 'Scooby' after the 1970s cartoon program and wearing dark sunglasses, they reportedly strolled into Chipotle, waited their turn in line and ordered a chicken burrito bowl - with guacamole - a chicken salad, a blackberry Izzy soda and a regular soda without being recognized. It wasn't until after Clinton was back on the road that her campaign alerted the press to the lunch outing. Reporters were then able to obtain security camera footage from the store that proved Clinton had in fact dined there. A former first lady, secretary of state, New York senator, Clinton's net worth fell somewhere between $5 million and $25 million in 2012, the last time she was required by the government to disclose her earnings. She's since written a memoir, for which she received a hefty $14 million advance, and made at least $5 million more off of speaking gigs. Together, she and husband Bill have an estimated net worth of roughly $100,000 million, but the public won't know for sure until she files a disclosure form in the course of her national campaign. A key feature of Clinton's second attempt for the presidency was supposed to be her interactions with 'everyday' Americans, meant to show how down to earth and approachable the wealthy New Yorker is. But Clinton made no attempts at the Chipotle to introduce herself, the manager indicated, or mingle with other burrito-goers. 'The thing is, she has these dark sunglasses on,' Wright told the New York Times after it inquired about her visit. 'She just was another lady.' The Daily Mail Online yesterday learned that an impromptu round table that Clinton held at a coffee shop with three young people was completely staged by her campaign. A Clinton staffer vetted the young people, all of whom had ties to the Democratic Party, and drove them to the site of the meet and greet. Clinton is pictured here arriving at the Iowa Statehouse yesterday for a meeting with Democratic Party lawmakers in Des Moines. To her left is Iowa Senate Majority Leader Michael Gronstal . This is the branch of Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio, where Hillary and her right-hand woman Huma Abedin were spotted at 1:13 p.m. local time on Monday . The question of whether Clinton left a tip at Chipotle was first raised by conservative radio show host Rush Limbaugh during his Tuesday broadcast. Explaining to his listeners the concept of Chipotle, Limbaugh noted, 'There's a tip jar in there.' 'And I would be interested to learn if Mrs. Clinton put anything in it. I mean, she's out there representing the little guy. She's out there campaigning against the rich,' he said, pointing out that Clinton is in the 1 percent of top earners. Further chiding her for failing to alert other diners to her presence, Limbaugh said, 'I thought this is an everyman tour. I thought this was a tour where Hillary Clinton was gonna meet the people that she's standing up for, that she's representing, that she's doing everything she's doing for the little guy, doing it for them. 'She slithers in to Chipotle, doesn't get recognized, doesn't seek to be recognized,' he said. 'Wearing the dark glasses is a favored technique of celebrities trying to hide' - not of political candidates. He also suggested, correctly, that Clinton probably didn't pay for her meal, her assistant did. 'You know, celebrities like that are famous for walking around with no money and no credit card because they're so accustomed to somebody else picking up the check. The Clintons really rate high on that scale.' Mystery: Until the security camera footage of Hillary and Huma surfaced around four hours after they ate at Chipotle, nobody knew where the presidential candidate was. Clinton made no attempts at the Chipotle to introduce herself, the manager indicated, or mingle with other burrito-goers . Continuing Limbaugh said, he really would 'like to know if she left anything in the tip jar, because that would be an indication that she understands the average, ordinary, everyman that she seeks to represent. 'I mean, that's where the people that work at Chipotle, that's where they make a little extra, in the tip jar, and I haven't heard a word about whether or not she visited the tip jar, whether she put anything in it or not.' Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus picked up the ball and began running with it on Wednesday, telling Fox News that Clinton's strategy is to 'make sure the field knows that she's running, and then not answer any questions from the media, and not actually talk to anybody.' 'If you want to be successful, ' he said, especially in early primary states, 'you've got to take the sunglasses off and actually go and talk to people. And actually care about what people think,' he said, according to Business Insider. 'This is Iowa; it's not Hollywood,' he said.","'Her bill was $20 and some change, and they paid with $21 and left,' said the manager of the Maumee, Ohio, restaurant .

"Wealth: Training consultant Jay Rutland, 34, with his 30-year-old billionaire wife Tamara Ecclestone . The husband of billionaire heiress Tamara Ecclestone earned just £65 a week from his firm last year, it was revealed today. Jay Rutland, 34, who is married to the 30-year-old daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, saw his company bring in just £3,378 over the 12 months to July 2014. The training consultant’s firm Brigante Business Developments, based in Battersea, south-west London, is listed in company records as providing ‘management consultancy activities’. Its latest accounts for the year to July 2014 were filed to Companies House a fortnight ago, showing the company - which was incorporated in July 2012 - having total net assets of £3,378, down from £18,131 the year before. The former stockbroker - who lives with his wife and daughter Sophia, one, in a £45million house in west London - married the heiress in a £7million wedding in France in July 2013. The couple, who met in January 2013 and were engaged a month later, celebrated Sophia’s first birthday last month with a farmyard-themed party that cost an estimated £70,000. This included ponies, a zebra, a balloon house and even a magical princess. And last year Sophia enjoyed a private visit from Father Christmas and a replica electric Bentley car toy. Miss Ecclestone’s family is worth an estimated £3billion - and the couple are said to own a £300,000 Ferrari, £123,000 Bentley GT Continental and a £100,000 Range Rover. Family life: The former stockbroker lives with his wife and one-year-old daughter Sophia (pictured) in London . Company: Brigante Business Developments is based in this building (above) in Battersea, south-west London . A spokesman told The Sun yesterday: ‘Although this company is still active it had not been trading in the financial year the filing reflects.’ Mr Rutland's high-earning career in the City of London ended in shame in 2012, when he was banned from trading over 'market abuse'. In a damning ruling, the Financial Services Authority concluded he was not a 'fit and proper person' and his behaviour demonstrated a lack of 'honesty and integrity'. In 2013 Mr Rutland needed treatment for facial cuts after he was ambushed by two men in a mugging when he stopped his black Ferrari - just a month after marrying Miss Ecclestone.

"The police officer accused of murdering Walter Scott will be banned from seeing his first-born child for several months, it was revealed today. Patrol officer Michael Slager will be refused the right to hold the baby which his wife Jamie is set to give birth to in a few weeks. He is only granted video access to his eight and a half month's pregnant wife and an officer stands outside the booth whenever he talks to his family. They are not allowed to spend any time together and contact is via video screens with headphones at the Charleston County jail. But the baby will not be able to enter the South Carolina prison. Before the fall: Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, with his wife Jamie before his arrest. Slager was charged with murder after shooting Walter Scott, 50, after stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina . Visit: Michael Slager received a visit at Charleston County Jail last Friday from his pregnant wife and mom . It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden. He will be informed by a telephone call and have to wait to see photographs, which will be examined by officials before being presented to him. When Jamie attended the jail on Friday, she was made to turn through the prison's reception area and take a seat next to a video screen for a talk with him which lasted around two hours. The booths are protected by screens to prevent onlookers from seeing inmates, but appointments have to made in advance. Relatives of other prisoners queued to use the video booths after registering with prison officials behind thick glass security screens as Jamie and her accused husband talked with the aid of headphones. But their first child together will not be allowed to visit him in prison until jail chiefs decide that the baby's health would not be at risk from being there. Although there is no specific age limit, prison policy is not to allow babies in. No date has yet been set for his first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away. Major Eric Watson of the Charleston County Sheriff's Office told Daily Mail Online: 'He is treated just like any other prisoner, except for being in protective custody. 'His baby won't be coming to the prison and he will not be allowed to see the child. It could be several months before he does. 'His attorney can apply for the baby to be brought to the jail if he wants.' Walter Scott was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen. Family tell says the light was an accessory and both mandatory stop lamps were functioning . Slager, 33, already has two step children from his wife's previous marriage, but the new baby will be the first for him and Jamie. Major Watson said Slager had no access to the internet and was under close scrutiny to deter any threat from angry prisoners over the shooting of Walter,who was gunned down by the officer after being stopped for an apparent faulty tail light on his Mercedes. Walter's supporters and family say he was stopped for allegedly having a faulty center stop light at the bottom of his rear windscreen and this was wrong because the light was an accessory and both his obligatory stop lamps were functioning. Major Watson said Slager was being offered three meals a day and recreation time, but was isolated from other inmates. Housed in a room with one small window, he has no interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. One released prisoner said outside the gates: 'Man, it ain't no holiday being in there. He has to watch his back more than most because of what he did. There's a lot of angry men in there, black and white.' Walter's brother Anthony said police faced 'many questions' about traffic stops based on racial profiling and that his brother's death should serve as a catalyst for a change in police policies. Meanwhile, the man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton. No date has yet been set for Slager's first court appearance and his full trial date could more than a year away . The mystery man who was in the car when Walter Scott was flagged down by police before being gunned down was identified today as drifter Pierre Fulton . The 30-year-old was detained by police as Walter fled his Mercedes Benz before dying in a hail of bullets and later released. Pierre's family said they had no idea why he was in the car and how he came to be friends with the shooting victim. His grand mother Eunice Fulton, 70, said: 'I spoke with my daughter Franetta on Thursday and Pierre had only just told her he was in the car. 'It was a terrible incident but we haven't had the chance to speak to him about it. He used to live with me until a couple of years ago. But I don't where he hangs out now. He moves around.' Pierre, who was known to police, had stayed in the background since Walter was shot by officer Michael Slager and at the weekend rejected media requests for interviews. He has given a full statement to investigators, but police refused to reveal his name and what he has told them. He had requested privacy. Pierre was caught on the policeman's dash cam after Walter had fled and been shot. But police released him without charge and he was not suspected of any crime. He has convictions for unlawfully carrying a pistol and served 174 days in prison in 2005 and has been arrested several times. His grandmother added: 'He is a good grandson. He cares for his family. But I don't know what he is doing now.' Pierre has worked as a cleaner, laundry man and warehouseman over the years, but some members of his family have lost touch with him. Rosanne Grant of Alternative Staffing employment agency told Daily Mail Online: ' He worked at various jobs over the period of a year through me. The last time I hear about him was in 2006 and nothing since. I don't know what he has been working at.'","Officer Michael Slager is being held at Charleston County jail accused of murdering Walter Scott, shooting him eight times in the back .

"If you’re bored of crosswords and sick of Sudoku, an enigmatic new riddle game may be just the mental challenge you need. A mysterious app called None* gives users only one clue to get started and a keyboard to type their guesses. There are no images, music, animations, sound effects or hints to help users, or indication of what the purpose of the game is exactly. Scroll down for video . An intentionally mysterious app called None* gives users only one clue to get started and a keyboard to type their guesses. Examples of 'questions' are pictured above left and right . Available for iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices, the description of the game in stores reads: ‘No one really knows what none* game is about.’ The free app has a pitch black screen and a single clue written in white text, as well as showing a small keyboard. Upon starting the game, there is no indication what the goal of it is, how many levels there are, or even how users are supposed to solve some of the more obscure riddles. However, the app can be completed and has 50 levels, according to people bragging on the App Store that they have completed the None* app. The questions are relatively simple to start with, including basic maths questions and others that have clear answers, but then extend to name associations, before seemingly showing random statements and even coordinates. Available for iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices, the description of the game in stores reads: ‘No one really knows what none* game is about.’ It is intentionally more mysterious than a crossword (stock image) and does not have as descriptive clues or aids of hints or images to help players guess the answers . The app is available to download for iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices. Players are confronted with a black screen and a single clue written in white. They use the keyboard to enter their answer in order to progress to the next level. There are 50 levels in total in 'Episode One' and clues get progressively tougher. But upon playing the app, this is not known and  it seems mysterious. The app's inventor, Dimitris Chassapakis, said that around 10 per cent of people who downloaded the app have completed the puzzle game. Clues include: 'The ultimate question of life, the universe and everything,' 'P + left step 1 + left step 7 + right step 1 + right step 1' and 'the answer is next. The next is answer'. Then there is a blank space beneath the clue to write the answer. Athens-based Dimitris Chassapakis, who created None*, told Business Insider that it’s his first text-based puzzle game for mobile. He said that there are 50 levels in None* but just 10 per cent of players have completed the game. ‘This is the first episode and if you solve all 50 levels you can subscribe for the release of Episode 2 — probably this summer,’ he added. Between 10,000 and 50,000 people have downloaded the free app via Google Play but there are no stats from the App Store. Reviews of the game on Google Play include those from people waiting for part two.

None* refers to itself as a puzzle game, but that's a poor descriptor. ‘Puzzles have clues which lead to a correct answer. None* simply gives a single, usually insufficient clue without context, and you have to guess at which of the many possible answers is the one the game is looking for.’ Around 10 per cent of None* players have completed the app's 50 levels and are eagerly anticipating their second episode, but others were simply frustrated with it (stock image)","Enigmatic app is the brainchild of a developer in Athens, Greece .

"Tony Blair yesterday faced accusations of ‘megalomania’ over an interview in which he vowed to set up his own ‘leaders club’ of ex-statesmen – and appeared to dismiss the need for democracy. The ex-PM said he wanted to create a ‘cadre’ of former leaders to advise governments, saying: ‘You can get some of these guys who are fantastic executors. Why not use their talents and their experience?’ He added: ‘Why not come and help the president of this country or the prime minister of that country?’ Scroll down for video . Tony Blair on the cover of Newsweek. The former Prime Minister said his ideas of leadership were ‘close to a benevolent dictatorship’ In the profile in the American magazine Newsweek, Mr Blair also praised the authoritarian military regime in Egypt, which has been accused of human rights abuses, saying: ‘Yes, democracy is important, but democracy is not on its own sufficient. You need effective government taking effective decisions.’ The article – which described Mr Blair’s ideas of leadership as ‘close to a benevolent dictatorship’ – added that Mr Blair had concluded from the foot-and-mouth crisis of 2001, when the army slaughtered ten million sheep and cattle, that soldiers were better at emergencies than governments. When asked about his future work plans, he grandly announced: ‘I’ve done British. I suppose where I think I can make most difference is on a global level, working on things that had interested me as Prime Minister but that I was not able to devote myself to.’ Mr Blair, who made his first intervention in the Election campaign last week with a speech backing Ed Miliband and warning about the risks of leaving the European Union, said that he hoped to stay active in both politics and business well into his 90s. Blair in his old constituency giving a talk at the Xcel centre in County Durham in support of Ed Miliband. He said he hoped to stay active in both politics and business well into his 90s . Explaining why he had no plans to retire, Mr Blair said: ‘I’ve got decades. I want to be seeing someone when I’m 91 after having had medical tests which show I’m getting younger. The thought of actually retiring is not... look, you have got to have some self-awareness of these things. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has branded Blair a 'megalomaniac' for his Newsweek remarks . ‘And I just know that if I do that, it would literally take me about three days before I was bored out of my mind. Took to drink or something.’ The 61-year-old has been working as a Middle East peace envoy while picking up international consultancy work that earns him millions of pounds a year. Talking about the group of ex-leaders he hoped to deploy in his business, Mr Blair suggested that only those who had risen to the top of their countries could properly relate to each other. He said: ‘The moment I’m talking to a new leader and I’m describing what I felt and what the challenges were, there’s a total and instant empathy, an immediate locking on to each other... and I know what it’s like because I’ve sat in the decision-making seat.’ Last night, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen claimed that Mr Blair’s words suggested he has ‘completely lost the plot’. Mr Bridgen added: ‘David Cameron recently announced that he would not serve a third term, on the grounds that all prime ministers go a bit mad after ten years. ‘It is becoming increasingly clear that Mr Blair’s decade in Downing Street has indeed left its mark, and he is now displaying the distinct signs of megalomania.’","Vowed to set up exclusive club of ex-statesman in Newsweek interview .

"The top-paying companies in America have been revealing - and film-streaming service Netflix is near the top of the pile, paying a median of $180,000 a year. The other boldface name in the group is Google, which comes in at no. 13 and pays an median of $143,000 a year. But to make it on to the payrolls of these top companies, workers needs to be highly educated, highly skilled or highly connected - sometimes all three. They fall into three categories - tech companies, law firms and consulting firms. Netflix has come a long way from its days of mailing DVDs to subscribers across the country. Its 2,000 employees have a median salary of $180,000 now . Nine of the top 15 companies are in the tech sector, according to salary data compiled by the recruiting company Glassdoor.com. These firms are competing furiously to hire and retain the relatively small number of top-notch computer programmers who make Silicon Valley such a magnet for money. Consulting and law firms rely on relationships with clients and so once employees establish themselves, they become more and more valuable and command higher salaries. Wall Street law firm, Skadden, Arps, one of the largest and most prestigious law firms in the nation, comes in at the top of the list. The median compensation there there is $182,000. Skadden has 4,500 employees - more than 1,800 of whom are high-grossing attorneys. Netflix, which has 2,000 employees, comes in second. Management consultants take the three spots - Strategy&, McKinsey & Company and A.T. Kearney all pay $160,000 median salaries. Mozilla, the company that oversees the Firefox web browser and TureCar, which lists car sales, are both on the list. Other than Google, Netflix, Mozilla and TrueCar, most people have likely not heard of the companies of the highest-paid list. The companies are also mostly small and midsize. Nearly all of them employ fewer than 5,000 people. Some just a few hundred. Google, which has 53,000 employees, is by far the largest employer on the list.","Netflix offers median salary of $180,000 .

"An agency is offering cash bonuses to Eastern European lorry drivers because they cannot find Britons to take up the jobs. Truckers from Bulgaria, Poland and Romania, who already work in the UK, are being offered £100 for each driver they manage to lure into Britain from their home country. Employment agency Mainline is offering the incentive to any worker who refers a qualified Class A HGV driver to undertake work for four weeks. Truckers from Bulgaria, Poland and Romania who already work in the UK are being offered £100 by employment agency Mainline (pictured) to lure drivers from their home country to work in Britain . The company did try a recruitment drive to attract lorry drivers from Cornwall to their base in Swindon. But they say they were forced to look further afield when that scheme failed. This is despite there being 3,000 jobless residents in Swindon. Around 4.5 per cent are also unemployed across the south west. The vacancy crisis will re-ignite claims that Britain’s generous welfare system has created a generation unwilling to work, while acting as a magnet for foreigners. Debbie Jameson, from Mainline, said those who arrive from Eastern Europe are willing to work 'as many hours as they can' - something which she said British workers are less keen to do. She said: 'We don't just recruit drivers, we also recruit for permanent roles, call centre roles, industrial roles - everything. 'But it's mainly the skilled workers which we've been struggling to recruit. Numbers of HGV drivers have been dwindling over the years for various reasons.' Ms Jameson said one of the deterrents is the £2,000 outlay that is needed to get a lorry-driving licence. She said many still struggle to get jobs after that, because they are newly qualified drivers and do not have any experience. Mainline said it will offer to help workers from overseas find accommodation and settle into a new life in the UK. It will also provide them with courses so they have the chance to familiarise themselves with British roads, customs and culture. The company did try a recruitment drive to get lorry drivers to relocate from Cornwall to their base in Swindon. But they were forced to look further abroad when that scheme failed (file picture) She said: 'As numbers dwindled, we needed to use a bit of ingenuity. So we asked our workers to help us do our jobs by using their contacts in these countries to help fill these positions. 'We also offer it throughout the UK, and it used to be we'd have drivers from Scotland and Cornwall and Wales come to work in Swindon. We'd find them accommodation and help them settle in, but even that has dried up. 'In places like Romania, Bulgaria and Poland, the standard of living is far lower and wages are lower, and they can come over here to work. 'Even though the cost of living is quite high, the people who come to work are men, and they are here to make as much money as possible to support their families. 'It also means they are quite flexible and want to work as many hours as they can, which is something many people here don't want to do.' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith previously claimed that the last Labour Government’s ‘open-door’ policy led to a huge influx of low-skilled migrant workers while its welfare system disincentivised Britons to work. Many employers have expressed concerns that they cannot get Britons to do manual jobs because they feel it is not the kind of work they want. Oppositely, in Eastern European countries, the average wage is around £7,000 - meaning workers can earn almost double that in the UK, even on a minimum wage. They would also have their wages topped up with tax credits - seen as a major attraction for EU migrants - and housing benefit. In November last year, the UK’s biggest sandwich maker said it was recruiting hundreds of workers from Eastern Europe for the same reason. Bosses from Greencore Group, which supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda, flew to Hungary today in search of staff for its new factory. Allyson Russell, Greencore’s human resources director, said the company had tried to recruit in the UK, but that it was ‘not always the kind of work’ which people wanted to do. Last year, the Mail found British companies had placed almost 8,000 job adverts trying to recruit Romanian nurses, taxi drivers and hotel staff.","Mainline, in Swindon, wants drivers from Bulgaria, Poland and Romania .

"The frustration of waiting hours for your phone to charge could soon be a thing of the past thanks to an aluminium battery that recharges in less than 60 seconds. And the technology is both greener and safer than current batteries, as well as being flexible. It is the first high-performance aluminium battery that is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive', according to its designers. The aluminium battery (pictured) was created at Stanford University. It is said to be the first high-performance aluminium battery that is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive' The aluminium battery was created at Stanford University, California, and the findings have been published in the journal Nature. Lead author and professor of chemistry at the university, Hongjie Dai, said: 'We have developed a rechargeable aluminium battery that may replace existing storage devices, such as alkaline batteries, which are bad for the environment, and lithium-ion batteries, which occasionally burst into flames. 'Our new battery won't catch fire, even if you drill through it.' Aluminium is cheap and has a low flammability coupled with a high-charge storage capacity. The aluminium battery was created at Stanford University. It consists of  a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte. These sit inside a flexible polymer-coated pouch. And while lithium-ion batteries can take hours to charge, the new battery has 'unprecedented charging times' of down to one minute. Unlike other prototypes which die after just 100 charges, the Stanford battery can also withstand more than 7,500 cycles without any loss of capacity. It is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries, and can't catch fire like lithium-ion technology. At present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity, the highest achieved yet with aluminium.' But the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of lithium-ion technology. But scientists have struggled to make a commercially viable aluminium-ion battery because of the difficulty in finding materials capable of producing sufficient voltage after repeated cycles of charging and discharging. The aluminum-ion battery consists of two electrodes - a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte. These sit inside a flexible polymer-coated pouch. Stanford graduate student Ming Gong added: 'The electrolyte is basically a salt that's liquid at room temperature, so it's very safe. 'Lithium-ion batteries can be a fire hazard. 'In our study, we have videos showing that you can drill through the aluminium battery pouch, and it will continue working for a while longer without catching fire. 'But lithium batteries can go off in an unpredictable manner in the air, the car or in your pocket. Besides safety, we have achieved major breakthroughs in aluminium battery performance.' And while lithium-ion battery can take hours to charge, the new battery has 'unprecedented charging times' of down to one minute. Unlike other prototypes which die after just 100 charges, the Stanford battery can also withstand more than 7,500 cycles without any loss of capacity. By comparison, a typical lithium-ion battery lasts about 1,000 cycles. Mr Gong continued: 'Another feature of the aluminum battery is flexibility. The battery consists of a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte. These sit inside a flexible polymer-coated pouch. It can also withstand more than 7,500 cycles without any loss of capacity . At present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity, the highest achieved yet with aluminium.'But the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of lithium-ion (stock image) 'You can bend it and fold it, so it has the potential for use in flexible electronic devices. Aluminium is also a cheaper metal than lithium.' At present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity, the highest achieved yet with aluminium.' But the researchers explained the battery has a limited voltage, compared to existing technology. 'Our battery produces about half the voltage of a typical lithium battery,' Professor Dai said: . 'But improving the cathode material could eventually increase the voltage and energy density. 'Otherwise, our battery has everything else you'd dream that a battery should have: inexpensive electrodes, good safety, high-speed charging, flexibility and long cycle life. I see this as a new battery in its early days. It's quite exciting.'","The flexible aluminium battery was created at Stanford University .

"Christian migrants from Africa have spoken of making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to escape beheading from Islamic State fanatics in Libya. A group of Eritrean refugees told how they were forced to deny their faith or face death at the hands of Islamist gunmen who patrol the towns and beaches of the North African state searching for 'infidels'. Haben, 19, told MailOnline: 'We are Christians but we had to deny our faith otherwise the gunmen would kill us, slit our throats and cut off our heads.' He and his brother Samuel, 14, arrived in Sicily a week ago, just days before around 900 people died when their boat capsized during the same dangerous journey from Libya - one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. Scroll down for video . Migrants: Eritrean refugees Haben (left) and his younger brother Samuel made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to escape beheading from Islamic State fanatics . Haben said his friends had been shot dead by armed ISIS terrorists who patrol the anarchy-ridden towns and beaches of the country. He told MailOnline: 'I have friends - from Eritrea and Egypt - who were killed because they are Christians. 'The men come around with Kalashnikov and they ask you what is your faith. 'If you are Christian they take you away and kill you. They cut off your head or shoot you. This is what they have done to hundreds of Christians.' Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing Libya as extremists  take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country. With ISIS having established strongholds in the towns on Sirte and Derna, and with smaller bases elsewhere in the country, fear of capture and execution at the hands of the radical Islamists is driving the desperate migrants to leave Libya as quickly as they can, dangerously overloading vessels. Only yesterday, Ethiopian officials revealed that the 30 Christians filmed being beheaded and shot by Islamic State militants in Libya were likely to have been desperate migrants trying to reach Europe and even Britain. The 29-minute video released on Sunday is titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', and shows dozens of militants butchering two separate groups of men in the north African country. (l-r) Haben, Aman, Tesfalem and Samuel set off on the perilous sea journey across the Med Sea last week . Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in boats launched from Libya . Local residents and rescue workers help a woman after a boat carrying migrants sank off the island of Rhodes, southeastern Greece yesterday . Haben and his brother Samuel, 14,  risked their lives in hope of a brighter future in Europe. The teenagers were able to keep their faith hidden, concealing the polished wooden crosses they wear around their necks underneath thick clothes. But other Eritrean Christians told MailOnline they were forced to deny their faith to stay alive. Aman, 18, said: 'I had a wooden cross but I had to throw it away to keep my life. The gunmen came around looking for Christians. They said they would kill the infidels, so I cut my cross off my neck and threw it away. 'I speak Arabic so I pretended that I was not a Christian, that I pray to their God, and they believed me.' Aman, together with Haben, Samuel and another Eritrean Tesfalem, who are all followers of the Coptic Orthodox Church - the main Christian Church in Egypt which has members worldwide - set off on the perilous sea journey across the Mediterranean last week. Refugee route: Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing Libya as extremists take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country . The 29-minute video released on Sunday is titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', and shows dozens of militants butchering two separate groups of men in the north African country . Thirty Ethiopian Christians appear to have been beheaded and shot by ISIS in a sickening new propaganda video.  Above, at least 16 men are marched down a beach in Libya by militants before they are killed . Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in boats launched from Libya. Aman, speaking from Mineo which is a temporary home to around 4,000 people, said: 'We paid $2000 each for a place in a boat. The boat left Libya and we were in the sea for two days before we were rescued. 'We were taken to the port and then to a camp with other refugees. 'But we won't stay here. We are going to Rome and then other countries. We want to work and make a hood life.' Haben said he fled his homeland after he was conscripted into the army - an ordeal that can last up to 30 years in this authoritarian state in the Horn of Africa. The country has been likened to African version of North Korea, led by President Isaias Afewerki. Most of the adults living in Eritrea face conscription or compulsory labour. The other migrants were sent by their families in the hope they could lead a better life - an education and good jobs - than is impossible in the isolated nation state. Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centres after landing in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily . As well as the spread of ISIS in the country, Libya is currently in a state of civil war - with two rival governments controlling and operating in different areas of the country. People smugglers are taking advantage of the subsequent chaos and confusion tearing the country apart to ply their trade with little to no threat of being caught. In 2015 there have already been 30 times more migrants dying off the coast of Libya than in 2014 - which was itself a record-breaking year. Last week, Christian refugees  revealed how they linked arms to form a 'human chain' in a desperate bid to stop Muslim migrants throwing them into the sea after an argument about religion. A group of 15 men were arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate' earlier this month after 12 Christians from Ghana and Nigeria were allegedly thrown off a rubber dinghy into the Mediterranean Sea. Survivors from the boat, made up of 105 migrants from diverse religions and ethnicities, have now claimed the men tried to throw other Christians off the side of the vessel after an argument about religion - but were prevented because they huddled together to create a human chain. Born out of the Iraqi War in 2003, Islamic State's deadly grip has stretched across the Middle East and into northern-Africa where today, only the Mediterranean Sea separates the militants from Europe. It has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya while building a terrifying support structure in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria. New ground: ISIS has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya (pictured) while building a terrifying support structure in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria . Europe's doorstep: Islamic State has now gained control of a number of Libyan coastal towns including Benghazi, Sirte, Derna and Nofilia . ISIS commands 31,500 loyal fighters according to the CIA but a commander of the Kurdish fighters who battled the extremists told the Independent on Sunday that they number closer to 200,000. Its growth in power and territory has been staggering since 2004 when it was known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). The group played a prominent role in the violent insurgency against the US and British occupation of Iraq after toppling Saddam Hussein's rule in 2003. After a string of bombings and murders over the next two years, its membership grew to around 1,000 according to the Washington Monthly. AQI then merged with its Mujahideen Shura Council allies in October 2006 to form the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). During the Iraq War which took place between 2006 and 2008, ISI had strongholds in Mosul, Baghdad, Al-Anbar and Diyala and commanded between 1,000 and 2,500 soldiers by late 2012. When it expanded into Syria in April 2013, it finally transformed into the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria (ISIS) as it exists today. Islamic State has now self-proclaimed the Syrian city of Raqqa as its capital, although there have been reports of increased defections. It was once a rebel group defying the British and US occupation of Iraq. Now other extremists across the Middle East and northern-Africa are pledging allegiance to it. Terrorist organisations inside Libya such as Ansar al-Sharia - which has taken control of Benghazi and declared its own Islamic state - also announced its alliance with ISIS in 2014.","Christian migrants speak of making the journey across Med to escape ISIS .

"The remains of high school teacher and bride-to-be Stephanie Scott have been formally identified. The 26-year-old's burned body was found around five metres from a road in Cocoparra National Park, north of Griffith, NSW, on Friday afternoon by police in an area where her accused killer went on regular camping trips. NSW Health says a post-mortem has been completed at Glebe Morgue in Sydney and a report is in the hands of the coroner. 'Additional testing is being undertaken prior to the release of Ms Scott’s body to her family,' a spokeswoman said. The Department of Forensic Medicine has made contact with Ms Scott's family to provide specialist grief counselling. Scroll down for video . The body of Stephanie Scott, pictured with her mother on a wine tour for her hen party last month in Canberra, has been formally identified after an autopsy was carried out this week . The adored teacher from Leeton went missing on Easter Sunday while preparing to go marry her fiancé Aaron Leeson-Woolley (left) On Monday, Ms Scott's devastated father opened up about the grief her family is feeling as they struggle to come to terms with their daughter's brutal murder, which took place just days before her wedding. The adored English and drama teacher disappeared from Leeton, a town in the Riverina region of NSW, approximately 550 km west of Sydney, on Easter Sunday while making final preparations for her honeymoon to Tahiti. Ms Scott's grieving father Robert explained that it is especially painful that Stephanie's life has been taken away when she had so much to look forward to. She was also a person who gave so much joy to others. 'Stephanie's aim was to get everyone feeling like it was their wedding as much as hers,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph, describing Ms Scott's bubbly and thoughtful personality. There are reminders of the wedding all over the house, yet instead of a wedding the Scott family must tragically prepare for Stephanie's funeral. 'You walk around the house and there's so many little things she planned for the wedding,' said Mr Scott. Ms Scott's grieving father Robert explained that it is especially painful that Stephanie's life has been taken away when she had so much to look forward to . 'You walk around the house and there's so many little things she planned for the wedding,' said Mr Scott (left, pictured with Stephanie's mother and one of her sisters) A guest list of 120 people had been invited to Stephanie and her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley's wedding at the picturesque Eat Your Greens venue . The venue in Eugowra, pictured the day their wedding was scheduled to take place. It was decorated by loved ones with yellow balloons and flowers to pay tribute to murder victim Stephanie Scott . 'That's the most devastating thing — they're not going to be used.' Ms Scott was incredibly excited for her wedding day to her childhood sweetheart, Aaron Leeson-Woolley and had put a great deal of time and thought into making the big day perfect. The ceremony was due to go ahead on Saturday April 11 - however cruelly the day before her remains were discovered by police. Ms Scott and Mr Leeson-Woolley had been taking dancing lessons together to prepare for their first dance as an excited married couple, according to Robert. But the moment when Mr Leeson-Woolley should have been holding his new bride during their planned first dance to a Keith Urban song, he was inconsolable at his fiancée's memorial. Police were lead to the place where Stephanie Scott's remains were found, by the family of her accused killer . The happy couple, Aaron Leeson-Woolley and Stephanie Scott (both pictured right), had sent out invites for their wedding day which was supposed to be held on Saturday . The high school where she worked turned into a memorial site after it emerged Ms Scott had been murdered . Ms Scott's father says he has been contemplating the afterlife since Ms Scott's shocking death, but is confident that his beautiful, sweet daughter is in 'the best possible place' after living a life full of love and happiness. 'When you die I don't know what happens really, but you leave this body and our spirit is what goes on,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph. 'She had plenty of spirit so, whatever happens, she should be in the best place possible because she had one of the best spirits you've ever come across.'

'When you die I don't know what happens really, but you leave this body and our spirit is what goes on,' Mr Scott (far left) said . Mr Scott paid tribute to his daughter, remembering her joyful childhood from her birth in Sydney, early childhood in Sydney's St Clair and time on the land from the age of nine, living in Canowindra. She loved her family, drama, soccer and school - eager for every opportunity to learn. It comes after local Leeton parents expressed anger over the loss of their children's 'favourite teacher' as the town continues to mourn the death of Stephanie Scott. Stephanie Scott was a 'favourite teacher' to many students at Leeton High School . A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their children. 'Well said, my daughter has lost her favourite teacher, and she will never be the same,' wrote Glenda Goolagong. Meanwhile Jodie Salerno posted: 'Stephanie was my son and 2 daughters favourite teacher at leeton high this ... has put so much pain and sadness on our comunity [sic].' Ms Salerno told The Australian her three children 'don't want to return' to school because they are so upset over Ms Scott's death. Detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer. School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday. NSW Police will get in contact with their counterparts in the Netherlands to determine if the accused 24-year-old murderer had any relevant history there, AAP reports. Stanford has reportedly been uncooperative with investigators. Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW police for comment. A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their children . Her body was discovered on Friday evening around 5pm in Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW . A policeman stands at a blocked off road in Cocoparra National Park near to the area where Ms Scott's body was found . One of the last actions of Ms Scott was to send an email to the bus company hired for her wedding, confirming transportation for guests. When police discovered the charred remains of Ms Scott's body around 5pm on Friday, after they were directed to Cocoparra National Park  by  Stanford's family, they allegedly found a gasoline can nearby. It is understood Stanford was familiar to the area and went on regular camping trips to the national park  on many occasions with his family.

On Saturday, the day Ms Scott was due to marry fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley, a memorial was held . Aaron Leeson-Woolley was comforted by friends and family at the heartbreaking service at the weekend . In a poignant move, the memorial service took place at the same time as when her wedding ceremony was due to take place. Her father Robert Scott spoke to the gathered mourners on behalf of his family and friends who were united in their grief on Saturday at Mountford Park in Leeton. The 26-year-old was last seen on Easter Sunday, when her disappearance sparked a widespread search for the much-loved teacher. 'Stephanie was a bright, intelligent and fun-loving woman who has impacted on many people here today,' Mr Scott said at his daughter's memorial on Saturday. 'Our wishes for the future are that this stays in your minds and you remember her. 'I'm sure she'd wish for that to be the case and you could remember her for the great little girl she was.' Ms Scott's grief-stricken fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley was too upset to take the stage, but was supported by loved ones to release yellow balloons into the air to commemorate her life.

"A police crime commissioner is facing investigation after awarding more than half a million pounds of taxpayers' money to the charity she runs alongside the force's chief. Vera Baird donated £500,000 to Victims First Northumbria, a charity which supports crime victims in her area and of which she is a director. Sitting alongside her on the organisation's top table is Sue Sim, Northumbria's Chief Constable, records revealed. The pair now face a Ministry of Justice probe as critics accuse them of concocting 'a soap opera' within the force. Vera Baird, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, faces a Ministry of Justice investigation after allocating more than £500,00 of public money to a charity of which she is the director . Sitting alongside Ms Baird on Victims First Northumbria's top table is Chief Constable Sue Sim. The pair are pictured together, above . It comes after the Home Secretary implemented a rule allowing PCCs to commission services for victims of crime. Last month Ms Baird boasted of the securing of funds for the charity in an article on its website. 'From April 1, I become responsible for some victims’ services after funding was devolved by the Ministry of Justice to PCCs,' she wrote. A Northumbria Police spokesman said the funds would be allocated 'in the same manner that Victim Support were directly funded by the MOJ'. But critics have described her selection of charity as 'inappropriate' and a conflict of interest. Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs committee, said: 'Northumbria police appears to have developed its own soap opera. 'It is totally inappropriate for a PCC to set up any organisation in which they have an interest of whatever kind using public money.' In an article on the charity's website, Ms Baird boasted of securing the funds from the public purse last month . Mrs Sim shot to prominence within the force over her handling of the hunt for Raoul Moat in 2010. She is pictured above with Deputy Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson at a press conference following his death . Adding the fact that Chief Constable Sue Sim was 'wrong', Mr Vaz said commissioners should never have been given the ability to allocate public funds to charity. 'The Home Secretary should never have given these powers.' Ms Baird stood by her decision today, telling MailOnline: 'All Ministry of Justice procedures and protocols were adhered to. Keith Vaz accused the force of creating its own 'soap opera' 'I am confident the team of coordinators will show that the decisions taken to create Victims First Northumbria were the right ones.' Mrs Sim has already announced that she will be retiring from the force in June. She was previously accused of bullying staff and faced an investigation that was spearheaded by Ms Baird, her co-director at Victims First Northumbria. A Ministry of Justice spokesman confirmed it would investigate the circumstances to conclude whether any conflict of interest rules had been broken. 'The MoJ requires PCCs not to be subject to conflicts of interest when providing victims services and has the power to investigate any possible conflict of interest and to cease funding if such a conflict is established.' Victims First Northumbria was established after the number of people contacting its predecessor, Victim Support, plummeted. But sources say many may be reluctant to confide in a service that is partly run by Mrs Sim who faced misconduct proceedings over alleged workplace bullying before announcing her retirement last week. The police chief who shot to prominence after her handling of the Raoul Moat manhunt in 2010, said she was stepping down to spend more time with her family. Ms Baird praised her 'passion and enthusiasm', adding: 'Sue and I have worked well together over the two-and-a-half years since I became police and crime commissioner.'","Vera Baird has allocated £500,000 to be given to Victims First Northumbria .

"A handwritten book containing notes and calculations made by Alan Turing while he worked on decoding Enigma  has been sold at auction for £700,000. The 56-page document, believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript in existence, was written in 1942 at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire. The notebook, in which he details his work on the foundations of mathematical notation and computer science, was sold for $1,025,000 (£698,000) in a Fine Books & Manuscripts Sale at Bonhams in New York on Monday. Scroll down for video . Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . A handwritten notebook in which Britain's Enigma machine genius Alan Turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $1million (£690,000). Above, he wrote that the Leibniz notation was 'extremely difficult' Turing is best known for his contribution to cracking the code used by the Germans in their Enigma machines during the Second World War while working at at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire. He is often said to be the father of modern computing and artificial intelligence. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said: 'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The 56-page book bought in Cambridge contains Turing's thoughts on the clearly tricky 'Leibniz notation dx/dy'. 'I find [it] extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one I understood the best once!' he wrote. Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' Prior to the sale, Andrew Hodges, a leading Turing scholar, said: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value. 'This notebook shines extra light on how, even when he was enmeshed in great world events, he remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' But Turing died from cyanide poisoning in 1954, generally thought to have been an act of suicide as a consequence of the hormone treatment he was undergoing as an alternative to imprisonment for his homosexuality. Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologised on behalf of the British Government in 2009 for the way Turing had been treated and he was granted a posthumous pardon in 2013. It will be sold by Bonhams in New York on Monday. It said the seller wished to remain anonymous. Part of the proceeds will be donated to charity. Cassandra Hatton, senior specialist in Fine Books and Manuscripts and the History of Science at Bonhams, said: ""This is a wonderful result and a fitting testament to Alan Turing's impact and legacy. 'It has been a great privilege to have been involved in this sale and we are immensely pleased that all the people who bid for this unique item and indeed the wider public have recognised Turing's importance and place in history.' Bonhams said a rare three-rotor German Enigma Enciphering Machine sold at the same auction for a world record price of 269,000 dollars (£183,000). A portion of the proceeds from Bonhams and the vendor will be donated to charity, the auctioneers said.","Notebook written by Alan Turing during World War II sold for £700,000 .

"A 32-year-old English teacher admitted in court Thursday that she had sex with a 16-year-old student, in a forgiving plea deal that gets her out of serving any prison time or having to register as a sex offender. Former Destrehan High School teacher Shelley Dufresne was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends at the St Charles Parish, Louisiana school that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house. Scroll down for video . 'Free' woman: Shelley Dufresne, 32, confessed in court Thursday to having sex with a 16-year-old English student in exchange for a plea deal that gets her out of prison time. The married mother-of-three pictured above leaving the St Charles Parish Courthouse on Thursday . Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana. The charges she settled Thursday had to do with sex acts she and the 16-year-old committed at a residence in that town . Both towns fall under different parishes, and Jefferson Parish has yet to formally arraign Dufresne on charges of carnal knowledge with a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a child. It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities. However, she had to spend 8pm to 7am inside her home during the weekdays. Both Dufresne and Respess were suspended from their jobs without pay following their arrests last fall.","Shelley Dufresne was arrested in September when a student at the high school she taught at started bragging about sleeping with two teachers .

"Apple is thought to have sold more than one million of its smartwatches in the first 24 hours it was available for pre-order. But UK buyers who are prepared to wait to get their hands on the eagerly anticipated wearable may want to snap up an Apple Watch on holiday, because Britain is the most expensive place in the world to buy one. The most expensive Edition model costs up to £2,500 more in the UK compared to elsewhere in the world, while at the lower end of the scale British buyers pay up to £63 more for the Sport model. Britain is the most expensive place in the world in buy the Apple Watch. The three models are pictured above. The Sport, shown left is round £63 more expensive in the UK than the US and there is a difference in price of over £1,230 when it comes to the luxurious Watch Edition (right) The gadget is available to pre-order in nine countries. The cheapest model is the 38mm Sport version and costs £299 in the UK. In the US, the same model costs $349, but this doesn't include sales tax. Sales tax in the US depends on the region where the product is sold, but as an example California has one of the highest rates - at 9% - while Montana has zero. With both of these sales taxes added to the price of the Sports model in the US, the total cost works out at $380.41 (£257) and $349 (£236) in the respective states. This is a difference of £42 when bought in California, compared to the UK, and £63 when compared to Montana. The effect is magnified for the top-of-the-range Edition version, which costs from £8,000 for the 38mm model in Britain, compared to a starting price of $10,000 in the US. At the time of writing, $10,000 converts to £6,769 - which equates to a difference of £1,231 before charges are taken into account. The most expensive version of the 38mm edition in the UK is £13,500 in the UK, and $17,000 in the US. When sales taxes are added to the US model, the price rises to $18,530 in California, which converts to £12,543 - a difference of £957. All prices shown in the table above are for the most expensive option in each model and region. Prices also include all relevant sales taxes. Beneath each foreign price is the conversion rate in GBP. In the US, California was chosen because it has one of the highest sales taxes at 9%, while Montana was chosen for the opposite end of the scale because it doesn't have a sales tax. Quebec in Canada has one of the highest sales taxes at 15%, while Alberta has one of the lowest at 5%. Prices and conversions were correct at the time of writing. But the difference isn't just visible between the UK and US. In Australia, for example, the most expensive 38mm Edition costs $21,000 AUD, which converts to £10,832 - a difference of around £2,665 compared to the UK. In fact, during MailOnline investigations the UK price for all three models of the watch, in both sizes with all sales taxes included, still works out more expensive in all the other regions where the watch is currently available for pre-order. The only places the Watch works out cheaper in the UK is when it's compared to the most expensive 42mm Edition model in Australia and China, or the 38mm Edition in Quebec and China. Explaining the price differences, Apple told MailOnline: 'UK prices include VAT. US prices don't include sales tax.' Sales tax is calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the  tax rate, which varies widely by jurisdiction, and ranges from zero to around 15 per cent in Canada. The gadget is now available in nine countries, with the cheapest model – the 38mm Sport version costing £299 in the UK. Here, Apple Watch fans in Beijing looking at the devices behind glass and on a display stand . The Apple Watch will go on sale in Apple shops and selected department stores on April 24. It will initially be available in Europe, China, Australia, Canada, Japan and America. It comes in three different versions - Sport, Watch and Edition - with each one made from different materials, such as anodized aluminium, stainless steel and 18 karat yellow or rose gold. Customers can choose either a 38mm or 42mm face, with an estimated battery of around 18 hours. These price discrepancies don't just apply to Apple products, however. MailOnline recently compared prices for the Sony PlayStation 4, GoPro Hero4 Silver edition action camera, Samsung Galaxy Gear 2 Neo in black and the Apple iPad Air 2. The US is also the cheapest place to buy the 38mm Apple Watch, where it costs $549 (£366) - £110 cheaper than in the UK where it’s on sale for £479. The watch has already gone on display in  Apple stores across these regions, as well as in Galeries Lafayette in Paris (pictured), Isetan in Tokyo and Selfridges in London . Prices were compared on both the UK and US Amazon sites, plus PC World in the UK and Best Buy in the US – with all taxes and VAT included. At the time of the research, the PlayStation 4 cost £327 from Amazon UK and £349 from PC World. This was compared to $435 in the US, which converts to £272. For the GoPro Hero 4 camera, prices were closer between the two countries, but UK customers still paid up to £17 more for the device. In terms of the Samsung Gear 2 Neo, prices ranged from £135 ($216) on the American Amazon site up to £190 on its UK equivalent. And Apple’s price discrepancy doesn’t just apply to its own store. Customers buying the Apple iPad Air 2 from other retailers pay £399 in the UK at PC World, compared to £340 ($544) at Best Buy in the US.

"Backache is striking us younger than ever – with almost half of the under-30s saying they are battling constant pain. Experts blame increasingly sedentary lifestyles and an obsession with mobile phones for a sharp rise in the number of young people with back and neck problems. And they warn that children as young as 12 are seeking treatment. As gadgets get smaller, users lean over them more, putting the neck and shock-absorbing discs that cushion the vertebrae under added pressure . Some 45 per cent of the under-30s surveyed for the British Chiropractic Association said they had a painful back or neck – up from 28 per cent last year. Across all age groups, 86 per cent said it was a problem – compared with 77 per cent last year. Almost one in four said that they are in pain on a daily basis. Chiropractors blame the increase on days and nights spent sitting hunched over mobile phones and tablet computers. Rishi Loatey, a chiropractor in North-West London, sees patients who are still at school, including some as young as 12. He said working on laptops and tablets rather than desktop computers, as well as using mobile phones, can affect posture and put the back under extra strain. As gadgets get smaller, users lean over them more, putting the neck and shock-absorbing discs that cushion the vertebrae under added pressure. The fashion for hot-desking, in which office workers don't have an assigned desk of their own, adds to the problem because the chair is not adjusted to suit them. The survey of more than 2,100 Britons aged 16-plus also revealed just how sedentary modern life is. Almost two-thirds said they spend most of their working day sitting. And the average Briton spends almost three hours in front of the TV each evening. In all, we typically spend ten hours a day sitting. Chiropractor Tim Hutchful of the BCA said: 'We're seeing a rise in the number of people experiencing back and neck-related problems because our modern lifestyle is forcing us to stay seated and I'm concerned that the number of patients under the age of 30 coming through our doors is increasing. 'Whether at your desk, on your tablet or watching TV, it's really important to take breaks to relieve the build-up of tension in your back.'","Some 45 per cent of under 30s surveyed said they had painful back or neck .

"One of America's greatest poets was honored by the US Postal Service in a star-studded ceremony on Tuesday. Maya Angelou, the acclaimed author of such classics as I Know Why the Cage Bird Sings and On the Pulse of Morning, which she read at Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993, was issued a Forever stamp in honor of her many achievements and contributions. First Lady Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey were just two of the big names in attendance for the unveiling which gave the public a first look at the stamp, which features a picture of Angelou's face and one of her many memorable quotes. The problem however, is that the featured quote came from another author. Scroll down for video . A quote attributed to Maya Angelou on her commemorative stamp released by the US Postal Service is actually that of another writer . The stamp was unveiled Tuesday at an event featuring First Lady Michelle Obama and Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan (above) Maya Angelou, the acclaimed author of such classics as I Know Why the Cage Bird Sings and On the Pulse of Morning, was issued the Forever stamp for her contributions to the arts and this country . 'A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song,' reads the stamp, a quote that has long been attributed to Angelou, with President Obama even using the famous line as he honored the poet at the 2013 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal. What's more, The Washington Post found proof of an interview in which Angelou herself used the quote. Joan Walsh Anglund wrote in her 1967 book A Cup of Sun; 'A bird doesn’t sing because he has an answer, he sings because it has a song.' A few years before this quote first appeared though in 1969 with the publication of Angelou's aforementioned autobiography I Know Why the Cage Bird Sings, it was used in a children's book by another American author. Joan Walsh Anglund, now 89, wrote in her 1967 book A Cup of Sun; 'A bird doesn’t sing because he has an answer, he sings because it has a song.' In a statement released shortly after the origin of the quote was revealed, Postal Service spokesperson Mark Saunders said; 'The Postal Service used her widely recognized quote to help build an immediate connection between her image and her 1969 nationally recognized autobiography, ‘I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.' Saunders later added in an email to the Post that had they been aware of this fact they would have selected another of Angelou's famous lines. Angelou, who was born into poverty, holding down jobs as a fry cook, singer, and at one point even a prostitute, passed away last May. She was 86-years-old at the time, and had written, among other works, seven autobiographies, countless poems, and numerous scripts for theater, television and film. She also continued to teach throughout her life, spending the last four decades of her life as a professor at Wake Forest in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. As for Anglund, she seems remarkably nonplussed about the entire incident. 'I think it easily happens sometimes that people hear something, and it’s kind of going into your subconscious and you don’t realize it,' she explained. There are no plans to remove the limited edition stamp at this time .","A quote attributed to Maya Angelou on her commemorative stamp released by the US Postal Service is actually that of another writer .

"A second cruise has docked in San Diego with a massive outbreak of the noxious norovirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhea. Royal Caribbean's Legend of the Seas reported 135 passengers took ill before it docked Tuesday. Just one day prior, the Celebrity Infinity cruise liner docked in the Southern California city with 106 sick. Both ships are owned by Royal Caribbean. The Legend of the Seas was carrying 1,763 passengers and 747 crew on 15-night cruise from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Scroll down for video . The Legend of the Seas docked on Tuesday with 135 sick passengers aboard - the second Royal Caribbean ship infected in two days . The Celebrity Infinity, which docked Monday, reported 106 people who had fallen ill with norovirus . Crews immediately got to work scrubbing down and sanitizing both ships. Norovirus can live on surfaces for weeks, meaning other passengers could also be infected . The Celebrity Inifity, which carried 2,117 passengers and 964 crew, sailed the same path from Florida through the Mexican Riviera. One of the passengers on the Legend of the Seas, Brooke Fagan, described a day of horrible gastrointestinal problems aboard the ship. 'I ended up feeling very very sick, very lethargic, very run-down. couldn't really get out of bed. Ended up throwing up and just had major issues all day,' she told KFMB-TV. Fagan believes the virus came from the ship's port of call in Guatemala. She says she fell ill shortly after that stop. The crew aboard the Legend of the Seas quarantined 15 people who fell ill to their staterooms for 48 hours. Norovirus is an extremely contagious virus from contaminated water or food that can live on surfaces for weeks. It causes severe gastrointestinal distress. After both ships docked, crews went to work scrubbing down every inch of the cabins and common rooms. The CDC, which is investigating the matter, said: 'One CDC Vessel Sanitation Program environmental health officer and one epidemiologist have boarded the ship in San Diego, CA on April 13, 2015 to conduct an environmental health assessment and evaluate the outbreak and response activities. Both ships sailed from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to San Diego for 15-night cruises. The Celebrity Infinity is pictured here . 'Specimens have been collected and have been tested by CDC to determine the causative agent for this outbreak is norovirus.' The CDC also sent a crew aboard the Legend of the Seas. In a statement sent to Daily Mail Online, Celebrity Cruises said: 'Those affected by the short-lived illness responded well to over-the-counter medication being administered onboard the ship,' the company said. 'During the sailing, we took a number of steps to prevent the transmission of the illness, including implementing enhanced cleaning procedures and protocols, and using special cleaning products and disinfectants that are proven to kill norovirus to clean throughout the ship. 'Additionally, when Celebrity Infinity arrived to San Diego, California, today, we began an extensive and thorough sanitizing onboard the ship and within the cruise terminal, to help prevent any illness from affecting the subsequent sailing.' The statement continued 'Also, all guests will receive a letter at boarding that asks if they have experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms within the last three days. Similarly, if any guest is uncomfortable taking their cruise, for reasons related to personal health or otherwise, our staff assisted them in rescheduling their sailing for another time.'

"Marc Carn, 29, from Plymouth, has been found safe and well after going missing during a stag do in Barcelona . A British father who vanished during a stag do in Barcelona was forced to walk for 20 hours after his taxi driver dumped him outside the Spanish city - and told him to find his own way home. Marc Carn, from Plymouth, Devon, was drinking in an Irish bar with ten friends near to Las Ramblas on Saturday night when he suddenly disappeared. After he failed to turn up for his flight back home, Mr Carn's worried family contacted the Foreign Office in a bid to track him down. They said his disappearance was completely out of character and feared he would miss the first birthday of his twins Freddie and Stanley. But the phoneless 29-year-old today handed himself into the British Consulate - having walked for two days to try and get back to Barcelona. According to his family, Mr Carn, who runs his own building company, was dropped 'miles away' from his accommodation by the Spanish driver when he tried to get back to his hotel on Saturday night. He then set off to try and find his friends - and only arrived at the British Consulate this afternoon. Speaking after he was found, Anna Harvey, the sister of Mr Carn's 31-year-old partner Emma, said the family was 'ecstatic' that he was safe. She said: 'He got into a taxi and the driver took him miles away from where he was staying. 'When he said at the end of the journey this was not his accommodation he was chucked out of the cab and has spent the last two days walking back to Barcelona. He has just walked in to the British Consulate to say he was stranded.' She added that the family were not yet sure where he had been stranded but that it was 'miles' away from where he was staying. She said: 'He has been walking for about 20 hours. The message we had from him was quite garbled so at the moment we are not sure exactly where he was dumped, but it appears it was a very long way from where he should have been. 'He was stranded with no phone or money. My sister is so relieved and the family are ecstatic. None of us thought we would ever see him again. The father-of-four, pictured left and right with partner Emma Harvey, had last been seen by friends on Saturday night and failed to turn up for his flight back home from the Spanish city . Family and friends became concerned after not hearing from Mr Carn for more than 48 hours. They contacted the Foreign Office amid fears that he would miss the first birthday of his twins Stanley and Freddie (pictured) 'His friends are buying him a flight home tonight so he can be back in time for his twins boys' first birthday tomorrow.' Ms Harvey had previously told how two of the stag party group had stayed behind to help with the search for Mr Carn. They had last seen him in Flaherty's bar on Saturday night. She told how friends became worried when he did not make it back to the group's hotel and missed his flight home. She added that it is his sons' first birthday tomorrow, something which he would 'never miss'. Mr Carn handed himself into the British Consulate this afternoon, after walking for 20 hours to find safety. He is now being bought a flight home by friends so he can celebrate the twins' birthday tomorrow . She had said: 'He is not one to normally not get in contact. Emma last spoke to him when they had arrived on Friday night. 'He had planned to take the family to Paignton zoo for the twin's birthday and it was something they had been really looking forward to. 'We had joked about him missing his flight with that in mind - as we knew he never would.' In addition to the twins Freddie and Stanley, Mark has two step-children with Emma: Ava, 11, and Gwen, seven.","Marc Carn vanished while drinking with friends in Irish bar on Las Ramblas .

"A Ukip candidate was forced to apology after he appeared to mock the victims of the Mediterranean refugee crisis – just days after hundreds drowned. Peter Endean, who is standing for Nigel Farage's party in council elections, re-tweeted an image with a caption that said: 'Labour's new floating voters. Coming to a country near you soon'. Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in make-shift boats launched by people smugglers from Libya – with up to 950 perishing off the Italian island of Lampedusa over the weekend alone. Peter Endean has apologised for retweeting a message mocking victims of the Mediterranean refugee crisis . Mr Endean, who is seeking election in Plymouth, Devon, and is also UKIP's communications manager for the city, has apologise and claims he re-tweeted it by mistake. He said: 'I retweeted it by accident. It was not intentional and clearly a mistake. I apologise unreservedly.' Earlier, Ukip's deputy chair Suzanne Evans described the situation as a 'devastating tragedy', but insisted Britain needed to be careful not to 'encourage' fleeing refugees from moving to the UK. She said: 'We all want to welcome people here, but as idealistic as we might want to be - and it's in our nature to want to help everybody - you can't, unfortunately. That's the reality of it.' Asked how many refugees Britain should take, Ms Evans replied: 'We have got to be talking thousands rather than tens of thousands.' EU leaders including David Cameron will meet in Brussels on Thursday to discuss a 10-point plan, drawn up in response to growing crisis.

Coming to a country near you soon' Mr Endean apologised and claimed he re-tweeted it by mistake. He wrote: 'I retweeted it by accident. It was not intentional and clearly a mistake. I apologise unreservedly' Brussels wants a military mandate to seize and destroy people-smugglers' boats, backed by increased budgets for Frontex, which manages the borders of the 28-nation bloc. It comes after Mr Miliband this morning launched a furious attack on David Cameron and other EU leaders for leaving refugees to drown by stopping search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean. The Labour leader said it was unacceptable to abandon thousands of immigrants boarding makeshift boats in Africa in the hope of making it to Europe. He also called on the UK to take a 'fare share' of refugees fleeing civil war. Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in make-shift boats launched by people smugglers from Libya – with up to 950 perishing off the Italian island of Lampedusa over the weekend alone . EU leaders including David Cameron will meet in Brussels on Thursday to discuss a 10-point plan, drawn up in response to growing crisis - but Ed Miliband said the response had been inadequate . Mr Miliband's remarks came amid growing alarm over the number of desperate families risking their lives to escape the raging civil wars in the Middle East and North Africa. Speaking in Manchester this morning, Mr Miliband attacked the decision to abandon European rescue missions. He said: 'The original decision was a mistake and it should be reversed.' Mr Miliband said: 'The logic is we are leaving people to die because it is a pull factor. We are better than that. We can't be leaving people to drown.'","Peter Endean re-tweeted a message with an image of the fleeing refugees .

"Thousands of holidaymakers face up to three days of chaos and cancelled flights because of a strike by French air traffic controllers. EasyJet and BA are among a host of major airlines expected to scrap hundreds of flights thanks to the walk-out, which will start at 5am tomorrow and run for 48 hours - with considerable knock-on disruption expected. Experts fear up to half of all flights between the UK and France could be axed, depending on how strongly the strike holds. Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Families returning from their Easter holidays and those hoping for a last-minute break will be worst affected. EasyJet is cancelling 118 flights to and from France, including 10 which either start or finish at British airports. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet has been advised of planned industrial strike action by French air traffic control services on April 8 and government transport workers on April 9. Like all airlines flying to and from France, we expect significant impact to our flights during this period, including cancellations.' The cancelled services include return flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, Paris and Luton, Gatwick and Toulouse, plus flights between Gatwick and Spain. The airline urged all passengers going to France to check the status of their flight online before they travel. British Airways said it was cancelling around a dozen return flights from the UK. A  spokesman said: 'Early indications are that there will be significant disruption for all airlines who fly within, to and from France and who also use French airspace for over flights. 'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers flying to and from France as a result of the threatened air traffic control strike. 'Unfortunately there will be some knock-on delays to other parts of our short-haul network as a result of the strike action, given how much airspace in Europe will be affected. We are sorry for any disruption to customers' travel plans.' Flybe said it was cancelling 16 flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Adding to the possible chaos, tomorrow is the first day of a new regultion which forces travel operators to check the passports of all passengers leaving Britain and pass on their details to the Home Office. Chaos: Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs will be severely affected by the strike . The strike has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. European air traffic chiefs at Eurocontrol have also warned of 'a significant risk of disruption', with the number of flights from France's busiest airport down 40 per cent tomorrow and 50 per cent on Thursday. National carrier Air France, based at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, is expected to be hardest hit. Air France said up to 40 per cent of its medium haul flights to and from Paris CDG will be cancelled. Rregional subsidiary HOP! will axe two thirds of its flights to and from Orly airport, and 40 per cent of services at other French airports. Britain's National Air Traffic Services, which controls the airspace over the UK, said: 'We've spoken to our operational teams and much will depend on the severity of the strike and how the airlines choose to respond in terms of their schedules. 'If it follows previous patterns we can expect a lot of airlines requesting to re-route around French airspace. That shifts the traffic from our usually very busy south coast airspace sectors to the west (Lands End) and east (Clacton and Dover).' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation as strike action is classed as an 'unforeseen circumstance' outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. Ryanair said it was cancelling more than 250 flights with more likely, branding the strike 'grossly unfair'. Ryanair is cancelling more than 250 flights, with a spokesman branding the strike action as 'grossly unfair' A spokesman for the budget airline said: 'Ryanair regrets to inform customers that it has been forced to cancel over 250 flights on Wednesday due to a French Air Traffic Control strike. 'Further cancellations and delays are likely and customers should check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport on the Ryanair.com website, where the latest information will be published. We sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption. 'It's grossly unfair that thousands of European travellers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny number of French Air traffic Control workers. 'Ryanair said all affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options - full refund, free transfer onto next available flight or free transfer onto an alternative flight routing.'","Strike is set to begin at 5am tomorrow and continue for two days .

"Avid users of MSN Messenger and other instant messaging services that were popular before Facebook and Twitter will remember the ‘away’ message. And years after it was popular, Facebook is bringing back short updates in a new form – the ‘Sidebar status’. The feature lets users post a short message about what they are doing in a sidebar added to the social network’s mobile app, complete with an illustrative picture, but it's currently only available to selected people for testing. Facebook's Sidebar status feature (pictured) will let users post a short message about what they are doing in a sidebar added to the social network’s mobile app, complete with an illustrative picture . The sidebar can be accessed by swiping right on the screen and brings up a user’s most messaged friends. A Facebook spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Millions of people already use the sidebar to quickly find and contact their friends. ‘We're testing new features in this space that let you and your friends stay up to date on all the things that make up your day.’ The sidebar can be accessed by swiping right on the screen (news Feed pictured left) and brings up a user’s most messaged friends. Here, they can see short updates such as 'making blueberry scones at home' and 'watching the game at home' (right) Facebook has started collecting information about the other websites users visit, the links they click on and their searches. The social media site already harvests details people share on their profiles, including where they went to school, their interests and where they live. But under a new privacy policy – to which anyone who has signed into Facebook since February has been opted in automatically – it can track activity outside the website, including online searches and some of the details users share with retailers. A Facebook spokesman said: ‘It takes into account pages and places visited on Facebook, alongside browsing on the internet.’ She added that the changes help Facebook 'to better serve more relevant advertising to you.' The site uses cookies – small files which it places on your web browser or device – to collect information which can then be transmitted back to Facebook. The new terms were introduced as part of a wider update to Facebook's privacy policy, which - the social network claimed - was designed to make the rules easier to understand. Facebook is testing the service in Taiwan and Australia, where from today, users of the app will see short status messages under their friends’ names, The Verge reported. Users can choose from an array of small pictures, such as a bicycle or coffee cup, for example, to go with their status. As well as the addition of the images, the sidebar updates differ from a regular status updates because they don’t show up in the main News Feed. They can just be seen in the sidebar and expire after 12 hours – allowing only the person who posted them to access them again. While the updates are visible to friends, users can change the privacy settings to determine who sees an update. The comparison of the old ‘away’ messages has been drawn because of the small square images and the fact they will be sent to only close friends, despite the fact that we are rarely away from phones and computers now-a-days. For many people, Facebook’s main News Feed hosts information from a large number of contacts and brands as well as friends, and the social network has heard from its users that people want a place to see and share smaller updates too. The idea is that the sidebar is a quick way to keep friends in the loop of what a user is doing and vice versa.

"Ken Clarke has bemoaned the Tories' recent electoral performances, claiming the party has become 'too right-wing' to win an election outright . The Conservatives will not win this year's General Election because they have become 'too right-wing', former Chancellor Ken Clarke has said. The Tory MP bemoaned the Conservatives' recent electoral performances, complaining that they 'haven't been able to win an election for 23 years' as the party has 'become much too right-wing'. In a wide-ranging interview with the New Statesman magazine, Mr Clarke also warned against offering 'blank cheques' to the NHS and foreign aid budgets, and criticised the Tory leadership for making personal attacks on Ed Miliband. Mr Clarke, who has served under Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron, said: 'Most elections I fought the Conservative party had won. And now we haven't been able to win an election for 23 years. 'It's become much too right-wing. Which I hope David will continue to seek to redress in coming times.' Mr Clarke cautioned against signing up to 'blank cheques' to the NHS and foreign aid budgets. David Cameron has promised to protect the health, schools and foreign aid budgets again if he wins next month's election. But critics warn the move will place intense pressure on other departments like defence and policing, which will have to bear the brunt of planned cuts. Mr Clarke also took a swipe at Defence secretary Michael Fallon's claim last week that Mr Miliband would 'stab the country' in the back by ditching the Trident nuclear deterrent in the same way he had knifed his brother David during the Labour leadership campaign. 'Personally I disapprove of personal attacks on your opponents. I've never done that. I also think it costs you votes. If either side goes in for personal attacks on the other side.' Mr Clarke, who served four years in David Cameron's Cabinet, is known for his outspoken views, and is one of the few remaining Tory cheerleaders for the European Union. But his intervention remains an embarrassment for the Tory leadership in the run-up to the election. Jon Ashworth, Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: 'This is an embarrassing blow for a Tory campaign in chaos. Even David Cameron's own ministers recognise the Tories have failed working people and are now making desperate promises with no idea where the money is coming from.' Mr Clarke served four years in David Cameron's Cabinet and is one of the few remaining Tory cheerleaders for the European Union .","Tory MP Ken Clarke claims the party has become 'much too right-wing'

"The alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attack which left 166 dead has been released on bail, Pakistani officials revealed. Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi was allowed to leave Adiala Prison in Rawalpindi late on Thursday. His release was slammed with Indians calling it an 'insult' to the victims of the three-day onslaught, which was blamed on the banned Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Pakistani security personnel escort Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, as he leaves court after a hearing in Islamabad on January 1 . LeT's charitable wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), confirmed Lakhvi's release. A senior JuD official said: 'Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi has been released from jail. He is free now and in a secure place. We can't say exactly where he is at the moment for security reasons.' Another official said Lakhvi would receive a hero's welcome when he arrived at JuD headquarters. It comes after nearly four months of wrangling over Lakhvi's detention after a judge granted him bail in December, sparking an angry response from New Delhi. Pakistan's government slapped Lakhvi with a series of detention orders but judges repeatedly cancelled them. On Thursday the Lahore High Court ordered his release, conditional on a two million rupee (32,000 U.S. dollars or £22,000) bond. India has long seethed at Pakistan's failure either to hand over or prosecute those accused of planning and organising the Mumbai attacks. A spokesman for India's home ministry, who asked not to be named, condemned Lakhvi's release. They said: 'This is a very disappointing announcement. An insult to the victims of the 26/11 Mumbai attack. The global community should take serious note of Pakistan's double-speak on terrorism.' Pakistan foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasneem Aslam blamed India for delaying the case.

Debris and burnt out cars litter the street at the site of a blast in Coilaba, a market in downtown Mumbai on November 26, 2008 . The horror of the Mumbai carnage played out on live television as commandos battled around ten heavily armed gunmen, who arrived by sea on the evening of November 26, 2008. The gunmen carried out twelve coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days, and killing 166 people. They targeted guests at two five star hotels, a Jewish centre and commuters at the city's main railway station. It took the authorities three days to regain full control of the city. Nine of the gunmen were killed. She said: 'Inordinate delay in extending cooperation by India complicated the case and weakened the prosecution.' Lakhvi and six other suspects were charged in Pakistan - but their cases have made little progress in five years. Delhi has long accused Islamabad of prevaricating over the trials, while Pakistan has alleged that India failed to give it crucial evidence. Lakhvi's initial bail order in December prompted an angry response from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said it came as 'a shock to all those who believe in humanity'. Pakistani analyst Hasan Askari said he was at a loss to understand why the case had not been resolved. Map detailing the 2008 Mumbai attacks and a photo of Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the man suspected of organising them . He said: 'The government must settle this case once for all and face the international community. 'It's strange that this case has not been decided since 2009.' New Delhi has long said there is evidence that 'official agencies' in Pakistan were involved in plotting the attack. Islamabad denies the charge but JuD, seen as a front for the militant LeT and listed as a banned terror outfit by the United Nations, operates openly in the country. Pakistan has long been accused of playing a 'double game' with militants by supporting groups it thinks it can use for its own strategic ends, particularly in disputed Kashmir. Pakistan and India both control part of Kashmir but claim the whole of the territory and have fought two of their three wars over it since independence from Britain in 1947.","Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi allowed to leave Adiala Prison late on Thursday .

"A 21-year-old student died after taking a lethal dose of diet pills she bought online, her mother has claimed. Eloise Parry, known as Ella, 'burned up from the inside' after swallowing the highly-toxic substance known as Dinitrophenol, or DNP. After accidentally taking the lethal dose on April 12, she began feeling unwell at around lunchtime - and drove herself to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. Eloise Parry, known as Ella,  died after swallowing the highly-toxic substance known as DNP . Doctors carried out a toxicity test and discovered she was in grave danger as there is no antidote to DNP, which is toxic. Her metabolism began to soar and she started to overheat. Despite doctors desperately trying to stabilise her, she died just three hours later. Her mother Fiona, 51, has now issued a stark warning about buying diet pills online. In a heart-wrenching statement issued on her behalf by West Mercia Police, she said: 'Sunday started out cool and clear. 'By lunchtime there was a brisk wind, blowing in strong gusts that suggested a storm might be coming. 'Overhead the skies were bright blue, almost cloudless and full of promise. 'I didn't know it at the time, but Ella had bought slimming tablets on the internet. The substance in the pills Ella took is unsuitable for human consumption because of its toxicity . 'A substance called DNP that is unsuitable for human consumption because of its toxicity. 'She had taken even more of these ""slimming tablets"" than recommended on the pack and had no idea just how dangerous they really were. 'How many of us have ever thought ""If one tablet works, surely it won't hurt to take one or two more?""' She went on to explain that her daughter had driven herself to hospital and walked into A&E. As she was still completely lucid and seemed to be OK, she thought there was no danger. However, when the toxicity report came back it became clear how dire her situation was. Mrs Parry continued: 'The drug was in her system, there was no antidote, and she had taken a lethal dose. 'As Ella deteriorated, the staff in A&E did all they could to stabilise her. 'As the drug kicked in and started to make her metabolism soar, they attempted to cool her down, but they were fighting an uphill battle. 'She was literally burning up from within. When she stopped breathing, they put her on a ventilator and carried on fighting to save her. 'When her heart stopped they couldn't revive her.' She added that her daughter never intended to take her own life, she just didn't understand the danger of taking an overdose of the slimming tablets. Mrs Parry said: 'Most of us don't believe that a slimming tablet could possibly kill us. 'DNP is not a miracle slimming pill. It is a deadly toxin. It is similar to TNT in structure. 'TNT is an explosive. DNP causes your metabolism to run at an explosive level, with potentially fatal consequences.' The cause of Miss Parry's death will be confirmed by a coroner at a later date. Her mother Fiona said: 'She had taken even more of these ""slimming tablets"" than recommended on the pack and had no idea just how dangerous they really were' Miss Parry, of Shrewsbury, was in the middle of a Families and Childcare Studies degree at Glyndwr University when she died, and also volunteered for West Mercia Women's Aid and the YMCA. DNP is sold as a weight loss aid, but has been described as 'extremely dangerous to human health' by doctors. It is sold mostly over the internet under a number of different names but contains 2, 4-Dinitrophenol. It is marketed mainly to bodybuilders as a weight loss aid as it is thought to dramatically boost metabolism. The manufactured drug is yellow and odourless and was previously used as a herbicide and fungicide. It was launched as a slimming aid in the U.S. in the 1930s but then banned in 1938, due to the severe side-effects. Depending on the amount consumed, signs of acute poisoning could include nausea, vomiting, restlessness, flushed skin, sweating, dizziness, headaches, rapid respiration and irregular heart-beat, possibly leading to coma and death. Her mother said: 'She loved how exciting life could be; how new experiences offered up thrilling possibilities and a whole world of opportunities to be explored. 'It is such a great sadness that her life ended so soon, and, in many ways, ended before it had really had a chance to begin. 'There were so many things that she dreamed of doing - travelling, having a career and having a family - things that she never got a chance to experience. 'She will be greatly missed by everyone who knew her and it will be all the good memories of her that we will cherish as we go through the difficult weeks and months ahead.' Police are now investigating where Eloise purchased the pills, which cost around £70 for 100 capsules containing 200mg of DNP. Chief Inspector Jennifer Mattinson said: 'We are undoubtedly concerned over the origin and sale of these pills and are working with partner agencies to establish where they were bought from and how they were advertised. 'The coroner's report will establish the exact cause of Eloise's death but we urge the public to be incredibly careful when purchasing medicine or supplements over the internet. 'Substances from unregistered websites could put your health at risk as they could be extremely harmful, out-of-date or fake. 'An investigation is being carried out to find out where Eloise bought the pills and we ask anyone with any information that could help us to call 101. Miss Parry began feeling unwell at around lunchtime on April 12 after taking the huge dose - and drove herself to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. Despite attempts to save her, she died three hours later . 'We continue to support Eloise's family at this incredibly difficult time and our thoughts very much remain with them and Eloise's friends.' The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has offered the following information concerning the dangers posed by DNP. A spokesman said: 'We advise the public not to take any tablets or powders containing DNP, as it is an industrial chemical and not fit for human consumption. It can be extremely dangerous to human health.' Anyone who may have any information which could assist police in their investigation is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 369 of April 12. A spokesperson for Glyndwr University, where Miss Parry studied, said: 'Ella commenced the BA (Hons) Families and Childhood Studies programme at Glyndwr University in September 2013. 'She was a motivated group member who contributed enthusiastically to all modules, always championing the promotion of positive well-being for children and young people. 'Ella was a popular student with staff, peers, across the University and within placement. 'She always strived to do her best in everything and had great potential both academically and in practice. 'She will be sadly missed by us all. Our thoughts and condolences are with her family and friends at this sad time.'","Ella Parry took the pills on April 12 and began to feel unwell hours later .

"No warrant had been issued for Walter Scott's arrest when he ran from Officer Michael Slager moments before he was shot dead, it has been revealed. Court records show he was $7,500 behind on child support when he was pulled over on Saturday and had already been jailed three times for missing payments. His family believe the fear of being thrown back in prison was the reason he tried to flee during the deadly traffic stop. But there was nothing directing officers to bring him in to face a family court judge, despite the fact his last payment was only in 2012. Scroll down for video . Escape: Dashcam footage released on Thursday shows Walter Scott running away from his car minutes before he is shot dead by Officer Michael Sager. His family believed he fled over fears he would be arrested for being behind on child support payments . History: Scott had already been jailed three times over missed payments, but court records have revealed there was no warrant out for his arrest when he was pulled over. Minutes later he was shot dead . In 2008, after a traffic stop in which he was charged with an open-container violation and driving under suspension, he was sent to jail in Charleston for six months for failing to pay about $6,800. In 2011, bench warrants ordered deputies to bring him in, and Scott spent a night in jail when he was $7,500 behind. In 2012, he spent another night in jail when he owed $3,500. On Thursday a police dashboard camera video released Thursday shows Scott bolting from his Mercedes after he pulled over. The camera on Slager's patrol car captures him telling Scott his third brake light is broken, before asking him to produce insurance papers. Scott, who appears to be accompanied by a person in the passenger seat, explains he does not have any documents as he has yet to officially buy the car. 'I haven't bought it yet, I'm about to do that Monday.... My car is down,' he says. The officer appears calm, checks his licence, then tells him: 'I'll be right back with you.' When Slager returns to his vehicle, Scott flees, running towards the park where he would die moments later. Off camera, a scuffle can be heard, with shouts of 'Taser, Taser, Taser!' and 'Get on the ground!' Slager's account has been called into question after a shocking video taken by a witness shows the officer shooting Scott in the back. In the dash cam footage, captured from Slager's patrol car, the officer explains, 'The reason I've pulled you over is because your third brakelight is out.' The conversation is muffled, with music playing in Slager's car obscuring the sound. Horrifying: Scott was gunned down as he ran away from Sager, who has since been charged with his murder . Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was in the Coast Guard for two years, and is pictured left in uniform. Slager is being held in jail on murder charges, and is pictured right in his prison mugshot . He can be heard asking Scott for his licence, registration and insurance card. Scott responds that he doesn't have papers as he has not yet to bought the car. 'Alright let me see your licence,' Slager replies. 'So you don't have any papers in the glove pocket?' Scott repeats that he does not and he is paying for the car on Monday. Slager returns to his car. A minute later, Scott opens the door, and gestures to Slager, who shouts, 'you've got to stay in the car!' Scott then sits back inside the car - and moments later flees. The only other footage of the incident shows the moment Scott was shot. Released earlier this week, it begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.

"One in five American women are willing to undergo dangerous beauty treatments in order to achieve the ideal look, despite the risks that these procedures pose to their health. According to a new study, while just over half of women worry about the long term damage of beauty treatments, nearly a fifth would still pursue a treatment to get the right look - even it it proved hazardous to their health. Seven per cent, meanwhile, have actually had allergic reactions. The survey, conducted by beauty research organization LQS and Associates, looked at the lengths 1,000 American women go to in order to enhance their appearances or copy a celebrity, and the potentially disastrous consequences they might face in doing so, including hair loss, skin swelling, and overly painful procedures. The cost of beauty: Women often don't realize the dangers of salon treatments before sitting in the styling chair . Respondents cited the hairstyles of actresses Jennifer Aniston and Sandra Bullock, as well as signer Jennifer Lopez, as celebrity favorites, with 53 per cent also noting that they get skin, beauty, and hair ideas from pictures and videos of famous personalities. But LQS and Associates warns against attempts to emulate these looks on a regular basis. A-listers like Beyonce, Paris Hilton, and Selena Gomez all sport weaves and extensions, but their beauty regimen is not always adaptable to the average person. 'Many of those glamorous looks can do more harm than good, leading to long term problems,' said LaQue Gushon-Harris, president of LQS and Associates. 'Unfortunately, most women are not even aware of the repercussions.' Mr Gushon-Harris explained that women who get weaves and extensions often deal with hair loss from traction alopecia, the gradual recession of the hairline due to tight hairstyles that pull at hair follicles over time. The survey also revealed that the top five beauty and cosmetic treatments favored by women in the US include manicures, pedicures, hair coloring, teeth whitening, and perms. However, frequently demonized treatments like tanning beds and facials also make the top 10. Good hair day: Jennifer Aniston (left) and Sandra Bullock (right) have the top two favorite celebrity hairstyles . Long-term risk? According to LaQue Gushon-Harris, president of LQS and Associates, Beyonce's weave could be causing permanent damage to her hair follicles . Despite the dangers, the majority of women say beauty treatments make them feel better about themselves and improve their looks. Nearly half believe these procedures boost their confidence. And in a country where one-sixth of women go to great lengths to look like their favorite celebrities, knowledge of dangers might not even stop them. When asked if they knew for certain that their treatments would cause permanent damage, four per cent said they would continue anyway and six per cent would continue, just not as much. Most women, however, remain confident that their treatments are safe, and 67 per cent say they would stop if they learned what they were doing to themselves was unhealthy. It comes down to education, says Mr Gushon-Harris, who travels the country teaching women about the dangers of cosmetic treatments. The study also found that 56 per cent of the respondents want more information on the side effects of their treatments and almost a quarter don't have any idea of the dangers of their treatments. It's a possible push for beauty salons to be more transparent. 'It is very important to be educated about whatever it is that you are doing to your body,' he added. 'These damages can be lasting and life changing.'","American women look to celebrities for hair inspiration, often uneducated about the potential dangers of beauty procedures .

"The mother-of-five who was arrested for allegedly throwing her 16-year-old daughter a drunken party  where they played naked Twister together has admitted to turning towards alcohol during her divorce from her veteran husband. Rachel Lehnardt, 35, had been a life-long follower of the Mormon church and had never touched a drop of alcohol before her split from her husband James, who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder when he returned from Iraq, her lawyer said in a statement on Thursday. But following their divorce last year, she began drinking and ultimately broke away from the church, where she had once been a Sunday school teacher, the lawyer said. Her alcohol abuse culminated in the startling incident in which she allegedly allowed her daughter and her friends to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in front of her at their Evans, Georgia home. Scroll down for video . Struggles: Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, is pictured walking outside her Georgia home on Wednesday, several days after she was arrested for allegedly throwing a drunken party for her teenage daughter . She had already been drunk when her 16-year-old daughter returned with her friends, according to her lawyer, Shawn Hammond. According to authorities, Lehnardt and the teenagers then played naked Twister - although Lehnardt left halfway through the game to have sex with an 18-year-old man in the bathroom. When she returned, she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers, Augusta Crime reported. After going to bed, she awoke around 3.30am to find her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend raping her and immediately threw him off, according to Hammond. The girl later told her mother that she felt guilty because his 10-inch penis was too big for her, so he had to have sex with her mom instead, according to a police report. According to Hammond, Lehnardt woke the next day and realized that her drinking had got out of hand and had led to her being raped by the 16-year-old. Her daughter has now split from the boy. Video from KJBF . Arrested: Lehnardt, pictured in her mug shot, was arrested after she told her AA sponsor about the incident and the sponsor then contacted authorities. Lehnardt said she is working to put it behind her . Split: Her lawyer said Lehnardt, who is a life-long Mormon, turned to drink after divorcing from her husband James Lehnardt, pictured right. He returned from Iraq with PTSD and was later discharged, the lawyer said . After the incident, the children's paternal grandparents found out about the party from the teenage girl and were awarded custody of the five children. Lehnardt was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who then went to authorities. As part of the AA's 12 Step program, members write a list of incidents they feel guilty about and confide in their sponsor about the acts (known as the Fifth Step). The person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings, as long as doing so does not cause harm to others. While there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings, there is no guarantee, and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes, according to The Fix. AA literature simply states that 'anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics'. The main 'Understanding Anonymity' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of AA members being convicted of crimes, including, murder after confessing to their sponsors. But there has also been some debate over whether the confessions can be used in court. In 2001, a 1995 murder conviction was thrown out after it was ruled that a killer's confession to fellow AA members was constitutionally protected and shouldn't have been used against him. The decision was reached after the judge deemed the 12 Step program had religious undertones, meaning that the members engaged in  religious activity, which is constitutionally protected. Lehnardt's lawyer said she was shocked with what had happened so she researched local Alcoholics Anonymous groups and met with a sponsor, named Heidi, who encouraged Lehnardt to tell her about her divorce, her drinking and the incident that led to her losing her children. Lehnardt also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos, including of Lehnardt having sex with her current boyfriend, and admitted to being a porn addict. Heidi then went to authorities and told them what the mother-of-five had confessed to doing at the party. Lehnardt's lawyer called Heidi's decision to go to the sheriff's office 'unfortunate'. Lehnardt was arrested last Saturday and charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Hammond, the lawyer, released a statement shared by Augusta Crime on Thursday, saying Lehnardt was 'extremely remorseful' for what had happened. 'Mrs. Lehnardt acknowledges that due to recent alcohol abuse she engaged in several acts of inappropriate conduct,' he said. 'Although, many of the allegations are exaggerated, she is extremely remorseful for what she allowed to occur in her presence and is obtaining professional and pastoral counseling to ensure that this conduct is never repeated.' He denied that she had thrown the party for the teenagers or provided them with drugs, and said she would be fully cooperating with authorities. 'Mrs. Lehnardt has recommitted herself to her faith and her family,' he continued. 'She is hopeful that her children, members of her faith and others will learn from her poor example as to just how easy it is for people to exercise such extremely poor judgment while intoxicated.' He did not comment on the naked Twister, bathroom sex or sex toy allegations, and simply said reports of the incident had been exaggerated. Denial: The mother-of-five said she did not throw the party but did admit to witnessing teenagers smoke marijuana. She also claimed she later awoke to her daughter's teenage boyfriend raping her . Scene: After the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, she lost custody of her five children . Downcast: Her lawyer said she has been a life-long Mormon who only recently started drinking alcohol . Before the divorce, she had never consumed alcohol, drugs or caffeine, he said. She married her husband, James, in 2000 and they had five children together, now aged between four and 16. James Lehnardt served with an artillery unit in Iraq during one of his deployments where he held the rank of specialist. He was based in Basra, Iraq's second largest city, from July 2009 as part of Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 17th Fires Brigade, Brigade Aviation Element. The unit, part of the 7th Division, co-ordinated American and Iraqi security force missions in the south of Iraq after British forces left and American troops were deployed there to deal with the Shi'ite militia which took control of the city. He was later based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, in Tacoma, Washington and more recently, the Augusta-Fort Gordon area of Georgia. But due to his PTSD and anger issues, he was ultimately discharged and is now on VA disability, according to Mrs Lehnardt's lawyer. According to her sponsor, who went to police, she also allegedly used sex toys in front of the teenagers and showed her daughter explicit photos of her having sex with her current boyfriend . Neighborhood: She was already drunk when her daughter and her friends came back to the neighborhood, pictured, because they had been staying at their father's, she said . The couple separated in 2014 and she kept custody of the children. She also returned to work, where she struggled while earning just above minimum wage, he explained. Around this time, she started drinking at the weekends when she didn't have the children and it ultimately got out of hand, leading to the incident at their Evans home, her lawyer said. Following her arrest on Saturday, she posted $3,200 bond and was released from the Columbia County Detention Center. While Lehnardt said she had been raped by the teenage boy, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent. This week, she was seen outside her house wearing a hooded jacket and workout clothes, and looking downcast. Her five children, who are aged four, six, eight, 10 and 16, remain with their grandparents.","Rachel Lehnardt, 35, 'allowed her 16-year-old daughter and her friends drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her Georgia home'

"A handwritten notebook in which Britain's Enigma machine genius Alan Turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $1million (£690,000). The 56-page book bought in Cambridge contains Turing's thoughts on the clearly tricky 'Leibniz notation dx/dy'. 'I find [it] extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one I understood the best once!' he wrote. Scroll down for video . A handwritten notebook in which Britain's Enigma machine genius Alan Turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $1million (£690,000). Above, he wrote that the Leibniz notation was 'extremely difficult' It was written at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and paved the way for computer science. It is believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript known to exist, the auctioneer said. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said: 'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' In a statement through Bonhams, Turing scholar Andrew Hodges said the notebook sheds more light on how Turing 'remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' He added: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value.' Turing committed suicide in 1954. He was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Britain and was convicted of indecency in 1952. He agreed to undergo hormone treatment as an alternative to imprisonment to 'cure' his homosexuality. It will be sold by Bonhams in New York on Monday. It said the seller wished to remain anonymous. Part of the proceeds will be donated to charity.","56-page book contains Turing's thoughts on tricky 'Leibniz notation dx/dy'

"Prague’s international airport has been forced to hire porters to carry passengers’ luggage up 32 stairs because a multi-million pound construction project didn’t budget for an escalator. A new metro line extension opened this week in the Czech capital – transporting travellers closer to the airport than ever before – but the point where passengers transfer from trains to buses doesn’t have a moving staircase. That means porters are left to carry travellers’ heavy bags up and down the steep stairs at Nadrazi Veleslavin station, in north-west Prague, from 5am to 10pm every day, free of charge. Scroll down for video . Porters are carrying passengers' luggage up and down the stairs at Nadrazi Veleslavin station every day . The construction project didn't budget for an escalator between the metro station and bus terminal . One of the porters, Radek Mojzis, a 23-year-old student at Prague's School of Economics, told the Associated Press that he applied for the job because he wants ‘to stay fit and help the elderly.’ Without a direct train connection, the No 119 bus takes passengers on the final five miles between Vaclav Havel Airport and the nearest metro station. More than three million airport customers use the bus every year, choosing not to go by car or risk being ripped off by one of Prague’s notorious cab drivers. The 20billion koruna (£527million, $787million) metro extension, planned by the Prague Public Transport Company, was supposed to transform Nadrazi Veleslavin station into a transport hub for the airport, with passengers transferring to trains, not buses. Travellers can use a lift, but they are forced to cross a busy road to access the bus terminal . But the project is unfinished and the escalator that was constructed connects with an unbuilt train station. Michal Rehorek, a spokesman for the airport, told MailOnline Travel that the public transit authority is responsible for building a new escalator. He said the airport is in talks with transit officials and a private company regarding the refurbishment of buses that stop at the airport and better signage at the metro station. He added: ‘Costs for [porters] are in tens of thousands of Czech crowns per month but for Prague Airport it is primarily an investment into the comfort and quality of service rather than cost only.’ Jiri Stabl, a spokesman for the Prague Public Transport Company, told AP that the train project is delayed and ‘it became impossible’ to change the original plan to include an escalator for those transferring from the metro station to the bus terminal. He added: ‘We don’t feel it is a mistake of the transport company.’ An escalator was built for airport customers but it connects the metro station and an unbuilt train station . The new extension allows passengers to travel between central Prague and the airport in 30 minutes, including the bus ride. Officials are now considering adding an escalator while it remains unclear when the train project will be completed. Travellers can use a lift located at another part of the metro station, but it is not a seamless transfer. Once they arrive on the surface they are forced to cross a busy road to enter the bus terminal.","Prague's new metro extension transports travellers closer to the airport .

"The force wasn't with everyone during the Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens panel held at California's Anaheim Convention Center on Thursday. Carrie Fisher, 58, who is reprising her role as Princess Leia, and Mark Hamill, 63, who is Luke Skywalker, were arm-in-arm on the stage just before the second trailer for the December film was rolled out. Not on hand was Harrison Ford, who is the franchise's Han Solo. Producer Kathleen Kennedy explained the 72-year-old was 'resting' after miraculously surviving a March plane crash in Los Angeles. Scroll down for trailer... Together again: Carrie Fisher, who is reprising her role as Princess Leia, and Mark Hamill, who is Luke Skywalker, were arm in arm on the stage in Anaheim on Thursday before the second trailer for Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens was rolled out . In recovery mode: Not on hand was Harrison Ford, who is the franchise's Han Solo. Director JJ Abrams explained the 72-year-old was 'resting' after miraculously surviving a March plane crash in Los Angeles; here the actor is seen in July after an accident on the Star Wars set . It was announced early on that Ford would not be a part of the panel (though later he was the high point of the trailer). 'He's not here today but he's in everyone's thought, Harrison Ford, he's a total bad a***. 'The amazing thing about Harrison – and I don't think anybody out there will be surprised – is he is the only person who could make an emergency landing on a golf course in front of two doctors,' producer Kennedy said. The A team: Kathleen Kennedy, pictured center, said, 'The amazing thing about Harrison – and I don't think anybody out there will be surprised – is he is the only person who could make an emergency landing on a golf course in front of two doctors'; to her left is director JJ Abrams . They have a bond: Both Hamill and Fisher thanked the fans for their support over the decades . The vet meets the new faces: Fisher smiled as she posed with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley . Kennedy said he was home resting, and getting well as fast as he can. 'I can't even begin to tell you how much he wanted to be here,' she said. 'When we open the movie, Han Solo will be very active in what we are doing.' Abrams then chimed in. 'He's doing great and he's working hard,' Abrams said. 'I had respect for him all my life, but I've never had more respect for a guy until I saw how he landed that plane. The way they were: (from left) Hamill, Fisher and Ford in the original Star Wars movie in 1977 . 'He's more of a hero in that move than in all the films he's been in,' he added. 'By the time the movie opens he will be very actively involved.' Abrams also called the veteran actor, who is married to Calista Flockhart, a 'real hero.' Ford was also injured on the set of the Star Wars film and production was brought to a halt. But he recovered without any long-term issues. Fisher came out on stage in a black blazer and red skirt. Next was Peter Mayhew, who plays Chewbacca. Last was Hamill. The audience went wild for over 10 seconds. 'Chewie, we're home': Ford was featured at the end of the trailer for Star Wars VII . She's taking care of him: Ford's wife Calista Flockhart has been seeing to her husband's needs; here they are pictured in 2008 . When asked about her iconic hairstyle, Fisher said, 'The buns are tired now so I don't think we'll have the futuristic buns but we will have an alternate that will not include the metal bikini.' She also thanked the fans and made a twisted joke about how she is glad people have played with toys of her - referring to her Princess Leia dolls - which drew laughs. Hamill added, 'George originally called the film the most expensive small film he ever made.' He then thanked the fans for their 'passion.' 'My entire adult life I have felt such love from you. You're more than just fans, you're family.' On the run: Daisy and John can be seen running from an explosion in the trailer . R2D2 then appeared on stage and an image from the movie was shared with the robot in it. The 'tinkerers' were also brought out to talk about working with the droid. Next came BB-8, a rolling droid that appeared in the first Star Wars VII trailer. It made noises while circling R2D2. Daisy described her character, 'She is a scavenger and very solitary until she meets another character and that's when the adventure begins.' Down for now: An aircraft is buried in sand on a new planet . Oscar added, 'He's been sent on a mission by a certain princess and he meets John Boyega's character and their fates are forever intertwined.' John then said he would not confirm whether he was a Stormtrooper or not. Anthony Daniels also made the event - he plays C3PO. And then came the trailer. No fear: A pilot is seen in battle in the film that has a December release . The clip was the first time the vet character Han Solo, played by Ford, was seen. He was joined by Chewbacca at the end of the trailer and is heard saying, 'Chewie, we're home.' The trailer opens on what appears to be the newly revealed desert planet Jaku. As a speeder races across the sands we see an ancient downed Star Destroyer and a skeletal X-Wing, which clearly crashed there from orbit decades ago. We then see an unknown pair of hands holding the mangled mask of Darth Vader, melted and disfigured from the Sith lord's funeral pyre at the end of Return Of The Jedi. A hint of the old era: A skull of Darth Vader - aka Anakin Skywalker - is shown in the beginning of the clip . We hear Hamill's voice reprising a line from the 1983 film: The force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. My sister has it. He then appears to hand a lightsaber to another unseen character - a strong suggestion Luke Skywalker has had a child. Daisy, Oscar and John are then all introduced in the clip and it is hinted that they are in allegiance. Harrison appears with Chewbacca only at the very end. The menace is always there: Stormtroopers are also seen in the trailer, and they are located in a snowy location . Where is this?: In the opening scene, a desert planet is shown that is not Tatooine, but rather a new place JJ Abrams said was Jaku - it is not known how that is spelled or what lives there . Star Wars Celebration is a multi-day festival produced by Lucasfilm that's dedicated to Star Wars past and present. The most recent event, held in Germany in July 2013, had more than 20,000 attendees. During the panel, JJ talked about his love of the franchise. 'I was 11 years old when Star Wars come out,' he said. 'That moment transported me. It was the first time a movie made me laugh that way.... the film was brilliant and had such heart and the biggest thing for me was that it had such hope. 'Shooting in Abu Dhabi was an incredible thing. Shooting Star Wars is a Western and a fairy tale... shooting in Abu Dhabi was just that,' he added. The stars in real life: Oscar, Daisy and John side by side at the panel . The star in the film: Oscar as a pilot, Daisy as a scavenger and John, who at one point is a Stormtrooper . They then flashed a scene of the team in the desert. 'It's a planet called Jaku, people thought it was Tatooine, but it was Jaku.' He did not explain how Jaku was spelled or where it was. In November the first trailer came out and it lasted only 88 seconds. Opening some 30-years after Return Of The Jedi, the teaser kicked off with British actor Boyega, playing Finn, racing across a desert landscape dressed in full Stormtrooper regalia. A parched, disembodied voice tells us of an 'awakening' and reminds us of the dual energies that are 'the dark side... and the light.' The droids showed up too: Also on stage were the new robot BB-8 (left) and the old robot R2D2 (right), which looked a bit banged up . Behind the scenes: Not only was the trailer shared, but so were shots from the making of the movie . British actress Ridley is the next new star to appear as she drives a hover vehicle towards a desert town, while Oscar Isaac is seen as a fighter pilot, looking rather like a young Luke Skywalker when he's headed for the Death Star. The first trailer also delivered what was initially suggested during the forthcoming film's development - a clear departure from the over-indulgent use of CGI that blighted parts one, two and three of the science fiction saga. It also confirmed the welcome return of the iconic Millennium Falcon, and it is seen dodging laser blasts in a brief battle sequence. A new lightsaber made its debut, complete with a sword-like hilt, as an ominous cloaked figure marauds through a dark, snow-layered forest setting. The film opens December 18, 2015. The man with a plan: JJ Abrams spoke about the exciting project on stage . The veterans: Mark, Carrie and Anthony Daniels waved to the crowd of loyal followers . Dark side: Several Storm Troopers attended the event as they walked in a uniform line while standing in the background at the event .

"The parents of a Slovakian model accused of murdering her British millionaire ex-boyfriend are being forced to sell their house to pay her legal bills. Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. The blonde model had gone on the run but was eventually tracked down to her family's home 2,000 miles away in the small western Slovakian town of Nova Basoca after police put out an international arrest warrant. Scroll down for video . The Slovakian model had gone on the run after Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain . Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found murdered . Now her parents Lubomir Kukuca, 50, and Danka Kukucova, 51, said they feel hated in their own village and are selling up their home to move somewhere more secluded and pay thousands for lawyers' fees in Spain where their daughter is awaiting trial. Gold dealer Mr Bush, 48, from Bristol was found dead in a pool of blood at his five-bed rented home near Estepona just after 3am. His new girlfriend, Russian student Maria Korotaeva, 20, told detectives his Slovakian ex was waiting for them in her pyjamas inside Mr Bush’s mansion when they arrived for a long weekend from the UK. Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge' Maria Korotaeva, 20 (left and right), the most recent girlfriend of murdered millionaire Andrew Bush, 48 (left), has told how the pair arrived at Mr Bush's Spanish villa to find ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting . She took refuge in Mr Bush’s Hummer while he argued inside with the alleged killer. Miss Korotaeva said Kukucova was ‘crazy’ with jealousy after Mr Bush ended their relationship. She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape. Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested  in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain. She was extradited back to Spain in May after handing herself in and locked up in  the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga. Maria's parents have visited their daughter and hired lawyers, but their efforts have landed them in debt. Now Kukucova's parents are being forced to sell their home (pictured) in Nova Basoca, western Slovakia, to pay thousands for their daughter's lawyers' fees . Danka Kukucova, 51, (left) Lubomir Kukuca, 50, (right) said said they feel hated in their own village after news of the murder spread and were planning to move to a more secluded area . Her father Lubomir Kukuca, who is seriously ill with cancer, admitted his daughter kept in touch with them while she was on the run. Miss Kukucova’s mother Danka, who supports the family as a manager for a local building society, said at the time of her arrest: ‘We are really struggling. We are upset with what is being said about our daughter.’ Having spent their savings and borrowed money from family, they have decided to sell their home in Nova Bosaca which is on the market for the equivalent of £73,000. One of Maria's cousins, Katarina, who did not want to give her surname, confirmed to the Slovak national newspaper Novy Cas: 'They have decided to leave the house in which they have been living for several years. Mayka Marica Kukucova, pictured after giving herself up to police in her home town of Nova Bosaca in Slovakia . Ms Kukucova had given herself up in her home town which is 3,102km (1,928 miles) from the crime scene in Spain . 'They feel in any case that everybody in the village looks at them as if they are murderers and they no longer feel welcome. People do not ask anything, they just gossip. The parents are fed up with everything. 'The price will not be lower than 100,000 EUR. They will not sell the house for less because they need to return the money that they have borrowed. 'They would also like to buy small secluded house so that they will not be nagged by anybody. 'They are also selling because they hope that Maria will come back and she will want to be in some calm and peaceful place far from people.' Slovak estate agent Lubomir Batovec reckoned the two storey house was not worth more than £59,000 because of the location and its distance from the town of Nove Mesto nad Vahom. He said: 'I am sure that it will not be easy to sell this house - at least not for that money.' The model has been locked up in the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga since she was extradited last May .

"Eight guards at Nauru detention centre have been suspended after they posted anti-Islamic messages on social media and were pictured with Pauline Hanson at a recent Reclaim Australia rally. Detention centre operator Transfield Services said the employees – who are part of Nauru's emergency response team - were found to be contravening a company policy that they display 'cultural sensitivity'. A former staffer at Transfield subcontractor Wilson Security said the guards – seven of whom are former Australian Defence personnel - 'frequently referred to asylum seekers in their care as ""the enemy""', The Guardian Australia reported. Nauru guards pictured with Pauline Hanson at the Reclaim Australia rally in Brisbane earlier this month. From left: Dan Connors, Cody Allen, Alan Hartley, Beau James, Pauline Hanson, Graham Motley, Simon Scott, a man who does not work on Nauru, Jamie Scannell and Harley Levanic . Some of the guards were found to have posted on their Facebook accounts promoting the controversial Reclaim Australia rallies – which were held around the country on April 4 to protest against Islamisation and the influence of 'minorities' and 'radical extremism' in Australia. All eight men were pictured posing with former federal MP Pauline Hanson – well known for her anti-immigration and anti-Halal stance - at the Brisbane Reclaim Australia event. In other social media posts some of the guards compared Muslims to Nazis while others accused companies with Halal-certified products of supporting terrorism. One guard, Harley Levanic, posted a picture to Facebook in February of a new neck tattoo bearing the word 'infidel' and tagged a number of other guards asking 'Who is next boys?' Another guard, Beau James, commented on the photo: 'Welcome to the gang… Well done old son. Looks awesome.' Harley Levanic posted an image of a new neck tattoo reading 'Infidel' with the caption 'Who is next boys?' Mr James appears in a Facebook photo wearing a T-shirt bearing the 'infidel' slogan, and on the day before the Reclaim Australia rally he commented on a post linking Muslims to Nazis with the comment 'See yas tomoz boys!!! Bring your pitch forks', the Guardian Australia reported. Fellow guard Simon Scott – whose Facebook profile has now been deleted – posted messages slamming companies for carrying Halal-certified products. 'Don't be UnAustralian and buy these products. Let the filthy sub human genetic Islamic filth have it,' he posted. Mr Scott also claimed that detention centres were '90% full of wealthy Iranians' in Facebook comments that have been deleted but still appear on Google search cache. And on a post detailing a plan to settle refugees bound for Australia in Cambodia, Mr Scott wrote: 'I don't care where they send them as long as they don't send them to Australia.' Fellow guard Simon Scott – whose Facebook profile has now been deleted – posted messages slamming companies for carrying Halal-certified products . Alan Hartley shared a pro-military cartoon with a caption urging people to attend 'take back australia rallies' Alan Hartley shared a pro-military cartoon with the caption: 'This picture shows why we all have to go to the take australia back rallies around the country before we lose what guys like these sacrificed their lives for that islam and its muslim extremists are trying so hard to disrespect and destroy!!!!!!!!!! [sic]' Transfield Services spokesman David Jamieson said the guards had all made social media posts that breached company policy, in addition to being pictured with Pauline Hanson. 'It's not just the picture,' Mr Jamieson told Daily Mail Australia. 'What they are alleged to have done appears to contravene policies we have around acceptance of cultural diversity. 'These sorts of actions are totally unacceptable and we're very concerned. What is alleged to have been done is in no way representative of the broader workforce on Manus and Nauru.' Mr Jamieson said the men had been stood down while an investigation was being conducted, and he did not know how long it would take. When asked if the company now planned to monitor the social media accounts of other guards, Mr Jamieson said: 'I'm not going to comment on what we might or might not be doing.'

"A good Samaritan was given a parking ticket after he pulled over to help an elderly woman he thought was dying. Student Drew Hollinshead, 21, stopped in the first space available when he saw the pensioner collapse on the pavement. But as he helped her for less than a minute, a traffic warden put a £70 ticket on his car – because Mr Hollinshead had pulled into a bay for disabled drivers. 'It's ridiculous': When he was slapped with the ticket on his windscreen Mr Hollinshead initially tore it up and threw it in the bin before later going back to pick it up . Yesterday Mr Hollinshead said the way he had been treated was ridiculous and said the council warden could see what was happening. He was driving through Bournemouth when he saw the woman fall to the pavement. He parked and rushed over to help. After discovering she was all right and helping her to her feet, he returned to the car only to find the warden printing the ticket. ‘I stopped in the disabled bay as it was the nearest place to where the old lady was,’ he said. Angry: Mr Hollinshead, who is studying marketing and advertising at Bournemouth University, said he was punished for trying to do something good . ‘There was a space for about four cars and it was completely empty, so it wasn’t like somebody was waiting to use it. Under the circumstances, I think it was ridiculous. I saw her fall down and stopped for around 30 to 45 seconds at the most to help her. ‘I went back to my car and there was a parking officer who was giving me a ticket. He must have seen what I was doing and that I was helping the old lady. 'I asked him why and he said, “It gives me no great satisfaction to give you this ticket”. Any normal person would have turned a blind eye when they saw why I had stopped.’ The undergraduate, who is in his final year of an arts and marketing degree at Bournemouth University, took a photo of the smirking traffic warden during the incident on April 9 and posted it on Twitter. Where it happened: The student was driving along Wimborne Road, Bournemouth, when he saw a pensioner lying on the pavement in nearby Wycliffe Road (circled). He pulled into the disabled bay shown above . Good Samaritan: Drew Hollinshead, 21, was given a parking fine after stopping to help an elderly woman . He at first tore up the ticket and threw it in a bin but later retrieved it. ‘It’s not the cost, it’s the principle,’ he said. ‘I tried to do something good and then something bad happened because of it.’ He was supported by other social media users. One, ShuttleX, said: ‘I’m sorry you got a ticket Drew (make sure you appeal against it) but well done for helping the lady who fell over. 'This doesn’t surprise me. Parking Services are well known for slapping out tickets in circumstances where common sense should prevail. The council doesn’t care, as long as the revenue keeps rolling in.’ Bournemouth Council posted a message to Mr Hollinshead on Twitter suggesting how he could challenge the ticket. Parking Services operations manager Margaret Leslie said: ‘Any motorist receiving a fine can appeal against a ticket… We give full consideration into all individual cases and take mitigating circumstances into account.’","Drew Hollinshead, 21, stopped as he thought an elderly woman was dying .

"A woman suspected of abandoning her newborn baby girl in a South Carolina dumpster has come forward following the rescue of the hours old infant by a teenager. Horry County Police said the mother, who will be identified once she is formally charged, turned herself in on Thursday night after seeing herself on television in pictures released by the police. The baby girl was discovered struggling to breathe while trapped inside of a tied plastic bag by Austin Detray on Thursday afternoon when he heard her crying. Inside he also found the umbilical cord and placenta, according to WMBF. The 8lb 6oz newborn was taken to hospital where she is listed in stable condition, and the woman is currently in hospital and will be charged once she is released, police said. Scroll down for video . Horry County Police said the mother of an abandoned baby girl turned herself in on Thursday night (above a picture released by police of the woman suspected to be in connection to the incident) The woman is currently in hospital and will be charged once she is released, police said . The hours old baby girl was found trapped in a tied plastic bag inside a dumpster (pictured above) located in an apartment complex in Myrtle Beach . 'Hospital staff estimated the baby was only hours old,' Horry County Police Department Lt. Raul Denis told NBC. On Friday, he said the baby is healthy and is in the custody of the social services department. Police responded to a report of the incident around 2.30pm on Thursday at an apartment complex in Myrtle Beach near Island Green Country Club. Austin and his brother were taking trash to the dumpster when they heard a faint noise. 'I heard it and I instantly knew it was a baby and she was crying, so I jumped in the garbage can, or the dumpster, and I started moving bags away,' Austin told WMBF. 'I got two or three bags down and saw the baby's face pressed against the bag.' He added: 'It was tied shut…it was, it was horrible. I ripped it open and the umbilical cord was still there, the placenta, it was just born.' Austin Detray (above) was with his brother when they heard the infant crying from inside the dumpster and rescued her before calling for help . Austin's mother Jessica (right) cleared the baby girl's mouth and nasal passages to help her breathe . Emergency responders took the infant to hospital where she is listed in stable condition (above scenes from the incident) Austin then told his brother to go upstairs and get help when their mother, Jessica, came to the scene and cleared the baby's mouth and nasal passages. 'So what I did was I got towels and took care of her,' said the mother-of-five. 'I named her Hope. Because I have hope for her and I pray, and if anything comes from this I want to make sure she is okay.' Once on the scene, emergency responders took the infant to a nearby hospital. On Thursday, the Detrays went to visit the baby girl, and Jessica mentioned she is willing to care for the infant and is considering adoption. 'To the parents, you ought to be ashamed of yourself,' Jessica told WTHR. 'I'm sorry, but there are hospitals and door-knocking you could have done to make sure that baby was safe.'","The woman, who will be identified once she is charged, came forward on Thursday night after the baby was found in a South Carolina dumpster .

"David Cameron embarked on his first proper walkabout of the election campaign today, and was soon told to 'f*** off back to Eton'. The Tory leader, who has been criticised for a dull campaign featuring a lack of ordinary voters, embarked on a tour of the streets of Alnwick to drum up support for his re-election. But he was reprimanded by one local woman for the 'name-calling' in the campaign, while a busker with a ukulele sang: 'f*** off back to Eton with all your Eton chums'. David Cameron embarked on his first proper walkabout of the campaign today in Alnwick, and was greeted by a man with a ukulele singing: 'F*** off back to Eton' Tory strategists had planned a low-key day while Labour leader Ed Miliband launched his party manifesto in Manchester. Mr Cameron has staged his first on-camera walkabout of the campaign - and was urged to avoid 'name calling' tactics against Ed Miliband. In an extraordinary attack last week, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon claimed Mr Miliband had stabbed his brother in the back to win the Labour leadership, and was now 'willing to stab the United Kingdom in the back to become prime minister' by giving up the Trident missile system to secure the support of the SNP. Mr Miliband rounded on the 'desperate smears' by Mr Cameron's 'minions'. Privately senior Tories admitted the attack had backfired, and triggered fresh complaints that it detracted from positive policies on freezing rail fares and volunteering. Today in Alnwick in Berwick-upon-Tweed constituency, one woman told Mr Cameron: 'I don't like the name calling in politics ... Be a good boy.' As Mr Cameron spoke to local voters, he was urged to avoid 'name calling' tactics against Ed Miliband . Despite the heckling, Mr Cameron was repeatedly stopped and asked to pose for selfies - a major feature of the election campaign . The Tory campaign was boosted by a new poll which suggested they have pulled away a six point lead over Labour . During his attempts to meet voters, the Prime Minister bought some sausages at Turnbull's butchers and chatted with shoppers during the 15 minute stroll. Mr Cameron was joined on his walkabout by Tory candidate Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who is trying to take the seat from the Lib Dems after incumbent Sir Alan Beith stood down. The premier also visited the Icon Plastics factory in Stockton South constituency, where Conservative James Wharton is defending a narrow 322 majority. Mr Cameron has been criticised for failing to engage with ordinary voters, but Tory insiders rejected the accusation. They said Mr Cameron had been on a 'walkabout' at Barry Island's seafront in Wales last week, held a 'Cameron Direct' question and answer session  with 150 members of the public and took part in a public hustings in his own constituency at the weekend. The Tory campaign was boosted by a new poll which suggested they have pulled away a six point lead over Labour. The Prime Minister bought some sausages at Turnbull's butchers and chatted with shoppers during the 15 minute stroll . The ICM survey shows David Cameron's party on 39 per cent, ahead of Labour on 33 per cent. The new  poll, published by The Guardian, had the Liberal Democrats unchanged on 8 per cent, Ukip down two points on 7 per cent and the Greens up three points on 7 per cent. The Conservatives were up 3 per cent in the poll and Labour down 2 per cent. It marks the Tories' best result in an ICM poll since March 2012, before the so-called 'omnishambles' budget.","Prime Minister embarks on tour of Alnwick high street to woo voters .

Scroll down for audio . A 13-year-old Maryland boy called 911  after a fire broke out on the first floor of his home in Clinton on Sunday . Marcus, who stayed calm throughout the 11-minute call, told the dispatcher that his older brother, mother and step-father were also in the home, ABC News reported. He also soothed his sister after she blurted out, 'We're going to die', during the call and told her to 'stay low' and reminded her to breathe. While giving directions, the boy said: 'Go up the steps right in the back hallways. 'It's a black door to the right.'

"German air traffic control officials today called for technology that ground staff could use in an emergency to take remote command of a plane. Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month. Investigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane into a French mountainside on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. Disaster: Rescue workers and debris from the Germanwings jet at the crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes, France . Call: Klaus-Dieter Scheurle (above), head of the Deutsche Flugsicherung authority, urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the Germanwings crash last month . Mr Scheurle said in Frankfurt: ‘Such an event might cause us to reconsider systems which would allow the control of aircraft to be taken over by personnel on the ground in emergency situations.’ He added that it was important to ‘think past today's technology’, explaining that such a system could be used in an emergency on the ground to take remote control of a plane and safely land it. Mr Scheurle said that it was not the ‘simplest solution’, adding that similar technology is already available for piloting drones - but it could take a decade to develop it for passenger jets. Pilots associations are sceptical of the plans, with German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit saying the idea of remote control from the ground could be open to abuse. In charge: Investigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately flew the plane into a French mountainside on March 24, killing all 150 people on board . Tribute: Flowers in front of the monument in homage to the victims of the Germanwings flight in Le Vernet . A spokesman said: ‘We also have to ask whether such a solution would really be an improvement. After all, it's the pilots who are sitting in the cockpit and they're the ones with all the information.’ The British Airline Pilots' Association also urged caution. ‘We must act with careful consideration to ensure new safety risks or concerns are not created, such as those raised by the vulnerability of any form of remote control of a passenger aircraft,’ a spokesman said. Since the Germanwings crash, European airlines have implemented a rule that two people must be in the cockpit at all times and Germany has set up a task force with the aviation industry to consider changes to medical and psychological tests for pilots. Commercial planes could be hacked in flight by passengers using the in-flight entertainment system to access flight controls, a US watchdog agency warned last night. Cyber-security experts said onboard firewalls intended to protect aircraft electronics from hackers could be breached if flight control and entertainment systems use the same wiring and routers. A 'virus or malware’ planted on websites visited by passengers could provide an opportunity for a malicious attack, one expert told Government Accountability Office investigators. A GAO report identified the hacking risk as one of several emerging weaknesses that the Federal Aviation Administration must address as air traffic control systems advance in technology. The publication said: ‘Internet connectivity in the cabin should be considered a direct link between the aircraft and the outside world, which includes potential malicious actors.’ FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the aviation regulator has begun working with US government security experts including the National Security Agency to identify needed changes. ‘This threat will continue to evolve and it is something that needs to be at the forefront of our thinking,’ he told a Senate oversight panel. Politicians in Congress called on the FAA to act.","Deutsche Flugsicherung urges aviation industry to develop safety system .

"Arnold Schwarzenegger has unleashed a tirade against Indiana's polarizing Religious Freedom Restoration Act, saying the new laws are 'distracting and divisive' for the Republican Party. While the legislation has sparked a nationwide outcry, with many claiming it legalizes discrimination against lesbians and gays and causing boycotts of the state, the actor and former California governor has a different take on the controversy. Writing an op-ed for The Washington Post, Schwarzenegger says he believes the defining problem is that Republicans are focusing on the wrong issues, in a move that will only hurt the GOP and further alienate voters. He wrote in the piece Friday: 'As an American, I’m incredibly concerned about what happened in Indiana this week and the threat of similar laws being passed in other states. '(But) as a Republican, I’m furious.' Blast: Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger became the latest celebrity to speak out against Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, calling it a 'distracting' law that only hurts the Republican Party . Schwarzenegger continued: 'I know plenty of Republicans who are sensible and driven to solve problems for America … This message isn’t for them … It is for Republicans who choose the politics of division over policies that improve the lives of all of us. 'It is for Republicans who have decided to neglect the next generation of voters. It is for Republicans who are fighting for laws that fly in the face of equality and freedom. 'If we want our party to grow and last, we must be focused on real solutions to problems Americans are facing. 'But distracting, divisive laws like the one Indiana passed aren't just bad for the country, they’re also bad for our party. 'Polls show that laws like this are not supported by independents, women, minorities or Americans between 18 and 29. Outcry: Protesters hold signs protesting Indiana's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has made the state the target of a boycott by businesses, local governments and individuals across the US . Angered: Demonstrators gather in Indianapolis to protest a controversial religious freedom bill recently signed by Indiana Governor Mike Pence during a rally last weekend . March: Thousands of opponents of Indiana Senate Bill 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, gather for a protest on the lawn of the Indiana State House on March 28 . 'If the Republican Party wants the next generation of voters to listen to our ideas and solutions to real problems, we must be an inclusive and open party, not a party of divisions. 'We must be the party of limited government, not the party that legislates love. 'We must be the party that stands for equality and against discrimination in any form.' Schwarzenegger was the Governor of California between 2003 and 2011. In 2008 he opposed California’s controversial Prop 8 in favor of LGBT rights. However the bill, which made gay marriage illegal in California, was still passed while he was governor. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, brought in by Indiana Governor Mike Pence, with a near-identical bill brought in in Arkansas, were supposed to satisfy evangelicals by 'upholding religious freedom', but subsequently sparked boycotts of both states. The Republican governors of both states signed off Thursday on changes approved by the legislatures aimed at clarifying the intent behind the legislation. To a large extent, the measures were modeled after a federal law enacted in 1993 with broad bipartisan support. But critics of the new measures said they were designed with a different motive — to shield businesses and individuals who do not want to serve gays and lesbians, such as florists or caterers who might be hired for a same-sex wedding.","Former California governor criticises the GOP for not focusing on issues that matter, such as airport delays, graduation rates and air pollution .

"SS Sergeant Oskar Groening - known as 'the bookkeeper of Auschwitz' - is set to go on trial charged with complicity in the killing of 300,000 Jews at the Nazi extermination camp . An SS sergeant known as 'the bookkeeper of Auschwitz' is set to go on trial charged with complicity in the killing of 300,000 Jews at the Nazi extermination camp. Auschwitz survivors and the relatives of those murdered there filed into court today for the trial of 93-year-old Oskar Groening - who may well have met their loved ones shortly before they were gassed. They spoke of their pain, pride and duty in confronting this 'cog' in the machinery of genocide. Groening, known as 'The Bookkeeper' for his role in the camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, was tasked with meeting the trains bringing victims there and robbing those aboard of their possessions. Between May 16 and July 11, 1944 he was on duty when 450,000 Hungarian Jews were transported there, with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival. Now those who lost loved ones have travelled thousands of miles  to bear witness as co-plaintiffs against Groening in what may prove to be the last Nazi trial of its kind in Germany. 'I lost 49 members of my family in the Holocaust,' said Eva Pusztai-Fahidi, 89, from Budapest. 'He must have been there, on the ramp, witnessing the suffering. Now I want to look into his eyes and see him recognise his guilt. 'The Holocaust was made of small men like him, little cogs in the machine. It wasn't just big fish, it was people like Oskar Groening. It doesn't matter what his punishment is, but the verdict. The Holocaust deniers can always say a little old Jewish woman told lies. But they will not be able to deny the words of a single SS man who admits he was there.' Hedy Bohm, 87, travelled from Toronto, Canada, with her daughter to bear witness for her lost family. She too lost numerous family members, her father and his sister, together with her small baby, on the day they arrived. 'I am so grateful to have been given this opportunity to come here and testify,' she said. 'I don't know if I ever saw him. But he was there. And there can be no statute of limitations on people who served in such a place.' Groening, a sergeant in the dreaded SS, was in Auschwitz as a guard for two and-a-half years, but prosecutors are charging him with complicity in the murders of 300,000 people who arrived on 137 trains during the 48 day period of that summer in 1944 because of his intact service records. Auschwitz (pictured) survivors and the relatives of those murdered there filed into court today for the trial of 93-year-old Groening . Hedy Bohm (left) and Eva Pusztai-Fahidi (right), survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp, take part in a news conference ahead of Groening's trial . Groening never denied being at Auschwitz and has been haunted by it ever since. He once admitted: 'I never really left Auschwitz - and it never left me.' But he denies a single instance of killing or cruelty - even though he witnessed plenty. Such a defence worked in Germany before 2011 and the trial of Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk, but no longer. Demjanjuk was tried and convicted for being part of the machinery of mass murder at the camp where 250,000 Jews were liquidated without a single shred of evidence linking him to a crime. There was no-one left alive to testify at his trial in Munich for his role in the extermination of 28,000 Dutch Jews. No-one could say whether he slaughtered with his bare hands, but he was convicted, for the first time in history, simply because he was there - and that is why Groening now has his appointment with justice. Groening, who lives near the Lueneburg Heath - ironically the place where his boss, SS chief Heinrich Himmler, was buried in an unmarked grave after committing suicide when he fell into British hands at the end of the war - lived a comfortable life after the war. He married, had two children and worked as a wages accountant in a glass factory after being released from a POW camp in Britain. Groening was in Auschwitz as a guard for two and-a-half years, but prosecutors are charging him with complicity in the murders of 300,000 people over a two-month period in 1944 . He spoke at trials after the war of the operations of the gas chambers and crematoria but denied any involvement. Now a frail widower, he bears little resemblance to the young soldier with thin glasses shown in a black and white wartime photograph, except for the shadow of a military tattoo on his left arm bearing his 'O' blood type. Groening has said he volunteered for the Waffen SS in 1941 at age 20, drawn by wartime fervour and 'the elegance of the uniform'. But he testified to his nightmares in interviews before he was charged. 'Every night and every day I remember it for the nightmare it was,' he said. 'It was in 1942 that my SS chiefs in Berlin ordered me there. 'I was an official in the prisoners' possessions administration which basically involved removing the money, jewels and other valuables from the inmates, registering it and sending it back to Berlin. 'They had diamonds and gold worth millions and it was my duty to make sure all of it got to Berlin. 'It was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight to the gas chamber, although some believed they were only going to be showered before going to work. Many Jews knew they were going to die. 'One time a drunken SS man discovered a crying baby on the platform. He grabbed the waif by its legs and smashed its head against the side of a truck. My blood froze when I saw it. 'When I saw this I went to my superior officers and made an application for a transfer to the front, to anywhere. But he refused. Down the years I have heard the cries of the dead in my dreams and in every waking moment. I will never be free of them. 'It was becoming harder and harder to suppress everything I saw. On one night in January 1943 I saw for the first time how the Jews were actually gassed. It was in a half-built farmyard near to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. A gas chamber was built there. We were searching the wood nearby for prisoners who had escaped. Loved ones (pictured being interviewed before the trial) have travelled thousands of miles to bear witness as co-plaintiffs against Groening . Between May 16 and July 11, 1944 he was on duty when 450,000 Hungarian Jews were transported there, with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival. Pictured, Auschwitz survivors . 'There were more than 100 prisoners and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the chamber and the door was shut. 'Then a sergeant with a gas mask went to a hole in the wall and from a tin shook Zyklon B gas pellets inside. In that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo, a choir of madness. These cries I have ringing in my ears to this day. 'I again made an application for a transfer and at the end of October 1944 I was shipped to the Belgian Ardennes where I served with a fighting unit until capture. 'But you can imagine that down the years I have heard the cries of the dead in my dreams and in every waking moment. I will never be free of them. 'I have never been back there because of my shame. This guilt will never leave me. I can only plead for forgiveness and pray for atonement.' Kurt Schrimm, who heads Germany's sole Nazi hunting agency, prepared the case against Groening. Three more are pending against former Auschwitz personnel but age and infirmity seem likely to derail those proceedings before they begin. Judith Kalman, 61, also from Toronto, has travelled to represent her sister Evike,who was six when she was gassed upon arrival at Auschwitz during one of those days that Groening was on duty. She said: 'She never grew up. She will be a six-year-old child forever. A talented, cute little girl who taught herself to read. 'There is not only a shadow on my family, there is a shadow on my whole life. She was gassed 75 days after her sixth birthday on June 3 1944. What could have become of this talented, gifted child? 'I don't feel resentement or hatred when I think of Groening. I believe him when he says he never laid a hand on a Jew. He is unsure himself of his guilt. He wants to have peace of mind, to justify himself, but he knows there can be no justification. 'I will be there for Evika and for all the others who were murdered. I want to understand. He chose to participate in this crime and participated with conviction. And now, finally, he must answer for it.'","SS sergeant Oskar Groening, 93, faces trial for being a guard at Auschwitz .

Linden Adkins was caught on camera getting out of his minivan and screaming at a motorist at Kent State University in Ohio on Wednesday . He then tries to grab the windshield wipers but is pulled to ground when the van drives off. Adkins suffered road rash and was treated at the scene. Witnesses told NewsNet5 the incident was sparked when the minivan cut off the car. Adkins claims he did it because he saw the motorist texting as he ran a stop sign and nearly hit a a pedestrian. He told the TV station: 'That's when I just got very upset about texting and driving. We've been inundated with...you shouldn't be doing that. That's when I got out of my car and, yes, I got enraged. The 56-year-old, who works in the College of Applied Engineering, can be heard shouting: 'What kind of moron are you?' He was then dragged to the ground as he tried to grab the windshield wipers, and the car drove off . 'I didn't get violent. I didn't get threatening. But I did want to make my point to him. Unfortunately I made it very strong. 'Maybe I shouldn't have been quite as intense, but at the same time, is it possible that my being that intense saved a future life?' Adkins was charged with menacing, a fourth-degree misdemeanor. He will appear in court April 21 and plans to plead guilty. His biggest concern however is about his job - which some people say could be in jeopardy. 'I may be getting in a lot of trouble for it. I hope to hell something comes good out of it,' he old NewsNet5. 'If what I did didn't teach him that he shouldn't be texting while driving, nothing is going to.' Adkins (left and right) claims he did it because he saw the motorist texting as he ran a stop sign and nearly hit a a pedestrian.

"Leaving a favourite dog in kennels while travelling abroad can be a source of profound guilt. But one owner was so overwhelmed with anxiety at the thought of being parted from her pet, she decided to take the dog on her frequent journeys overseas. As a result, May Wong’s four-year-old cockapoo, Miss Darcy, has travelled the globe - visiting 11 countries and 23 destinations including New York, Berlin, Stockholm, Milan and Paris. She takes more trips with her owner every year than the average Briton and has covered nearly 25,000 miles since 2011 - making her a real-life Phileas Dog. Scroll down for video . C'est la vie! Darcy poses for her owner May Wong before the Eiffel Tower, left, and near Milan Cathedral, right . Seasoned traveller: Cockapoo Darcy in shades as she takes in the sun in Nice in the south of France . Now the pair have been joined on their trips by Miss Wong’s new dog, George. The dogs have travelled on planes, trains, cars and ferries across the world and sleep in dog-friendly hotels with their 55-year-old-owner. Among the landmarks they have visited are the Eiffel Tower, New York’s Central Park and the Berlin Wall. Miss Darcy, who took 12 trips with her owner last year alone, has become such a seasoned traveller she is familiar with boarding procedures at stations and airports. Her interior designer owner said: ‘Over time and effort, travelling with Darcy has become routine. ‘I know her ways and by now she’s familiar with being in trains, waiting around in stations, boarding procedures for ferries and planes. She is a very calm dog. I am lucky that she is a very good traveller. Boat trip: Darcy with her owner May Wong on board the Queen Mary in the Atlantic returning from New York . ‘My dogs are my best friends, my family – and I enjoy exploring places with them. Having them with me makes me more relaxed during my holidays rather than thinking about them and worrying if they are okay.’ Research from pet insurer Petplan has found that 65 per cent of people experience separation anxiety from their pets when holidaying - something which Miss Wong has struggled with. She tried leaving her dogs with friends, dog trainers and kennels but felt distressed by finding them unhappy and, on occasions, unwashed, on her return. Miss Wong, from London, said: ‘On occasions when I had left Miss Darcy behind with friends, she’s constantly on the lookout for me when she was out walking. She was restless and listening out for me all the time, whining, which is out of character for her. ‘They may not necessarily appreciate the effort I go through to have them travel with me but I know they would rather be with me than not.’ Before going abroad, Miss Wong researches dog-friendly hotels and restaurants so she can eat and sleep with her dogs. She said: ‘We’ve travelled by rail, car, plane and ferry. Being checked into cargo on a plane is not the most pleasant way for pets to get places. I would do so only if it is absolutely necessary in order to get my pets to where I will be if I am gone for long periods. Globe-trotter: Dressed up to visit Kylemore Abbey, Ireland, left, and watching the sunset in Manhattan, right . Public transport: Darcy is used to all forms of travel. Pictured: On a train before arriving in Bruges, Belgium . ‘I am most concerned about their comfort level and have restricted our vacations to places where I can take them and where it is safe for them to go to. ‘There are obviously occasions where I need to travel further afield and that are not worth risking their safety to bring them along.’ Inga MacKellar, Petplan’s pet behaviourist, said pet separation anxiety can be felt by both pet owners and their animals. She said: ‘Dogs are as social a species as we are, so it is not surprising that some dogs can’t cope with being left by themselves. ‘On the other hand, we know that cats are a solitary species and many like to spend time on their own - however, whilst most separation problems are usually seen in dogs, it doesn’t mean that all cats are happy to accept being alone. ‘Some can become over attached to their owners and also suffer from separation problems. ‘Separation anxiety can vary in intensity, with signs including restlessness and panting, howling, destruction or messing. ‘Knowing that 65 per cent of pet owners experience separation anxiety themselves when leaving their pets, with symptoms including uneasiness or restlessness, it’s evident how much our pets mean to us.’ Well travelled: Darcy's pet passport .

"An American college student who abandoned the west to wage holy war in Syria and call for homegrown attacks in the United States has told how she lied to her family and cashed in her tuition money to flee the West. Hoda Muthana, 20, spoke out about her decision to ditch her life as a college student in Hoover, Alabama, after being persuaded by terrorists that it was her duty as a Muslim. Now the radicalized former student has called for drive-by shootings  in America on Memorial Day and for blood to be spilled. Mu Muthana, who lived with her moderate Muslim family until she fled to Raqqa, Syria, revealed her path to terror in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Scroll down for video . Hoover to Raqqa: Hoda Muthana, 20, told how she abandoned her home in Alabama to be a jihadist in Syria. She is pictured left in her 2013 high school graduation photo. Pictured right are female jihadis waving the ISIS flag from a deactivated Twitter account believed to be connected to her . Fled: Muthana, pictured right in a 2011 taken at her school, said she feels all true Muslims must join ISIS . Suhan Rahman, Muthana's ISIS husband, was an Australian jihadi who was killed last month fighting for the terror group . She told reporter Ellie Hall that she conspired for months with other jihadists to hatch a plan to flee her parents, who kept a strict watch over her and her sister. Muthana was not named in full by Buzzfeed, but her identity was revealed on Monday by the Birmingham News. After a year of planning, she fled in November, spending money meant for college tuition on a flight to Turkey. From there she fled to Syria and, after a month, married an Australian jihadist, Suhan Abdul Rahman who was reportedly since been killed in an airstrike by the Jordanian military. Despite pleas from her family to come home, Muthana is resolute and claims it is the duty of all true Muslims to join her and wage war on the West. Her father told BuzzFeed: 'I believe she been brainwashed. She’s not that kind of girl. They brainwashed her.' During the interview, Muthana revealed how she escaped her strict family, who normally keep a close eye on both their daughters. Unexpected: Muthana is pictured with her classmates to the right in this yearbook photo from 2012 . Student: Muthana studied business at the University of Alabama's campus in Birmingham. She dropped courses at the school and spent the refund money traveling to ISIS-controlled territory . She said she enrolled on extra courses at the University of Alabama, where she studied business, then promptly dropped them to cash in the refund checks. Eventually she persuaded her family to let her go to Atlanta, Georgia, for the day for a field trip - which they would usually be reluctant to do. On the day of the trip she said she had caught the wrong bus home and was stuck in the city - which is when she caught her flight to the Middle East. Her panicked family went to look for her, but soon got a follow-up call from Muthana, then in Turkey, revealing her scheme to leave. According to a high school friend who spoke to the Birmingham News, Muthana was a 'quiet' girl 'who kept to herself'. Jordan LaPorta, who went to Hoover High School with her until they graduated in 2013, added: 'I don't think anybody saw this in her.' Muthana herself confessed that she had given up on all her American friends by the time she decided to leave . Sweet home? Raqqa, Muthana's new home city, is pictured above. It is the target of regular airstrikes, one of which killed Muthana's husband . 'Quiet': Shocked contemporaries of Muthana, who studied with her at Hoover High School, spoke out when her voyage to Syria was revealed . Instead, she conferred with jihadists online, and posted messages inciting fellow American Muslims to murder their countrymen. In one Tweet from a now-deactivated account with the title Umm Jihadi, she wrote: 'You have much to do while you live under our greatest enemy, enough of your sleeping! 'Go on drive-bys and spill all of their blood, or rent a big truck and drive all over them. Veterans, Patriot, Memorial etc Day parades..go on drive by's + spill all of their blood or rent a big truck n drive all over them. Kill them.' [sic] . Her family noticed her increased devotion to her religion, but assumed she was simply becoming a more ardent follower of the peaceful strain of the religion which they observe. As Muthana observed: 'They liked the change until they saw me getting ""jihadi"".' According to Muthana's father, the FBI is investigating his daughter - but the agency said its policy is not to confirm or deny any activity.","Hoda Muthana, 20, left Hoover, Alabama, to join extremists in Raqqa, Syria .

"Cellphone footage appears to show a Minneapolis police officer threatening to break the legs of a teenager who claims he was pulled over because of racial profiling. The March 18 video recorded by Faysal Mohamed lasts for 30 seconds and begins with a police officer giving a violent warning while his gun was trained on the teen and his two friends. 'Plain and simple, if you f*** with me I'm going to break your leg before you even get a chance to run. Be honest. I don't screw around,' says the officer. Keeping calm, Mohamed's friend replies to the officer without missing a beat to say, 'Who said I was going to run?' Scroll down for video . Pulled over: The teens were cuffed and held on the side of the road by the officers in south Minneapolis on March 18 . Filmed: Faysal Mohamed (picture) was in the car when the officer threatened violence against the three teenagers . Put on the backfoot, the unidentified officer justifies his aggressive tone saying, 'I'm just giving you a heads up. I'm trying to be Officer Friendly right now.' According to Mohamed he and friends had just left the YMCa in south Minneapolis when the police officer pulled over their car. They were told to get out and put into handcuffs and when they asked why, the police officer said, 'Because I feel like arresting you'. Mohamed told a CBS News report that they were held for 45 minutes while they were searched and a background check completed on them. Frightened: Liban Yusuf (left), Faysal Mohamed (center) and Hamza Jailani (right) have made an official complaint to the Minneapolis Police Department . The officers claimed they were being investigated for grand theft auto, but were let go. Liban Yusuf, 18, who wa with Mohamed said the officers frightened him. 'They had their guns drawn,' said Liban to Fox News. 'I don't know why they were so aggressive.' Former police officer, Mylan Masson, who teaches law enforcement at Hennepin Technical College in Minneapolis, says what the officers did appeared wrong. 'It's a threat … it's an illegal, you know, you can't threaten people. And the other thing is you can't break legs. It's not part of the Constitution and it's not part of the laws that we have,' Masson said to CBS News. According to Fox News, the officer who made the threats is called Rod Webber and Minneapolis police confirmed an investigation is underway.","Faysal Mohamed, 17, pulled over along with two friends in Minneapolis .

"Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute says forcing teachers to promote gay relationships would be making them choose between their faith and their job . Schools should be forced to promote gay relationships in sex education lessons, union leaders say. The National Union of Teachers has called for a ‘positive portrayal of same sex relationships’ in lessons to be made ‘compulsory’ under the next government. It said MPs had a duty to tackle ‘homophobia, biphobia and transphobia’ in schools and create a ‘positive climate of understanding about sexuality’. But critics accused the NUT of ‘thought control’ and said the ‘intolerant’ proposals risked ‘oversexualising’ children at a young age. Meanwhile, Christian groups warned it would compel teachers at faith schools to act against their beliefs. However, the union said the changes were needed to tackle prejudice which was ‘still strongly prevalent in our schools’. Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute said: ‘This motion is itself an act of intolerance towards mainstream Christians and their beliefs. It would force Christian teachers to have to choose between their faith and their job. ‘I wonder whether Christian members of the NUT who have paid their dues can expect any help from the NUT when their jobs are on the line.’ He added that Church schools already teach ‘love and tolerance’ of others without having to explicitly approve of same sex relationships. The proposal was contained in a motion on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights passed by the NUT at its annual conference in Harrogate yesterday. It stated: ‘Conference instructs the executive to call upon the present and future government to … make it compulsory that all schools’ sex education policies include a positive portrayal of same sex relationships.’ The NUT said only 10 per cent of LGBT teachers felt confident to be ‘out’ to students. Other proposals included promoting LGBT History Month – which celebrates gay and transgender rights movements – in every school. The motion also advocated supporting transgender students and staff ‘while transitioning and after’. Christine Blower, NUT General Secretary, said: ‘We need education policy that develops curriculum for children and young people that supports the democratic values of a diverse Britain – including LGBT equality.’ Christine Blower, National Union of Teachers General Secretary, has called for a ‘positive portrayal of same sex relationships’ in lessons to be made ‘compulsory’ under the next government . The law would also see teachers at Muslim and Jewish schools compelled to promote gay marriage and other issues that go against their beliefs. The proposal comes amid a row over the government’s new requirement for schools to teach ‘fundamental British values’, which include tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles. Christian schools have complained they were branded ‘intolerant’ and marked down by Ofsted after children were asked about gays and lesbians. Durham Free School is set to close after inspectors branded it an educational failure and said some children displayed ‘discriminatory’ views towards people of other faiths. Meanwhile, Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland was put in special measures after failing to meet Ofsted’s British values criteria. Inspectors were said to have asked pupils if they knew what lesbians ‘did’ and if any of their friends felt trapped in the ‘wrong body’. The drive was formed in response to the Trojan Horse scandal in which Muslim hardliners allegedly tried to impose an Islamic agenda on schools in Birmingham. The NUT motion renewed fears teachers would be required to go beyond their remit in tackling such a sensitive subject. Andrea Williams from Christian Concern said: ‘This kind of policy is dangerous for our children who are being oversexualised at a very young age. Durham Free has been told to close after inspectors branded it an educational failure and said some children displayed ‘discriminatory views’ toward people of other faiths . ‘They are being introduced to concepts and having normalised same sex relationships which robs them of their innocence and is not good for their emotional and moral wellbeing.’ Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘The rights of groups who oppose gay marriage on sincere religious grounds should be respected as much as those who support gay marriage. Thought control should not be promoted by the NUT.’ A Church of England spokesman said it is ‘fully committed to sex and relationship education that allows room for exploration and discussion of relationships, within a framework of Christian values’. Sex and relationships education is mandatory for pupils at council-run secondary schools. It is also compulsory for children aged between five and 14 at council-run schools to learn about sex as part of the science curriculum.","National Union of Teachers said MPs had a duty to tackle 'homophobia'

"Energy drinks like Red Bull are causing children to behave badly, a teaching union has claimed . Pupils’ excessive consumption of energy drinks is fuelling deteriorating behaviour, it has been claimed. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, likened the caffeinated refreshments to ‘readily available legal highs’. Some children drink ‘excessive’ amounts of Red Bull, Monster and Relentless, causing ‘hyperactivity’ and an ‘inevitable crash’ later, the teaching union said. Of the 3,500 teachers it surveyed, 13 per cent cited ‘use of caffeine and energy drinks … as a driver of poor pupil behaviour’. The teaching union is now working with national drug and alcohol charity, Swanswell, to provide pupils, parents and schools with advice on energy drinks. The move comes as doctors warned last week that the drinks can trigger heart problems in healthy teenagers. Miss Keates said: ‘This is the first time we have seen a significant number of teachers beginning to raise this as a concern. ‘These drinks are becoming increasingly popular among young people and are often seen as simply like any other soft drink, but many young people and their parents are not aware of the very high levels of stimulants that these drinks contain.’ She added: ‘Teachers are growing increasingly concerned that some young people are using these drinks to enable them to stay up into the early hours of the morning and then replace their lost energy by drinking two or three cans of these drinks on their way to school. ‘Teachers are reporting that this affects concentration in class and hyperactivity is then followed by the inevitable crash later in the school day when the impact of these drinks wear off. ‘Parents and young people need to be made aware of what these drinks contain and their potential impact on behaviour.’ There is no recommendation around how much caffeine people should drink each day, according to a briefing document prepared for the NASUWT by Swanswell. However, the Food Standards Agency recommends that children should only consume caffeine in moderation. As a result, it would ‘seem logical that children should consume a maximum of 200mg of caffeine per day, as recommended for pregnant women’. Children and pregnant women could drink five 500ml bottles of cola before reaching this daily limit for caffeine intake. However, they could only have one of the top five energy drink brands to get to this 200mg level, according to the report. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT (pictured), likened the caffeinated refreshments to ‘readily available legal highs’ It also points to a Danish study that revealed over 40 per cent of energy drink consumers experienced insomnia, restlessness and heart palpitations. Twenty per cent of those aged 10 to 14 consume too much caffeine and have a ‘limited knowledge of the ingredients in energy drinks and the side effects associated with them’, the research found. Debbie Bannigan, chief executive of Swanswell, said: ‘As a provider of drug and alcohol services for young people we’re concerned about excessive energy drink consumption, not least because we’re finding links to use of other substances, including alcohol, cannabis and mephadrone.’ Cardiologists in Madrid last week said the energy drinks, which contain large amounts of caffeine, may trigger sudden heart attacks and erratic heartbeats in young, apparently healthy, people.","Children drink 'excessive' amounts of energy drinks, teachers' union claim .

"Hit rap trio Migos have been arrested on the first leg of their U.S. tour after police discovered drugs and guns inside their van during a college gig. Rappers Quavious Marshall, 24, Kirschnick Ball, 20, and Kiari Cephus, 23, were escorted off the Georgia Southern University campus mid-performance on Saturday night and taken into custody. According to NBC News, all of the band members have been denied bond - meaning they might not be able to fulfill their upcoming tour dates. Migos were next due to perform at the Ksu Convocation Center in Georgia before traveling on to a number of other states including Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York. From left to right: Hip hop rappers Quavious Marshall, 24,  Kirschnick Ball, 20, and Kiari Cephus, 23, have been arrested on the first leg of their U.S. tour after drugs and guns were found in their van . Authorities said that they suspected the music stars were in possession of drugs when 'a very potent smell' of marijuana was detected coming from their two tour buses. When Migos left to perform at Georgia Southern University's Hanner Fieldhouse arena over the weekend, investigators seized the opportunity to conduct a search. Multiple guns, marijuana and another undisclosed drug were discovered inside the vehicles,  officials said. They added that the discoveries 'were intensely concerning' as they had been brought to a university-sponsored event where over a thousand students were congregated. In the spotlight: According to NBC News, all of the band members have been denied bond - meaning they might not fulfill their upcoming tour dates . Bad habits?

The three band members - best known for their 2013 single Versace and their 2014 track Fight Night - were arrested after leaving the stage. They reportedly face charges of drug possession; possession of firearms in a school safety zone; and possession of firearms during the commission of a crime. It wasn't known early Monday if they had attorneys. Phone calls and emails to the group's management team by the Associated Press were not immediately returned. About a dozen other suspects - all occupants of the two vans - were also taken into custody following the concert. Information about them and the charges they face were not immediately available. The arrests took place during the school's annual spring concert. Migos - which formed as a group in 2009 - had contracted with Georgia Southern to perform at the event, the sheriff's office said.","Quavious Marshall, 24, Kirschnick Ball, 20, and Kiari Cephus, 23, were escorted off the Georgia Southern University campus  on Saturday night .

"Row: Tinie Tempah pictured performing at an 'intimate gig' in Canterbury last night, where he arrived late and then played just two songs . Fans of rapper Tinie Tempah were left furious when the star turned up hours late to his own 'intimate gig' and only performed two songs before leaving. Music lovers paid nearly £40 to see the singer perform in Canterbury last night - only to wait for more than three hours for him to arrive. He then spent just a few minutes on stage, playing two of his songs before telling the crowd 'See you on tour' and leaving. The club which hosted the event has apologised to the audience and accused Tinie of breaking his contract with them. The event was advertised as 'an exclusive and intimate gig with one of Britain's most talented performers', with tickets starting at £30 plus booking fees. Some fans are believed to have paid more than £100 to meet Tinie, 26, whose real name is Patrick Okogwu and who is best known for his 2010 hit Pass Out. Ticket-holders had been warned that they would not be let in if they arrived after 11pm - even though Tinie was not there until at least three hours later. One member of the audience told MailOnline that she stormed out in disgust when the star failed to turn up until after 2am, and then stayed in a VIP area meeting fans for another hour. 'We were told we needed to be there by 11, but he didn't turn up until well past two,' said the 20-year-old student, who did not want to be named. 'Me and my friend left after three and he still hadn't played. 'We weren't the only people who left early, a lot of people left. People weren't happy.' Fans who stayed for the late-night performance were treated to just two songs before Tinie walked off stage, telling the audience: 'See you on tour.' Venue: Bosses at Club Chemistry said they would seek a refund from Tinie's management . One ticket-holder wrote on Twitter today: 'Clearly success doesn't equal class, Tinie Tempah showed how little he cares about his fans in Canterbury last night.' She added: 'He didn't deliver on his promises to the club, half-heartedly performed two songs rather than a full set then left.' A spokesman for Club Chemistry told MailOnline that Tinie had breached his contract for the event - and claimed that at one point he threatened not to play a single song. 'We have never been so utterly let down or disappointed by someone we were so excited about,' she said. 'There was nothing we could do. At one stage his manager actually told us he was not going to perform at all!' Success: Tinie Tempah pictured in 2011 after winning two Brit awards for his debut album . Organisers apologised to those who had bought tickets, saying in a statement: 'We are as disappointed as you. We were promised a two hour set with DJ Charlesy that included a decent performance from Tinie Tempah, as well as meet, greet and photos. 'It was all a massive let-down. We have lodged a formal complaint with his management and have demanded your ticket money back. 'Club Chemistry is committed to delivering quality artists and entertainment and it would appear that some people are not as dedicated to the cause as we are.' The club said that it would make sure members of the audience are 'compensated' and promised to keep them updated. Representatives for Tinie Tempah failed to return a request for comment on the row.","EXCLUSIVE: Rapper was booked to play 'intimate gig' at club in Canterbury .

"Part of a fiberglass boat spotted floating off the coast of Oregon is thought to be more debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami. The 25-ft long wreckage was discovered floating west of Ona Beach in Lincoln County at about 9.30am on Thursday. Biologists with the Oregon Coast Aquarium and Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center inspected the boat remains and and found 'several live specimens of a variety of yellowtail jack fish found in the coastal waters of Japan.' Tsunami debris: A chunk of a fiberglass boat 25-30' long has been spotted floating off the Oregon shore . Rescued: These live yellowtail jack fish, native to Japan, were found inside the floating debris and are now being housed in the Oregon Coast Aquarium . The several live yellowtail jack fish found on board will be delivered to the Oregon Coast Aquarium. Five million tons of wreckage - the remains of homes, boats, and other remnants of shattered lives in eastern Japan - were swallowed by the ocean when the tsunami struck four years ago. About 70 per cent of it sank, leaving about 1.5 million tons floating with scientists saying they expect more debris to hit Alaska and the West Coast of North America for years to come. An estimated 5 million tons of debris washed into the ocean in March of 2011 during the tsunami. Around 70 percent of it is believed to have immediately sunk near the Japanese coast. Some more mobile items may have reached the Pacific Northwest before 2011 even came to a close. The first documented piece of debris to arrive in California, a barnacle covered fishing boat, came ashore in April 2013. The particles are dispersed sparsely from Alaska to the Philippines. In 2013, a floating island of debris the size of Texas crossed the vast Pacific Ocean to the western shores of the Americas. The Oregan authorities plan to tow the boat segment to the Port of Newport for temporary storage. 'The debris appears to be half to two-thirds of a larger vessel, possibly damaged and set adrift during the earthquake and tsunami that struck the east coast of Japan in 2011,' said Chris Havel of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. He said biologists inspected the object and consulted with the state Fish and Wildlife Department, deciding that the attached organisms pose little threat to the Oregon coast ecosystem. The remains of the boat will eventually be removed from the water, studied, dismantled and taken to a landfill.

It comes on the same day that official figures are expected to show Britain has entered its first period of deflation since 1960. Inflation is expected to fall into negative territory after the price of fuel, food and energy bills plummeted in recent months. Low grocery and household bills has given family finances a boost, encouraging people to spend more. Barclaycard, which processes almost half of credit and debt transactions in the UK, found consumers had used this opportunity to update their wardrobes. Analysis showed spending on women's clothes grew by 6 per cent over the last year, and 4 per cent for men's clothing. A separate survey of 2,000 respondents by Barclaycard also found people were feeling more confident about their finances. A fifth of people are delaying a major purchase until after the General Election, a study shows. A survey found over half of people were concerned about how the outcome will affect their personal finances. Almost half of these said they were worried about the impact of the election – irrelevant of who wins. People said they had delayed buying various 'big ticket' items until after May 7, including family holidays and furniture. It follows concerns that a new Government could lead to a flood of new financial and fiscal policies, affecting their family finances or job security . The findings emerged in a survey of 2,000 people commissioned by Barclaycard. Valerie Soranno Keating, of Barclaycard, said: 'The forthcoming UK General Election is also causing some uncertainty. 'But overall, this report shows that the UK consumer is now firmly feeling the impact of the recovery and they are voting to enjoy their new-found fiscal flexibility.' Three-quarters of people do not worry about living within their means each month, while two-thirds say they are now happy to spend money on 'non-essential items'. Half of people who expect to increase their spending over the next few months say this was driven by a desire to treat themselves and others. Many said they had been 'cautious for a long time' but now want to splash out. Since the survey was last conducted three months ago, a higher proportion of Britons now have more confidence in global economies, their own job security and their personal finances. While people are increasingly eating meals out, most are not being reckless with their habits. Over a third say they never go to fine-dining restaurants and most prefer a traditional British pub. Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said: 'When people feel better off, they are more prepared to go out to restaurants. 'The fall in petrol prices and muted food prices will give them a bit more discretionary income. 'Consumer confidence is at its highest level for about nine or ten years. 'Rather than delaying purchases in anticipation that prices will fall, I think a lot of consumers are taking advantage of the boost to their purchasing power and spending happily.' Valerie Soranno Keating, of Barclaycard, said: 'UK consumers are starting to feel more optimistic about both the economy and their own prospects, and this is feeding through into their shopping habits. 'Falling prices and a strengthening economy have given people the confidence to spend more freely and they have taken the opportunity to treat themselves, with spend on discretionary items rising as consumers worry less about covering the cost of essentials.' Low grocery and household bills has given family finances a boost, encouraging people to spend more . But she said the financial crisis was still at the forefront of people's minds and families remained cautious about spending beyond their means, like they did in the run-up to the recession in 2008. 'While the data shows a generally very positive picture, consumers still remember the lessons of the prolonged downturn. 'The 'new normal' – fiscal prudence, a desire to balance the budget and an ongoing search for value – remains a feature of the shopping landscape', she said. The study found the General Election had created some uncertainty, with over half of people saying they were concerned about the impact the outcome could have on their personal finances. One in five are postponing a major purchase, such as a family holiday, until after the May 7 election is decided.","Consumers are buying luxury items amid falling prices and rising wages .

"Audio has surfaced of Michael Slager, 33, laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the shooting . Audio has surfaced of the cop who killed Walter Scott laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the deadly shooting in South Carolina earlier this month. Michael Slager, 33, can be heard laughing nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5. The dashcam footage showing Scott, 50, a Coast Guard veteran, being pulled over for a broken tail light just minutes before Slager shot him, was released to the media on Thursday. The camera continued to record for another hour and a recording of the audio feed, including the conversation between Slager and a senior officer, was obtained by The Guardian. 'By the time you get home, it would probably be a good idea to kind of jot down your thoughts on what happened,' the senior officer said. 'You know, once the adrenaline quits pumping.' 'It's pumping,' Slager said, laughing. The senior officer replied: 'Oh yeah. Oh yeah.' The senior officer told Slager during the conversation to go home and relax, assuring him that he would not have to answer questions about the shooting for days. Scott was shot five times in the back as he ran away from the traffic stop. The father of four's death has sparked a nationwide debate about police brutality and bias against black people after a witness published video contradicting the police account of the event. Warning: Graphic Content Below . Scroll down for audio and video . Slager can be heard laughing nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5 . Slager, 33, who is white, said that he felt 'threatened' by Scott, who is black, during a confrontation over his Taser, but video shows the civilian running away before being shot. The dashcam also recorded a cellphone call that Slager received about five minutes before his conversation with the senior officer. 'Hey. Hey, everything's OK, OK?' Slager said, after an iPhone ringtone was heard. Slager then appears to say: 'He grabbed my taser, yeah. Yeah, he was running from me.' His wife, Jamie, is eight months pregnant with their first child. Slager was fired from the North Charleston police and charged with murder on Tuesday. A group of black attorneys have called for the second officer connected to the fatal shooting to be arrested. National Bar Association officials said that Officer Clarence Habersham, 37, who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man's body after Slager, should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report. The National Bar Association is calling for North Chareston officer Clarence Habersham, 37 (right) to be arrested for falsifying a report about the actions of  Michael Slager, 33 (left), during the death of Walter Scott . Habersham (right) was the second office to arrive at the body of Scott, 50, and did not report Slager's actions leading up to the shooting . Habersham, who approached the body after Slager went to go grab the Taser that fell, can be seen examining Scott. Slager then drops the Taser next to the dead body in the presence of Habersham. Habersham then used his radio to report that Scott had gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. However, the black officer gave a two-sentence supplemental report and said that he tried to render aid to the body, which no one in the video does. Officers in the video are seen walking around and checking the pulse of the body. Sergeant James Gann wrote in his report that he helped Habersham administer first aid and CPR. On April 4, 2015 I Officer Habersham responded to the empty Lot behind Mega Pawn in reference to the above incident. I (Habersham) attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to take to get to the victim faster. Video released after Slager's account into the death shows Scott (left) running away from the traffic stop when he is shot. Mourners have placed flowers at a memorial to the veteran (right) over the past week . Slager said after the incident that he 'felt threatened' by Scott, though video shot by Feidin Santana contradicts his report . Feidin Santana, who filmed a widely circulated video of the incident, said he did not any officers giving Scott CPR. The National Bar Association, the country's oldest group of black lawyers, said that Habersham 'deliberately left material facts out of his report' and left it 'incomplete'. The group said it was 'outraged' by the incident and that any other officer of the seven that quickly arrived on the scene should be indicted if they filed a false report. Police are interviewing all officers involved, a police source told CBS News. Chief Eddie Driggers said that he would not comment because the investigation is ongoing. Habersham was accused of excessive force by another black South Carolina resident, Sheldon Williams, 47. POLICE VERSION . Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS . Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. Relatives of Scott say their goodbyes to him on Saturday at a funeral that was was so widely attended that hundreds were left outside . Williams, who has multiple criminal convictions, said that he was pinned to the ground, handcuffed and had his face stomped on during a 2011 arrest. He said he did not resist arrest . Scott was laid to rest on Saturday, his casket draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. US senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. Slager is being held without bail and faces punishments as serious as the death penalty if convicted. Judy Scott, the mother of Walter, leaves the funeral for her son in Charleston, South Carolina. The service was also attended by a number of the state's politcians . Scott, who was remembered as a beloved father, had his coffin draped in an American flag during Saturday's funeral ceremony .","Audio has surfaced of Michael Slager, 33, laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the shooting .

"Grant Shapps was last night at the centre of extraordinary claims that he was doctoring Wikipedia pages to promote himself at the expense of his political rivals. The Tory party chairman is accused of deleting embarrassing references to his past from his own page in the online encyclopedia while putting unflattering updates on the pages of others. A furious Mr Shapps denied the claims, published by the Guardian, describing them as an ‘extreme dirty tricks campaign’. David Cameron defended Mr Shapps, saying that the party chairman is doing 'a great job' while on the campaign trail today. Scroll down for video . Grant Shapps, pictured campaigning with Esther McVey yesterday, has been accused of changing Wikipedia pages to promote himself and damage rivals . Mr Shapps has denied the allegations claiming they were part of 'an extreme dirty tricks campaign' Wikipedia has suspended an anonymous user of the site, known only as ‘Contribsx’, after finding evidence it said suggested the account was run either by Mr Shapps or under his ‘clear direction’. It cited a series of amendments made by the user to pages of the site, around one third of which involved removing embarrassing references on Mr Shapps’s own page. Other changes included adding critical language to the pages of Tory Cabinet ministers including International Development Secretary Justine Greening and campaign chief Lynton Crosby. The timing and content of some of the edits appear to tally with instances when Mr Shapps clashed with the subject of the changes. The Tories described the story as ‘completely false and defamatory’. Last night Mr Shapps said: ‘It’s categorically untrue. It’s absolutely nothing to do with me. It’s just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.’ But it emerged in 2012 that changes to Mr Shapps’s Wikipedia page were made from computers in his constituency office. At the time, he said he had amended pages claiming he was ‘a Jehovah’s Witness, agnostic or crashed a car into a school wall’. A Wikipedia account using the alias 'Contribsx' edited a number of pages linked to Mr Shapps and other prominent politicians . Minister Justine Greening, left, and Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby, right, were among those mentioned in the Wikipedia edits . When Mr Cameron was asked if he has 'full confidence' in Mr Shapps today, he replied: 'Grant does a great job. He has made a very clear statement about this and I have got nothing to add to that.' The Conservative chairman told the BBC: 'This is one of the most bonkers stories I think I have seen during this election campaign. Absolutely, totally without foundation. 'It seems to be based on the word of a single Wikipedia anonymous editor who, for all I know, is a Labour Party apparatchik.' An investigation by Wikipedia claimed the Contribsx account ‘is a ‘sockpuppet of Grant Shapps’ previous accounts on Wikipedia’. Sockpuppet refers to a fake online identity used ‘for an improper purpose’ and is banned on the site. Among the changes revealed include information about Miss Greening, who had disagreed with Mr Shapps over his support for a third runway at Heathrow. In September 2013 the user said she ‘failed to vote in a critical parliamentary division about military action in Syria’ as she failed to notice the division bell had sounded, despite being in the House of Commons. The user also made edits on Mr Crosby in March and August last year, at times when there were reports of splits between the two men. Mr Shapps took the blame after the 2014 Budget over a ‘patronising’ picture he tweeted about cuts in beer tax and bingo which would help ‘hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy’. Contribsx edited Mr Shapps’ Wikipedia page to suggest he had unfairly taken the blame for the picture, which was the fault of Mr Crosby and Chancellor George Osborne. In September 2013, Contribsx added these passages to Justine Greening's Wikipedia entry, highlighting her opposition to the expansion of Heathrow and an embarrassing incident in the House of Commons . The user added the highlighted text about the gay marriage bill to Dominic Grieve's page . Mr Shapps's Wikipedia page stated that he had edited the site 'removing negative information', as shown in the highlighted text top image, but Contribsx changed it to cast the minister in a better light . A recent Contribsx edit, on Easter Sunday this year, changed the page of Karl Turner, the shadow attorney general, adding a reference to the Labour MP having ‘admitted breaking House of Commons rules by sending out invitations to a £45-a-head Labour party fundraising event from parliamentary email’. Two weeks earlier Mr Turner had called on Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate Mr Shapps over his denials that he had continued to use the pseudonym Michael Green while he was an MP. Wikipedia is like a normal encyclopedia but its pages can be created and edited online by anyone. Volunteer administrators moderate the site and monitor changes. Changes to pages create an audit trail which can be linked back to users. Labour frontbencher Jon Ashworth said: ‘This is another embarrassing episode in the saga of Grant Shapps. It’s about time we had some answers, from him and from David Cameron who appointed him to run the Tory campaign.’ Liberal Democrat campaign chairman Paddy Ashdown sent a light-hearted press release that read: ‘Grant is a wonderful guy - he is a credit to the Conservative Party, a fine sportsman and reads a book a day. We could all learn a lot from him. Quite simply, a colossus.’ The press release noted that it had been ‘edited by Wikipedia user Contribsx’. Mr Shapps's own Wikipedia page was edited by Contribsx in March 2014 to shift the blame for a controversial tweet on the Budget to George Osborne and Lynton Crosby; the passage in question is pictured before and after the edit . A passage added to Vince Cable's page by Contribsx drew attention to his alleged disloyalty to Nick Clegg . The highlighted passage appeared on Labour MP Karl Turner's Wikipedia page after it was edited by Contribsx earlier this month . In a statement released last night, Mr Shapps said: 'It is untrue from start to finish, and was quite likely dreamt up by the Labour press office. Sadly it is typical of the smears coming from those who would rather not debate policy and substance.' A spokesman from Wikimedia UK, the UK charity that supports Wikipedia, told The Guardian: 'We would welcome any MPs who choose to become editors, and are happy to provide training sessions to anyone who wants to learn. 'However, the Wikipedia project is founded on trust, and anyone who tries to deceive our volunteers and readers in order to further their own ends should think very carefully about the morality of what they're doing. Eventually, the public will find out.' The Tory chairman who gave himself a false identity . Tory chairman Grant Shapps is nicknamed the Duracell bunny for his seemingly unstoppable energy and his willingness to appear on any TV show to defend the government. But it is another name – Michael Green – for which he has become infamous in recent years. Green was an alter ego that Mr Shapps used to promote get rich quick products before he became an MP. The revelation that he had used the alias even prompted a man to change his name to Michael Green by deed poll to stand against Mr Shapps in his Welwyn Hatfield seat in next month’s election, in the hope of embarrassing him. Grant Shapps, pictured, created the alter ego Michael Green as part of a get-rich-quick scheme . It all adds to the perception of many of his political rivals that there is something not quite to be trusted about him. Mr Shapps, a 46-year-old father of three, was first elected in 2005. Five years later, he became a housing minister in the incoming Coalition government. Since September 2012, the qualified pilot has been Conservative Party chairman, charged with masterminding a campaign to win the 2015 general election. His supporters say he is an effective media performer; often wheeled out by party high command to defend the party’s policies. As fellow Tory MP Nick Boles said: ‘Somebody said he’s the Duracell bunny of the Conservative party. I did laugh at that because it’s a rather apt description.’ A populist politician, who is a self-confessed fan of restaurant chain Nandos, Mr Shapps is from a different background from many others in his Cabinet, which is often perceived as being populated by public school toffs. Born in Watford, he was schooled at the local grammar school. His cousin is Mick Jones, guitarist of punk rock band The Clash. Mr Shapps’ brother even played with Jones in another band, Big Audio Dynamite. Mr Shapps posted this controversial tweet after last year's Budget and was criticised for allegedly being patronising . Mr Shapps joined the Jewish youth organisation BBYO and later became its national president. At the age of 20 he was in a coma for a week after being involved in a car crash in the US. A decade later he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but went into full remission after chemotherapy. The future Tory politician studied business and finance at Manchester Polytechnic, and upon leaving university he set up a successful printing business. Later he started writing self-help guides for a website called HowToCorp, advising people on how to get rich quick – a job which has earned him a ‘loadsamoney’ nickname. He wrote the books under an alias, Michael Green – and a photograph of him wearing a badge with the name at a US conference came to light in 2012. Last month he had to admit that despite saying he had stopped using the name on election in 2005, he was still using it in summer 2006. Three years ago, claims first came to light that he had allegedly altered his Wikipedia entries; changing sentences which he said were inaccurate – such as that he was a Jehovah’s Witness. It emerged that changes were made from computers in his constituency office. And some have claimed he has followed and de-followed people on Twitter to increase the number of his followers.","Grant Shapps has been accused of altering Wikepedia pages of his rivals .

"The Tennessee Supreme Court postponed execution dates for four inmates, effectively halting all executions while the courts decide whether current protocols for putting people to death are constitutional. Tennessee last executed a prisoner in 2009. Since then, legal challenges and problems obtaining lethal injection drugs have stalled new executions. In 2013 and 2014, the state tried to jump-start the process with a new one-drug lethal injection method and the reinstatement of the electric chair as a backup. The Tennessee Supreme Court has vacated the execution dates of the last four men on the state's death row as new lethal injection methods are challenged. Above, electrocution has been designated as a backup method . Beginning in December 2013, the court set new execution dates for 11 inmates. One inmate died in prison, and the execution dates for the others have been postponed as they approach because of legal challenges to the new methods. On Friday, the court postponed the last of the scheduled execution dates. It will set new dates after the legal questions are settled. States across the country have been struggling to find a method of execution that will stand up to legal challenges. And obtaining lethal injection drugs has been getting harder. As manufacturers have refused to sell drugs to prisons for executions, prison officials across the US have turned to compounding pharmacies, which make drugs specifically for individual clients. But those versions have also become difficult to come by because pharmacists are reluctant to expose themselves to possible harassment. Last month, the American Pharmacists Association adopted a policy discouraging its members from providing drugs for lethal injections, saying that runs contrary to the role of pharmacists as health care providers. Death row inmates challenging Tennessee's lethal injection method recently submitted an affidavit from University of Utah College of Pharmacy professor James H. Ruble that questions whether even a willing compounding pharmacist could provide the pentobarbital that Tennessee and several other states need for executions. Leroy Hall Jr, 48 (left) and Nicholas Todd Sutton, 53 (right) were both convicted of murder in 1991 and 1985, respectively. They no longer have dates for execution in Tennessee . Donald Strouth, 56 (left) and Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman, 64 (right) were also both convicted of murder, though the European Union has called for Abdur'Rahman, who is believed to be mentally ill, to be allowed to live . Ruble says in the affidavit that the main ingredient for pentobarbital is unavailable from the six primary commercial sources that compounding pharmacists buy their ingredients from. The Tennessee Supreme Court's recent ruling will vacate the execution dates for Leroy Hall Jr, 48, Donald Wayne Strouth, 56, Nicholas Todd Sutton, 53, and Abu-Ali Abdur’Rahman, 64. Hall was convicted of premeditated murder and aggravated arson after burning his ex-girlfriend to death in 1991. Strouth was convicted of murdering a clothing store owner in 1978 by slitting his throat after he was knocked unconscious with a rock. Sutton was sentenced to death for stabbing a fellow inmate to death in 1985 after originally being sent to prison for child molestation. Abdur'Rahman, formerly James Lee Jones,  received his death penalty sentence for the murder of a Nashville cocaine dealer in 1986 while he was a remember of a militant Christian group looking to eliminate drugs from its neighborhood. The case of Abdur'Rahman, who was reportedly seriously abused by his parents as a child, has drawn international attention and the European Union called for a stay. He is believed to be mentally ill and had ineffective counsel during his trial, according to his website. There are 69 people on Tennessee's death row. The Tennessee Supreme Court (pictured) is waiting for verdicts about the constitutionality of the lethal injection drug pentobarbital . Tennessee last year reinstated electrocution as an alternative if lethal injection drugs are unavailable or a court rules the procedure unconstitutional. But that change has brought yet another legal challenge. Other states of the 31 with the death penalty are considering their own alternatives. Utah last month reinstated the firing squad as a backup method if it can't obtain lethal injection drugs. In Oklahoma, lawmakers approved nitrogen gas as a backup execution method. The state's Republican Governor Mary Fallin supports the death penalty but has not said whether she will sign the bill. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf suspended his state's death penalty in February, citing the inefficiency of long court proceedings and expense. Ohio and Georgia are delaying all of their executions while investigation their lethal injection drug protocols. The US Supreme Court will hear a case later this month about the first substance in a so-called 'three drug cocktail', which is supposed to render the person being executed unconscious so they will not feel pain for the second two drugs. Scrutiny on the death penalty has increased since an execution using the drug, midazolam, resulted in an Oklahoma inmate writhing in presumed pain before dying 43 minutes after the procedure began. Tennessee uses only one drug in its protocol, the sedative pentobarbital. There are 69 people in death row in the state, according to the Department of Corrections. The Tennessee Supreme Court order said that their execution dates have previously been vacated for legal challenges.","Tennessee Supreme Court vacates execution dates for four men .

"Jessica Silva has spoken about why she had to kill her abusive husband and revealed she hopes his family can one day forgive her for what she did. In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother’s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica’s parents).

'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said ""it was just a rash"", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals ""my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness"". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, ""you're fat, you're ugly"", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said ""it was just a rash"". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard .

'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that.

'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how ""I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her"". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now’. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear. 'I'm thinking that the amount of women who will watch this and know exactly what she is going through and went through. 'It's a fact that the woman is usually the one who ends up dying. 'But she told it to send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence.'

"As a society we believe that our political allegiance depends on which party best marries up with our needs and values, and that these are shaped by our life experiences. But research with twins suggests picking who to vote for in an election might have more to do with your genes than the policies of the parties. To put this to the test, the Department of Twin Research, which hosts the biggest adult twin registry in the UK, recently performed a poll of voting preferences. Deciding who you will vote for may have more to do with your family than who won the leaders debate (above) finds study which looked at the voting habits of twins born in the UK. The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences . The twins were all born in the UK and were broadly representative of the UK population. The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences so we can draw broader conclusions about people’s voting habits. Twins provide a unique natural experiment for research. Identical twins share 100 per cent of their genes, while non-identical twins - like non-twin siblings - share about 50 per cent. Both identical and non-identical twins normally share the same environment while growing up. Twin studies are useful for exploring whether a trait is forged in the genes, passed down or by the environment a person is living in. As identical twins share exactly the same DNA, traits produced by genes should appear in both twins. However in non-identical twins the DNA will not be the same and so differences can occur. In most cases twins should have shared the same environment when growing up too. So by comparing the differences and similarities between identical and non-identical twins it may be possible to unravel whether a trait is environmental or cultural. However, as twins grow up they can be influenced by different groups of friends, cultural experiences and points of view. This can make it difficult to unpick the influence of environment over genetics. In the case of political views, these can also run strongly in families as they tend to share the same socioeconomic background and parents can often impress their political support upon their children. However, the study of twins found identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins. Assuming they had similar upbringings and experiences through adulthood, this would suggest there is an underlying genetic influence for political alignment. By comparing the differences and similarities between them the researchers said they can identify how much of a quirk, disease, or trait is due to a genetic predisposition or environmental and cultural factors. Because twin studies adjust for culture and upbringing, they are an ideal way to study political allegiances. The researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins (comprising responses from 612 full pairs) in March 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged. They told the researchers whether they intended to vote, what their political party of choice was, and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders. They found that voting Conservative, or not, is strongly influenced by genetics. When it came to voting Tory, they found that 57 per cent of the variability - differences or similarity - between people’s voting preferences were due to genetic effects. This percentage is called heritability. That means the identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins - suggesting an underlying genetic influence was stronger than environmental or random factors. For UKIP voting preferences, there was also a moderately strong heritability of 51 per cent. This was closely followed by Labour and the Green Party both with 48 per cent. The exception seemed to be voting for the Liberal Democrats, which was affected entirely by environment with no genetic influence. Identical twins showed exactly the same level of disparity in preference for the Lib Dems as non-identical twins. Geography also played a possible role - as voting for the SNP in Scotland was also completely environmental. These latest results from UK data confirm the trends found in previous research carried out in the US. The researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins in March 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged. They told the researchers whether they intended to vote, what their political party of choice was, and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders . Voting for the Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, pictured above after voting at the last General Election with his wife Samantha, tended to have the strongest heritability according to a study of UK twins . A 2008 survey of 682 pairs of middle-aged twins from the Minnesota Twin Registry showed that self-reported political ideology and right-wing authoritarianism were consistently more similar in the identical twins than fraternal twins. Previous studies have also shown strong genetic influences on right-wing views, be they for or against. 'We and others have demonstrated consistent genetic influences on all measurable aspects of our personalities,' said the researchers. 'The consensus is that these political leanings are mainly due to the genetic makeup of our underlying personalities.' 'Despite this, our survey shows that whether we intend to vote or not does not seem to be influenced by genes and personality. That decision appears to be entirely shaped by environmental factors.' The popularity of Nick Clegg (above), leader of the Liberal Democrats seemed to be heritable, although voting for this party was not heritability and appeared to be influenced by the environment alone, the study showed . The question of whether a leader would make a good prime minister produced mixed responses. David Cameron had the stronger genetic influence on opinions, with 50 per cent heritability, followed by Nick Clegg at 37 per cent. Views on all the other party leaders were purely environmental. Psychology studies have shown our sub-conscious biases for leaders who are tall and with round symmetrical faces so maybe this also plays a role in our choices. But even if we do see party leaders differently, the findings of this study suggest that our choices at the polling booth may not be as free or rational as we would like to believe. Something to think about when you approach the ballot box. Professor Tim Spector is the Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King's College London .

"Burying the dead along with a human sacrifice was common in ancient Korea. But an unusual tomb dating to between the 5th and 6th century seems to hold the remains of two lovers, one of whom may have been killed so the pair could lie together for eternity. The skeletons were found on top of one another in the tomb from Korea’s Silla Dynasty, leading some experts suggesting that the set-up could even have been designed to show two people having sex. An unusual tomb dating to between the 5th and 6th century seems to hold the remains of two lovers, one of whom may have been killed so the pair could lie together for eternity. Here, the bones of the two people can be seen on top of one another, leading some experts to suggest the set-up was designed to imitate sex . Archaeologists are almost certain that the tomb was intended for a noblewoman and believe that the man she is lying with may have been killed so he could be buried with her. The tomb is made of soil and stone and was discovered last December in Hwangnam-dong, a neighbourhood of Gyeongju City in South Korea,Korea Joongang Daily reported. It was the capital of ancient Silla for almost 1,000 years and is known for its intricate gold ornaments and Buddhist temples. The remains of the two people, including leg bones and teeth, were found in the main chamber of the tomb and are thought to have died between the ages of 20 and 30. Experts believe the tomb was intended for the woman, because her body is carefully positioned to face the sky and she was buried with gold earrings, indicating her high status. A belt, beaded necklace and jade green jewels were also found with her skeleton. It is not known whether she died naturally or was killed. Archaeologists are almost certain that the tomb was intended for a noblewoman and believe that the man she is lying with may have been killed so he could be buried with her. The position of the skeletons is shown above . It's thought that the tomb was intended for a noblewoman, based on the positioning of her skeleton and objects found with her body, such as gold earrings (pictured). In contrast, no precious possessions were found with the male body, leading experts to speculate that he was a human sacrifice and possibly, her lover . Both the woman and the man in the tomb are estimated to be between the ages of 20 and 30 when they died, or were killed. The woman is thought to have been a noblewoman, based on the fact that her body was positioned on its back in the tomb, and she was buried with precious items such as gold earrings and jade. A sword and horse harness was discovered in another room of the tomb, indicating she was used to riding a horse and carrying a weapon, which was not unusual during the Silla Dynasty, which sometimes had women rulers. The man would have been the woman's lover, servant or body guard and it is likely that he was killed to be buried with her. Human sacrifices were buried in tombs at the time so they could act as guards in the afterlife. But when males were killed, they were usually placed at the feet of the person whom the tomb was intended for, or outside the main chamber, indicating that the man was of special interest to the noblewoman. The fact that the bones lie on top of each other have  led experts to think that the couple were lovers. Some even say that their bodies were positioned to make it look like they were having sex. In contrast, the man is believed to be a human sacrifice and his bones are positioned on top of hers. While male sacrifices were rare but not unheard of at the time, the set up in tomb is thought to be unique. Silla history expert, Professor Lee Han-sang of Daejeon University, told The Chosun Ilbo: ‘The man could have been a servant, bodyguard or lover’. ‘The discovery is important because it shows an unknown type of burial of the living with the dead in the Silla period.’ Kim Kwon-il, a researcher at The Foundation of Silla Cultural Heritage Research, said: ‘Male sacrifices were often buried in the room where the artefacts were, as guards, so to speak, for the dead.’ In the Silla tomb, the position of the teeth indicate that the man and woman’s heads laid next to each other. The only bodies previously found in main chambers, show that human sacrifices were often positioned at the feet of the person whom the tomb was intended for. Some historians believe that the couple were deliberately arranged to make it look as if they were having sex, Yonhap News Agency reported. The man’s thigh bones were found on top of the woman’s, indicating that they could have been locked in an embrace when they were buried. However, researchers at the foundation say that t's more likely that the man may have been buried on a wooden frame above her body, which decayed over time, so his bones became mingled with hers. Explicit clay dolls with large penises or breasts have previously been found and belong to the Silla, supporting some claims that the burial could have been posed to look sexual. In another room of the tomb, artefacts including a sword, harness and pottery was recovered, indicating that the woman probably rode horses and carried a weapon. No artefacts linked to the man were found, reinforcing the belief he was a sacrifice. Tombs from the early part of the Silla Dynasty are rare and just 24 are known to have been discovered. The tomb is made of soil and stone and was discovered in Hwangnam-dong (shown on the map with a red marker), a neighbourhood of Gyeongju City in South Korea, last December .","Remains dating to the 5th century were found in tomb in Hwangnam-dong .

"They may have millions in the bank and the most prestigious beauty houses bending over backwards to gift them products, but our favourite A-listers don't turn their noses up at cheap and simple tricks when it comes to beautifying. From Shailene Woodley colouring her lips with roasted beetroot to Kate Moss submerging her face in cucumber water, it seems the stars' best kept beauty hacks start in the kitchen. Insurgent actress Shailene, who is a big fan of natural beauty, has confessed to cooking the vibrant vegetable to use it as an alternative to lipstick. Insurgent actress Shailene Woodley colours her lips with roasted beetroot rather than lipstick... and she's not the only celebrity who favours natural beauty products . She told Bon Appetit magazine: 'It's totally awesome. Beets are amazing. If you roast them you'll get a better lipstick. 'They're not as potent and they don't stain the same way if they're raw. So I roast them first and then just dab a little of the juice on my lips with my finger.' The 23-year-old star isn't the only celebrity who swears by unusual products when it comes to looking her best. Gossip Girl actress Blake Lively  revealed the secret behind her glossy blonde locks comes from her fridge. Blake Lively says her mother taught her to slather mayonnaise on the bottom half of her hair before showering to avoid it drying out . She told Byrdie: 'My mum taught me this really great beauty tip. She used to put oil or mayonnaise on the bottom half of her hair before she would shower. 'That way, when she would shampoo, the soap wouldn't strip the bottom of the hair and dry it out, making it brittle.' Meanwhile, 12 Years A Slave actress Lupita Nyong'o combats her dry skin with oily vegetables. She told Harper's Bazaar last year: 'Avocado oil is a big thing for me. I discovered it last year, and at first I was using it just on my body, but then I realised it works on my face, and my hair too, for that matter! 'Especially in the wintertime, when my skin is drier, it really seeps in and leaves it nice and lush.' Lupita Nyong'o combats her dry skin with  avocado and loves to use it on her locks, too . Blonde-haired bombshell Scarlett Johansson is famed for her china doll skin and plump red lips. And while the actress can afford to splurge on a plethora of skincare treatments, the A-lister has been guarding a rather cheap and unusual beauty secret. The Avengers star has revealed that she uses apple cider vinegar as a cleanser. The 30-year-old slathers the natural product across her face to keep her spots at bay. While the actress did admit that the product - which is priced at around £1.50 in stores such as Holland & Barrett- can be harsh on skin, it has actually been effective in treating her spots. Speaking to Contactmusic about her beauty secrets, she revealed: 'I researched natural skincare and found that apple cider vinegar is really effective. 'Using it as a toner can be harsh, but if you have breakouts it can be really healing. 'It's a little bit stinky but if you're not sleeping over at your boyfriend's it's really effective!,' she added. Scarlett Johansson has revealed that she uses apple cider vinegar as a cleanser and to keep her spots at bay . Natural beauty Catherine Zeta- Jones is happy to use her own homegrown beauty secrets, such as rubbing honey and salt on her skin to beat wrinkles, washing her hair in beer and brushing her teeth with a strawberry. In an interview with Now Magazine back in 2009, the actress admitted that the answer to preserving her youthful appearance lies as much in her kitchen as her make-up bag. 'I rub a mixture of honey and salt all over my body to moisturise and exfoliate,' she said. 'You wash it off and your skin is gorgeous. Also, I love to eat an apple after a meal, just to cleanse my teeth - they always look polished afterwards.' If there aren't any apples in the fruit bowl, a strawberry will suffice. 'The juice or pulp of strawberries contains malic acid which serves as an astringent and can lighten surface stains,' she explained. 'Pineapples work the same way.' However, while her rather unusual beauty regime appears to have its benefits, she admits it has its drawbacks too. 'I do condition my hair with honey and beer. 'I smell like the bottom of a beer barrel for days afterwards but it's very good for the hair.' Kate Moss submerges her face into a sinkful of iced cucumber water in the morning to perk up her skin . As someone who likes the odd cigarette and night out on the town, many are left wondering how does Kate Moss maintain such a glowing visage? The supermodel submerges her face into a sinkful of iced cucumber water in the morning to perk up her skin. 'If I wake up looking tired and puffy, I fill a sink with ice and cucumber and submerge my face. 'It tightens everything making you look and feel instantly awake. It is a bit Joan Crawford - but it works!,' she told Stylist magazine. Cucumber and the skin share the same level of hydrogen, so the fruit can easily help to cure problem areas.","Shailene Woodley colours her lips with roasted beetroot .

"Nick Gunn: He had affairs with women on his rounds . A councillor who stabbed his wife nine times with a kitchen knife after discovering her affair with the postman was yesterday found guilty of attempted murder. Joseph O'Riordan, 76, left his wife Mandy, 47, with life-threatening injuries to the chest, torso and back after flying into a rage over her infidelity. But today it can be revealed that her married postman lover, Nick Gunn, 41, had previous affairs with women on his rounds. While his wife last night refused to discuss her unfaithful husband, a former girlfriend revealed their relationship ended because he had been sleeping with a woman on his rounds. She also told how when she confronted him about the affair, he confessed that he had cheated on a previous partner with a woman he had been delivering post to. Mr Gunn started an affair with Mrs O'Riordan last year and the romance led to her husband placing a GPS tracker on her car as he hired a private detective to watch her movements. The couple had been married for ten years and had attended the Queen's garden party in 2013 for O'Riordan's work on the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Yesterday he showed no emotion as a jury took just two hours and ten minutes to reach a unanimous verdict and find him guilty of trying to kill his wife. Brighton Crown Court had heard how he repeatedly stabbed his wife in their bedroom on October 22 last year, after arguing about the affair. The pair lived in a ground floor flat where Mrs O'Riordan worked as an estate manager on a residential home in Polegate, East Sussex. Mrs O'Riordan and Mr Gunn – nicknamed 'Tommy' by friends and family – had known each other for a number of years when he lived in the Sussex village and worked as a postman. Guilty: Joseph O'Riordan, 74, stabbed his wife Amanda, 47, (pictured together above) nine times with a kitchen knife at the home they shared in Polegate, East Sussex, after discovering her affair with postman Nick Gunn . Last year – despite having married three years ago and having moved with his wife Sara Saunders to Portslade, near Brighton – Mr Gunn and Mrs O'Riordan became lovers. But she was not his first, it is claimed. A 39-year-old former partner, who did not want to be named, said: 'We split up because he was having an affair. I saw that he had made a comment on Facebook about a 'lover' and I knew he wasn't talking about me so I confronted him. 'He admitted he had been sleeping with a woman he had been delivering post to. He told me that something similar had happened with a previous girlfriend as well. We were together for six years, and this might have happened more than once. I didn't find out until July 2011.' After that affair Mr Gunn married schoolteacher Miss Saunders, who said last night: 'I'm still married to him at the moment and I'm not interested in talking about him.' O'Riordan (left) was convicted of attempted murder today after a jury took just two hours and ten minutes to unanimously find him guilty of trying to kill his wife with a nine-inch kitchen knife (right) in October last year . O'Riordan was sitting on Polegate Town Council when he grew suspicious that his wife, Amanda, 47, was having an affair and hired a private investigator to follow her which confirmed her relationship with Mr Gunn . Mr Gunn has a Facebook page and describes himself on Twitter as: 'A Gamer, a Lover, a Postman and a friend of Death.' As the affair developed last year, O'Riordan first hired a detective to watch his wife and then set up a GPS tracker on her car. The £300 tracker reported back via text to O'Riordan's phone whenever his wife left home and gave the exact location of her vehicle. On one day alone on October 9 the tracker sent a total of 35 notifications to O'Riordan as his wife visited Mr Gunn at his then home in Portslade. O'Riordan used to run nightclubs in the South East before he retired and was also a councillor in East Sussex and became president of his local Royal British Legion. Mrs O'Riordan was a 23-year-old divorcee when she met the older O'Riordan in 1991. They married in 2004 and were seen by many friends as the 'perfect, loving couple'. Friends and family of Mrs O'Riordan arrived at Brighton Magistrates' Court (left) for the verdict today while O'Riordan's son Liam - from a previous marriage - also attended the hearing to see his father convicted . But as O'Riordan became older his wife essentially became his 'carer' and the court heard how she wanted more 'freedom'. Prosecutor Dale Sullivan said O'Riordan had 'clearly lied' when he told police officers repeatedly that he had stabbed his wife because he had 'just found out she was having an affair'. In reality he had known for weeks that she was seeing Mr Gunn. When Mrs O'Riordan gave evidence last week she did so from behind a screen so she did not have to see O'Riordan. She told the court: 'I loved Joe. I didn't want to hurt him. I never wanted to hurt him – even now.' O'Riordan is due to be sentenced today. Mr Gunn was unavailable for comment. O'Riordan will be sentenced for attempted murder at Brighton Crown Court (pictured above) tomorrow .","Councillor Joseph O'Riordan found guilty of attempting to murder his wife .

"The Revered Al Sharpton appeared on Sunday in North Charleston and is expected to attend a vigil for Walter Scott, the black driver who was fatally shot by a white police officer after he fled a traffic stop. Rev. Sharpton preached at the Charity Missionary Baptist Church and addressed the Scott case and the need for reform around national policing legislation during his sermon. Elected officials and police from North Charleston were in attendance and South Carolina Senator Marlon Kimpson was also there to hear Sharpton speak. Scroll down for video . The Revered Al Sharpton delivered a sermon and addressed the Walter Scott situation on Sunday morning . North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey (left), Police Chief Eddie Driggers (center) and Sharpton 'discussed the Scott shooting' on Sunday before the reverend spoke at Charity Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina . Sharpton wrote on Facebook: 'Joining us this morning is Mayor Keith Summey, Sheriff Al Cannon, Senator Marlon Kimpson, SCLC Leader Michael Steele, North Charleston Police [Chief] Eddie Driggers, and Assistant Police Chief Reggie Burgess.' The officers and elected officials listened 'intently' to what Sharpton had to say as he gave credit to Mayor Summey for firing Michael Slager, the officer who killed Scott, according to the Post and Courier. During the sermon, Sharpton said: 'When he's wrong ... we protest. 'When he's right, we should have the same courage to say he's right. 'Let us use this hour to not only change what's going on in North Charleston. 'North Charleston, that's known as a place of intolerance, can be the place that could set a new tone in policing all over the United States. 'Maybe now between a southern white mayor and a forgiving black mother, maybe this nation will deal with this.' The civil rights leader is also expected to attend a vigil near the scene of the Scott shooting on Sunday afternoon. Sharpton denied Scott's family barred him from attending his funeral on Saturday because it would cause a 'circus' of media attention. Allegations that Scott's family wanted nothing to do with Sharpton were published by the New York Daily News. In response, Sharpton said: 'There has never been a discussion about me attending or participating in the funeral on Saturday, since everyone knows that [National Action Network's] convention with thousands of delegates is happening in New York and doesn't end until Saturday night.' Scott's casket was wrapped in an American flag at a funeral home in Summerville, South Carolina, on Saturday . Scott (left) was killed by Michael Slage (right).

Judy Scott wipes her eyes as she looks at her son's casket during his burial service in Summerville yesterday . Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral for Scott, 50, on Saturday in Summerville, north of North Charleston where the shooting took place. Sharpton remained in New York where his National Action Network was wrapping up its national convention. Slager, 33, the North Charleston officer who fired eight times at Scott's back as he fled from a traffic stop, has been charged with murder and dismissed from the police force. Slager pulled Scott's black Mercedes-Benz over for a broken tail light. Video from the dashboard camera in Slager's police cruiser recorded a respectful exchange between the two men before the officer returned to his patrol car. A few minutes later, after being told by Slager to stay in the Mercedes, the man emerged from his car and ran off. Scott, who was apparently unarmed, had a history of arrests for failing to pay child support. A cellphone video taken by a bystander showed the men in a brief tussle before Scott ran off again, Slager fired his gun and Scott slumped into the grass. There was a gap between the two videos, however, as the officer was not wearing a body camera. Scott's shooting was one of the latest in a series of killings that have stoked a national outcry over police use of force against African Americans. Last year, the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Missouri, and choking death of a black man in New York City triggered a wave of demonstrations across the country.","Reverend Sharpton was expected to appear Sunday in North Charleston .

"A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 68 per cent had hurt themselves doing odd jobs or decorating. But many admit they know where they are going wrong . If you are thinking of attempting some DIY this weekend watch out – nearly seven in ten of us end up injured. A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 68 per cent said they or their partner had hurt themselves doing odd jobs or decorating. Two in five had injured their back, one in five had cut themselves and one in ten had suffered side effects from inhaling chemical fumes. A careless one in 30 suffered after getting paint or chemicals in their eyes and eight in 100 had fallen off a ladder, said research for the makers of pain relief brands Deep Heat and Deep Freeze. But a significant number of hapless handymen and women know where they're going wrong. One in 10 said they failed to follow instructions or research the right way to do the job, while one in five came to grief taking a shortcut. Men are a third more likely than women to try to cut corners when doing a job. Top of the nation's to-do list is DIY and decorating, with eight in 10 Brits catching up on everything from odd jobs to major makeovers round the home . However, it seems DIYers are failing to prepare properly for a weekend of exertions. More than a third confessed they did not prepare their bodies for the physical demands of their day of DIY. A similar number admitted they weren't used to physical work or were too out of shape for hard graft.

"Prosecutor Nafir Afzal said hundreds of British teenagers see ISIS as 'pop idols' like One Direction and Justin Bieber . Hundreds of British teenagers see ISIS as 'pop idols' like One Direction and Justin Bieber, putting children in danger of being radicalised, the country's most senior Muslim prosecutor has said. Nafir Afzal said teenagers are at risk of 'jihadimania' and warned that 'another 7/7' could happen unless Britain makes sweeping changes to the way it tackles terrorism. Mr Afzal, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the north-west, said children are 'manipulated' by Islamists and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation. He told the Guardian's Nigel Bunyan: 'The boys want to be like them and the girls want to be with them. That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image. 'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers – they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.' Mr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services. The prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack. He believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures. 'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension – a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said. Mr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation . The prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right) 'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.' Hundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain. His comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group. Waheed Ahmed, 21 – the son of councillor Shakil Ahmed – is said to be a member of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which advocates a global Muslim caliphate, similar to the one established by ISIS. Ahmed, a politics student at Manchester University, was arrested by Turkish police at the border town of Reyhanli last week. He was one of a group of nine detained, all from Rochdale, including four children aged from one to 11. They could be flown back to the UK today. Nafir Afzal last month quit the CPS despite being cleared of allegations suggesting he texted a defendant in a case. In the four-line email, Mr Afzal said there was 'no secret reason' why he was leaving after 25 years with the CPS. Mr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences. This included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions. He said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice. More recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall. He also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse. The prosecutor last year claimed that there would be a fresh wave of Operation Yewtree arrests concerning the abuse of children by celebrities. He said: 'This is a growing industry. There are more arrests scheduled over the next few weeks. Some are very high-profile figures.' Mr Afzal began his CPS career in central London and went on to be awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community.

"A warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe 1.4 million years ago, a new study suggests. Researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors, the hominins, had been halted by colder and drier temperatures. But as conditions warmed, they were able to branch out from Africa into Spain, and ultimately spread across Europe. Spanish researchers say climate change impacted human migration. Until 1.4 million years ago it was too cold to inhabit southeast Spain. But then the climate warmed to 13°C (55°F) and became more humid. This enabled hominins (stock image shown) - our distant ancestors - to move to new regions . The research was led by Dr Jordi Agusti from the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA). Published in the Journal of Human Evolution, the paper suggests climate change affected the amount of resources available. There have been various theories put forward over the years about the diet of our early ancestors, but a study from Oxford University published last year claimed to have finally settled the debate. An ancient human ancestor known as ‘Nutcracker Man’ lived mainly on a diet of tiger nuts, worms and grasshoppers, according to research. Scientists believe this diet explains why the ancient hominin relative, called Paranthropus boisei, which lived in East Africa between 2.4 and 1.4 million years ago, had such distinctively powerful jaws and large, flat molar teeth. The theory is based on analysis of the Barranco León site in the Guadix-Baza Basin in southeast Spain. Here, simple Oldowan tools have previously been found, linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago, reported Popular Archaeology. But they were not able to migrate to this region until conditions improved. The researchers said that the early Pleistocene era (the era lasted from 2.59 million to 11,700 years ago) was characterised by colder and drier weather. This ‘possibly impeded the settlement of this region by the early hominin population from the southern Caucasus,’ the researchers wrote. But shortly afterwards, ‘when the climatic conditions were again favourable, a hominin presence is suddenly evidenced.’ The theory is based on analysis of the Barranco León site in the Guadix-Baza Basin in southeast Spain, shown by the grey marker on this map. Here, simple Oldowan tools have previously been found, linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago . The Acheulean tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - followed the more primitive Oldowan period. Tools at the time included large stone hand axes (stock image shown) made from flint and quartzite, used to scavenge from carcasses . It should be noted that the warming climate referred to here is on a vastly longer time scale than modern climate change. At the time 1.4 million years ago, though, temperatures warmed above 13°C (55°F) and humidity increased, allowing hominins to inhabit the region - scavenging carcasses in the region with the help of tools. ‘The data reported here clearly support the idea that the early hominin occupation of Europe was strongly constrained by climatic and environmental conditions, rather than by physiography or cultural factors,’ the researchers wrote.","Spanish researchers say climate change impacted human migration .

"Is this the world’s safest bike? Its designers certainly think so. Boasting front and rear lights, rear view mirrors and even a car horn, the team behind the electric Babel Bike say it is unprecedented in its approach to safety. And perhaps most noticeable of all is the roll cage that surrounds the cyclist - keeping them safe against trucks and buses turning into them. Scroll down for video . London-based designer claims to have made the world's safest bike. Called the Babel Bike it has a host of features including a roll cage. Crispin Sinclair (shown with the bike) is seeking £50,000 of funding on site Indiegogo. The bike also has foot protectors and an electric motor . The Babel Bike was designed by London-based Crispin Sinclair - son of the famous British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, whose 1985 Sinclair C5 bike turned out to be somewhat of a flop. Crispin will be hoping a similar fate does not befall his invention though - and hopes the array of safety features will appeal to safety-conscious cyclists. He is seeking £50,000 ($74,000) of funding on Indiegogo to bring his dream to fruition. The price might be a bit much for some, with the non-electric version retailing for £2,499 ($3,693), and the full electric version £3,499 ($5,170). Both are £500 ($740) less if bought through Indiegogo. May 2016 is the estimated delivery date for the bike at the moment. The bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back, with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike’s innards. It doesn’t rely on pedal power alone, but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the US and 15.5mph in the EU. ‘In both the US and the EU you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor can’t assist at higher speeds (by law),’ the team notes on their Indiegogo page. The bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back, with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike’s innards . There is a holder for a smartphone on the front so you can keep track of vital stats . The controls for the Shimano 250-watt electric assist motor are located on the handlebars, and provide up to 50 per cent assistance. The battery has a range of 50 to 80 miles (80 to 130km). The bike is recharged by either removing the battery and recharging it at home, or with an optional electric-car-charging lead. At the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors, which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock.

But Crispin notes in a video that even all these safety features ‘won’t help in a collision with a turning bus or truck at a junction - by far the single biggest cause of cycling fatalities.’ Transport for London says that 65 per cent of all bike fatalities in London are caused by trucks and buses cutting across cyclists. So the team designed a roll cage for the bike, which prevents it getting trapped under a vehicle. If a truck or bus comes into contact with the bike, it will hit the roll cage first and ensure the cyclist is pushed to relative safety – or at least, that’s the plan. The side of the seat – also detachable – has foam pads to cushion against side impacts, while the shape has apparently being designed with aerodynamics in mind by former Red Bull F1 engineers. ‘Our dream is to put a million more cyclists on our roads, and therefore take a million cars off them, and to do that we need to give cyclists their safety back,’ said Crispin. Whether the bike will prove to be more of a success than his father’s invention remains to be seen, though.","London-based designer claims to have made the world's safest bike .

"Boris Johnson will move centre stage in the Conservative election campaign next week as the party struggles to open up a consistent poll lead over Labour. The London Mayor, who has been largely invisible at a national level despite being the second best known Tory in the country, will make a high-profile joint appearance with David Cameron, sources said. There have been growing calls from Conservative MPs for Mr Johnson to be ‘weaponised’ as the party seeks to break away from Labour. High profile: Boris Johnson (pictured at a gin distillery in London on Friday) will move centre stage in the Conservative election campaign next week . While many polls indicate deadlock, one by Survation for the Daily Mirror lifted Tory spirits yesterday by putting their party up four points in a week and moving ahead of Labour. The Conservatives were on 34 per cent, with Labour down two on 33 per cent. It is only the second time the Conservatives have been ahead with Survation since the organisation began conducting national polling in 2011. The poll put Ukip on 17 per cent, the Lib Dems on seven per cent and the Greens on three. Last night Lord Bell, the advertising guru who masterminded Margaret Thatcher’s three election victories, was scathing about the Tories’ campaign, saying: ‘It’s dreadful. It’s risk averse. It’s boring. There is no engagement with real voters. There is no passion. ‘Cameron seems to be content with the idea that there will be a hung Parliament. They don’t even seem to be fighting for an overall majority. The campaign seemed to be based on the idea that Ed Miliband couldn’t even tie his own shoelaces properly. When he showed he can there was no Plan B.’ There have been growing calls from Conservative MPs for Mr Johnson to be ‘weaponised’ as the party seeks to break away from Labour . There was surprise that Mr Johnson was not present at this week’s Tory manifesto launch, with Mr Cameron instead introduced by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, Home Secretary Theresa May and Chancellor George Osborne. Internal polling suggests Mr Johnson is by far the most popular senior Tory among Ukip voters, who Mr Cameron has pleaded with to ‘come home’ to his party rather than risk a Labour government propped up by the SNP. Other senior figures told the Daily Mail that David Cameron must underline manifesto pledges aimed at working class voters – such as extending the right-to-buy and promising a tax-free minimum wage. ‘The tax-free minimum wage is the best policy we’ve had in years – but we haven’t heard a word about it since the manifesto,’ said one former minister. Boris Johnson tried a 99 cornet (left) in West Drayton yesterday and visited the Al Falah mosque (right) ‘We should be out selling some of the terrific stuff in the manifesto every day until polling day. It’s not enough to make one good speech. ‘We need to get everybody out there – all the Cabinet – pushing these arguments day after day.’ One senior Tory donor said the campaign was ‘lacklustre’, ‘negative’, and ‘boring’. ‘I am afraid we are paying a terrible price for not having a proper narrative over the last five years. People just don’t know what we stand for any more. ‘Why are we talking only now about extending right to buy? Why is there nothing on immigration? Where is the Cabinet? ‘Why aren’t we using Boris Johnson who is our biggest hitter and actually knows how to win elections?’ The donor added: ‘There is no sense of urgency. We seem to be sleepwalking to defeat praying that the polls might turn in the last week like it did in 1992. ‘If it wasn’t for the SNP surge in Scotland Ed Miliband would be in Downing Street with a comfortable majority. We couldn’t beat Gordon Brown and now it seems we can’t beat Miliband who was supposed to be an even worse leader. ‘With the economy performing so well we should be miles ahead instead we are in danger of boring voters to death.’ The London Mayor, who has been largely invisible at a national level despite being the second best known Tory in the country, will make a high-profile joint appearance with David Cameron, sources said . Some Tories are also complaining that the collapse in party membership has decimated their ground operation in some constituencies and they are being outleafleted by Labour – whose canvas operation has been swelled by thousand of trade unionists – by three to one. Another said the mood was ‘tense’ and there was ‘some dismay’ that the manifesto launch had not given the party ‘lift-off’. ‘The polls have moved a bit in our favour. But if we are to turn the tide decisively, we need to keep the energy up and we should be using Boris more.’ One candidate hoping to be re-elected in a marginal seat said: ‘Boris is doing good stuff on the ground but we should be seeing more of him – he’s box office. Unlike some of our secretaries of state, people actually want to turn out to hear him.’ A Conservative adviser said: ‘We’ve always known this would be an incredibly close election and that a large number of undecided voters will only decide who they want in Downing Street – Cameron or Miliband – at the last minute. ‘You will be seeing more of Boris as we move towards the end of the campaign – that has always been the plan.’ The latest polls suggest a swing back to the Tories, but nothing close to the lead they would need for a Commons majority. A Panelbase poll suggested the Tories had cut a six-point Labour lead to one, while TNS put the party two points ahead, with 34 per cent to Labour’s 32. A YouGov poll, meanwhile, had the two main parties tied on 34 per cent.","Boris Johnson to move centre stage in Tory election campaign next week .

"President Barack . Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro shook hands last night ahead of a historic meeting which may see Cuba declassified as a state sponsor of terrorism. The two leaders, who clasped hands yesterday at a brief meeting, are both attending the Summit of the Americas in Panama. The gesture of friendships is an outward symbol of Obama's project to thaw diplomatic relations with Cuba, which have been frozen since the 1960s. The White House has set expectations for a 'substantive' exchange between Castro, brother of revolutionary leader Fidel, and Obama today. Speculation is high that a result of the exchange could be the official removal of Cuba from the State Department's list of state terror sponsors. That removal would also lift some economic sanctions on Cuba. Scroll down for video . Warmth: President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro shook hands on Friday at a summit in Panama, a symbolically charged gesture as the pair seek to restore ties between the Cold War foes . Until next time: The White House said the two men will have a more robust exchange on Saturday . Obama and Castro have met once before - at the 2013 funeral of Nelson Mandela in South Africa - but today could mark their first robust, in-person meeting. The President's eventual aim is to restore full diplomatic relations . and boost trade and travel between the two countries. Their rapprochement, first unveiled in a historic policy . shift in December, is the central issue at the Summit of the . Americas meeting in Panama. Obama said: 'As we move towards the process of normalization, we'll have . our differences, government to government, with Cuba on many . issues. Just as we differ at times with other nations within the . Americas, just as we differ with our closest allies.' But the 53-year-old Obama, who was not even born when Fidel . and Raul Castro swept to power in Cuba's 1959 revolution, also . said the United States is no longer interested in trying to . impose its will on Latin America. 'The days in which our agenda in this hemisphere so often . presumed that the United States could meddle with impunity, . those days are past,' he said. Apart from a couple of brief, informal encounters, the . leaders of the United States and Cuba have not had any . significant meetings since the Castro brothers toppled . U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista and then steered their . Caribbean country into a close alliance with the Soviet Union. Last time: Obama and Castro are pictured above shaking hands at the funeral of Nelson Mandela, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in December 2013 . Out of the deep freeze: Obama and Castro are expected to meet again on Saturday and talk about their efforts to restore full diplomatic relations and boost trade and travel between the two countries . Gang's all here: President Barack Obama (far right middle row) and Cuba's President Raul Castro (far left middle row) attend the Summit of the Americas opening ceremony . Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos hailed Obama's push . to improve relations with Cuba, saying it was helping to heal a 'blister' that was hurting the region. However, Cuban dissident Guillermo Farinas said civic groups . in Cuba have been sidelined from talks and appealed to Obama to . support their push for more democracy. 'The Cuban government is showing no goodwill ... They don't . want to make any kind of concessions,' he said. Obama, who met with activists from across Latin America, . including two Cuban dissidents, appears to be close to removing . communist-run Cuba from a U.S. list of countries that it says . sponsor terrorism. Its inclusion on the list brings a series of automatic U.S. sanctions and Cuba is insisting it be taken off as a condition . of restoring diplomatic ties. Washington imposed trade sanctions on Cuba from 1960 and . broke off diplomatic relations in 1961, but the . ensuing freeze did it no favors, said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy . national security adviser. 'Our Cuba policy, instead of isolating Cuba, was isolating . the United States in our own backyard,' he noted. The two countries have maintained contact through interests . sections in Havana and Washington since 1977, and in recent . years they have increasingly cooperated on issues such as . migration and drug trafficking. The State Department has now recommended that Cuba be taken . off the terrorism list, a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations . Committee aide said. Obama is expected to agree, although it is . not clear whether he will announce it during the summit. Historic: President Barack Obama (right) waving among Raul Castro other Presidents before the opening ceremony of the VII Americas Summit . Obama has already used his executive authority to ease some . trade and travel restrictions, and is seeking to encourage . nascent small businesses in Cuba by allowing more exports there. But only Congress, controlled by Republicans, can remove the . overall U.S. economic embargo on the island. The rapprochement . by Obama has met some resistance in Washington and . among some influential Cuban-Americans. Critics say Cuba should not be rewarded unless it changes . its one-party political system. While Obama's policy has been widely praised around Latin . America, this was tempered last month when his administration . imposed sanctions on Venezuela, Cuba's closest ally and main . benefactor. That controversy now hangs over the summit this weekend. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro plans to present Obama . with a petition signed by millions of people demanding that the . sanctions be reversed. He is certain to receive support from .

"A girl who believed she had a bad hangover was found to have 13 blood clots in her lungs. Holly Barber, from Manchester, woke up feeling unwell and with chest and neck pains – but chalked it down to heavy drinking a few days before. But when the 25-year-old started coughing up blood she knew it was something serious. She rushed to hospital, where doctors found 13 pulmonary embolisms, blood clots blocking the main artery of her lungs, killing the tissue and stopping her from breathing properly. She was treated with medication but, incredibly, a year later was dealt another blow – when medics found another melon-sized blockage in her right lung. Holly Barber, 25, was horrified to be told she had 13 blood clots in her lungs as she believed  she was suffering was just a bad hangover. She is pictured before (left) and after her diagnosis (right) Ms Barber began coughing up blood and was having difficulty breathing, so rushed to hospital. It was there doctors diagnosed pulmonary embolisms - blood clots that were blocking the arteries in her lungs . She was horrified to be told the blockage was so big she was probably days from death. She now takes blood-thinning medication to prevent future clots, but the shock of the ordeal has led her to completely changed her lifestyle. She has given up drinking and taken up exercise in an effort to lead the healthiest life possible, and wants to encourage other to do the same. Ms Barber, who has set up her own diet business, said: 'I was so scared when I started coughing up blood, I had no idea what was happening to me but I knew it wasn't a hangover. 'I used to love partying with friends but after suffering from 13 blood clots, I knew I needed to change my ways. 'A terrifying experience like this gives you a brand new outlook and makes you appreciate things so much more, I'm lucky to be alive. 'I did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture.' A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. As in Miss Barber's case, it can be life threatening, as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs. A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. This blockage – usually a blood clot – is potentially life threatening, as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs. The symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. But the main symptoms include: . chest pain – a sharp, stabbing pain that may be worse when you breathe in . shortness of breath – this can come on suddenly or develop gradually . coughing – this is usually dry, but may include coughing up blood or mucus that contains blood . feeling faint, dizzy or passing out . A person should visit their GP as soon as possible if you have a combination of these symptoms. If  symptoms are particularly severe, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Source: NHS Choices . The symptoms, feeling dizzy, chest pain, coughing and being short of breath can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. Ms Barber first discovered she was battling with pulmonary embolisms in 2012, when she was 22-years-old. She was feeling weak and ill, but had been heavily drinking and partying a few days before, so she presumed it was just a bad hangover. Then she started coughing up blood, struggling to catch her breath and suffering from chest and neck pains so her mother Carol Mack, 54, and stepfather Bob Tomkins, 57, decided to rush her to hospital. A scan revealed she had 13 blood clots in her lungs, though it was found they had not spread from her legs, where clots normally form. Despite many tests, nothing could explain what had caused her pulmonary embolisms. The only possible risk factor was the contraceptive pill, which she stopped taking straightaway. She was put on Heparin injections – which thin the blood - to prevent any blood clots from reoccurring, as well as other drugs to reduce the pain. Ms Barber said: 'I had to inject myself every month and I was on pain relief for some months after suffering from my blood clots. 'I was constantly anxious for a year and I suffered from panic attacks and anxiety.' Because of this anxiety, when she got a similar pain again in May 2013 - almost exactly a year later - she just thought that she was being paranoid and chose to ignore it. Luckily, she eventually forced herself to go back to hospital and a CT scan revealed she had a melon-sized blockage in her right lung. The blood clot has entered the artery of her right lung after passing through the heart, and had blocked the artery, cutting off blood supply so a large part of the lung tissue around it had died. Ms Barber said: 'It was the size of a melon and almost covered my heart, if I had left it any longer I would have died. A year later, Ms Barber was rushed to hospital again, and doctors found a melon-sized blockage in her lungs. She is pictured here with partner Steven, who she lives with in Manchester . Before her illness (left and right), Ms Barber was a 'party girl' and loved to drink. She has now given up drinking in favour of a healthy lifestyle. 'I did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture', she said . She will now have to take the warfarin, which stops her blood from clotting, for the rest of her life. The shock of being diagnosed twice has meant she has decided to turn her life around. Some doctors advised she shouldn't exercise because the pulmonary embolisms meant her lungs' ability to pump oxygen around the body was reduced. But she has found safe ways to exercise and plans to run the Great Manchester Run in May to show other sufferers that it is possible. She said: 'I'm so thankful to be alive, I have set up my own healthy lifestyle business called Healthy Fit + which helps others make the right lifestyle choices. 'I have never felt better and I hope my story shows others who have suffered from pulmonary Embolisms that they can achieve their fitness goals.' Ms Barber has been with her boyfriend Steven, who works for a solar panel company, for nearly four years and they now have their own flat in Manchester together. But Ms Barber is uncertain whether her reduced lung capacity will mean she will be able to have children. She said: 'I really want children in the future because I am a maternal person but it would be a high risk pregnancy. Ms Barber has now set up her own diet business, hoping to encourage others to take up healthy habits . 'I would have to be in a good condition, hence my healthy lifestyle now.' Dr Noel Snell, Director of Research at the British Lung Foundation, said: 'A pulmonary embolism - better known as a blood clot in the lungs - causes a blockage in a pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. 'Some blood clots can be life-threatening, for example a large clot in the main artery. 'Sometimes people will get multiple small recurrent blood clots and will notice that they become increasingly breathless and experience chest pains - these can be quite difficult to spot and are often diagnosed late.'

"Chances are you've been to Malaga. Well, the airport at any rate. Every year, millions of us pass through on the way to the beaches of the Costa del Sol or palaces of Granada. But, now, the southern Spanish port is having a moment. Thanks to a multi-million pound regeneration project, and several new galleries and museums, this once down-at-heel city has become one of Europe's hippest destinations. Incoming: The Centre Pompidou Malaga, a pop-up version of the Parisian institution, has opened to visitors . Along with a thriving cultural scene, there are good restaurants, great shopping and exciting nightlife. This week saw the opening of Centre Pompidou Malaga, the first of several popup versions of the famous Parisian gallery planned outside France. It is housed in a low-slung white building topped with a giant glass cube in the trendy harbour area. When I turn up, a large crowd is queuing to pay the £6.70 entrance fee to view 90 works by artists such as Miro, Magritte and Picasso on loan from the Pompidou in France, plus an exhibition exploring dance and choreography. There's a brilliant room of self-portraits, including a Francis Bacon and Frida Kahlo. Drawing a big huddle is Kader Attia's striking installation, Ghost — a mass of Muslim women in prayer, made from tin foil. Pompidou is the latest bold step in branding Malaga a 'City of Museums'. Across town, the first overseas branch of St Petersburg State Russian Museum has just opened in a refurbished tobacco factory. Take a good look: Gibralfaro Castle offers fine views of the city, with the Mediterranean as a wide backdrop . Next door is the Malaga Automobile Museum, an extraordinary celebration of cars, fashion and art. By 2016, a Museum of Fine Arts and Archaeology will complete the set. Malaga's Picasso Museum opened in 2003 — a long-held dream of the artist, who was born in the city in 1881. The Automobile Museum in Malaga houses around 90 classic cars, plus displays of haute couture . Round the corner, you can peek into Santiago church where he was baptised. The Picasso Birthplace Museum in the house where he lived until he was ten, contains more paintings, ceramics, early photos, belongings and sketchbooks. What sets Malaga apart — for now, at least — is that all these galleries tend to be uncrowded, refreshingly small, and most in walking distance of each other. That means there's plenty of time to explore Andalusian cuisine. Get in the mood at the buzzing Atarazanas market, then try the terrace at El Pimpi, which overlooks the Roman amphitheatre. For unbeatable seafood, take the bus to the beach at Pedregalejo on the city's outskirts, where locals feast on freshly caught boquerones (anchovies, often deep fried), espetos (sardines, barbecued on sticks) and platters of enormous mussels, prawns and clams. For modern minimalism, head to the sleek gastrobars of the arty Soho district, such as KGB, where punky young things queue for tables. 'Seville just stays the same,' one girl tells me over fusion tapas and a beer. 'Malaga is moving on.' Green and pleasant: Malaga's botanical garden plays host to exotic plants from around the world . Near the Pompidou is the city's botanic gardens, rated as one of the best in Europe and bursting with palms, exotic plants and squawking birds. Also to see are the Moorish Alcazaba fortress and Gibralfaro castle, where you can enjoy fabulous panoramic views of the city. Visitor numbers are already soaring — with some people saying Malaga will be like Barcelona in ten years' time. I'm tempted to agree with them. British Airways (0844 4930787, www.ba.com) has daily flights from London to Malaga from £82 return.

"A Canadian adultery website which boasts 'life is short, have an affair' is targeting British investors because of the UK's supposed 'laissez faire' attitude to extra-marital affairs. Ashley Madison, an online dating agency, is betting on Europe's relaxed attitude to boost its investment when it lists shares on the stock market in London later this year. It's founder Noel Biderman, 43, who came up with the idea for the site in the 1990s when he worked as a sports attorney, wants to raise money from investors to fund a launch of its services in Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states. Scroll down for video . Noel Biderman, 43, (pictured) who is the founder of Ashley Madison - a Canadian dating website for married people - wants to raise money from British investors to fund a launch of its services elsewhere in the world . Ashley Madison, a Canadian online dating agency which boasts 'life is short, have an affair', is targeting British investors for stock shares because of the UK's supposed 'laissez faire' attitude to extra-marital affairs . With more than 34 million members worldwide, Ashley Madison claims to be the world's second-largest dating website. Only Match.com is bigger. Despite being happily married himself, father-of-two Mr Biderman, who was born in Canada, claims infidelity can actually save relationships and believes people 'use affairs to preserve their marriage'. He is a self-made multi-millionaire having successfully launched the company in Toronto before rolling it out in other major nations. Avid Life Media, the parent company of Ashley Madison, values itself at £669million ($1 billion) and had a reported revenue of £77million ($115 million) in 2014 alone - up 45 percent from the preceding year. Mr Biderman believes the website is such a success because it gives members the 'perfect affair' - helping them cheat on their partner with like-minded people and reducing their chances of getting caught in the act. He now wants to raise up to £135million ($200 million) by listing shares for Ashley Madison in London this year, to help continue its growth worldwide. It comes five years after a lack of investor appetite caused it to pull an attempt to list in Canada. Avid Life Media has 1.2million customers in the UK and 35million worldwide but was forced to scrap a flotation in Toronto in 2010 after investors weren't convinced to buy in. Mr Biderman came up with the idea for Ashley Madison in the 1990s when he was working as a sports attorney. He said he realised there was a space in the market for the site after watching stars arrange affairs . Mr Biderman claims to have been happily married to his wife Amanda for 10 years and the pair have two sons . The company hopes success in London will help it fund a launch of its services in Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states in late May or June. Membership is growing quickest in India, South Korea and Japan. Ashley Madison's website allows members to sign up without disclosing personal information such as their name, telephone number or home address. Visitors to the site are greeted by a brunette woman, who is extending her finger across her lips in a shushing gesture. She is wearing what appears to be a wedding ring. Christoph Kraemer, director of international relations for Ashley Madison said: 'It is for people who are married, who are seeking an affair and want to do so in a discreet environment. 'In Europe, we have simply got a more laissez faire attitude towards a business such as ours.' Mr Kraemer also believes the website can actually help married couples, by 'igniting a spark in their marriage'. He said: 'The response we get from our members who have actually had an affair via the website is that they feel happier, invigorated and transmit that happiness, which actually reinforces and ignites a spark in their marriage and relationships.' Avid Life Media, which is backed financially by a number of anonymous investors, owns also various other similar websites including Cougarlife.com and EstablishedMen.com. Ashley Madison's website allows members to sign up without disclosing personal information such as their name, telephone number or home address. Visitors are greeted by a brunette woman with a finger to her lips . Married father-of-two Neil Biderman, 43, (pictured) is the man behind dating website Ashley Madison . The founder of the world’s largest online dating agency for extra-marital activity which boasts ‘life is short, have an affair’ is a multi-millionaire father-of-two who claims to have been happily married for 10 years. Neil Biderman, 43, the man behind dating website Ashley Madison, has made millions from his unique website which offers married partners the chance to have an affair with other spouses. However, despite his hugely successful business, Canadian-born Mr Biderman – who is often referred to as ‘the king of infidelity’ claims he has never cheated on his wife Amanda and remains happily married. The couple have two sons. Despite his loyalty claims, Mr Biderman did once reveal that he wouldn’t hesitate to cheat if the sexual relationship with his wife dried up. Speaking to the Evening Standard last year, he said: ‘We’re incredibly communicative about our sexual needs. ‘But if I woke up beside my wife and it was the 200th day we hadn’t been intimate with one another and it looked like nothing would change, I would cheat so fast. ‘I would cheat long before I would get a divorce. If you have children that you love and a home that you built together and a future that you planned — why would you give that up just for sex?’ Mr Biderman came up with the idea for the extra-marital dating site in the 1990s, after a career as a sports attorney apparently made him realise how much time and money his clients spent on mistresses while they were away on tour. The site has made him a self-made multi-millionaire and he claims it is worth at least £669million ($1 billion). Despite its risqué nature, Mr Biderman’s wife doesn’t appear to mind because she agrees it is a ‘sound business idea’. The pair insist the social network is just a tool and no one can force anyone to betray a spouse and even believe the dating website can actually help save marriages. M Biderman said previously: ‘The reason people have affairs is that they want to stay married. ‘What I get is a lot of people who come back to me and say: 'Listen, this has made me a better partner.' ‘They were angry and taking things out on their family. The sexual frustration they were feeling, they start having the affair and all of a sudden, that stress is removed. It's very cathartic for those people. ‘If you come home and you've had an affair earlier in the day, it might be easier not to be frustrated with your partner. The conversation could take a different directional tone and that can lead to intimacy. He also has previously said: ‘My belief is that people use affairs to preserve their marriage.’","Canadian adultery website to list shares in London in bid to boost revenue .

"When it comes to the Coachella festival, a number of suspect looks crop up each year including hippie ensembles, outlandish headgear and plenty of skin - and 2015 has been no exception. But as the first weekend of the arts and music festival wrapped in Indio, California, some of the outfits paraded around the sunny campus - or lack thereof - stood out as being particularly woeful. From the couple who wore matching American flag leotards to the man who sported a loincloth over Speedos, could this be the worst year for Coachella street style yet? Scroll down for video . Call the fashion police: From the couple who wore matching American flag leotards (left) to the man who sported a loincloth over Speedos (right), could this be the worst year for Coachella street style yet? The searing California heat was excuse enough for countless festival revellers to ditch most of their clothes, and the scraps that remained left much to be desired. One woman spotted was nude except for a minute chainmail band slung around her hips, two silver star stickers covering her nipples and a breezy shrug. Another was dressed in a  strappy monokini, essentially leaving her practically naked apart from a pair of sturdy boots, a beaded headband, shades and a sheer white printed kimono. One festival goer seemed to have taken a leaf from Kanye West's recent catwalk show in which he dressed models in clinging nude bodystockings.

And speaking of clashing, there was a lot of that. Celebrity offenders included Paris Hilton, who strutted around yesterday in a turquoise paint-splattered maxi-dress, and Katy Perry, who teamed a metallic gold bikini top with a pair of patchwork denim dungarees and a bright orange bomber jacket. The worst fashion moments from just about every recent decade came out in full force; from the tie-die crop tops of the Nineties to the deeply unflattering high-waisted ankle-flappers of the Eighties, and the clashing florals of the Sixties and Seventies. Headgear was, as always, blindingly popular, with opulent bejewelled forehead chains and blooming-awful flower crowns the order of the day.

"A North Carolina mechanic whose son was murdered nine years ago found an inscription dedicated to his fallen son on a car he was working on in his body shop. John Brynarsky's son Chris, a custom paint job expert, was shot and killed in October 2006 after an argument in his car detail shop in Union County, North Carolina. When he was shot, he fell over the bumper he had just finished working on and damaged it, his friend Mark Cosentino said. So Cosentino repaired the bumper and put it back on the car, but not before writing a message on the inside. Chris Brynarsky (back left) was killed in his custom car detail shop in October 2006. When he was shot, he fell over a bumper he was working on and damaged it. His friend Mark Cosentino repaired the bumper and wrote an inscription on the inside dedicated to his slain friend before reattaching it to the car . 'In memory of Christopher Brynarsky October 11th, 2006 11:45 AM,' Cosentino told WZZM. 'I just wanted to immortalize him. That was my way of doing it' Cosentino said he never thought anyone would see the inside of the bumper, but it resurfaced nine years later, in Chris Brynarsky's father's body shop in Charlotte. On Good Friday, John Brynarsky was working on a car when he took off the bumper and found the message. 'I didn't know what to do,' John Brynarsky said. 'I didn't know what to think.' Chris's brother Jonathan, who also works at Hendrick Luxury Collision Center with his father, was just as shocked about the discovery. 'Somehow it came to this shop, somehow we got it and it's just unreal,' Jonathan told WZZM. 'You can't even write something like that.' John Brynarsky was working on a car at Hendrick Luxury Collision Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, when he took of a bumper and found an inscription dedicated to his murdered son . When John Brynarsky met Cosentino after discovering the message, it was clear they shared a special bond. 'For it to end up with his Dad getting it, is just mind boggling,' John said about finding the bumper. 'I can't believe it.' And Cosentino said he's grateful his memorial for Chris ended up in the right hands after nearly a decade. 'It's a good feeling to know that I did do that and somebody else did see it, especially the right person,' Cosentino said. 'It's a good day when something like this happens. We don't get a lot of days like this anymore.' Though the Brynarsky family lost Chris nine years ago, but it seems he remains in everyone's heart. 'I miss him every day,' John said Brynarsky. 'And we think about him every day, too.'","Chris Byrnarsky was shot and killed in his custom detail shop in 2006 .

"A former Guantanamo Bay prisoner arrested over the terrorist killing of a top female prosecutor in Uganda had been awarded £1million in compensation by the British government following his release. Jamal Kiyemba, 36, was detained in the Ugandan capital Kampala in connection with the death of Joan Kagezi, who was killed in front of her children days before a major trial against Islamist terror network Al-Shabaab. Kiyemba, a former pharmacy student at a university in Leicester, who grew up in London, was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years and awarded the huge payout after being released. Arrested: Ex-Guantanamo Bay prisoner Jamal Kiyemba, 36 was detained in Kampala over the brutal murder of top female prosecutor Joan Kagezi . The 36-year-old is one of 16 former Guantanamo prisoners awarded a £20million payout from the British taxpayer over claims of false imprisonment and human rights abuse. His case was championed by Muslim human rights group CAGE, whose director infamously branded ISIS executioner Mohammed 'Jihadi John' Emwazi an 'extremely gentle, kind, beautiful young man'. He was born in Uganda as Anthony Kiyemba, but converted to Islam aged 20, changing his name to Jamal Abdullah. When the family arrived in Britain following the death of his father in 1993, Kiyemba, then 14, was granted indefinite leave to remain, but never applied for British citizenship. Kiyemba was arrested near Peshawar in Pakistan in March 2002, after allegedly trying to enter Afghanistan in the company of 'a probable al-Qaeda operative, a suspected al-Qaeda operative and a low-level jihadist', U.S. military files reveal. Compensated: Kiyemba was awarded £1million from the British government over claims he had been tortured by U.S. intelligence and interrogated by the MI5 at Guantanamo which had violated his human rights . Kiyemba, however, claims he had gone to Pakistan to study Arabic and the Koran because the country was 'very cheap'. Following his 2006 release, he claimed he had only admitted to terrorist activities under torture by American intelligence officers and that he had been interrogated by MI5. He was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years but as he was not a British citizen, he was not entitled to representation by the Foreign Office nor, on his release, to automatic rights to return to his family. Kiyemba, whose mother, four brothers and sister all live in Britain, was instead deported to Uganda, but made several attempts to be allowed back into the UK. 'I may not be British according to some bit of paper but in reality I am a Brit and always will be,' he said in an interview following his release. 'My doctor, my local mosque, my teens, my education, employment, friends, taxes, home and above all else my family - it is all in Britain.' Support: Kiyemba's compensation claims were championed by human rights charity CAGE, whose research director, Asim Qureshi, pictured, famously branded ISIS executioner Jihadi John a 'kind, beautiful' man . Kiyemba was arrested alongside three others in a suburb to Kampala on Tuesday as a result of an operation aided by U.S. officials, Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga said. Jamal Kyiemba is one of 16 former Guantanamo Bay detainees paid compensation by the British Government over claims of human rights abuse. A total of £20million has been awarded to former prisoners in an out-of-court settlement after they made allegations against British intelligence, the Sun reports. Others include Shaker Aamer, 48, who still remains in Guantanamo after 13 years without charge or trial, despite being cleared for release twice. Once he is released Mr Aamer, from south London, should be entitled to £1million. Ms Kagezi had been a prosecutor in the ongoing trial of 12 suspects accused of being involved in the July 2010 bombings in which 76 people were killed while watching the World Cup final on TV. Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab, who were behind the brutal massacre of nearly 150 students at a Kenyan university this month, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier this year, Ms Kagezi had been appointed Head of the International Crimes Division, at the rank of Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions. Kagezi was shot twice by gunmen after she left her car — in which she was traveling with two of her children on the way home from work — to buy groceries in a Kampala suburb. After shooting her in the head and neck, the gunmen fled on a motorcycle, according to police. Ugandan police say there is not yet conclusive evidence tying Kiyemba to the murder of Ms Kagezi, but that detectives were questioning him about any possible role and about other offenses. Kiyemba has yet to comment on the allegations. Ugandan police on Tuesday arrested at least six suspects.","Jamal Kiyemba, arrested over killing of Uganda's top female prosecutor .

"More than a third of GPs are considering retirement in the next five years, a survey shows. Another one in ten is thinking about moving abroad to countries including Canada and Australia, where the pay is higher and workload less stressful. A poll of 15,560 family doctors also found that one in six is considering going part-time and 7 per cent are contemplating quitting altogether. Choices: A poll of 15,560 family doctors found that one in six is considering going part-time and 7 per cent are contemplating quitting altogether (file picture) Senior GPs say they are facing ‘incredible’ pressures brought on by an increasingly ageing population who have complicated illnesses, as well as having to chase targets. Their morale is low despite the fact they benefited from a pay deal ten years ago that resulted in their salaries rising by 50 per cent, while allowing them to opt out of working during evenings and weekends. There is now a national recruitment crisis and many surgeries are short-staffed, with increasing numbers of GPs retiring or moving abroad. And they are not being replaced by younger trainees, who view the career as ‘second class’ compared to more prestigious roles as hospital doctors or surgeons. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last month described the situation as ‘worrying’ and pledged to alter targets and invest more in surgeries. The British Medical Association survey, which included GPs in their late 20s through to early 60s, found that 34 per cent were considering retiring within the next five years. 'Worrying': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) has pledged to alter targets and invest more in surgeries . And a fifth of the 780 trainee GPs included in the poll were already considering moving abroad. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA’s GP committee, said: ‘This poll lays bare the stark reality of the crisis facing the GP workforce. ‘It is clear that incredible pressures on GP services are at the heart of this problem, with escalating demand having far outstripped capacity. ‘GPs are overworked and intensely frustrated that they do not have enough time to spend with their patients, especially the increasing numbers of older people with multiple and complex problems.’ Last month, figures showed the number of GPs applying to work abroad had increased by 40 per cent in five years. The most popular destinations are Australia, New Zealand and Canada where they can earn the equivalent of £200,000 a year and have more of a work-life balance. GPs in England earn an average of £105,000 a year, and many take home considerably more. But they claim they often work 12-hour days or longer, and that ten-minute appointment slots are not sufficient to meet patients’ needs. Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said the shortage of family doctors could have a ‘devastating impact’ on the future of the NHS.","One in ten thinking about moving to countries where the pay is higher .

"Fearing for their lives, hundreds of African immigrants have begun arriving in their home countries after fleeing the bloody violence that has swept across South Africa. Among them were some 400 Zimbabweans –  including pregnant women and babies – who were packed onto buses to escape the anti-immigrant attacks that have left seven people dead in recent days. They were pictured wearily disembarking in the safe haven of a migration centre  in the Zimbabwean border town of Beitbridge after leaving Durban yesterday. About 3,200 Malawians have also sought refuge in temporary camps amid the ensuing chaos. Their plight emerged as South Africa's influential Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini denied whipping up the xenophobic hatred in the country that has forced thousands from their homes.

Zwelithini had made an angry speech last month blaming immigrants for rising crime and saying they must leave the country, in an outburst seen as inciting the spate of attacks. But addressing a tribal gathering of several thousand Zulus in the port city of Durban the king insisted he had been taken out of context. 'My speech... was directed at the police, calling for stricter law enforcement, but that was never reported,' he said. 'The public was instead given another side of my speech, which has been twisted and misrepresented. This violence directed at our brothers and sisters is shameful.' Meanwhile, in Malawi, Information Minister Kondwani Nankhumwa said six buses carrying 390 Malawians from Durban were sent to Malawi yesterday, while five more buses were expected to leave today. Those killed in the anti-immigrant unrest included two Malawians, according to Malawi's government. Louis Lulu Mnguni, South Africa's top diplomat in Nigeria, said his Lagos mission has warned South African citizens in Nigeria 'to exercise vigilance and limit their movements' following threats of reprisal attacks.

A group of 390 Malawians fleeing xenophobic violence wait at Kamudzu stadium  in Blantyre. South African authorities have struggled to contain mobs in the economic capital Johannesburg and Durban who have been attacking foreigners from Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and other African countries . Similarly, security was increased at the South African High Commission in Accra, Ghana, after telephoned threats, said Lulama Xingwana, the high commissioner. Activists in some African countries have also organised protests and called for a boycott of South African goods as South Africa is a powerful trading partner in the region. Kenmare Resources, a Dublin-based company, said it temporarily repatriated its 62 South African workers at a titanium mine in Mozambique after 'reciprocal unrest' there that stemmed from the South African violence. The mine's total workforce is nearly 1,400. The outbreak of violence in South Africa against immigrants has tarnished the reputation of a country that has one of the biggest economies on the continent and has been a destination for people seeking opportunity and an escape from turbulence elsewhere in Africa. Horrific pictures released yesterday showed a Mozambican man bleeding to death in a gutter after being savagely attack by a gang who stabbed him with knives and bludgeoned him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg. In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself. South Africa was also dubbed the 'rainbow nation' for its relatively peaceful transition to democracy after the end of white racist rule in 1994. Attack: Shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround Emmanuel Sithole and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg . Now the government is struggling to contain negative fallout from attacks on immigrants in some areas of Durban and Johannesburg that killed seven people since the end of March. Professor Chris Landsberg, an African diplomacy and foreign policy expert at the University of Johannesburg said the South African government should be 'less reactive and more proactive' in dealing with tensions over immigrants. He said the country should 'be a bit more humble' about its aspirations as a continental leader, adding: 'We are in denial.' Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, an influential figure among the Zulu ethnic group in South Africa, condemned the attacks in a speech Monday at a Durban sports stadium. His remarks followed allegations that he provoked the violence with reported comments in which he said foreigners should go home. Doctors tried in vain to save Mr Sithole's life. His cause of death was later established as a direct stab wound to the heart and his identity established from a mobile phone found in his pocket . President Jacob Zuma postponed a ceremony, scheduled for next week, in which the country's highest official honor is bestowed on South Africans and foreigners who have contributed to South Africa, his office said. The event will be postponed so South Africa can mourn the victims of the anti-immigrant violence, including three South Africans and four foreigners, it said. The attacks in South Africa stem from a perception that immigrants, many from other African countries, are taking jobs at the expense of South Africans in a country with high unemployment. Many people have entered South Africa illegally, though the government has said a large number of immigrants are working legally and contributing to economic development. The violence recalls similar unrest in South Africa in 2008 in which 60 people died. In January this year, four people died during looting of foreign-owned shops in areas of Johannesburg. The violence is particularly unfortunate because other African nations provided shelter and other aid to South African activists during the battle against white minority rule, said Xingwana, the South African diplomat in Ghana. 'The young people have forgotten the contribution of African countries to South Africa's fight against apartheid and need to be educated on this,' she said.","400 Zimbabweans fled Durban on buses to escape the xenophobic protests .

"Hayley Grimes, 42 (pictured with granddaughter Roxanne) found Baby Peter's body in Norfolk in 1988 and was accused of being his mother . The girl who found a baby's body floating in a village pond in 1988 says she can no longer be 'blamed' for dumping the boy, after his mother was arrested over the child's death 27 years later. Hayley Grimes, 42, was just a teenager when she found the body of Baby Peter wrapped in a blanket and Sainsbury's bag in Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk. Yesterday, it emerged that the boy's mother had been arrested nearly three decades on, after police used DNA profiling techniques to trace back to his family. The mother, who has not been named, told officers she had put the body into the lake, known locally as Windmill Pit, after going through the trauma of a stillbirth. But Ms Grimes told today how she had been left scarred by the discovery after being accused by locals of being the child's mother. She also said it was 'unthinkable' that the baby had not been given a proper burial. Ms Grimes, a mother of two, said: 'At the time a lot of people thought it could have been me who left the baby and then pretended to find it. 'I think it was because I was so desperate to get it a proper grave. 'The image of that baby has definitely stayed with me all my life and I still feel quite angry about the whole thing. 'I think what she has done is horrible if the baby was dead or alive. 'But I am glad that the have finally found his mother. The very least it means nobody can blame me anymore.' Ms Grimes found the baby while she was playing at the pit, a common place for local children to play, with friends. Speaking about what happened, she said: 'We were just up there as kids. We used to go fishing up there and now and then I would go up there to read a book. 'I thought it must have been an animal or something. My partner at the time helped get it out the water and we cut it open. 'To me it looked like a normal baby wrapped in a blanket but I didn't want to look at it. My partner at the time said it didn't have much of a face because of the decomposition.' Unsolved case: A police officer searches Windmill Pit, the Norfolk pond where the baby boy's body was found back in 1988 . During the original investigation, police had been unable to identify the mother. Villagers then carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby's burial at St Peter's Church in the village. But after the case came up for a periodical review, police exhumed the boy's body from his grave. DNA taken from his leg bone was then put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents. Detectives examined that person's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy's mother. She was then was arrested on suspicion of infanticide. But the charge was dropped after she told police that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends and later had a stillbirth. The boy's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review, with DNA samples leading police to the boy's mother. He has now been reburied at Weasenham St Peter church, Norfolk . Police have now ruled out any foul play. The woman remains on bail while the CPS decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial. Ms Grimes's mother Jackie Elson, 60, also  remembers how her daughter was affected by the discovery. She said: 'A lot of people pointed the finger at Hayley. They even blamed my husband as he was up there fishing a lot of the time. 'The head of CID would always be round here seeing if he could ask Hayley one more question to see if she could remember anything.' She added: 'It is a relief that the case is being closed but I'm still not sure if justice has been done. 'I do feel sorry for the woman because she must have been in a state.' Ms Grimes's cousin Emma Enifer, 39, added: 'It was where all the children used to fish and it is horrible to think that happened there. The boy was originally buried without a name but  a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as Peter after the name of the church . 'I am surprised that it took this long and that they did not carry out the DNA tests earlier than they did. 'The police interviewed all the young girls and women in the area. The pit is quite a secluded spot and I think you would have to be local to the area find it.' After his exhumation, the baby boy was re-buried in the St Peter's church yard. It took place on June 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery. A report in the Eastern Daily Press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond . The grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross, which read: 'In loving memory of unknown baby boy. Born and died 1988.' But a support group called Hana's Gift, which works with families who have suffered a stillbirth, later paid for a new headstone giving his name as Peter, after the name of the church. The inscription now reads: 'In loving memory of baby Peter, June 1988. A sweet little child, lost but then found, to bloom and grow in Heaven's playground. There is no foot so small that it cannot leave an imprint on the world.' Meanwhile, other villagers recalled how the mystery had affected the community. Hildergard Michalak, 87, who has lived in the area for more than 60 years, said: 'I remember the police going round every house in the area but of course nobody could help. Nobody knew who it was. 'It was a shock as you didn't think anything like that could happen so close to you. 'I guess there is a sense of relief that it has come to an end and that it wasn't more sinister.' Her son Mick, 64, said nobody knew who the mother of the child was but he thought the parents could have lived at the nearby RAF base at Raynham. He said: 'Its a bit of a shock but I'm glad the mother has been found. I hadn't a clue who she was. 'The camp at Raynham was open at the time but that has been closed now. I always thought it could have been somebody who sneaked the camp there. 'I generally think incidents like this should be punished. If they don't then it could suggest to somebody else in that position that it is OK.' One mother who has lived in the village most of her life said her two daughters were also treated like suspects after police came to her home to interview them. The 65-year-old, who did not want to be named, said: 'She must have been a very young girl who was quite naïve at the time. 'My two daughters are now in their 40s but they were both treated like suspects and it was very upsetting for them and me. Tranquil: The pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, as it is today . 'They said it must have been somebody local as the pond is not easy to find if you don't know the area.' She added: 'The woman has done her time already and will have to live with what she has done in her head. I think it should be left at that.' Det Insp Andy Guy, of Norfolk Police who led the investigation said the DNA was compared to five million samples on the national database. He said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time. He said: 'The pregnancy was concealed from everybody. She didn't tell her family, her close friends, she gave birth in secret. The baby was stillborn.' He added that the small team of officers involved in the case had 'mixed feelings' after bringing the investigation to a final close. He said: 'From a police officer's perspective, it's fantastic. From a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her.' A police spokesman said: 'In this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation. 'Thanks to advances in DNA we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself. 'Sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play.' Karen Murray-Tye who set up Hana's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006, has since appealed for the mother to come forward if she is in need of support. She said: 'It was quite hard to find the right words, but I thought the 'lost but found' fitted the circumstances. 'I hope she sees we've tried to do the best for him as we have for Hana. It would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward.' Norfolk coroner's chaplain Chris Copsey said: 'When the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said 'unnamed baby boy'. 'It seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so I took the name of the church, St Peter's church.'

"Julius Caesar famously collapsed at the battle of Thapsus in 46BC and had to be carried to safety. Historians have long believed this was result of an epileptic attack, highlighting other symptoms such as vertigo, dizziness and weakness in his limbs. But new research suggests that the Roman general may in fact have been suffering from a series of mini-strokes that affected both his mental and physical state. Julius Caesar famously collapsed at the battle of Thapsus in 46BC and had to be carried to safety.Historians have long believed this was result of an epileptic attack, but new research suggests otherwise. Pictured is Ciaran Hinds Julius Caesar in the drama series 'Rome' Doctors at Imperial College London came to the conclusion after taking a new look at Caesar's symptoms described in Greek and Roman documents, according to a report by Ian Sample in the Guardian. 'Possible cardiovascular explanations have always been ruled out on the grounds that until his death he was supposedly otherwise physically well during both private and stately affairs,' the researchers wrote in their study. Francesco Galassi, a medical doctor at Imperial who conducted the analysis with Hutan Ashrafian, a surgeon at the college, say there are a number of symptoms that mini-strokes can explain better than epilepsy. New research suggests that the Roman general may in fact have been suffering from a series of mini-strokes that affected both his mental and physical state. Doctors at Imperial College London came to the conclusion after taking a new look at Caesar's symptoms described in Greek and Roman documents . For instance, Caesar was known to suffer from depression towards the end of his life, which may have been the result of damage to his brain from the strokes. There may have been social reasons why the military leader, and his chosen heir, Octavian, believed they suffered from epilepsy. In antiquity epilepsy was referred to as the 'sacred disease' among the Greeks. It was generally perceived by those uneducated in medicine or as being the result of possession by a deity. In literature of the time, epileptics were often the possessors of powers and the subjects of divine favour. The Greeks and the Romans appear to have known the causes and symptoms of epilepsy quite well. The Hippocratic treatise On the Sacred Disease, which attempts prove the condition is not caused by supernatural causes, outlined them in detail. In his biography of Caesar, the Greek historian Plutarch describes how the leader supposedly had a very public attack of his disease. This took place on the floor of the senate, where he cried that anyone who wished to kill him could. Plutarch says that Caesar later claimed that it was due to epilepsy, which causes him to become giddy when in front of large crowds. 'When re-evaluating his symptoms, it can be noted that Caesar suffered falls during his campaigns in Spain and Africa at Cordoba and Thapsus,' the researchers write. 'He reported symptoms of headaches, vertigo and later on mentioned giddiness and insensibility, when he could not stand up as senators honoured him.'

In literature, epileptics were often the possessors of powers and the subjects of divine favour. But the researchers note that both Caesar's father and another forefather died without an obvious cause. This may point to the fact that they also suffered from mini-strokes, a condition that can come about due to genetic disposition.","Roman general suffered from vertigo, dizziness and weakness in limbs .

"No blame: Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes . Divorce laws in England and Wales should remove the need for allegations of adultery and blame, Britain’s most senior female judge has said. Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes so a person does not need to be held at fault in order to obtain a divorce. Divorcing couples currently have to cite one of five reasons: adultery; unreasonable behaviour; desertion for two or more years; two years’ separation with consent; or five years’ separation without consent. The second reason – unreasonable behaviour’ – is by far the most widely used. Around 120,000 couples divorce in England and Wales each year and those who want to divorce quickly are encouraged to cite unfaithfulness or unreasonable behaviour, which, critics argue, encourages recriminations. Lady Hale, who is deputy president to the Supreme Court and the only woman among the 12 Supreme Court justices, also wants couples to be made to sort out arrangements for children and money before obtaining a divorce as part of the overhaul. She told The Times: ‘We should make it take longer to get a divorce and encourage people to sort out what happens to the home, children, money before, rather than after, they get a divorce.’ Couples would have a one-year ‘cooling off period’ after declaring that their marriage had permanently broken down in order for them to sort out arrangements. Lady Hale, 70, was behind the move for ‘no fault’ divorce in England and Wales 20 years ago. Conservative MPs saw off the proposals and said that removing fault would take away responsibility and undermine the concept of marriage. Last night campaigners and lawyers backed the proposed overhaul. Resolution: Lady Hale also wants arrangements for children and money resolved before divorce is finalised . Sir Paul Coleridge, former family High Court judge and chairman of the Marriage Foundation, told The Times: ‘Lady Hale, a complete expert with decades of experience across this whole field, is entirely right. ‘Our current system which pretends to be fault-based is in practice and reality no such thing. 'The fault is largely invented to get a quick divorce — a hangover from pre-1970 days which is manipulated by lawyers and parties.’","Baroness Hale of Richmond wants to see 'bitterness' taken out of disputes .

"An 800lb woman, whose weight spiraled out of control after she was kidnapped by an ex-boyfriend and held hostage, finally stood up for the first time after years of being bound to her bed and taken care of by her three daughters. When viewers first met Marla McCants, from Nashville, Tennessee, on last night's season finale of My 600lb Life, doctors determined that she was only months - maybe even weeks - from dying. And even after a lengthy hospital stay and gastric bypass surgery, the 43-year-old still refused to let medical professionals help her stand up – and, in doing so, save her life. Marla's recovery seemed like a hopeless cause until it dawned on the mother-of-three that this was her last shot. If she didn't get up, she would spend the rest of her very short life bedridden. Scroll down for video . Life changing: Marla McCants, who weighed 800lbs, can be seen standing for the first time in years on the season finale of My 600lb Life . Catching her breath: The 43-year-old took a moment to rest after getting herself out of bed . Marla and her daughter Sierra moved to Houston, Texas, so she could she could work with weight loss expert Dr Younan Nowzaradan, but following her surgery and a lengthy stay in the hospital, she was discharged because of her lack of cooperation. The surgeon had all but given up on Marla until he received an impassioned call from Sierra, begging him to come to her apartment and convince her mom to get up once and for all. Dr Nowzaradan made the house call and requested emergency medical technicians come to the apartment to help Marla stand for the first time in years. With the help of a walker, the EMTs and Dr Nowzaradan's support, Marla was able to stand for a few seconds. And, although brief, this short moment gave her enough confidence to try and stand again, essentially changing the direction of her recovery for the better. Stuck: The mother-of-three relied on her daughters to take care of her. She can be seen rolling over, so her daughter Adele could bathe her while she laid in bed . Last stand: Adele tearfully explained she feared her mother would die if she didn't get help . Before she moved to Houston, Marla depended on her three daughters, Britney, Adele and Sierra, for everything. 'I have no life,' she told the cameras. 'My legs can't even hold my weight anymore.' Her children had no choice but to clean her and take care of her. ‘I'm 24 and I have to take care of my mom. I wipe her, bathe her, make sure she's clean. And I do get tired,' Adele explained with frustration. Marla noted that 'it's embarrassing', but added she has no other choice because of her mother’s massive size. Because of her morbid obesity, Marla suffered from arthritis, gout, swelling in her joints and diabetes, in addition to being bed ridden and in constant pain. Junk food addict: Marla can be seen looking at the junk food Adele had brought for her to eat . Making dinner: Marla, who was unable to get out of bed, had a table brought to her so she could fry some chicken . She explained that she never had problems with her weight when she was a child, but her eating got out of control after she tried to break up with her boyfriend who 'lost it' and proceeded to kidnap her, hold her at gunpoint and even shot two officers who tried to rescue her before she escaped. After the ordeal, Marla refused to leave her house because she was living in constant fear that he would find her and kill her. She soon turned to food for comfort, and by the time her ex-boyfriend was caught, it was too late. She already weighed 700lbs. 'The kidnapping changed my life forever, and I wish I could take that day back,' she said. But allowing herself to indulge in endless bad eating habits for years, Marla admitted that she was terrified that her daughters were going to find her dead in bed one day, so she made the decision to travel to Houston to seek Dr Nowzaradan’s help. Bad choices: She can be see frying the chicken in boiling vegetable oil at her bedside . Extra calories: After making her meal, Marla covered her fried chicken tenders in French dressing before eating them . Emotional eating: Marla explained that she turned to food for comfort after her ex-boyfriend kidnapped her and held her hostage when she was in her early 20s . Because she was unable to get out of bed, she had to call an ambulance to transport her to her daughter's car where she sat for the entire 13 hour drive. And the trip almost killed her. A blood clot that had formed in her leg after years of not moving dislodged during the trip and traveled to her lung. By the time she got to the hospital in Houston, her health was rapidly declining. 'She is in the worst condition health wise that I have ever seen,' Dr Nowzaradan said, noting that she should have never traveled to Houston at her size. In pain: Marla was filled with pain after a blood clot dislodged in her leg and traveled to her lung during her trip to Houston, Texas to see Dr Nowzaradan . Heavy lifting: A group of hospital members worked together to life Marla into bed . 'I am not [as] worried about weight loss surgery as [I am about] making sure she will survive the next 24 hours,' he said. 'This is [a] very dangerous situation. She is at the end of her life if we can't do anything.' After Dr Nowzaradan put a filter in her leg to prevent any more blood clots from forming, Marla recovered and was put on a 1,000-calories-per-day diet while she was living in the hospital. In an attempt to make painfully clear to Marla the extent of her condition, the doctor explained that when she was living in Nashville she was 'months or even weeks from death'. But despite the danger of developing another blood clot, Marla refused to try and stand or move her legs. Sierra, who gave up her life to move with her mom to Houston, scolded her for sending her physical therapists away, but Marla maintained that everyone was pushing her too hard. Preventative measures: Dr Nowzaradan can be seen putting a filter in Marla's leg to prevent more blood clots from forming and traveling to her lungs . Second chance: As a last resort, he would later perform gastric bypass surgery on Marla in the hope of saving her life . 'You need to work on your attitude,' Sierra told her with frustration. Dr Nowzaradan explained that 'Marla has convinced herself that she cannot walk, but the reality is that she doesn't want to walk'. When Marla was pressured to try and stand, she started screaming in pain and begged to be pushed back on the bed. ‘If Marla won't get up, we can't treat her,' Dr Nowzaradan said. 'This is a life or death situation. She is going to die.' Despite her massive size, Dr Nowzaradan opted to perform weight loss surgery a few months later because there was no other way to help her. New foods: Marla can be seen eating healthier options while she maintained a 1,000-calories-per-day diet during her hospital stay . Doctors orders: Marla's daughter Sierra grew frustrated with her because she refused to try and get up . Not confident: Marla continued to make excuses for why she was unable to attempt to get out of bed . Following the gastric bypass, Marla was once again at risk of developing blood clots, but she continued to rely on a physical therapist to move her legs for her. A frustrated Dr Nowzaradan yelled at her for giving the hospital staff and her daughter 'attitude' when they were trying to help her. Without her cooperation, he had no choice but to discharge her from the hospital. Because she was still unable to fend for herself, Marla decided to move in with Sierra in Houston, but insisted that she didn’t need the help of her doctors in order to get better. 'I can make healthy choices on my own,' she said. 'I can do this better.' But Marla still wasn’t making any progress, especially when it came to working her muscles. 'You've been sitting here for eight weeks!' Sierra yelled at her mom before making a desperate call to Dr Nowzaradan. Major victory: Marla can be seen standing on the scale for the first time in five years . All smiles: Marla was happy to learn that lost an estimated 266lbs since she started her journey a year ago . It was his visit and support that changed Marla's life. 'Getting up and standing was one of the most encouraging things I've done and now I don't want to stop,' Marla told the cameras after she lifted herself out of bed for the first time in years. A year after she started her journey, Marla was able to stand on a scale for the first time in five years, clocking in at 534lbs. Her estimated weight loss was 266lbs, and Marla noted that she was 'so proud' of herself. 'It took me a while to get here, but now nothing is going to stop me,' she said.","Marla McCants, from Nashville, Tennessee, began rapidly gaining weight after her ex-boyfriend kidnapped her and held her hostage .

"It was a cunning plot to steal more than £1.5million in gold bullion and jewellery. Using a flat-pack wooden cabinet as a ‘Trojan Horse’, one of the thieves was to hide inside. The gang then planned to put real money in a briefcase and show it to a jeweller at a pre-arranged meeting, before placing it on the floor. Then, while a price was being agreed at a nearby table, the man in the cabinet would switch the case for one containing counterfeit notes. The gang – posing as wealthy Italians – would then walk off with their money and the stolen jewellery. Scroll down for video . Jail terms: Luigi Arcuri (left), 73, Nikolic Giuliano (centre), 37 and Antonino Ballistreri (right), 45, were each sentenced to two years and eight months  for conspiracy to defraud and possession of counterfeit currency . The idea: They planned to put one of the men inside the desk, show the jeweller real cash in a briefcase and then switch this with an identical case containing counterfeit notes - which he would then take away . In construction: The gang posing as rich Italian businessmen built the cabinet so one of them could hide inside a large void in the middle and secretly switch a haul of Euros for fake money during a deal . Flat-pack desk: While a price was agreed, the money would be switched by the man hidden inside the cabinet for an identical brief case containing the worthless counterfeit notes . But the three men and one teenager were seized when police swooped on a conference room at a hotel in Manchester city centre – and found them assembling the cabinet. Officers suspect similar scams have been carried out across Europe, costing businesses millions of pounds. At Manchester Crown Court, Luigi Arcuri, 73, Nikolic Giuliano, 37, and Antonino Ballistreri, 45, were each sentenced to two years and eight months in prison. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given 16 months. All admitted conspiracy to defraud and possession of counterfeit currency. The men had been negotiating the purchase of gold and gems worth £1.5million from Rockefeller’s in Manchester. They first contacted the shop by phone. This was followed by a visit by the teenager, who gave his name as Benjamin Berman, and Ballistreri, who called himself Mr Ferrari. Both were well-dressed and wore Rolex watches and ordered 41 high-value items including gold bullion and jewellery. Arrangements were made to meet at a hotel, where a ‘Swiss banker’, who would be in possession of the cash, would be present. Cash in the draw: The quartet are suspected of being part of a larger, highly organised gang responsible for defrauding businesses across Europe out of jewellery and gold bullion worth millions of pounds . Euros seized by police: Inside a drawer, officers recovered €2.2million in counterfeit money as well as £52,000 worth of legitimate Euro notes . Police, who had been tipped off, placed the teenager and Ballistreri under surveillance and monitored them as they returned to the shop and finalised the deal. They were observed going to the Thistle Hotel near the Trafford Centre before going to a supermarket where they bought a torch to be used by the man in the cabinet. Enquiries revealed that a phone number used to contact Rockefeller’s was also used to contact other jewellers in the region. Detectives also discovered that in November, the 17-year-old had tried to defraud Diamond Watches in London, Classic Jewellers and Camelot Diamonds in Brighton and had attempted to launder cash in Brighton Exchange. Police swooped and arrested the gang and found 2.2 million in counterfeit euros (around £1.5million) as well as £52,000 of legitimate euro notes. Detective Inspector Rob Cousen of Greater Manchester Police said: ‘This was a well-run, highly sophisticated scam. To catch them red-handed is a fantastic result as we have been able to stop them in their tracks and prevent them from committing a serious crime.’ Caught on CCTV: Two members of the group were observed going to the Thistle Hotel near the Trafford Centre, moving the flat-pack table on a trolley ahead of assembling it in a conference room . First floor camera: The men are pictured making their way through the hotel with their kit, before setting it up in a conference room. Police swooped on the room and found them busy assembling the wooden furniture . The men outside the shop: Detectives discovered that men purporting to be Italian businessmen had been negotiating the purchase of jewellery worth €2million from Rockefeller's jewellers (above) in Manchester .

"Police are hunting Peter Fox, 26, (pictured) after his mother and sister were found dead half a mile apart in an alleged double murder . A 26-year-old man police are hunting over the alleged double murder of his mother and sister in Merseyside is believed to have fled to London. Detectives have released CCTV images of Peter Fox leaving Liverpool Lime Street at 8.18pm on Wednesday and arriving at Euston railway station in the capital at 10.57pm. The body of Sarah Fox, 27, was found by police on Thursday night, just hours before her 57-year-old mother Bernadette was found dead at sheltered accommodation just half a mile away in Bootle, Merseyside. Merseyside Police said Mrs Fox died of asphyxiation, while her daughter was repeatedly stabbed. Bernadette and Sarah's family today said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss. Police are now appealing for the public's help to track down Mr Fox. They say they want to speak 'urgently' with him in connection to the deaths, but warned the public not to approach him. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Rooney, said: 'We are still trying to trace Peter Fox, the 26-year-old son of Bernadette, as he could have information which could assist with our investigation. 'I am reappealing to Peter to come forward so that we can speak to him following the murders of his mother and sister. We know that Peter travelled by train to London on Wednesday night and we are working with the Metropolitan Police to try and find him. Although we know he travelled to London that night he may well have gone on to travel outside of the London area. 'I would stress to the public that if they do see Peter Fox, they should not approach him. We would urge anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact the police on 999. 'Peter's family have been left devastated by the deaths of Bernadette and Sarah and they would also urge Peter to come forward to help the detectives investigating these murders.' Fox is described as white, between 5ft 2in and 5ft 5in and of slight build with short, dark hair - no longer shaved - and brown eyes. He speaks with a Liverpool accent. The family of Bernadette (left) and Sarah (roght) today said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss . Mr Rooney added: 'The investigation into these deaths is at an early stage and, although the motive is unclear at this time, we believe the offender may be known to the victims. 'I would like to reassure residents who live in the Bootle area where these addresses are located that we have increased patrols in the area to provide reassurance and support.' In a statement issued through police, a spokesman for the Fox family said: 'We are absolutely devastated following the loss of Bernadette and Sarah and are still trying to come to terms with what has happened to them both. Detectives have released CCTV images of Peter Fox arriving at Euston Station (right) in the capital at around 10.57pm on Wednesday night after leaving Liverpool Lime Street at 8.18pm (left) 'Bernadette, who was a mother of three and grandmother of three, was a very outgoing and lovely person who wouldn't harm anyone. In fact she only ever had nice things to say about people. She was so caring and would help anyone. 'And Sarah was loved by her family and well-liked by her friends and neighbours. She was a fantastic aunty and was a cheeky, bubbly and outgoing person who loved her dog. They will both be greatly missed. 'We would ask that people appreciate that this is a sad and tragic time for the family and that we are left alone to grieve in peace, whilst we try to understand what has happened.' The family urged anyone with information about the incident to contact police to help them 'find justice for Bernadette and Sarah'. Police are hunting for 26-year-old Peter Fox, the brother and son of the two women who were allegedly murdered this week in Bootle . Sarah Fox's body was found around 9pm on Thursday night after police received a phone call about her welfare. A neighbour had reportedly raised the alarm after seeing a dog loose on the streets. Another neighbour living close to the flat, who did not want to be named, said: 'I saw one of my neighbours in the street who said he was worried after he noticed the dog from the flat roaming the streets, he had seen it a few times so he knocked on the door but got no answer. 'He called to the house last night and noticed there was a downstairs window open and the back door was ajar.' It was then that the police were called and officers found Sarah Fox's body, who they said had suffered 'multiple injuries'. 'It's so shocking. I've spoken to the girl from those flats before two or three times, she seemed a nice girl,' the neighbour added. Bernadette Fox was found when police arrived at her address through other enquiries. One neighbour near the sheltered housing property, who did wish to be named, said: 'The girl's name was Sarah - people called her Foxy - and her mum was Bernie. 'Bernie was harmless and Sarah I think had worked at a solicitors nearby, Bernie had a son as well. 'The place where Bernie lived was sheltered accommodation and it had cameras all over the place. 'There's a camera over the intercom so anyone letting someone in would see them. It's a hard place to get into.' Martin Stevenson, Director of Older People's Services at Your Housing Group, said yesterday: 'Tragically a body was discovered at one of our Roger Arden Court sheltered scheme apartments in Bootle this morning. Police launched a double murder inquiry after the bodies of two women were found at separate addresses in Bootle, Merseyside. Pictured, officers outside a property in Worcester Road .

'Merseyside Police attended the incident and we are continuing to support them with their investigations. 'Our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the deceased at this difficult time.' Patricia Doragh, who lives in a property near the flat, said: 'It is quite a rough area around here especially up the side streets. 'The police are always up and down the main road it's not a rare thing, it's a street quite well known for alcohol. 'When I took my grandsons out earlier about 12 o'clock there was nothing here and now all the cordons are up.'","Sarah Fox, 27, was found dead at her home in Bootle on Thursday night .

"Rescue workers tasked with freeing almost 100 dogs that had been kept locked up in a blacked-out barn in Tennessee this week say they were met with fear when approaching the animals, but not their own. 'They had been suffering a very long time. I saw little to no emotion, and when I did see an emotion, I saw fear,' said Scotlund Haisley, president of Animal Rescue Corps, which led the rescue operation. The dogs, who had been living in complete darkness, were found last Saturday in the barn in Manchester; many emaciated, 'living in several inches of their own waste' and close to death. According to The Huffington Post, some had acid burns from the ammonia of their own urine, and there was also a wheelbarrow in the barn filled with 10 dead dogs piled on top of each other and covered in maggots. The property owner, identified as 64-year-old Caroline Irby, was charged with 10 counts of animal cruelty on Monday and booked into the Coffee County jail on $10,000 bond. Scroll down for video . Deplorable conditions: Animal Rescue Corps workers help free almost 100 dogs that had been locked up in cages in a barn in Manchester, Tennessee, surrounded by their own waste on Saturday . In shock: Workers described the animals as being overcome with fear after living in tiny cages and total darkness for an unknown period . Filthy: Some of the breeds were unrecognizable because the dogs were covered in so much waste . Freed: The female owner of the Tennessee property has been charged with animal cruelty. Hoarding is an illness, authorities said . Rescue: The 97 dogs were in conditions that Animal Rescue Corps described as the worst they've ever seen . Squalor: The dogs were kept in the barn without any windows in Coffee County, Tennessee . Safe: Each of the dogs were assessed  individually and then sent for treatment in Lebanon, Tennessee . Unrecognizable: The dogs were mostly all adults and a variety of breeds including Golden Retrievers, Shih Tzus, Yorkshire Terriers and Border Collies, but some were so dirty it was hard to tell . Charged: The property owner, identified as 64-year-old Caroline Irby, was charged with 10 counts of animal cruelty on Monday and booked into the Coffee County jail on $10,000 bond . The dogs were mostly all adults and a variety of breeds including Golden Retrievers, Shih Tzus, Yorkshire Terriers and Border Collies. Haisley said bringing the animals outside was a stunning sight. 'Something magical happened that I had never seen before in by 26-year-old long career,' Haisley added to The HuffPost. 'When we brought everyone out, they all did the same thing. 'They shot their noses up to the sky, and what we believe they were doing was absorbing the sunshine and the oxygen.' Jackie Jones, a Smyrna-based vet, was one of many people enlisted to treat the dogs due to the overwhelming number that needed help. Many more volunteers joined the effort. 'Words can't describe how it was,' Jones told The Daily News Journal. 'It was deplorable. There was so much neglect.' The animals were checked out individually and moved to a shelter in Lebanon, where their treatment continued. Help: Dozens of workers and volunteers attend to the dogs as part of the massive rescue operation . Much happier: The animals were relocated to a shelter in Lebanon, Tennessee, where they are recovering . Nearly 100 dogs were rescued Sunday from a property in Coffee County, Tennessee, where officials say they were living in total darkness inside a squalid, windowless barn . Thankful: Workers said the dogs turned their heads and noses to the sun once outside . Besides being hungry and incredibly filthy, the biggest problem with most of them was light deprivation, which brought on heart problems and infections. Animal Rescue Corps is expected to stay and care for the dozens of dogs for at least one-and-a-half to two weeks and give them medical grooming, veterinary exams, vaccines and decompression time, the DNJ reported. To donate to Animal Rescue Corps, go to www.animalrescuecorps.org/donate. Assessment: Besides being hungry and incredibly filthy, the biggest problem with most of them was light deprivation, which brought on heart problems and infections. Deplorable: Many of the cages were rusted shut and the dogs had not appeared to have been fed in some time . Ongoing effort: The operation will continue for another one to two weeks, such was the state of the dogs . Neighbors described Irby as a nice woman. They said they did not ever suspect she was a dog hoarder or saw any evidence there were so many animals on the land. It is unclear how police first came to find the dogs hidden in the barn.","Caroline Irby, 64, was charged with 10 counts of animal cruelty Monday .

"Marco Rubio has claimed people are 'born with a sexual preference' while insisting state legislators should decide whether or not to allow gay marriage. The presidential candidate spoke to CBS's Face the Nation after admitting in an interview he would attend the same-sex wedding of a family member or staffer - even if he didn't agree with the decision. The Florida Senator told Bob Schieffer that he wasn't against gay marriage, but believes the 'definition of the institution of marriage should be between one man and one woman'. Scroll down for video . Marco Rubio told Face The Nation he believes people are born with a sexual preference, but insisted same-sex marriage should not be a constitutional right . He added: 'States have always regulated marriage. And if a state wants to have a different definition, you should petition the state legislature and have a political debate. 'I don't think courts should be making that decision. 'I don't believe same-sex marriage is a Constitutional right,' Rubio continued. 'I also don't believe that your sexual preferences are a choice for the vast and enormous majority of people. 'In fact...I believe that sexual preference is something that people are born with.' Last week, during an interview with Fusion magazine, he said if someone he 'cared' for was involved in a same-sex union he would 'of course attend'. He added: I'm not going to hurt them simply because I disagree with a choice they've made or because I disagree with a decision they've made, or whatever it may be. 'Ultimately, if someone that you care for and is part of your family has decided to move in one direction or another or feels that way because of who they love, you respect that because you love them.' Rubio also noted that, as a Catholic, he believes divorce is wrong, but he wouldn't stop loving someone if they were divorced. The Miami politician announced he is running for president last week. Donors have said their candidate has already received monetary commitments in excess of the $40 million he will likely need to battle through a presidential primary season that will feature a crowd of seasoned Republican candidates with strong financial backing.

"Britain's biggest purpose-built air raid shelter, which could hold 6,500 people, was so sophisticated it even had electric lighting and flush toilets. The tunnels were dug into sandstone cliffs along the River Mersey in Stockport in the 1930s, and were originally intended to provide car parking spaces. But following the outbreak of the Second World War, the space was redeveloped as an air raid shelter where residents of Lancashire and Cheshire could hide from Nazi bombs. Scroll down for video . Shelter: This shows one of the rooms of Britain's largest purpose-built air raid shelter, located in Stockport, Greater Manchester . Safe: A bunker lined with corrugated steel to protect against the possible effects of a Nazi bombing raid during the Second World War . Tunnels: A total of 6,500 people could fit into the shelter, which was made up of a network of interconnecting passages . Entrance: The shelter has been converted into a museum, replicating the conditions which would have been found 75 years ago . The shelter became so popular that local officials had to issue season tickets limiting the number of people who would be allowed to seek refuge there. The cliffs were first dug out to provide cellars for homes along Chestergate, one of the busiest streets in Stockport. As part of a plan to widen the roads, the local council bought and demolished the houses, and planned to convert the cellars into an underground car park. An engineering survey showed that the space was in fact unable to become a car park - but the advent of war meant that it was needed as an air raid shelter. Bathroom: The women's toilets, equipped with a proper flush, located deep inside the Stockport air raid shelter . Gadgets: A radio, blood pressure monitor and lamp from the 1940s, pictured inside the air raid shelter's first aid section . Medicine: The shelter had a first aid room to help any residents who were injured by the bombing raids . Equipment: Gas masks which were kept in the shelter are pictured left; right is the sick bay, where people could seek shelter while unwell . Extent: The shelter was going to be turned into a car park, but officials discovered that its long tunnels were unsuitable for the purpose . Curator Howard Green said: 'The official capacity was 3,850, so outside they painted 4,000 - but what they didn't advertise was that they thought they could squeeze twice as many in if needs be. 'They were used extensively by people from Manchester and Salford, and even as far as Eccles. Stockport was less of a target, and the underground shelters were a particularly safe place. 'What they did was introduce season tickets - they were issued to locals, although you could write in if you had difficult circumstances. We still have some letters from people in Manchester who'd been bombed out several times. 'It was really only a way of damping down demand, nobody was denied entrance in an alert. In the winter of 1940 and '41, it went up to 6,500, with another four sets of tunnel shelters. History: A photograph of the shelter as it appeared in the 1930s, around the time of the Second World War's outbreak . Rambling: The tunnels were large enough to fit in 6,500 people, who came from all around Lancashire, Cheshire and Manchester . Emergency: Local councils had to establish air raid shelters to protect their populations from German bomb attacks . Base: The room belonging to the shelter's warden, who would have been responsible for ensuring the safety of those inside . Danger: A fire bucket and hose which could have been used to control any unexpected blazes in the tunnels . 'People are always surprised by the extent of them, and just how much thought and planning went into them. There were first aid posts, electric lighting and flush toilets, which people living in back-to-back cottages of town centres wouldn't have had at home.' The shelter space is now operated as a museum, and has been restored to how it might have looked to residents hiding there during the war. Stockport was heavily bombed between 1940 and 1941, but escaped serious damage - unlike nearby Manchester, which as an industrial hub came under sustained attack from the German air force.","Air raid shelter in Stockport was dug out of caves along the River Mersey and intended to be a car park .

"Los Angeles Kings forward Jarret Stoll was arrested on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, on drug possession charges, and looked wide-eyed and alert in his mugshot. Stoll, 32, is the longtime boyfriend of Dancing With The Stars host Erin Andrews, a former ESPN employee who now works as an NFL sideline reporter for Fox Sports. The NHL player was arrested for possession of cocaine and MDMA, also known as Molly, at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand Hotel shortly before 5pm. On Monday TMZ Sports added that the athlete was trying to smuggle over three grams of cocaine and over eight grams of MDMA by hiding them in his board shorts. Scroll down for video .

Stoll (seen partying at the MGM Grand in 2014 after the Kings Stanley Cup win) was arrested on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, on drug possession charges . He was arrested for possession of cocaine at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand (above) Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Michael Pariente, a Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer, says that Stoll will likely be offered a plea deal as a first time offender. Speaking with TSN, he said; 'It's pretty much a slap on the wrist. Even if he was going to represent himself they'd make him an offer like this.' This would include a $1,000 fee, an online drug awareness course, and possibly community service. Stoll was likely at the MGM Grand to attend the two year anniversary of their popular club Hakkasan Friday evening, an event that featured Tiesto and brought out Christina Aguilera. In both 2012 and 2014, Stoll headed to the MGM Grand to celebrate  the end of the hockey season with his Kings teammates. It seems that Stoll went on a date with Andrews on Thursday night, as she posted a photo of a romantic-looking candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page, and a fan snapped a photo with Stoll earlier in the day in the same neighborhood. The caption, which did not mention Stoll by name, read: 'Always a great date night'.

He has been with the team since 2008, but will become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. The Kings failed to qualify for postseason play after winning the Stanley Cup last year and in 2012. The team said in a statement following Stoll's arrest: 'We are aware of police reports out of Clark County, Nevada regarding Jarret Stoll. 'Our organization is concerned and has begun conducting a thorough internal investigation. 'While we continue to actively gather facts, we are withholding further comment at this time.' Veteran had 17 points in 73 games this season and was a member of the Kings' recent Stanley Cup teams . Andrews, 36, sparked engagement rumors after she posted an Instagram of her wearing a very large, square-cut diamond ring last month. Fans thought the picture meant Stoll had proposed, but Andrews said the ring was on loan. 'I've definitely dropped hints here and there,' the Fox broadcaster shared with ABC News in July. 'But we haven't looked at rings... Nothing there yet, the ball's in his court.' She added: 'But no we are fine! We've had enough on our plate for the last two years of dating and haven't really gone there yet.' He was previously engaged to actress and model Rachel Hunter, the former wife of singer Rod Stewart, and dated actress Katie Cassidy. Stoll broke off his engagement with Hunter just seven weeks before they were supposed to be married.","Los Angeles Kings forward arrested Friday on drug possession charges .

"A super-fertile dental nurse is being hailed a hero after helping scores of childless couples try to conceive - by donating 50 eggs. Mother-of-two Kelly Parsons, from Morden, south west London, has already enabled two couples to have twins and another woman give birth to a boy, thanks to her willingness to go through the painful donation procedure. In the space of 11 months, the 35-year-old's eggs have become twin girls, twin boys and a baby boy. Kelly Parsons, 35, from London (pictured with daughters Emily, four, (left) and 11-year-old Charlotte (right) has donate 50 of her eggs to help childless couples conceive . Kelly said: 'Despite the pain, it was worth it to bring joy to families that would never be able to have kids naturally. 'To have the urge to have kids and not be able to have them must be heartbreaking. I'm only a little part of making these babies. 'I am sure the parents will probably curse me in the middle of the night when they have to do bottle feeds.' Kelly and her train dispatcher husband Dean, 41, had a daughter, Charlotte, now 11, in 2003. After eight years of trying and three heartbreaking miscarriages, Kelly gave birth to daughter Emily in January 2011. Kelly then decided to start donating her eggs to other childless couples, in a bid to help as many families share the joys of children. Kelly and her husband Dean, 41, (second right) struggled for eight years to conceive Emily, with Kelly suffering three heartbreaking miscarriages . She said: 'I wanted the eggs to go to a husband and wife so that the kids would be raised in a similar environment to our family - after all, these eggs could have been my children. 'Dean wasn't totally on board but because I have supported him through so many crazy things, he knew it was my turn. 'You can only donate your eggs until you are 35, and because I was 33 at the time I felt like the clock was ticking.' Kelly injected herself twice a day with drugs to stop her period and stimulate her ovaries, and after a few months she will have stored up enough for them to be harvested. She said: 'After the first time I donated eggs I was knackered but so happy I'd done it. Kelly injected herself twice a day with drugs to stop her period and stimulate her ovaries . In all, the nurse has donated eggs three times, leading to three successful pregnancies - twin boys, twin girls, and a baby boy . 'A week later I got a call to say five of them had been fertilised and two had been implanted into the mum-to-be. 'They'd also frozen the others so they could have more kids in the future. 'From then on I was on tenterhooks, hoping her body would accept the embryos. 'Although I knew nothing about the couple, I really felt a connection to them.' In all, Kelly has donated eggs three times, leading to three successful pregnancies. Also, a number of her eggs have been frozen for future use. Controversially, Kelly has told her 11-year-old daughter that she has brothers and sisters. Controversially she has told her daughter Charlotte that she has brothers and sisters out there - and she has elected for her egg donor kids to be able to contact her daughters when they turn 18 . She also chose for the kids to be able to contact her daughters when they turn 18 - as she wants her girls to know their half siblings. She added: 'I would love to see if they look like me and am curious to meet them when they grow up. 'Charlotte is so excited by the thought she might get to meet her brothers and sisters one day. 'She even wants to donate her eggs because she thinks what I've done is amazing. 'The people that I've helped have babies have been through the menopause or cancer meaning they could never conceive naturally. Imagine having that urge to become a mother but not being able to have a baby, it must be devastating.

"A four-year-old child climbed under a temporary bike rack along Pennsylvania Avenue triggering Secret Service to put the White House under lockdown. The unidentified child caused the presidential residence to be closed off for a few moments on Sunday afternoon. 'Child was fine and was safely reunited with parents' following the incident, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary told CNN. A four-year-old child climbed under a temporary bike rack along Pennsylvania Avenue triggering Secret Service to put the president residence under lock down for a few moments . The incident is the second lockdown in Washington only a day after a man shot and killed himself on Saturday. The man died after shooting himself on the west front of the Capitol building just after 1 p.m., Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said. No one else was hurt. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said the man had a backpack and a rolling suitcase, triggering an hours-long lockdown, and a sign that said something about 'social justice.' Witness Robert Bishop told CNN it said something about taxing the '1%.' Bomb squad members respond to reports of a suspicious package on the West Front of the US Capitol,  on Capitol Hill on Saturday. A man carrying a backpack and rolling suitcase shot himself while carrying a sign about taxation. Authorities do not believe there is a terrorism connection . Robert Bishop of Annapolis, Maryland said he was biking near the steps of the Capitol when the suicide happened. Bishop didn't witness the suicide but said there were about 60 people in the area, and that some of them did, including a girl and her mother who immediately began crying afterward. Bishop said another witness told him and a police officer that the man who killed himself held up a protest sign about taxation just before pulling the trigger. The lockdown came during Washington's annual Cherry Blossom Festival, which attracts thousands of tourists during Washington's busy season. Congress has been on spring recess for two weeks and lawmakers are set to return to work Monday. Busy day: The suicide came on one of the busiest days for tourist in the U.S. Capitol as travelers from the world over flock to the yearly cherry blossom festival . January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the drone hobbyist lost control of the device. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for while being filmed by cameras for their reality show.","Child climbed under a temporary bike rack along Pennsylvania Avenue causing lockdown on Sunday afternoon .

"Carrying out the perfect U-turn can be tricky at the best of times, so spare a thought for this coach driver who had to complete it on a narrow river slipway. Not only did the driver have to perform the manoeuvre, he also had to do it while carrying a bus full of French tourists and under the watchful stare of passersby. The coach driver found himself stuck on slipway, with a queue of cars behind, after he tried to board a  ferry in Devon only to get turned back. This is the moment that a French coach was forced to perform a U-turn on a river slipway in Dartmouth, Devon . Eyewitnesses feared that one wrong move from the driver and the bus would slid into the estuary . Unable to reverse back up the way he had come, the driver had no other option than to attempt the  U-turn. Terrified Gallic customers were said to have clung onto their seats as the driver slowly shunted forward and back. Eyewitnesses feared that one wrong move and the bus would slid into the estuary. Tourists and locals enjoying the sunshine at Dartmouth gathered to watch as the coach, owned by French operator Sovetours, was turned back when it tried to board the ferry on the Kingswear side of the River Dart. A spokesman for the Dartmouth Higher Ferry company confirmed that the coach was too big to be allowed to cross. He said 'Triple-axle coaches are not permitted to use the ferry as they are usually overweight. 'Experience has shown that damage can occur to the rear of the vehicle during loading and unloading. There are clear signs in place to warn drivers.' The ferry service between Dartmouth and Kingswear  costs £4.70 for cars and 50p for foot passengers for a single journey. It clearly states on the firm's website that they are unable to carry triple-axie coaches. After much French blue language, the driver managed to complete a U-turn on the seaweed covered, sloping slipway and head back to go the long way round.

"A local council has been criticised for banning an Indian food stall from a St George's Day event because it 'only wanted English food'. British-born stall-holder Tania Rahman, 27, was asked by Salisbury City Council if she wanted to run a stand at the celebration later this month. But when she asked to be counted in she was told her stall, Chit Chaat Chai, would not be allowed because it is not 'English-themed'. 'Discriminatory': Tania Rahman received a letter from Salisbury City Council telling her it would not accept her offer to run a food stall at a St George's Day event because it 'only wanted English food' The council has now apologised after their response sparked a backlash from locals - who pointed out that chicken tikka masala is a British-made dish. Ms Rahman, of Andover, Hampshire, was one of many food stall-holders who applied to take part in the event planned for Sunday, April 26. When her application was rejected, she was sent a response she has branded 'discriminatory'. It read: 'It has been decided that St Georges day will be English themed food only. Many Thanks, Salisbury City Council.' Ms Rahman said: 'When I received the email my initial reaction was 'am I reading this right?'. I couldn't believe it.  I was hugely disappointed. 'I consider myself to be English - I was born in this country. How far does it go? Can only English people attend the event? U-turn: The council has since apologised for the letter and reversed their decision by inviting Ms Rahman to run a stand on the day . 'It is the utter ignorance of it all that makes me most upset. Why should I not be allowed to trade on St George's Day? 'It is a day celebrated all over the world. The whole thing has been very upsetting.' Questioning the wording of the letter, she added: 'In all respect, with English cuisine in modern day England what can we actually define to be English food? 'To say that one food is English cuisine and another isn't, I beg to differ. To think Indian food itself plays a huge part in English day food, it seems silly not to have it there. 'Chicken Tikka Masala is the nation's favourite dish and St George himself was born in Palestine. I just thought they cannot be serious.' She added: 'Salisbury is one of the most multi-cultural towns in Wiltshire. For them to turn around and say they don't want my food there because it isn't English enough is discriminatory.' Miss Rahman posted the council's email on her Facebook page, which was criticised by her followers and friends. Street party: An image captured at last year's St George's Day Festival in Salisbury. The annual festival takes place in Salisbury city centre on Sunday . Friend Jordan Harris said: 'I wonder if they'll be checking passports and heritage on the day to make sure the crowd is positively English.' A spokeswoman for Salisbury City Council said the authority 'never intended to be racist'. Annie Child, deputy city clerk, said: 'The Council acknowledges that the email sent to Ms Rahman was poorly worded. The Council never intended to be racist. 'The theme of the St George's Day event in 2015 was olde worlde traditional English with Morris Dancers and dragon fighting. 'Ms Rahman has raised some very interesting points about modern England and the council will wish to reflect upon these issues when setting the theme for the St George's Day in 2016 and onwards. 'The council is delighted to offer Ms Rahman an opportunity to trade at the St George's Day event as part of our apology to her. Defence: A spokeswoman for Salisbury City Council said the authority 'never intended to be racist' 'The council is sorry for any offence caused and looks forward to seeing Chit Chaat Chai trading in Salisbury.' Ms Rahman has stated she will now reluctantly accept the council's offer of the stall. She said: 'When they offered us a stall my first reaction was to say no because they didn't want us there to start with, but the people seem to really want us there so we will be there.'","Stall-owner Tania Rahman, 27, was invited to take part in the celebrations .

"The son of a Labour councillor who was detained in Turkey after apparently trying to sneak into Syria with eight family members was seen grinning as he began his journey back to Britain. Waheed Ahmed, 21, who is the son of Rochdale politician Shakil Ahmed, was arrested with eight relatives – including four children – in a remote Turkish border town earlier this month. However, it is understood he is now returning to the UK and will fly from Dalaman into Manchester Airport later this evening. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Waheed Ahmed  looks relaxed as he begins his journey back to the UK after being caught trying to sneak into Syria with eight family members . On the way home: The 21-year-old, sporting a shaved head, was filmed being escorted from a vehicle . Sky News reported that the remaining eight members of his family will remain in Turkey until Tuesday. The majority of the family flew to Turkey on March 27 from Manchester Airport and are accused of having plans to try and sneak across the border into Syria. Waheed did not fly out with his family but joined them three days later on a flight from Birmingham. Mohammed Shafiq, a friend of Waheed's father, said there were concerns about his behaviour in the months leading up to his arrest. He told Sky News: 'There were concerns in the last six months to a year about a change in his behaviour. 'And a change in his attitude towards various different issues. 'That was causing concern for people in the community and his family.' Earlier this month, Waheed's father spoke of his shock after being told that his son is suspected of being a militant Islamist. He said: 'All I know is that they were on holiday and then the next thing I am told is that they have been arrested.' Mr Ahmed was with his aunt, two cousins and one of their wives when they were stopped in Turkey, near the Syrian border . Waheed Ahmed, the 21-year-old son of Labour Councillor Shakil Ahmed, is understood to be returning to the UK on a flight to Manchester from Dalaman tonight following his arrest for allegedly trying to sneak into Syria . Waheed Ahmed, 21,  is the son of Rochdale Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed (pictured above with Ed Miliband) The nine Britons, who include three men, two women and four children aged between one and 11, were seized in Hatay province, in southern Turkey. It shares a border with part of Syria controlled by rebel factions including those linked to Al Qaeda and ISIS. All of those held are from Rochdale and are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory. Counter terrorism officers at Greater Manchester Police began an investigation into their movements and the extended family group were detained at a checkpoint in Ogulpinar earlier this month. A senior officer questioned why anyone would take children so young 'and vulnerable' into a warzone. The three men and two women, aged between 21 and 47, were taken to a hospital with their children, aged one, three, eight and 11. Waheed (pictured) was detained in Turkey alongside his aunt, two cousins and one of his cousin's wives . The nine Britons - four of them children – were seized by Turkish security forces as they tried to slip into Syria . Officials said they would be photographed and fingerprinted before being deported back to the UK. At the time, photographs showed Waheed, dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots, leading the group from a minibus into a police station. Several women, all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces, could be seen carrying children. Most of the party were wearing walking boots, perfect for trekking across the rugged region. Shakil Ahmed, a bakery delivery driver, is a councillor in Kingsway and served alongside Karen Danczuk, wife of Rochdale MP Simon Daczuk, until her resignation in January. Speaking as he delivered election campaign leaflets earlier this month, he said he recognised his son in online newspaper reports of his arrest. He said the others arrested included Waheed's aunt, Zadia Bi, 50, and two of her sons and one of their wives. He said: 'I don't know why they have been arrested. We have no information. Until they ring we will not know what has happened.' He said that he had seen his son's photograph and when asked about one picture of his son laughing, he replied: 'Well, they went on holiday so they shouldn't be crying on holiday should they?' He added: 'I don't believe my son was on his way to join Islamic State. I was shocked, worried and extremely upset to hear that my son has been arrested. During their arrest, the family were fingerprinted and taken to a police station where they have been held since . One of the family members, holding a child, is seen arriving at a Turkish hospital to undergo medical checks . The family are pictured arriving at a police station in Turkey's southern Hatay province earlier this month . 'It's a total mystery to me why he's there, as I was under the impression he was on a work placement in Birmingham. 'My son is a good Muslim and his loyalties belong to Britain. If I thought for a second that he was in danger of being radicalised, I would have reported him to the authorities.' The councillor added: 'He's studying a degree in politics and sociology at Manchester University and has a good future ahead of him. I just want to speak to my son and get him home as soon as possible.' Waheed apparently called his devastated father to break the news he had been arrested.

"A young bride planned a fairytale wedding and married her fiancé just six days after finding out his cancer is terminal. Laura Jordan, 24, was told her now husband, Jack Jordan, 23, had just weeks to live on Saturday April 11, having battled leukaemia since 2013. The couple, from Brixham, Devon, got engaged at Jack's hospital bedside just two months ago after being left devastated by the news. Scroll down for video . Laura and Jack on their wedding day yesterday, April 16, at the Torbay Hospital Chapel . Laura with Jack in hospital, where she sat by his side for more than a year . Friends, family, and hospital stuff rushed to plan the pair's dream wedding, and Laura and Jack got married in Torbay Hospital Chapel just six days after the heartbreaking news - and Ed Sheeran even sent them a personal video. In it he said: 'Hope you have an amazing wedding. And drink a lot, dance a lot and have a lot of sex. You should be doing that. awkward laughter. And, yes, have a wonderful time - see you soon.' The couple first met at school as teenagers but it wasn't until 2012 when Jack worked in Laura's local corner shop that their relationship blossomed. Jack underwent gruelling rounds of chemotherapy after being diagnosed two years ago, but it failed to stop cancer from spreading into his bone marrow. He is hoping to spend his final weeks at home surrounded by close family, his wife and her two-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, Lilly. Laura added: 'As soon as Jack told me that doctors could not offer him any further treatment I turned to him and said 'we need to get married. 'He proposed to me in January but we thought we had our whole lives to plan our wedding day. 'When he was given just weeks to live we had no time to wait, I'm so happy that I can call Jack my husband now, we are soul mates and it seemed like the perfect thing to do. In 2013, Jack knew there was something wrong when he started to feel tired and achy all the time - a blood test confirmed he had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia . At the time Laura was due to give birth to Lilly and needed to focus on her, but the pair kept in touch . 'I surprised Jack by wearing a traditional white wedding dress after I told him I was wearing a smart suit. 'He couldn't stop smiling when he saw me walking down the aisle, I felt like a princess. 'Our wedding day was amazing, we will never forget, it was the happiest day of our lives.' Laura was distraught when Jack broke the news that his treatment wasn't working and he had just weeks to live. She added: 'Jack has undergone so much chemotherapy in the past two years but despite being briefly in remission this year, his leukaemia returned. 'When he told me it was terminal last Friday I thought I would at least have a year with Jack before he died but when he told me he had just weeks left I was in complete shock. 'We had made so many plans for the future and Jack just kept saying ""I'm so sorry"" as he knew he could no longer be here to fulfil them with me. When Lilly was six-months-old Laura drove two hours to see Jack at Bristol Hospital . After nine months of being inseparable the pair decided to start a relationship in February 2014 . They often had date nights where they would order Dominoes and watch films . Leukaemia affects a person's white blood cells. White blood cells are the important infection-fighting part of the immune system, made in your bone marrow. Patients with leukaemia produce an abnormal number of immature white blood cells which 'clog up' their bone marrow. This stops bone marrow making other blood cells, which are vital for a balanced immune system and healthy blood. Acute leukaemia comes on suddenly, progesses quickly and needs to be treated urgently. Chronic leukaemia develops more slowly, over months or years. Common treatments for leukaemia include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a bone marrow transplant. It is predicted that 48 per cent of men and 44 per cent of women will survive the disease for ten years or more. 'I'm completely heartbroken but I find my strength in him, I need to make sure his last few weeks are the best ones of his life. 'There is nothing more he wanted than to become my husband so I'm really happy that I was able to fulfil that wish for him.' Laura wore a floor length white wedding dress that was fitted by her mother, Jenny Cant, 47, who works in bridal store, Jane's. The registrar was provided for free by the Torbay Hospital Chapel and Lilly was their flower girl. Laura added: 'The day was perfect, Jack was determined to walk on his wedding day despite being completely exhausted due to cancer treatment. 'He had some oxygen before the ceremony began so he was able to smile for some treasured pictures without feeling as though he looked unwell. 'We both love one another so much that it was lovely to see him looking so happy despite knowing he has just weeks to live.' Laura first met Jack when they were at school but it wasn't until years later while Laura was pregnant that their relationship blossomed. She said: 'I was always popping down to my local corner shop for one craving or another but when I noticed Jack worked there I started going daily. 'I knew the minimum spend on a debit card was five-pounds so I purposely never took cash so I could take longer choosing things in the shop that would equal over that amount. 'Me and Jack would always have a little chat and he worked every day he could but one day when I walked in I noticed a charity bucket on the till for him, it read 'help poorly Jack.' Laura surprised Jack by wearing a traditional white wedding dress after telling him she would wear a suit . There is nothing more Jack wanted than to become Laura's husband, so she's delighted to have been able to fulfil that wish for him . 'I was devastated when I realised he had blood cancer, he had kept it to himself as he didn't want me to worry.' Jack knew there was something wrong when he started to feel tired and achy all the time - a blood test confirmed he had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Laura said: 'At the time I was due to give birth to Lilly and I needed to focus on my daughter but we kept in touch in Facebook but I missed seeing him terribly. 'When Lilly was just six-months-old I drove two hours to see him at Bristol Hospital. 'He was so happy that I remembered him and he was completely overwhelmed to see us both.' Laura has been at Jack's side ever since and after nine-months of being inseparable the pair decided to start a relationship in February 2014. Laura says they feel like the happiest couple in the world to have got married, but wish they had longer . When Laura found out about Jack's condition she was due to give birth to Lilly so needed to focus on her . Laura was over the moon when he proposed two months ago while he was in hospital . She said: 'Jack has spent the majority of our relationship in hospital as he needs constant transfusions and chemo to stay alive but I have always made the best of our time together. 'We often had date nights where we would order dominoes and watch films.' Laura was over the moon when he proposed two months ago while he was in hospital - it was a dream come true. Laura said: 'We had wanted to wait until Jack got better before we got married but that was no longer an option, it was now or never and I can't imagine my life without being Jack's wife. 'I'm so happy we will be spending our final few weeks as a family, there's nothing more important than ensuring he feels comfortable and content in his final few weeks. 'We feel like the happiest couple in the world to have got married but we just wish we had longer together.' Jack added: 'Marrying Laura is something I have wanted to do for a long time, I'm so happy and proud to call her my wife. 'I love Laura and Lilly more than anything and I hope to create as many memories as possible in my final weeks. 'We want to say a big thank you to everyone who made our wedding day possible. After the ceremony, Jack and Laura were stunned to discover that their music idol Ed Sheeran had sent them a personalised video greeting from New Zealand. In it, he said: 'Hey Jack and Laura, It's Ed here. I am sorry I can't be there. I am in New Zealand at the moment - just doing a tour. Ed Sheeran sent the couple a cheeky personalised video greeting from New Zealand . 'Hope you have an amazing wedding. And drink a lot, dance a lot and have a lot of sex. You should be doing that. awkward laughter. And, yes, have a wonderful time - see you soon.' Laura said: 'We were told after the signing of the registers that Ed Sheeran had sent a video. 'Apparently if he had more notice he would have been there for us. He was on holiday in New Zealand and still took time out to do it. 'I was in total shock. The whole chapel gasped in unison as soon as it was announced. 'We are both huge fans. His awkwardness is hilarious to us, but he's our age and proof to never give up. 'We were devastated because I bought Jack tickets for our anniversary in February to go and see him at Wembley in July and now we obviously can't go. 'The tickets will eventually arrive and Jack won't be here.' The video was arranged through Jack's social worker Suzie Holmes from CLIC Sargent.","Laura Jordan, 24, married Jack Jordan, 23, yesterday .

"A man who spent 15 years on death row in Alabama has been freed after his conviction was quashed and he struck a bargain with prosecutors. William Ziegler, now 39, was initially convicted of capital murder in 2001 for killing Russell Allen Baker, an acquaintance of his who was found dead next to his house in Mobile the previous year. However in 2012 his conviction was overturned by Judge Sarah Stewart who blasted his initial trial, pointing out that his lawyers were substandard, a key witness later recounted her testimony, and that a juror lied about his views on the death penalty during selection. William Ziegler, now 39, was jailed in 2001 (pictured) for the killing of Russell Allen Baker, an acquaintance of his who was found dead next to his house in Mobile the previous year . Ziegler  (cetnre, with his mother, second left) had his conviction for capital murder quashed in 2012 after a judge blasted his initial trial, allowing him to cut a plea deal  which saw him walk free today . Today he is a free man again after he agreed to plead guilty to aiding and abetting murder, with the judge sentencing him to the 15 years and 50 days he has already served, Al.com reported. The ruling, which has been hailed by Mr Ziegler's family, marks the second time in recent weeks that a death row prisoner has walked free. On April 3 Anthony Ray Hinton was released after spending 30 years in jail for a 1985 shooting in which two fast food managers were shot dead. His conviction was overturned after tests on the gun allegedly used in the shooting couldn't prove that it was fired during the killings. In Ziegler's case, he was arrested after the body of Baker was found in a wooded area close to his house in 2000. Witnesses reported seeing Baker arguing with Ziegler at a party that evening, eventually leading to Ziegler's conviction, along with two other accomplices. However, that witness, whose evidence was kept secret by prosecutors at Ziegler's initial trial, later recanted her testimony, one of the factors leading to the conviction being overturned. In November last year, state prosecutors had raised the prospect of a retrial for Ziegler, meaning he could have faced going back to death row if convicted for a second time. At his hearing today, Judge Sarah Stewart warned Ziegler against becoming bitter, adding that 'the world is a very different place than it was 15 years ago when you went to jail' Ziegler's release comes after Anthony Ray Hinton (pictured) was freed from death row two weeks ago after serving 30 years for a double murder he did not commit . Ziegler was determined to prove his innocence, according to his defence lawyers, but was reluctantly persuaded to accept a plea bargain for the chance to leave jail and escape another trial. During the hearing, Judge Stewart urged Ziegler to resist turning bitter and said she knew he recognized God's grace. 'I want you to appreciate that gift,' she said. 'You need to be very careful with your gift. ... The world is a very different place than it was 15 years ago when you went to jail.' With his plea, Ziegler acknowledged that his conduct helped lead to Baker's death. Relatives of both Ziegler and Baker, from Bayou La Batre, came away from the hearing disappointed. O'Della Wilson, the defendant's mother, said she is happy that he will go free but angry that he had to plead guilty to any crime. 'He had no choice but to go ahead and plead to a murder he did not commit. ... Judge Stewart's the only one who has given us any justice,' she said. Baker's relatives weren't happy Ziegler would be released. 'He's a menace to our society. He will be back,' said Beth Johansen, the victim's aunt. 'This is not justice for our nephew.'","William Ziegler convicted of capital murder  for 2001 killing of Russell Baker .

"Five time Emmy-winning actress Candice Bergen, now 68, confesses she was the highest paid actor in television for a lot of years after playing the title role in the hit CBS sitcom, Murphy Brown that ran for ten years starting in 1988. ‘The job security was incredible. And I never wanted it to end; doing Murphy Brown was insanely fun’. ‘I have made a lot of money. Most of this is the incomparable TV Money. Nothing like it’. After the first year of the hit TV show, when she won the Golden Globe and Emmy for best actress, her salary headed skyward for over ten years and she kept that fact a secret. Financial secrets prevailed in her upbringing by her model/ actress mother and her famous father, Edgar Bergen, best known for as ventriloquist who's sidekick was dummy Charlie McCarthy. Scroll down for video . Puppet envy: In her new memoir, Candice Bergen writes that her father belittled her looks and favored his dummy. She reveals that she would sit on one of her father’s knees at the breakfast table and Charlie McCarthy sat on the other.‘A gentle squeeze on the back of my neck was my cue to open and shut my mouth so he could ventriloquize me. Charlie and I would chatter together silently, while behind us Dad would supply the snappy repartee for both of us' Success: Candice starred in the long-running TV hit Murphy Brown, here with costar Grant Shaud . Happy at last: Candice Bergen and husband Marshall Rose t the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscar Party . Edgar spent more time with the dummy than his first-born child, Candice. And when he died in 1978, her penurious father left his only daughter out of his will - but not Charlie.. Charlie McCarthy was willed $10,000 with the proviso that the funds be managed, invested and reinvested to fund ventriloquist performances in the future. Edgar wrote ‘I make this provision for sentimental reasons which to me are vital due to the association with Charlie McCarthy who has been my constant companion and who has taken on the character of a real person and from whom I have never been separated even for a day’. ‘I’d chased my father’s approval all my life and here was proof I’d never get it’, the actress candidly reveals in her new memoir, A Fine Romance, published by Simon & Schuster. Charlie McCarthy dominated Candy’s childhood. She sat on one of her father’s knees at the breakfast table and Charlie sat on the other. ‘A gentle squeeze on the back of my neck was my cue to open and shut my mouth so he could ventriloquize me. Charlie and I would chatter together silently, while behind us Dad would supply the snappy repartee for both of us. Charlie had his own bedroom next to mine – and his was bigger. Candy's competition for her dad's affections was not with a sibling - it was with her ventriloquist EdBound to give Charlie McCarthy . ‘Those were unique circumstances to grow up in. Sometimes I have to give myself credit for being a functional human being,' she writes . ‘Those were unique circumstances to grow up in. Sometimes I have to give myself credit for being a functional human being’. ‘I knew my father loved me, but with his Swedish reserve, it wasn’t his nature to tell me’, Bergen writes. He was not physically affectionate and when the young girl decided to get over her own terror of trying to say she loved him, his response to her declaration was a pat on the hand. But the two would go up in his plane together and he’d prop the young girl up on phonebooks and let her fly the plane. They also went on fishing outings together and took long breakfast rides on horseback when visiting Palm Springs. ‘Still I was hurt, shocked when I discovered he had left me out of his will’. She didn’t need the money but it was an emotional slight. Edgar also kept secrets from his wife – the contents of a safe in his study. When Candice and her mother finally figured out the combination after his death, the name ‘Charlie’ transposed into numbers, the door opened to reveal fabulous pieces of jewelry that Edgar had purchased and stowed away as investments and also to avoid paying taxes on them. Mrs. Frances Bergen, known professionally as Frances Westcott after becoming ‘the Chesterfield Girl’ and the ‘Ipana (toothpaste) Girl’ in newspaper ads and on billboards, had no clue as to the existence of the large marquis diamond ring or the beautiful diamond necklace with an aquamarine the size of an egg. Edgar never included her in any financial discussion but after his death, she became the ‘stock witch’, cleverly quadrupling the value of the estate over twenty years. Charlie McCarthy always dominated Candice’s life. She compared playing her award-winning title role on Murphy Brown to channeling her inner Charlie. The Murphy Brown character fit her like a glove and ‘gave me permission to be my brattiest, bawdiest self’. Her father was schizophrenic in the same way -- buttoned-down, quiet, and introverted– unless he was with friends or had Charlie with him, an invitation to be risqué and tell dirty jokes. Director Louis Malle and actress Candice Bergen attend the 'Dangerous Liaisons'  premier in 1988 . ‘He belonged to a men’s group called the Rancheros Visitadores. They would go on weekend horseback rides and camp out and tell stories and fart around a campfire’. Then he would revert to his introverted self when back at home. Candice married the brilliant French film director, screenwriter and producer Louis Malle in 1980. When she became pregnant with their first and only child, Chloe Malle, Candice agonized over whether or not she would be able to tell the baby still in her womb that she loved her. She had never heard those words growing up and had never been able to tell her parents she loved them until late in their lives and well into her thirties. For thirty-nine years, those feelings were suppressed until Chloe was born in 1985 and then the infant hijacked Candice’s feelings and turned her into a lunatic if she was separated from the child. The little girl became the love of her life distancing her from Malle. He escaped Los Angeles to work in France and New York. But the couple remained devoted and thought about having a second child until Louis was diagnosed with myelofibrosis that morphed into lymphoma and inflammation of the brain. The illness was fatal.' ‘I was in a black anger. I felt that my life, which had always been blessed, had suddenly been hijacked by this completely other force.’ Candice's daughter Chloe is engaged and will marry in France, as her mother did Chloe's father, this summer . ‘I felt like my heart was breaking’. She hid in the housekeeper’s room and cried at night. She sought out primal scream therapy and was angry that that her life was being taken away from her and that she had become caretaker. Louis died in November 1995 at age sixty-three and Bergen confesses she still thinks about him all the time. ‘We loved each other completely, then were pulled apart by distance’. Three years later in 1998, she met Marshall Rose, who had been chairman of the New York Public Library, a real estate developer, philanthropist and a billionaire. They married in June 2000 and writes that she found this new married life claustrophobic. She and Louis had lived together and apart with his work in Europe. Now ‘Marsh’ was reaching out for a closeness she found excessive and suffocating and reacted to with tiny tantrums. Back to analysis that helped her open up to the continued tenderness of her second husband. Feeling too old for movies, feeling like a cliché, a middle-aged actress with no job offers, she was suffering from empty nest syndrome until the offer to act in Boston Legal in 2005 came along and rescued her from her anxieties. These days Bergen accepts the thirty pounds she’s packed on since her marriage to Marsh. She accepts that she is ‘a champion eater. ‘No carb is safe – no fat either’. Always a compulsive eater, when she was a young girl, she consumed twelve peanut butter and jelly sandwich halves in less than ten minutes. She no longer overeats past gratification but still indulges in cookies and ice cream if she can find where the housekeeper has hidden them and Parmesan cheese. She writes there is so much fat in her face that the skin is stretched to the max while hanging in folds under her chin. She’s on meds for mini-strokes she first suffered while taping Boston Legal, but she’s off the Prozac that had been prescribed. She’s given up chasing plastic surgery or fills to look younger and has settled in a loving and devoted relationship with Marsh.

"This is the moment that two total strangers who could pass for identical twins came face to face for the first time. Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student and TV presenter, found her 29-year-old doppleganger after she teamed up with two friends to launch a project called Twin Strangers . The aim of the social media experiment was to see which of the three could find their closest lookalike within 28 days and it attracted submissions to their website 'twin-strangers.com from across the world. Scroll down for video . This is the moment that Niamh Geaney, right, met her doppleganger, Karen Branigan, left for the first time . They meet! 'I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me' Niamh (right) said about Karen (left) Incredibly, Miss Geaney, of Dublin found Karen Branigan in just two weeks - just an hour away. After their first meeting she said: ‘I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face. ‘And some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, “Oh my God that’s my face”. I can’t remember the number of times I said “this is so freaky”. It was truly amazing. ‘I would say Karen is the shyer of the two of us,’ said Miss Geaney. ‘But then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me. I’m the weirdo that contacted Karen and asked her to meet me.’ Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . 'For the entire duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face,' said Niamh (left) Miss Branigan, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Miss Greaney has two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Since meeting, Miss Greaney and Miss Branigan - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'. Karen (right) turned out to be a fellow Ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from Niamh (left), making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together . She added, 'Some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, ""Oh my God that’s my face""' While Miss Geaney appears to have beaten her fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry and 22-year-old Terence, hands down, the search isn't over until April 27. 'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry English said. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence Manzanga. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!'

Miss Geaney, who is still promoting the project across social media with Harry and Terence as interest spreads, says there will be no prize for the winner, just 'pride'. They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' She said. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'

"Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons had been on my wish list for a while - and Mum is such a huge fan of Raymond Blanc she once confessed he could be her Mastermind subject… . Nestled in the green rolling hills of the Chilterns, Le Manoir is a striking building; a 15th Century manor house built with golden bricks and burgundy roof tiles, and boasting tall chimney stacks and climbing wisteria. It is beautiful - and it's impossible not to gawp. The impeccably kept grounds included perfectly trimmed lawns, bronze sculptures (including a scarecrow based on Blanc himself), pathways lined with lavender and the walled organic kitchen garden - which supplies the restaurant with seasonal herbs, salads and vegetables. Lucy Verasamy proudly shows one of the healthy and tasty dishes created at Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons . Raymond Blanc pays a surprise visit to the cooking school that bares his name in his Oxford manor house . Our twin room for the night was huge. We loved it - from the flattering lighting and the textured wallpaper to the cashmere blankets on the end of the beds. Le Manoir's restaurant has held two Michelin stars for the best part of the 30 years since it opened. We decided to go for the full-on dining experience and the seven-course taster menu. Each dish was presented like a work of art - it almost seemed a shame to attack it with my cutlery. It was so good we were both unusually quiet. With every course came a helpful and brief explanation, and a glass of wine. The cheese trolley was one of the biggest I'd seen. By this stage I was on mouse-sized portions and ready to pop. The next morning I was woken by the sound of birds rather than the alarm on my phone. We headed down to breakfast but were distracted from the huge smorgasbord of choice by Blanc himself as he bounced around the tables, cheerfully welcoming guests. Le Manoir boasts  stunning grounds, luxury accommodation and Blanc's two Michelin-starred restaraunt . Thankfully, Mum was more starstruck than stalker when it was our turn. Chatty and friendly, Blanc noticed my Bircher muesli and immediately offered up the recipe. I had signed up to the Food, Body, Mind course due to start promptly at 9am - one of several day-long courses run at the in-house cookery school. A few minutes in, Blanc unexpectedly arrived and introduced the course - passionate, enthusiastic and energetic he spoke about the importance of nutrition and being mindful of the ingredients we choose. This was right up my street and I couldn't wait to get going. Natalia, a nutritionist, and Mark, a chef who has worked with Blanc for more than 25 years, were brilliant course hosts and teachers. With their amazing knowledge, they were like a human foodie Google. Natalia banished misleading food myths, while her informative facts and figures on the latest medical research were fascinating. I couldn't help but scribble down notes. Food icon Raymond Blanc and Lucy bond over a delicious creme caramel at his Oxfordshire cooking school . I thought my limited cooking skills would be a hindrance, but far from it. Mark showed us several easy, healthy dishes - some of which we cooked, wearing our chef whites in our own fully equipped kitchens. Hands-on Blanc popped back just as we were making our sugar-free chocolate mousse - and wasted no time in helping out with the frantic whisking. Trains run from London Marylebone to Haddenham & Thame Parkway (a 10-minute drive to the hotel and restaurant) Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons offers a Wine & Dine break from £895 per couple. This includes a five-course dinner, three glasses of wine each and one night's B&B accommodation. The Food, Mind, Body course costs from £395pp. I loved every minute of it and learned so much - from interesting food facts (who knew fresh-out-of-the-ground new potatoes were a healthier option than blueberries?) to helpful kitchen skills. I've lost count of the times I've rustled up some of the recipes at home since. It had been a massive treat. I had asked Raymond which season was best to visit Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons. He replied: 'You must visit every season!' Brilliant idea.","ITV meteorologist Lucy Verasamy visited Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons .

Alex Stevens, South West regional policy advisor, said: 'Badgers are protected by law and people shouldn't be interfering with badgers or setts. 'This incident is really unusual and surprising, given the time at which it happened. But badgers are pretty headstrong. I suspect he was searching for an easy source of food. 'Badgers can squeeze through any gaps in fences or hedges which are bigger than 7.5 centimetres. So if you have fencing with the slats spaced more narrowly, that will help. 'Even better, people can protect their property through badger-proof fencing. This goes a foot or two into the ground so that badgers cannot tunnel underneath it. 'People should also keep the lids on their bins, and if they have a dog or a cat, don't leave their food or water bowls out in the open. 'If you do have to make contact with a badger, be sure to wash your hands afterwards.'","Terry Cooper, 79, said a badger the size of a large pig burst through hedge .

"Homeless people in the Bay Area are being handed free smartphones by multi-billion dollar tech companies in the hope that it will get them off the streets. A group called Community Technology Alliance is giving away free Google handsets which come loaded with apps that help the homeless find shelters, soup kitchens, and warn of severe weather. The phones are also designed to help people apply for jobs and find housing, as companies often require people to visit their websites.

She found the advert on Craigslist using a Nexus 5 phone she was given by the Community Technology Alliance. She told the New York Times: 'People don’t put out ""for rent"" signs anymore, so the Internet is the best way. 'You can’t even go get a paper application for a lot of things. You can’t get a job unless you get online. Before I got a free phone, it was like you’re almost nonexistent.'

"A restaurant customer in the Mexican border town of Tijuana was left horrified after witnessing staff butchering a dog to be served up as a pork dish on the menu. The authorities have closed a total of six Chinese restaurants in the local area since police raided the Lo Yen City restaurant in southern Tijuana following a tip-off from the disgusted client. The customer called in the cops after witnessing kitchen staff killing the dog, later intended to be served up masquerading as pork in the next chow mein. Scroll down for video . Disgusted: A restaurant customer in Tijuana was left horrified after witnessing staff butchering a dog to be served up as a pork dish on the menu. Pictured is a dead dog police recovered at the establishment . The authorities have closed a total of six Chinese restaurants in the local area since local police raided the Lo Yen City restaurant (pictured) in southern Tijuana . Officers conducting a raid of the restaurant on Wednesday morning discovered caged dogs in the kitchen, a decapitated puppy in the trash and the owner himself in the process of decapitating and butchering a canine carcass, putting the meat in a cooking pot. Owner Yu Yu Chou told local newspaper reporters: 'I admit to killing the dog, but the meat is for my own personal use, not for my customers.' Police received a tip-off from a restaurant client who heard the sounds of a howling dog at the back of the establishment. After peeking over the back fence to investigate, the horrified client witnessed two cooks in the act of killing the defenceless animal. In total five arrests were made at Mr Yu Yu Chou's restaurant, including three workers of Chinese nationality . An official was filmed pulling a beheaded dog from a storage barrel during the raid . Boast: The restaurant advertises the quality of its 'home-style food' but has had complaints from customers before about flies and cockroaches in their food . Rescued: Some dogs were found alive at the restaurant and were taken away by a local vet . Lucky: This dog was saved from the owner's knives by the police. The picture is a grab from a local news agency video of the property . Upon arrival at the scene, police officers said they witnessed the cooks hurriedly throw a decapitated dog carcass in a kitchen waste bin. Officers later saw the owner decapitating and butchering a dog in the back alley. The restaurant, which advertises the quality of its 'home-style food' claims never to have received complaints of using dog meat before. The owner, while handcuffed in the back of a police vehicle, said: 'We've had complaints from customers who have found hair, flies or cockroaches in their food, but never anything this serious.' The AFN news agency took video evidence of the police bust. It contains footage of a hair-strewn alley where the dogs were seen being butchered, a terrified dog chained to the wall and a forensics officer pulling a decapitated canine carcass – stiffened by rigor mortis – out of a kitchen waste bin. The animals, some of which survived, were removed from the scene in a veterinarian's van. Samples of meat were also taken from the kitchen fridges in order to determine the origin of the meat. Following local authorities' demands to investigate kitchens in other local oriental eating establishments, five other Chinese restaurants in the area did not open their doors to customers on Wednesday, leading many to question whether the cooking of dog meat has long been practiced in Tijuana. In total five arrests were made at Mr Yu Yu Chou's restaurant, including three workers of Chinese nationality. A spokesman for the Mexican Ministry of Health told local reporters following the incident that the city would be pursuing conviction of the Mr Yu Yu Chou, and that 'you can't play with the health of Tijuana'. The infamous frontier town in Baja California state sits directly on the United States border, just three miles from downtown San Diego. The town has long had a dangerous reputation, not least for the criminal cartel activity which sees drugs and humans trafficked across the border into the United States.","Customer witnessed dog being butchered at Lo Yen City restaurant .

"A Kansas mother who uses marijuana to treat a debilitating disease is now fighting for custody of her child after the 11-year-old boy disagreed with an anti-drug presentation at his school. Shona Banda, 37, who published a book about how she uses a liquid form of cannabis as therapy for Crohn's disease, has a custody hearing Monday in Garden City, Kansas. Her boy was taken by authorities on March 24 after officials at his school reported comments he made about marijuana to child protection services. Medical marijuana activist Shona Banda, 37, is fighting for custody of her 11-year-old son after his comments about marijuana at a school presentation prompted police to search her home . The Department of Children and Families in the small Midwestern town then contacted police who went to Banda's home, according to the Garden City Telegram. She did not give authorities consent to search her home, but they returned several hours later with a warrant and discovered marijuana in plant, oil, joint, gel and capsule form along with  paraphernalia for the drug. Two ounces of cannabis in plant form and one ounce of oil were reportedly seized. Video supposedly of the incident posted on Youtube shows officers arriving at Banda's house without a warrant, standing in her backyard and refusing to let the woman enter her house for fear that she could disturb evidence. 'It is not public property, you don’t have a warrant,' Banda is heard telling the police of her backyard, but a sergeant responds that it 'doesn’t matter'. The boy was given temporarily to his father, who is separated from Banda, but returned to state custody on Thursday ahead of the hearing. No charges have yet been filed against the mother. Banda  wrote a book that detailed how she used cannabis oil to treat her debilitating Crohn's disease . Police asked to enter the activist's house (pictured), but she denied them entry until they arrived with a warrant . 'For him to have spoken up in class I can’t be upset about because he hears me daily on the phone talking with people, encouraging people to speak up and speak out,' she told Ben Swann of her son. 'My son says different things like, ‘My mom calls it cannabis and not marijuana,’ Banda said. The mother, who was diagnosed with the inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's in the early 2000s, said that she had been losing weight and was 'on her death bed' before she began using cannabis oil in 2009. Crohn's, where the body's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal system,  causes pain, diarrhea, menstrual problems, lack of appetite and fatigue. Banda said that the marijuana worked much better than any medicines that had been prescribed for her and she was soon able to walk without a cane, she said in a YouTube video. She says that her son was pulled out of school and interrogated by police without her. A Go Fund Me page has raised more than $20,000 for Banda's legal defense. Supporters plan on rallying outside the courthouse when the author goes in for her custody hearing on Monday. Video posted on YouTube shows the officers standing in her backyard (left) and denying Banda entry into her home (right) because she may have disturbed evidence . Banda says that her 11-year-old was pulled out of school (pictured) and questioned by police after his statements . Possession of any amount of marijuana is illegal in Kansas and can land offenders with up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Repeat offenses are a felony and can lead to up to three and a half years behind bars, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. Banda and her son had previously lived in Colorado, where marijuana is legal for recreational use, roughly one hour driving from Garden City. A medical marijuana bill that would allow some patients to use cannabis oil was in the process of going through the Kansas state legislature earlier this year, according to the Kansas City Star. Twenty-four states have laws allowing medical marijuana, while four and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use by adults.","Shona Banda, 37, had written book about using cannabis oil to treat Crohn's .

The beautiful DJ, 27, from east London, has worked with and modelled for a variety of fashion and beauty brands including Illamasqua and Boy London - made famous by megastar Rihanna.

Munroe said: 'I had always known growing up that I was supposed to be a woman, but I'd always tried to hide it for fear of being different. 'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate. 'But I remember being about 17 and wondering how different my life would be if I didn't care what people think. 'It was then that it suddenly hit me - it was time to start being true to myself,' she said. 'I came out as gay to begin with at 15 and then I started dressing up as a woman and doing drag around three years later,' said Munroe. 'Soon I started the slow process to transition into a woman, it was the best decision I've ever made. Now (left) and then (right): Munroe has transformed into a sexy beauty after growing up as a boy. 'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate,' she says . Munroe (pictured at a party last year) began her transition at the age of 19, and at 25 years old was offered hormones by her doctor . 'I'm now a DJ full time and I do some work within the fashion industry too,' said Munroe. 'I've worked for Calvin Klein in their press office, designed a lip gloss for Illamasqua, a make-up brand that I love, and I've even designed capsule lines for Boy London - Rihanna has worn one of my pieces. 'I also do a bit of modelling from time to time. 'Some people notice that I was once a boy, some people don't - but I'm happy to talk about it if they ask.' Munroe began living as a woman at the age of 18 and started taking drugs friends had been prescribed at 23. It was only at 25 she was offered the hormones by her doctor. She said: 'I first started taking hormones that had been prescribed to my other trans friends. The DJ explained: 'It was really exciting to start taking the hormones and see my body change' The stunning brunette (left and right) modelled for a variety of fashion and beauty brands including Illamasqua and Boy London - made famous by Rihanna . 'It is not something that I would recommend at all, but the process can take such a long time, and once you've made the decision to become the person you really are, you just want to get on with it. 'It was really exciting to start taking the hormones and see my body change - and soon as I was given them by my doctor. 'It's like going through puberty again so I got quite self-conscious about the way I looked and dressed, and I felt as though I started to think differently.' 'I didn't really like explaining what was going on to people as I was doing this for myself, but friends and family were curious,' she said. 'My mum found out what was going on when she noticed my chest growing - it was a shock at first but she's very supportive. 'As soon as I noticed the change in myself it was like I wasn't ashamed any more,' she said. Munroe has now been taking hormones for four years, and has embraced her new life. She said: 'When I left university I got involved in fashion and the PR industry. 'I've had the opportunity of working with some incredible brands, designers and photographers, and I just love it. 'I've done everything from club promotion, modelling, PR, and now I'm a full time DJ. 'I DJ at major club nights and private members clubs in some of the most exclusive venues in London - I feel so lucky for everything that's come my way, I would never take it for granted. 'I'm still the same person I was before, I'm just in the right body now. 'I look in the mirror and I feel like it's me who's looking back, rather than somebody I don't recognise'. Munroe, pictured with her friend Conor, says of her transition: 'It was the best decision I've ever made' Munroe and her friend Stephano at London Fashion Week. The DJ believes: 'I want people to know that it's ok to be different, and that you shouldn't be scared of being the person you are' 'I look in the mirror and I feel like it's me who's looking back, rather than somebody I don't recognise,' says Munroe . Munroe now hopes her story will encourage other young transgender men and women to feel comfortable in their own skin. Munroe said: 'I think it's important that the world understands and respects transgender people and the rights that they deserve to have within society. 'I'm so much happier now than I was growing up. 'I want people to know that it's okay to be different, and that you shouldn't be scared of being the person you are. 'I talk quite openly now about what's I've been through and frequently speak publicly about trans rights and community issues.

"A rescued seal pup who had been nursed back to health in a wildlife sanctury has washed up dead just weeks after being released into the wild after being run over by a boat. The female seal, who was called Sponge Bobby by rescue workers suffered horrific injuries to her face and back after the high-speed impact. The force of the collision broke Sponge Bobby's jaw causing her a painful death off the Dorset coast. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Sponge Bobby the seal suffered horrific injuries after she was struck by a boat or a jet-ski on Monday . The six-month-old seal had been earlier rescued in November when she was suffering breathing difficulties . It is feared that Sponge Bobby could have been struck by a fast moving jet ski or speed boat . Tamara Cooper of the Cornish Seal Sanctuary cared for Sponge Bobby when she got into difficulties in November as a young pup. She said the seal was only about six months old at the time of her death. She said: 'You give them the best chance you can, fixing them up for release, but then it's down to them. 'We are realistic enough to know that not all will survive but nevertheless it was shocking to hear of her horrendous injuries.' Sponge Bobby was found with breathing problems at Widemouth on the north coast of Cornwall. Her body was recovered from a beach at Highcliffe, Dorset on Monday with severe head injuries including a broken jaw. Wildlife campaigners were able to identify Sponge Bobby from the tag they fitted before her release . Wildlife photographer and environmental campaigner Steve Trewhella, of UK Coastal Wildlife, said: 'You have to assume that under the circumstance is was struck by a boat or jet ski. 'There were loads of people in the water that day and it could have easily been struck. 'You can tell it wasn't a propeller strike because that would have had a corkscrew effect, where it is struck multiple times. 'If it had come in in a storm then it may have been a rock but it was fairly calm on the day. 'They are wonderful creatures - watch them, film them and enjoy the spectacle but you have to respect the fact that they are vulnerable animals.' Emma Rance, marine conservation officer at Dorset Wildlife Trust, added: 'The injuries to its face suggest a boat strike. 'The jaw is seriously broken, possibly by a boat or a Jet ski.' She said the injury could have been inflicted accidentally, but boat users were breaking the law if they harassed sea animals. 'We don't know how many animals are injured every year, because not all of them are washed up,' she said. 'Marine animals like seals and dolphins are curious creatures so if people are aware of their presence they should cut their engines and be certain that the animals have moved on.'

"Mr Miliband will allow Scotland to set a more generous benefits system than the rest of the UK if he becomes Prime Minister . Labour leader Ed Miliband will allow Scotland to set a more generous benefits system than the rest of the UK if he becomes Prime Minister. Mr Miliband will hand Scottish MPs the unprecedented power to set a higher state pension and more generous dole and disability payments in a desperate attempt to reverse the exodus of his voters to the SNP. He will unveil the radical proposals in his manifesto, due to be published tomorrow, as he attempts to fight back in Scotland – a key General Election battleground. But the move will lead to fears that it could again put the future of the Union at risk by setting Scotland apart from the rest of the UK. Under Mr Miliband’s plan, the Scottish Parliament will be given the power to ‘top up’ payments which are reserved to Westminster, including jobseeker’s allowance, disability living allowance or even the state pension. Critics fear that it could lead to the SNP and Labour veering increasingly to the Left by promising a more generous benefits system. It is also sure to prove controversial in other parts of the UK, and could stoke resentment about Scots getting a better deal. There are already concerns about Scots receiving state handouts such as free prescriptions and free tuition fees, which are not available in England and Wales. Ahead of tomorrow’s manifesto launch, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: ‘We will go much further than what is on offer by allowing Scotland’s cities and communities more influence and control over the welfare state.’ Under the proposals, Labour will give members of the Scottish Parliament the power to make top-up payments to all benefit claimants. Crucially, the money would need to be found from elsewhere within the Scottish Parliament’s budget – or raised through increased taxation. That increases the prospect that other taxpayers could see their bills soar in order to fund benefit giveaways. Scottish Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone said: ‘This is an example of Labour desperately foraging around for policies it thinks people in Scotland want to hear. ‘They’re forgetting people voted “No” [in the independence referendum], and don’t need Labour patronising them on the constitution.’ Miliband and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy appear at a General Election campaign press conference in Edinburgh .","Ed Miliband will allow Scotland to set a more generous benefits system .

"A tourist has a frightening tale to tell after French customs officers found a stash of cocaine in a suitcase that had his name on it but didn’t belong to him. French officials said the illicit drugs, worth more than €1.3million (£950,000) in street value, were discovered in a suitcase that arrived at the airport in Nice on a flight from the Dominican Republic. The country’s Directorate-General of Customs said 18 packages containing 46lbs (21kg) of cocaine were stuffed inside a suitcase that was abandoned on the baggage carousel. French customs officials at Nice airport said the drugs were found after a flight arrived from the Caribbean . Officers detained the baffled tourist, who was waiting for his luggage, at the airport and questioned him about the drugs. A statement issued by the Directorate-General of Customs said officers are satisfied that the bag did not belong to the tourist and he had nothing to do with the drug smuggling attempt. The department said their investigation found that smugglers in the Dominican Republic filled the suitcase with cocaine and used the tourist’s identity in an attempt to sneak the drugs into France through Nice Cote d’Azur International Airport. Authorities continue to investigate to find out who packed the bag and how it wound up on the transatlantic flight. Officials questioned the tourist whose name was on the bag and are satisfied he did not smuggle the cocaine . Last year French customs officers seized more than six tonnes of cocaine at the country’s ports of entry. A similar incident occurred last year when a college student arrived at New York’s John F Kennedy International Airport from Trinidad and Tobago. The 21-year-old woman called police after she opened her suitcase and found 10lbs of cocaine inside. Police believe the woman was used as an unwitting drug mule and were investigating how the drugs were placed inside her suitcase after it was checked in.","Officials said the man's name was on a suitcase that didn't belong to him .

"Marion 'Suge' Knight was chained down to a chair and wheeled into a California courtroom on Wednesday after he fell at a previous hearing while addressing murder charges levied against him. During his appearance in the Los Angeles courtroom, the Death Row Records co-founder complained to Judge Ronald Coen and said he could walk.

Marion 'Suge' Knight was chained down to a chair and wheeled into a California courtroom on Wednesday . Death Row Records co-founder fell at a previous hearing while addressing murder charges levied against him . Knight, a 49-year-old diabetic with a blood clot, told the judge walking was not a problem despite the earlier fall . His lawyer, Matt Fletcher, said authorities put Knight in the chair and chained him down as part of a 'ploy' to 'humiliate' his client, according to TMZ. Knight told the judge: 'I'm being chained to some type of chair and their pushing me. 'It's making the situation even worse[er]. 'I walked perfectly fine from the county jail, to the bus, to the bus to here'. The judge told Knight if he could walk, that was fine and the chair will not be used again. Judge Coen is giving the former rap music mogul time to hire an attorney in a robbery case filed against him last year. A celebrity photographer accused Knight and comedian Katt Williams of taking her camera. The judge pressed Knight about whether he wanted a new attorney in the robbery case. His previous attorney, David Kenner, said in a filing he no longer wanted to represent Knight. Knight said he wanted to fire Kenner and has until May 27 to hire a new attorney. In this March 2015 file photo, Knight collapsed in court during a bail hearing about his hit-and-run case .

"Westerners fighting for ISIS are taking part in a sickening circle of violent one-upmanship in order to prove themselves to commanders who consider European militants little more than cannon fodder. Ranked well below battle-hardened foreign jihadis from warzones such as Chechnya and East Africa, the Westerners believe ultra-violence is the only way to make their name in Syria and Iraq. This would partly explain why so many Western extremists are eager to take part in the terror group's sickening propaganda releases, such as the seven savage filmed beheading videos featuring depraved British terrorist Mohammed Emwazi, also known by the name Jihadi John. Militants: Ranked well below battle-hardened foreign jihadis from warzones such as Chechnya and East Africa, Westerners believe ultra-violence is the only way for them to rise up the ranks in Syria and Iraq . Western fighters waging jihad in Syria and Iraq often appear disillusioned by the mundane jobs they are given upon arrival. British militants have previously been known to complain on social media about being ordered to clean toilets or wash the plates of senior terrorists. By far the most common job for Western jihadis, however, is guarding prisoners. While some complain that this involves little more than standing bored in a doorway or handing over meals, others have used their unlimited access to these defenceless so-called 'enemies of the state' to build a reputation for the kind of shocking cruelty and sadism ISIS commanders appreciate. One former prisoner has now revealed that many of the thousands of Europeans who have flocked to join ISIS over the past year have been shocked to find themselves marginalised within an organisation where Iraqi and Saudi nationals rule. 'They come ­expecting a heaven and when they see the reality they are shocked,' a Syrian former prisoner identified only by the name Omar told The Times. 'There is a hierarchy in ISIS and the foreign fighters and the Syrians are at the bottom of it,' he added, revealing that fighters from Tunisia consider themselves the group's military wing, while Saudis are largely dominate religious affairs. Doomed: The Syrian former prisoner, identified only by the name Omar, revealed he had been held for a short time alongside  Kenji Goto before the Japanese journalist (left) was savagely murder by Jihadi John (right) Flying the flag: It is widely-understood that Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State are so unfit and badly trained that they are used as little more than cannon fodder . Omar, who was sentenced to death and spent six months in an ISIS prison 18 miles north of Aleppo before taking part in a daring but successful jailbreak three-months ago, also revealed that he had been held for a short time alongside Japanese journalist Kenji Goto. Goto was later transferred to another prison by ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, before being savagely murdered by the aforementioned Emwazi on January 31. 'There are two ways to prove your allegiance to IS: either by getting married or by carrying out the punishments,' Omar said, using an alternative acronym for the terrorist organisation. They were merciless - the ­foreign fighters and the ­Syrians treated us the worst because they are the lowest in Isis,' he went on to say. It is widely-understood that Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to join Islamist militant group ISIS are so unfit and badly trained that they are used as little more than cannon fodder. Many of them are unable to communicate in Arabic and when not cleaning and cleaning for senior commanders tend to while away their days on social media where they pretend to be vital cogs in the ISIS wheel for their gullible sympathisers in the West. Outcast: Many of the thousands of Europeans who have flocked to join ISIS (pictured) over the past year have been shocked to find themselves marginalised within an organisation where Iraqi and Saudi nationals rule . Speaking last year, Peter Neumann - director of the International Centre of Radicalisation at King's College London - said British fighters in particular are poorly rated. 'In a context like ISIS in Syria you have all these battle-hardy Chechens and then you have some fat guy from Luton turning up,' he told the Financial Times. While many of the European extremists joining ISIS tell their commanders they will be willing killers, very few of them have ever even held a gun by the time they arrive in Syria or Iraq. Useless in combat and a liability in situations when a simple mistakes can cost lives, the few Westernisers who do make it on to the battlefield are used as little more than cannon fodder. Leading the line when the odds are stacked against them, or acting as suicide bombers to clear the path for more experienced and important fighters, ISIS commanders convince the young men that their lives on earth are worthless and that to die for the terror group is somehow praiseworthy. These arguments are lapped up by the idealistic young fighters who appear not to notice that it is never the commanders or other senior figures within ISIS who have the 'honour' of losing their lives.","Western jihadis are ranked well below Iraqi and Saudi nationals by ISIS .
They are forced to cook and clean for the more experienced fighters .

"A mother who spent months feeling unwell was horrified to discover she probably had cancer - after spotting all her symptoms on a Facebook post. Laura Everley, 36, had experienced bloating, lower back pain and constipation over a three-month period. She also frequently needed to urinate. But having previously suffered irritable bowel syndrome and endometriosis, she put the symptoms down to those conditions. It was only when she stumbled across a post on her Facebook timeline, which detailed all the same symptoms, that she realised it could be cancer. Tests later revealed she had an aggressive ovarian tumour - and the disease had begun to spread. Scroll down for video . Laura Everley, 36, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer after seeing a post on Facebook describing all her symptoms. She had been suffering from bloating, back pain, constipation and frequently needing the loo . In October 2014, Mrs Everley underwent a hysterectomy to remove her womb and her ovaries. She is pictured with husband Mark, and her five-year-old son, Harry, before being diagnosed with cancer . After performing a hysterectomy to remove her womb as well as her ovaries, surgeons revealed the cancer had already begun to spread. Mrs Everley is now undergoing chemotherapy and doctors are confident she can beat the disease. She hopes her story will raise awareness to the symptoms of ovarian cancer, prompting other women to see their doctor if they are worried. Warning signs of the disease can be difficult to recognise, particularly in the early stages. This is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). Mrs Everley said: 'The symptoms are the same, so I thought it could have been irritable bowel syndrome . 'I went down the gluten free route but that didn't make any difference. 'The idea of cancer hadn't even entered my head. You just never dream this going to happen to you.' By early 2014, she had been suffering with her symptoms for three months. The symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise, particularly in its early stages. This is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). However, three main symptoms are more frequent in women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. They are: . Other symptoms, such as back pain, needing to pass urine more frequently than usual, and pain during sex may be the result of other conditions in the pelvic area. However, they may be present in some women with ovarian cancer. Source: NHS Choices . Idly scrolling Facebook one evening, she noticed a post raising awareness of ovarian cancer. 'A friend had shared a post from a friend of theirs about her experiences of cancer and what she'd been through,' said Mrs Everley. 'There was a list of symptoms and I realised I had them all. 'I called my doctor straight away and told her that I thought I might have cancer.' Medics confirmed Mrs Everley had a cyst, which was removed and sent away for a biopsy. She was also referred for an internal examination, which revealed abnormalities. In October 2014, she was called into East Surrey hospital. 'I thought I was just going in for check-up so I didn't think to take anyone with me,' she said. 'I was told I had clear cell carcinoma. 'It all sounded very medical and I had no idea what that meant. Finally, it dawned on me that it was a type of ovarian cancer. 'I was on my own finding this out. It was awful. I spent ages with the Macmillan nurse afterwards, sobbing in shock. 'I phoned my husband Mark as soon as I came out of hospital and told him over the phone. I couldn't keep it to myself, I had to tell somebody. 'Having to tell my son Harry was horrible. He knows I have ovarian cancer, but he's only five so he doesn't quite understand what cancer means.' Two weeks later, Mrs Everley met with surgeons, who gave her a heartbreaking choice – whether to have one ovary removed, or a complete hysterectomy, which would leave her unable to have more children. 'I already had Harry, but I would have liked to have had more children,' she said. 'It was difficult but I decided on the full hysterectomy – I didn't want my cancer coming back. 'Afterwards doctors told me I'd made the right choice. I had stage 1c cancer, meaning the cancer cells weren't contained in my ovary. After the hysterectomy, Mrs Everley underwent a course of chemotherapy, with each round leaving her sick for a week afterwards. She also lost her hair - which she says was an emotional experience . 'I'd have needed the hysterectomy eventually anyway.' Now, Mrs Everley is nearing the end of her course of chemotherapy and doctors are confident she can be cured. Her treatment has been gruelling, however, with each round leaving her feeling constantly sick for a week afterwards. She has also lost her hair. 'My hair started coming out in clumps, so I decided to just get a friend to shave it,' she said. 'I didn't want to just watch it fall out. It was nice to regain a little control. 'It was a really emotional experience. My mum and dad came round and everybody cried – even my friend that was shaving my head. Mrs Everley has been promoting Target Ovarian Cancer charity, hosting a coffee morning to raise money . 'My mum held my hand throughout. It was tough but I felt better afterwards.' Mrs Everley has also been busy promoting Target Ovarian Cancer, hosting a coffee morning to raise money for the charity. She is also keen for women to be more aware of the symptoms of ovarian cancer. 'I don't think people are sure of symptoms. There's not a definite list, they're all a bit vague and lots of them could mean other things,' she said. 'I think that uncertainty puts people off going to the doctors. 'There's no screening for ovarian cancer like there is with the smear test for cervical. 'Women need to know the signs because early diagnosis is the best chance of survival. 'It's easy to dismiss and ignore symptoms, but it's not worth the risk.' Clear cell carcinoma is normally treated with a hysterectomy operation . Clear cell cancer of the ovary is an uncommon type of ovarian cancer. Epithelial ovarian cancer means the cancer started in the surface layer covering the ovary. It accounts for 3 to 5 per cent of patients with ovarian cancer in the western world and 20 per cent in the Far East. It is likely that the cause of clear cell cancer is different from the common variety. The prognosis for women with clear cell cancer is greatly influenced by the stage of the disease. Clear cell cancer may also arise more commonly in women with a history of endometriosis. The first treatment is the same as for the common form of epithelial ovarian cancer – a hysterectomy. In some circumstances removal of the lymph glands in the pelvis and back of the abdomen may also be included. As well as removing the pelvic organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus and omentum – the fatty tissue that covers the abdominal organs), fluid will be collected from the abdominal cavity for testing for any cancer cells. A pathologist will examine the tissue and fluid removed to try and decide how advanced the cancer is. Some tumours are just in the ovary and so will have a better prognosis, about 20 per cent are stage 1. However, in some cases, tumours will have spread through the outer lining (capsule) of the ovary and to other organs including the uterus (womb), fallopian tubes, the lymph glands and the omentum. Usually post-operative treatment involves chemotherapy. Source: Ovacome .","Laura Everley had bloating, back pain, constipation and bladder problems .

"Probe: Guernsey police sent ten officers to the island last Thursday to raid Dr Rory Lyon's surgery and a private address . The widow of one of four patients whose deaths are being investigated on the Channel Islands last night spoke out to defend the GP at the centre of the police probe. Yvonne Deegan, 77, described the investigation as 'absolutely diabolical' and said she was 'perfectly happy' with the care provided by Dr Rory Lyons. Her husband Bernie Deegan, 70, died suddenly earlier this year following a 12-year cancer battle. Police last week told Mrs Deegan that his death is one of four on the small island of Alderney being investigated as part of a probe into Dr Lyons. The retired stonemason was a close friend of Colin Cosheril, 63, whose sudden death from heart failure last year is being also being looked at. Islanders have said it was concerns over the unexpected death of Mr Cosheril's cousin Karen from pneumonia in January that prompted the investigation in to Dr Lyons, 62, who has been suspended from practicing. But Mrs Deegan, 77, yesterday said she had no complaints over Dr Lyons or the care he gave her sick husband Bernie. She said her husband's death was sudden but not unexpected as he had been ill since he was diagnosed with throat cancer 12 years ago. The great-grandmother said: 'Only God could have helped him. 'I have always been perfectly happy with Dr Lyons and whatever is going on I think it is absolutely diabolical. 'I don't know who started all this but I think they are all very wrong.' Guernsey police sent ten officers to the island last Thursday to raid Dr Lyon's surgery and a private address. The Eagle Medical Practice was searched for five hours and computers and papers – including medical records – were seized by police. Mrs Deegan said she did not know why her husband's death was being looked at and police had not given her any information either. The cancer had recently spread to Mr Deegan's chest and specialists in Guernsey had warned the family he did not have long left before he died in January. She said: 'The police are not saying anything. They are telling us not to talk to anyone but they are not telling us anything.' But she said she had no reason to be concerned about how her husband died, adding: 'As far as I'm concerned there should be no reason. They gave him a death sentence 10 years ago. 'I don't really know and I can't really understand it and actually I'm very, very sad about it. 'The police said Dr Lyons was being looked into and Bernie's death had come up and I said well I didn't see why. 'He has been cremated so at least they can't dig him up. Thank God. Because that I wouldn't have.' Relatives: Cousins Karen and Colin Cosheril were patients of the Alderney family doctor when they died. Karen, 52, left, died in January of pneumonia and Colin, 63, right, died of heart failure in May last year . The widow said her husband's death was sudden, but said: 'It was in the sense of the word sudden but we knew it was going to happen because the lung specialist in Guernsey told us.' Mr Cosheril's sister Brenda Webb reported his sudden death to the health authorities last year and was told last week it was being investigated as part of the police probe. It is believed the Guernsey health service launched an investigation into Dr Lyons when concerns were raised about the death of divorcee Karen Cosheril, who often used her married name Tayleur, in January. Chief of Police Patrick Rice last night said: 'Our Neighbourhood Policing Team Sergeant has met community leaders and spoken to a wide range of islanders over the last few days. 'Our Alderney-based police officers will continue this work as we seek to ensure islanders are being reassured about this serious investigation. 'I will repeat that this decisive early police action was necessary in order to ensure the protection of the public, which is always our main focus. 'The investigation will be conducted as expeditiously as possible, however, given its nature and complexity it could take a considerable amount of time to conclude.'

"A 73-year-old grandmother has been convicted of murder in the shooting death of her third husband — three decades after being acquitted of killing her second husband. A jury in Placerville, California, took less than two hours on Wednesday to return a guilty verdict for first-degree murder against Colleen Ann Harris, known to family as 'Grandma Cokie'. Mrs Harris wept in court and covered her face as the verdict came back, Sacramento Bee reported. Robert Harris, 72, was found dead from a shotgun blast at the couple's home in 2013. Colleen Harris testified that she couldn't recall the events leading up to his death because of traumatic memory loss. She could get 50 years to life when she is sentenced on June 5. Colleen Harris was charged in the 1985 shotgun killing of her then-husband, 46-year-old James Batten. Her attorney argued the killing was self-defense because of ongoing abuse, and jurors acquitted her.","A jury in Placerville, California, took less than two hours on Wednesday to return a guilty verdict against Colleen Ann Harris .

"Two jihadi brides have escaped from Islamic State's female police force and revealed the horrifying punishments they used to inflict on other women. Doaa and Umm, whose names have been changed to conceal their identities, were smuggled from Raqqa, in Syria, to southern Turkey after leaving the al-Khansa Brigade earlier this year. The pair said they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group's rules - including giving 60 lashes to those who tried to flee. Scroll down for video . Doaa and Umm (above), whose names have been changed to conceal their identities have revealed what life was like working for the brutal al-Khansa Brigade . In an interview with Sky News Doaa, who left after her Saudi Arabian husband blew himself up in a suicide attack, said women also received a 'standard' 40 lashes if they did not wear proper Islamic dress. The 20-year-old, who was paid around £70 a month by the unit, said: 'What upset me most was lashing old women when they weren't wearing the proper clothes.' Umma, 25, was forced to marry a foreign fighter. She said did not see him very much as he was often on the front line. 'Most of the time I would stay at my parents’ house because he wasn't around. He behaved normally, he would come home for two or three days and then go back to fight,' she said, adding that she did not love him. Now the pair, who are living in Turkey illegally, are scared they will be discovered by ISIS fighters who, they believe, are following them. The al-Khansa Brigade operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa. The women revealed they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group's rules - including those who tried to escape. Above, one of the women shows a picture of herself holding a gun . The al-Khansa Brigade operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa. Above, other women from the brigade are pictured holding guns . It achieved notoriety last year after women who travelled to join the Islamic State's insurgency boasted of joining the police unit. They used social media to brag about doling out savage beatings and lashings, ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of sex slaves are believed to be imprisoned and raped daily. In the brigade's first manifesto, released in February, women are told to live a completely 'sedentary' lifestyle. It adds that their role should be primarily to remain 'hidden and veiled' and at the service of men, who are described as their masters. While it claims not to have been written or approved by ISIS's leadership, it provides a disturbing look at the way women are treated. Last September a Syrian woman agreed to carry a hidden camera to film daily life in Raqqa. Her footage showed several gun-wielding French women who had left their home country to join ISIS (above) The women’s revelations come a day after a shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya was released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the east of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', were lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others were filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. It followed another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film.","Doaa and Umm were smuggled from Raqqa, in Syria, to southern Turkey .

"Federal health officials say 106 passengers and six crew members aboard the Celebrity Infinity cruise ship were sickened by the gastrointestinal illness norovirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a Monday news release there were 2117 total passengers on the ship and 964 total crew members. The agency said the main symptoms for those affected were diarrhea and throwing up. The ship was on its journey from March 29 to April 13, federal health officials said. Outbreak: Federal health officials say 106 passengers and six crew members aboard the Celebrity Infinity (seen in this file photo) cruise ship were sickened by the gastrointestinal illness norovirus . The CDC's release said 'One CDC Vessel Sanitation Program environmental health officer and one epidemiologist have boarded the ship in San Diego, CA on April 13, 2015 to conduct an environmental health assessment and evaluate the outbreak and response activities. 'Specimens have been collected and have been tested by CDC to determine the causative agent for this outbreak is norovirus.' The CDC said staff on the Infinity stepped up cleaning and disinfection in response to the outbreak. Symptoms of norovirus include vomiting, diarrhea, fever and body aches. According to the CDC, most people recover within three days. The CDC recommends on its website that anyone sick with norovirus stay well hydrated. The Infinity was on a 15-night cruise. The Celebrity website says the ship regularly travels through the Panama Canal and to Alaska. Illness: Symptoms of norovirus (pictured) include vomiting, diarrhea, fever and body aches. According to the CDC, most people recover within three days . In a statement sent to Daily Mail Online, Celebrity Cruises, part of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.,  said only 99 passengers and 1 crew member became sick. 'Those affected by the short-lived illness responded well to over-the-counter medication being administered onboard the ship,' the company said. 'During the sailing, we took a number of steps to prevent the transmission of the illness, including implementing enhanced cleaning procedures and protocols, and using special cleaning products and disinfectants that are proven to kill norovirus to clean throughout the ship. 'Additionally, when Celebrity Infinity arrived to San Diego, California, today, we began an extensive and thorough sanitizing onboard the ship and within the cruise terminal, to help prevent any illness from affecting the subsequent sailing.' The statement continued 'Also, all guests will receive a letter at boarding that asks if they have experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms within the last three days. Similarly, if any guest is uncomfortable taking their cruise, for reasons related to personal health or otherwise, our staff assisted them in rescheduling their sailing for another time.' The Maritime-Executive reported the ship previously experienced gastrointestinal illness outbreaks in 2006 and 2013.","The CDC says 106 passengers and six crew members aboard the Celebrity Infinity cruise ship were sickened by the gastrointestinal illness norovirus .

In celebration of Canada’s Day of Pink, an annual event aimed at raising more awareness and understanding about the LGBT community, police officer Ryan Willmer posted a picture of his fellow police officer Luke Watson on Twitter, promising that a series of images of Luke with pink hair would follow, if the first image was retweeted 500 times. 560 retweets later and Luke arrived at the station to the news that he would have to dye his blonde locks a bright and bold shade of pink, all in the name of spreading a message of tolerance and acceptance to the community. Tickled: Toronto officer Luke Watson was more than happy to sport his new hot pink hair in support of the Day of Pink event held on April 8 across Canada . Luckily for Ryan, Luke was more than pleased to undergo the transformation for the cause. A friend used spray-in hair color to transform his blonde locks to a shocking shade of fuchsia, and within no time Luke was ready to show off his new hairdo at the Day of Pink rally at Forest Hills Collegiate Institute in Toronto, where he arrived in a pink cruiser with his fellow police officers, who all wore pink shirts. The Day of Pink was born in Nova Scotia after two high school students intervened when a gay classmate, who was wearing a pink shirt, was being bullied. The pair of teenagers subsequently rallied with other members of the student body and donned pink in the days to come as an act of solidarity against bullying. Luke told Yahoo Beauty Luke said the response to his new hair color has been 'overwhelming'. Preparation: Luke donned a pink cape and held a can of spray-in hair color while awaiting his transformation . Quick work: Within moments, Luke's hair was a nearly-neon shade of pink . A prank gone pink: Ryan Willmer (left) received an overwhelming response after he volunteered his fellow officer Luke up for the makeover without him knowing . As for why Luke was the only one sporting the rosy locks, he explained that Ryan 'lacks in the hair department, so I am the guinea pig'. After Twitter lit up over the pics of Luke and his new do, the officers tried to keep the hype going with a new promise: to keep Luke's hair pink for seven days if they reach 1,000 retweets with an additional day for every 100 retweets on top of that. The numbers have already passed 3,600. 'I'll be keeping my hair pink for quite some time,' says Luke. 'I didn't think such a simple gesture would become such a big thing, but it has brought awareness and opens up discussion.' Result: Officer Ryan shared the photo of Luke on the left saying that 500 retweets would see his hair go pink, 1000 to keep it for a week and an extra day for every 100 thereafter .","Canadian policeman Luke Watson had his hair dyed as part of the Day of Pink event to fight against bullying in schools .

"With her contoured cheeks, flawless glow and smokey eyes, let's face it, who doesn't want to look like Kim Kardashian? When the reality TV star once shared a snap mid-way through her makeover revealing her contouring tricks, a new beauty craze was born. And now, the secret behind the 34-year-old reality TV star's glowing skin has been revealed. Scroll down for video . Want to look like Kim Kardashian? Now you can, because the flawless star has revealed the products that give her that envy-inducing glow . The mother-of-one, who shared her beauty essentials on Instagram, protects her skin with a £65 ($96) Creme de la Mer SPF 30 UV Protecting Fluid, which claims to prevent the appearance of discolorations while providing protection from the sun. The cream, which is packed with gemstones, peculiar sounding 'photonic spheres' and smart seaweeds, can also be used as a make-up primer. Kim shared her beauty essentials on her Instagram page and, of course, a hairbrush from her own brand featured . Kim then loves to spritz her face with a £12 ($18) rose water mist from Glossier. The little-known product is made with roses and aloe and aims to to hydrate, soothe, and leave you feeling fresh and awake. The brand say the product is also 'excellent as a make-up refresher and midday pick-me-up'. To remove the day's face, Kim uses a NARS face wash and Black Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System. The NARS Gentle Cream Cleanser apparently helps to maintain skin's moisture balance while removing makeup and impurities. Meanwhile, the vibrating brush uses a micro-massage motion, which is said to work within skin's natural elasticity to gently remove the impurities traditional methods leave behind-leaving skin softer, smoother and more beautiful. Clearly it's working for Kim. Other beauty essentials in her cosmetics bag include a hairbrush from her own range, Kardashian Beauty, which she established with her sisters, as well as an Essie nail polish. Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Kim said: 'As far as products, I love the Kardashian Beauty dry shampoo and conditioner, which we have. I've never seen a dry conditioner out there but it really helps when you're trying to not wash your hair.' Another product the sisters swear by is coconut oil, which they say is 'everything'. 'When I take off my make-up, I use avocado oil or coconut oil and I also sleep in it, it's amazing for dry hair,' explained Khloe. 'You can put it on your body, too. Coconut oil can do everything.' When it comes to grooming her brows, Kim calls on Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping'. The brow groomer uses the Dipbrow Pomade, which she applies with her £15.50 Brow Wiz, an ultra-fine brow pencil, which claims to fill in sparse brows for a naturally fuller appearance. She then defines and enhances the brows with her £17 Brow Powder Duo, which is enriched with Vitamins C and E to nourish and protect, before sealing the powder make-up into place with her £15 Beauty Genius Clear Waterproof Gel, which she says seals and waterproofs any loose powder. To remove the day's face, Kim uses a Black Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System, left, loves to spritz her face with a £12 ($18) rose water mist from Glossier, centre, and protect her skin from the sun with a £65 ($96) Creme de la Mer SPF 30 UV Protecting Fluid, right . As well as running a successful beauty empire with her sisters, Kim has revealed that she wants to design a range of handbags for toddlers. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star - who has 22-month-old daughter North with husband Kanye West - is set to launch her Kardashian Kids collection next week and has revealed she's already thinking about adding more accessories to the range. Asked about designing shoes or handbags, she told Vogue.com: 'Well, North does love handbags. And anything where there's a little bit of glitz.' When it comes to grooming her brows, Kim calls on Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping' The 34-year-old beauty admits that while her daughter is a big fan of fancy shoes, she's not so keen on the range of headbands included in her mother's new collection. Kim explained: 'Every day she wakes up and says, ""shoes"". You have to bargain with her - before you change her diaper she needs a pair of shoes on ... She hasn't been the biggest fan of keeping something on her head.' Kardashian Kids launches on Nordstrom.com on April 13 with prices ranging between $25 (£16.80) and $35 (£23.60) and Kim admits that while she did a lot of research online, she also drew inspiration from her own wardrobe which is why the collection features pieces such as peplum tops and faux leather leggings.

"Drugs kingpin Gavin Thorman (pictured) operated his empire from HMP Altcourse  where he boasted in Welsh he would make 'millions' when he got out . The kingpin of a violent drugs gang who planned to spend his money on new teeth, liposuction and a facelift has been jailed for 12 years after being caught out speaking about the illegal operation in Welsh. Father-of-four Gavin Thorman, 36, of Caernarfon, Gwynedd, operated his drug empire from HMP Altcourse in Liverpool, where he boasted in Welsh that he would make 'millions' when he got out of jail, Caernarfon Crown Court heard. Drugs worth £200,000, luxury cars, guns and even a boat were all seized by detectives when they cracked the huge crime operation which involved 26 members of the same gang. Thorman organised the supply of cocaine and cannabis from Liverpool and Manchester in one of the largest conspiracies of its kind in North Wales. The court heard he planned to spend his ill-gotten money on new teeth, liposuction, ab implants and a facelift when he got out of jail. The gang leader thought he could get away with talking to his contacts from prison in Welsh - but was unaware that police were recording and translating every conversation. He was serving a sentence in the prison for assault when he was overheard bragging about his new contacts and discussing drugs. Thorman told his girlfriend: 'I'm only doing a small sentence so they won't be listening to my calls.' Prosecutor Jayne La Grua read excerpts from a phone call between Thorman and fellow defendants Richard Broadley, 34, of Colwyn Bay, and Adam Roberts, 33, of Caernarfon, in which Thorman boasted about links to a notorious Merseyside crime baron. Thorman also bragged about plans to import cannabis from Amsterdam and ship BMWs to Jamaica. He told his then girlfriend and fellow defendant Yasmin Owen, 25, of Caernarfon: 'We're going to take over Wrexham... Wrexham's like 10 times the size of town (Caernarfon). 'I'll make a fortune there you know.' Some of the drugs seized during the operation - which was one of the largest to take place in north Wales . Thorman sent text messages which showed he maintained his position through threats of violence . Drugs worth nearly £200,000 were seized by police during a five-year painstaking investigation . The court heard Thorman planned to spend his ill-gotten money on new teeth, liposuction and a facelift . On December 5, 2013, Owen asked Thorman: 'Does anyone hear these phone calls?' He replied: 'No, as if. They're in Welsh anyway, aren't they? No one would understand anyway.' Ms La Grua said: 'He told her he planned to get new teeth in a couple of years once he's finished fighting, that top and bottom sets would cost £3,000 each, that he fancied lipo and ab implants which would be about eight grand, and definitely a facelift when he's older, maybe for his 40th birthday. 'They then discussed a holiday in either Mexico or the Maldives, and possibly the Maldives for their wedding.' One of the guns sized by police following a number of raids which eventually led to yesterday's sentencing . The entire 26-strong gang was caught after painstaking surveillance work by 200 police officers from North Wales, Cheshire, Merseyside and Manchester, who followed their movements between North Wales and north-west England, as well as tracking their mobile phones. Despite Thorman only using unregistered pay-as-you-go mobile phones, police managed to trace 49 different numbers linked to him. Text messages showed he maintained his position through threats of violence. Thorman admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis. Thorman was jailed after he admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine (pictured) and cannabis . The judge was told he also had a previous conviction for possessing heroin with intent to supply. Yesterday Thorman was one of 23 men and three women - all from the Caernarfon and Manchester areas - to appear before Caernarfon Crown Court. All were sentenced for their part in conspiring to supply class A and B controlled drugs into North Wales between 2009 and 2014. In total the 26 received 127 years imprisonment - which is the most significant sentencing the region has ever seen for one investigation. He and the others were jailed following a five-year investigation by North Wales Police codenamed Operation Yonside. While in prison Thorman boasted about his links to a notorious Merseyside crime baron . Cars, drugs, guns and even this boat were all seized by detectives as they cracked the huge crime operation . It was set up as part of the wider Operation Scorpion which was set up to smash organised crime gangs and was launched in 2009 after large quantities of cocaine were found hidden in a hotel locker and the loft of a house in Caernarfon. Information supplied by local police and members of the community helped detectives uncover drugs valued at over £179,000 stashed in various houses in the Caernarfon area. Over 500 witness statements were recorded . Over 200 officers from North Wales, Merseyside, Cheshire and Manchester were used . North Wales Police also worked with North Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Gwynedd Social Services and Gwynedd Council's CCTV . 180 witnesses were involved . 39 people were arrested and 34 addresses searched . Over 200 hours of suspect interviews were carried out . Over 2,700 exhibits were recovered, examined and reviewed . 192 phones and devices were recovered, examined and reviewed . 141 phone numbers were attributed to 34 defendants . 66 SIM cards and handsets were checked . 413 telecommunication records were used . 9,228 phone numbers were researched . Police recovered 1.24kg of cocaine valued at £101,799, as well as 5.8kg of cannabis and plants worth £97,770. But Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said: 'I am entirely satisfied that the total quantities of both drugs was many times that amount.' The purity of the adulterated drugs was between 20 per cent and 30 per cent. Judge Hughes said: 'It was a large-scale and sophisticated conspiracy, one of the largest in the last 15 years. 'It involved at least 26 individuals in a controlled crime syndicate. 'Gavin Thorman controlled 14 individuals. 'The harm to the general public and to the community of North Wales and Caernarfon in this case is incalculable.' Detective Superintendent John Hanson Head of Major Crime North Wales Police said: 'The communities of North West Wales are a safer place in which to live, visit, work and socialise today after the successful conclusion of this investigation. 'This has been a protracted and often complex investigation into the unlawful activities of an organised crime group who have established criminal links across the North West of England to facilitate the distribution of controlled drugs into North West Wales. 'This criminal gang contained a number of violent individuals who would use and threaten violence as part of their criminality - however the communities in which they operated were not prepared to tolerate this behaviour. 'I am grateful for their support and for the commitment and assistance we received from law enforcement colleagues and multi-agency partners. 'This has been a collective effort with a very positive outcome'.

"Two small boys, ages 5 and 3, drowned after the child-sized all-terrain vehicle (ATV) they were riding crashed into a pond in a rural area of Northern California. The California Highway Patrol says the boys died Sunday afternoon despite the father of one of the kids jumping into the water and pulling both children to shore. Investigators say the 5-year-old, identified as Blake Cronkhite, was driving the 50cc ATV, and his younger friend, Jayden Secrest, was on the back. Scroll down for video . Too young: Blake Cronkhite, 5 (left), and Jayden Secrest, 3 (right), drowned when their kid-size ATV plunged into large pond in Northern California . Crash: The boys were riding this kid-size 50cc ATV, with Blake at the wheel and Jayden on the back . Watery grave: the 5-year-old lost control of the vehicle and the ATV plunged into this large pond . CHP Officer David Martinez said Monday that the agency's investigation has focused on how the boys ended up in the pond and how well adults were supervising them while riding. The Sacramento Bee reports that the incident on private property near Auburn is listed as an accident and nobody has been cited or arrested. The accident took place in the driveway of the Cronkhite family's home in the 5100 block of Wise Road in rural Placer County as the children's fathers, William Secrest and Brandon Cronkhite, were doing yard work together. According to CHP, Blake and Jayden hopped on a small ATV, which had been brought to the house by a friend, and rode to a nearby pond, where the 5-year-old driver lost control and plunged into the water. Both boys were wearing helmets at the time. At one point, the parents noticed the absence of the boys and when looking for them. Then, a relative spotted a helmet bobbing in the water, prompting Brandon Cronkhite to race to the pond to try and save the children. After carrying Jayden and Blake to shore, Mr Cronkhite proceeded to perform CPR on them. Paramedics who arrived on the scene a short time later also made efforts to revive the unresponsive children. Rescue attempt: Blake's father, Brandon Cronkhite (left), jumped into the pond and brought the children ashore but could not revive them . Two helicopters transported the toddlers to UC Davis Medical Center, where they were pronounced dead in the span on an hour. In California, young children are permitted to ride ATVs on private property, so long as they have the proper supervision. Despite his tender age, Jayden Secrest was accustomed to being around vehicles. His father, William Secrest, is a member of Vagos Motorcycle club, and his Facebook albums are filled with photos of the toddler and his young cousins and friends zipping around on kid-sized dirt bikes and small ATVs. The CHP told the station KCRA they will investigate the incident, but it will be up to the district attorney to determine whether the parents will face charges. Mr Secrest expressed his anguish in a heartbreaking status update a day after the tragedy. Blake (left and right) and Jayden had helmets on at the time of the crash. The two young friends were airlifted to a hospital, where they died Sunday night . ‘I want to die and can't even describe the pain and emotions I'm feeling or the demons I'm fighting so I don't do anything stupid, but my life has crumbled so bad that I don't know what will happen,’ the grieving dad lamented. The two bereaved families have set up donation pages, one for Blake and one for Jayden, to help them with the final expenses. Heritage Church is also accepting donations on behalf of the Cronkhites and the Secrests.","Blake Cronkhite, 5, and Jayden Secrest, 3, drowned when their kid-size ATV plunged into large pond in Northern California .

"Crawling commando-style underneath an open-sided Land Rover, I came virtually nose to nose with a 4,500lb horned rhino. I tried to slow my breathing as she looked straight at me. I needed to be calm to take my shot. There were three other rhinos with her and, let's be honest, they're not called a crash of rhino for nothing. I raised my camera and began to photograph what could soon become an extinct pachyderm. The luxurious Ulusaba Game Reserve is  in South Africa's Sabi Sands and is Sir Richard Branson's private reserve . Thankfully the female found my scrawny presence of absolutely no consequence, and instead wandered off in search of tastier herbivorous options. I was with my mate James and we laughed awkwardly as we climbed back into the vehicle. My mum – Sky TV presenter Kay Burley – was sitting statue-still on board, having adopted her best nonchalant expression, but she wasn't fooling either of us. The holiday at Ulusaba, Sir Richard Branson's private game reserve in South Africa's Sabi Sands, was my reward for graduating. I have been on safari before but this was different. I'm an amateur car photographer and wanted to swap taking photos of Ferraris and focus instead on the roar of a bush lion, the yawn of a hippo, the prowl of a glorious leopard or a close-up of a fearless rhino. We achieved all of them. Kutner came face to face with three rhinos, along with documenting the roar of a bush lion, the yawn of a hippo and the prowl of a glorious leopard . Just the day before, we had tracked the crash of rhino on foot. With 1,000 rhinos killed by poachers in South Africa last year alone, they are increasingly difficult to view. Danny, our brilliant tracker, who could find a spelling mistake in a dictionary, had eventually located them, but with dusk fast approaching we reluctantly headed back to the Land Rover. The African bush is not a place to be on foot in the dark. We should know. We'd spent the earlier part of the day up close and personal with a pride of lions. Our ranger, Trevor, steered the Land Rover as close as he dared without disturbing the big cats. The lioness, who could have taken any one of us out with a casual swipe of her front paw, looked in our direction, checked her cubs and allowed us to stay. Trevor, also a photographer, whispered advice on appropriate settings for my Nikon D600 to achieve the best results. Heading back to the luxury accommodation at Cliff Lodge, a two-bedroom apartment within Rock Lodge (Mum described it as glamping but with solid walls, luxury furnishings, soft sheets and a chef to conjure up our favourite food), we talked about all the other animals we wanted to see, if possible. Alexander Kutner with mum, Sky TV presenter Kay Burley, at Ulusaba, Sir Richard Branson's private game reserve in South Africa's Sabi Sands . Trevor said he and Danny would try but couldn't promise anything. Nevertheless, given the conservation, ecology and anti-poaching work being carried out by Ulusaba and adjoining camps, we were feeling confident. The following day we found ourselves slap bang in the middle of a herd of buffalo, mean-looking guys who glare at you as if you owe them money. Danny, who will happily track on foot for lion, leopard, elephant and rhino – four of the Big Five – makes an exception for buffalo. Alexander said a lioness looked in his group's direction, checked her cubs and allowed them to stay . Trevor started up the engine and we moved on. Pausing at a watering hole, we were delighted to see two young male elephants wandering towards us. They made their way into the water and proceeded to perform for us – a photographer's dream! We returned to the lodge to relax and sort through the hundreds of photos we'd captured. Chef served up kudu burgers for lunch. We'd seen plenty of these handsome antelope during our morning game drive… and Mum decided to pass on that meal. Ulusaba means 'place of little fear'. That's because the koppie where Rock Lodge sits provided the ancient Shangaan warriors with the perfect lookout point . Trevor wondered what else we'd like to see. 'Cheetah, please,' we cried. He took us on a long, bumpy drive to the wide-open plains where cheetah can run free in their hunt for food. They are extremely rare in this area of the Sabi Sands and, despite hour after hour of tracking, there were no paw-print clues. However, Trevor had one last surprise. Danny heard the call of a honey bird and a solitary warning from an impala antelope. These led him on foot to a pair of leopard cubs frolicking up a tree. There is no sighting quite as magical as a leopard, and six-month-old cubs are the perfect age to provide incredible images of their playful behaviour. Eventually, with a heavy heart and my camera packed away, we left the African bush. Until the next time...

"Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus has revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Speaking in the latest issue of Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former senator and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video . Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine . Short and sweet: Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades . Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread . As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose ideology revolves around getting 're-elected at all costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy . Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event . And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female politicians get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There’s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let’s do something about that,' she said. 'Let’s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that’s OK, and if it does look good, that’s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld. On Tuesday it was announced that she would be making an appearance on her former co-star's Crackle channel web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.","The 54-year-old actress covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine ."
"Libertarian icon Rand Paul has beefed up his campaign store ahead of his announcement this morning that he would compete for the Republican nomination for president next year. Like Paul, the Kentucky senator who made a name for himself by championing issues not typically associated with the GOP such as criminal justice reform and privacy protections, much of the 'Rand' 2016 SWAG is unconventional. Rand fans will still find the usual array of yard signs and bumper stickers. But they'll also have the opportunity to sport their support  through Macbook skins and woven blankets that feature Paul's face, 'Stand with Rand' flip-flops and car mats and a host of other unique items like the 'NSA Spy Cam Blocker.' Scroll down for video . Libertarian icon Rand Paul has expanded his campaign store to include an array of unconventional SWAG, including the 'Rand on a Stick' item feature above, as he kicks off his presidential campaign . An ophthalmologist by trade, the store contains eye charts bearing Paul's name and his campaign slogan because 'we need a president who can see clearly,' as the site states . For $75 Paul fans can own a throw rug featuring the Kentucky senator. It also comes in a Constitution theme for the same price . 'Sure it might be fun to have Rand in your living room at night engaging in deep discussions about objectivism, libertarianism, conservatism and a few other isms,' the description for the item reads. 'In the absence of that, curl up on your couch with the Rand blanket. It's the next best thing to him being there.' The freshman senator's expansion of his campaign store to include 'Paul for president' items preceded an announcement this morning on the website that said: 'I am running for president to return our country to the principles of liberty and limited government.' An unofficial candidate for the last year, the statement made formal the tea partier's entry into the 2016 contest a few hours before he was scheduled to hold a campaign kick-off in his home state. He'll spend the rest of the week rallying supporters in early presidential primary states New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada, in that order, before making his back to Washington for his day job. The Senate is currently in the midst of a two-week break in honor of the Easter and Passover holidays. Loyalists of the 52-year-old freshman senator and his father Ron, a former Texas representative who sought the presidency in 2008 and 2012, are known for the fervency of their support and organizational skills. Tonight they'll celebrate the younger Paul's entry into 2016 competition with 'Stand with Rand' #LibertyKaraoke parties across the country. Running on the slogan 'Defeat the Washington Machine, Unleash the American Dream' and promoting himself as 'A Different Kind of Republican,' Paul's campaign store reflects the 52-year-old lawmaker's efforts to appeal to a new generation of conservatives- fiercely independent young adults who are just as likely to vote for GOP politicians as they are Libertarian candidates or nobody at all. Playing off the Stand with Rand theme, the description accompanying a pair of $20 sandals in the store says, 'no, really stand with Rand in official campaign flip flops.' Beer steins and t-shirts rock an 'unleashed' dog wearing patriotic sunglasses and holding an American flag in his mouth. The item bound to draw the most attention, however, is the campaign's 'NSA Spy Cam Blocker' that allegedly protects users from the preying eyes of the government. 'That little front facing camera on your laptop or tablet can be a window for the world to see you - whether you know it or not!' the item's page warns . For $100 Paul's supporters can purchase branded versions of cornhall, the bean bag toss game that's especially popular with the southerners from Paul's native region .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have moved back to Kensington Palace to prepare for the imminent birth of their new baby, MailOnline can reveal today. The couple, whose second child is due on Saturday, returned to their London base, just a few minutes’ drive from the private Lindo Wing at St Mary’s, Paddington, on Sunday night after spending the weekend at Kate’s family home in Berkshire, where they took a trip to their local farm park. The news came as Kensington Palace revealed William will enjoy what amounts to six weeks’ paternity leave around the arrival of the new little prince or princess. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Prince William, pictured with his wife last month, has finished his air ambulance pilot training early so he is guaranteed to be with the Duchess of Cambridge when she goes into labour . Change: Until today the second in line to the throne, who is a trainee pilot with the East Anglia Air Ambulance in Norfolk, had been expected to still be working around the time his wife is expecting their new baby. A royal spokesman announced that the second in line to the throne had completed his latest stage of his training as a pilot with East Anglia Air Ambulance (EAAA) ‘earlier than expected’ - and would not be required to embark on the final stage until June 1. The future king had already announced that he planned to take two weeks’ statutory paternity leave after the birth. With his enforced absence from work happily coinciding with the birth of his second child, William will now take the next month and a half off as unpaid leave, aides said, with immediate effect. Good timing? Prince Harry, pictured in Australia, also announced today that he will be back in the UK to watch the London Marathon on Sunday, meaning he may also get to meet his future niece or nephew . The palace also announced that Prince Harry, who is currently on deployment with the Australian Army, will briefly return to the UK this weekend to present the winners’ medals at Sunday’s London Marathon and, if all goes to plan, meet his new niece or nephew. Harry – who is soon to drop down a place in the line of succession to fifth – is already travelling over to attend the Gallipoli Campaign centenary commemorations with his father, Prince Charles, on Thursday. The prince, who is patron of the London Marathon Charitable Trust, will return to Australia on Monday to continue his placement. The Mail understands that in recent days the Duchess, who carried out her last public engagement in March, has been taking her mind off the impending birth by spending a few days with her parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, at their sprawling Georgian mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire. On Sunday she and Carole took her eldest son, Prince George, for a visit to nearby Bucklebury Farm Park where youngsters can meet a variety of animals from lambs to wild boar and enjoy a large outdoor playground. The little prince is a frequent visitor to the park with both his mother, nanny and grandmother. Kate appeared unbothered by her pregnancy, according to onlookers, as she carried and cuddled George, accompanied by a low-key Scotland Yard security detail. The family returned to London on Sunday night to make last minute preparations for the latest addition to their family, who will become fourth in line to the throne. In a statement today a Kensington Palace spokesman confirmed that William, who is employed by a private company, Bond Air Services, while working for the EAAA, had sailed through his initial training so quickly that he would now be able to be with his wife both before and after the birth. Plans: Kate plans deliver her child at the Lindo Wing, where the cost of giving birth naturally is up to £10,000, and where their son George was July 2013 . They said: ‘The Duke of Cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with Bond Air Services earlier than anticipated. ‘This is due to a combination of The Duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned.’ The Duke was the first member of the Royal Family to take advantage of statutory paternity leave, which was introduced in the UK in 2003. After the birth of his son George he took two weeks off while working on Anglesey. With his second child due on Saturday William will now be off work until June 1, although it will be unpaid, Palace sources say. Government rules state fathers are  paid £139.58-a-week for a maximum of two weeks. It is understood the Prince will not claim it. Fathers are entitled to two weeks paid paternity leave and up to 26 weeks’ additional paid leave if the child’s mother returns to work. The spokesman explained that given the lengthy gap between now and the final stage of his training, the prince has been on unpaid leave since Friday. He will undertake a handful of public engagements in late May, likely to include joining his grandmother, the Queen, at a Buckingham Palace garden party, before recommencing his training at the start of the following month. His spokesman added: ‘His final block of in-work training requires an uninterrupted three week block of working time and the availability of the new EC145 helicopter that will be used for missions. This has always been scheduled to commence on 1st June, following a pre-planned period of official royal engagements in late May, details of which will be announced in due course. ‘As he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave, he will not return to duties with Bond until that time, and will remain on unpaid leave until then.’ While it is unlikely the new little prince or princess will become monarch, it is not unheard of. The Queen’s own father became George VI after the abdication of his elder brother, Edward VIII, over his love for American divorcee Wallis Simpson. The current monarch celebrated her 89th birthday quietly with her husband, Prince Philip, at Windsor Castle where she is holding Easter Court. Not only has she now entered her 90th remarkable year, but the Queen will soon also become the longest reigning monarch in British history.","Prince William had been expected to work as pilot until the end of April .

"Alan Rogers, who admitted manslaughter after smashing the skull of neighbour Fred Hatch after wrongly believing he was involved in witchcraft . A crazed pensioner killed his Navy veteran neighbour with a claw hammer as he wrongly believed he was involved in witchcraft, a court heard today. Alan Rogers, 73, smashed the skull of 76-year-old grandfather Fred Hatch in the communal garden of their sheltered housing complex near Cardiff. Mr Hatch's worried wife Enid then went looking for her husband after he failed to return into the house from the garden. She then discovered Rogers standing over the bloodied body of her husband before fleeing to press a panic alarm. Today at Cardiff Crown Court, Rogers pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is due to be sentenced later today. The court heard how after attacking his neighbour, Rogers then calmly called the police and told them: 'I have just killed one of my neighbours and I have hit his head with a hammer.' Police and paramedics raced to the sheltered housing complex in Dinas Powys but they were unable to save Mr Hatch, who died in hospital. As Rogers was handcuffed by police officers, he told them: 'I have been waiting a long time to kill that man.' Police then interviewing Rogers suspected he may have been suffering mental health problems when he started making strange statements about why he killed his neighbour. Prosecutor Mike Jones said Rogers told police he had killed Fred because he was involved in modern 'witchcraft'. Mr Jones explained: 'He told police he had a moral duty to himself to kill this person as these people were using modern technology the equivalent of witchcraft to harm defenceless sentient beings. 'He said Fred had been in collusion with what he described as ""the man and his colleagues"".' The court was told the morning of October 8 last year began with Mr Hatch walking to the communal garden to spread grass seeds. Rogers told police he had 'been waiting for an opportunity to get this person' and when he saw Mr Hatch walking back from the garden he 'opened his door and attacked.' Rogers then hit him at least six times with the claw end of a hammer - spraying blood up the walls and across the floor. Mr Hatch, pictured with his wife Enid, who discovered Rogers standing over the blood stained body of her husband in their communal garden . The court was told the victim had such catastrophic injuries to his forehead his skull, his brain was visible. Rogers was later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia but had no previous criminal record or episodes of violence before the killing. Mrs Hatch said they had never had any previous problems with Rogers, and described him as 'articulate but unkempt'. She said her husband of 50 years was 'the love of my life' and someone who was 'very easygoing and never had any problems with people.' A police officer stands outside the sheltered housing complex in Cardiff, where both Rogers and Mr and Mrs Hatch lived . Rogers attacked Mr Hatch outside in the gardens of the sheltered housing complex after going out to spread grass seeds . The court heard the couple met serving in the Royal Navy and 'fell in love quite instantly' and married within six months of meeting. They had four children together and spent their retirement travelling the world. They were planning their next trip to America when he was brutally killed. Vincent Coughlin, defending, said the killing was 'an appalling unprovoked attack' and Rogers was 'conscious of the pain he has caused.' Mr Hatch's death came four decades after Mrs Hatch’s sister Betty Elston was found murdered on the beach at Sully in the Vale of Glamorgan in July 1971.","Alan Rogers smashed the head of Fred Hatch in their communal garden .

"White solidarity groups in South Africa are protesting over the removal of a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes from the University of Cape Town. The monument of the controversial historical figure is set to removed today, after South Africa’s oldest university voted to ditch it following a month of protests against the statue. Members of the university council ordered that the bronze sculpture was removed, after hearing its presence made black students feel uncomfortable and was seen a symbol of historical white oppression . The defaced statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes is tied by straps to a crane before its removal at the University of Cape Town. It follows weeks of protests at the university over the symbolism of the statue . The monument has been vandalised in recent weeks. It has not yet been decided where it will be moved . The government has backed the move, and Sandile Memela, the spokesman for the arts and culture ministry, said they are working to see if the country can take an ‘official position’ on statues and other colonial symbols. ‘It marks a significant… shift where the country deals with its ugly past in a positive and constructive way’, he said to press agency AFP, adding the government did not encourage the violent removal of statues. But the decision to move the monument of Rhodes – a 19th century imperialist who critics say helped pave the way for apartheid – has sparked protests in itself. On Thursday morning, the youth wing of white Afrikaner solidarity group AfriForum handed a memorandum to parliament in Cape Town to ‘demand protection’ for their heritage. The same statue was covered in plastic bags after protests by students and staff at the university in March . The university's council heard that black students felt uncomfortable because of the bronze monument . Politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes is called a 'racist' by his opponents. Born in 1853, he made his fortune in diamond mines, and entered into politics as an outspoken supporter of colonialism. He later founded Rhodesia - modern-day Zimbabwe - which was named after him. He believed England was the 'master race', and wanted to draw a 'red line' railway from Cairo to Cape Town for the British Empire - spanning the entire continent of Africa. While his supporters say he brought political and physical infrastructure to South Africa, others say his actions laid the groundwork for apartheid by restricting the rights of black Africans to work. Source: BBC, Wikipedia . While they are not recognised as supporters of Rhodes, statues of their heroes have been attacked during the university protests. A monument of former president Paul Kruger was splattered with paint, and Afrikaner men, some of them in quasi-military outfits, demonstrated next to it on Wednesday. ‘The Afrikaner is -- from a historical perspective -- increasingly being portrayed as criminals and land thieves,’ solidary group Afriforum said in a statement. ‘If the heritage of the Afrikaner is not important to Government, our youth members will preserve our own heritage.’ It has not been decided where the statue of Rhodes will end up, although it will likely be held in a museum. But as tension grow on campuses about the statues of historical South African figures, Jonathan Jansen – the first black vice-chancellor of the University of the Free State – denied that there was a race war coming.

"Police in Hagerstown, Maryland, are promising a thorough investigation into the death of a man in custody after officers shocked him with a stun gun outside a home he allegedly had broken into. Chief Mark Holtzman says the man died either inside an ambulance, accompanied by two officers, or at the hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly early Friday morning. The man was not carrying identification but police were later able to identify him as Darrell Lawrence Brown, 31, of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, they wrote in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Hagerstown police have asked the Washington County Sheriff's Office to investigate the incident. Sheriff Douglas Mullendore says the investigation will be independent and thorough, according to the Herald Mail. Police were called to a reported break in at a house in Hagerstown, Maryland (pictured) before using a Taser on a black man who was staggering around outside . A spokesman for the Washington County Sheriff's Office told the Daily Mail Online that the force was investigating both the actions of the officers as well as any other possible crimes during the incident. Brown was black and all five officers involved are white. Race hasn't been raised as a factor, but it comes amid a national debate about the deaths of black men at the hands of police. Officers used a stun gun to subdue him outside a home he had broken into, prompting the frightened children inside to call 911, according to the Hagerstown Police Department and witnesses. Witnesses said the officers acted professionally in taking Brown down Thursday night as he cursed at police and ignored their commands to get down. An officer fired a stun gun from at least six feet away after the man moved toward him in an aggressive manner, said Robert Holmes, who said he watched the incident. 'They wasn't physical or nothing like that. They were pretty much doing their job,' Holmes said. Police said the man appeared to be under the influence of drugs. They said he remained uncooperative as he was handcuffed and placed in an ambulance. 'At some point, the suspect suffered an unknown medical emergency,' police said in a written statement. They said he was pronounced dead shortly after midnight at the nearby Meritus Medical Center. The Office of the State Medical Examiner will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death, said Officer Heather Aleshire, a police spokeswoman. She said she was not aware of any video of the incident. A spokesman for the Office of the State Medical Examiner said they do not comment on cases still under investigation. The man, who has not yet been identified, was said to be under the influence of drugs before police used a Taser and he was pronounced dead at a local hospital . It is not known how many times the man was hit with a Taser, according to Holtzman. Police said the first call reporting a disturbance, with screaming in the background, came into the 911 center around 10.30pm Thursday. A second caller reported that a man broke into her house before leaving and staggering around outside the house, police said. Nine-year-old Tera Gibbs said the man kicked in the door to her family's row house and came upstairs, where she and her sisters sleep. Tera's mother, Laura Mirfin, said she had gone out, leaving Tera and three sisters, ages 16, 14 and 13, at home. Tera said the girls chased Brown outside and called 911. Police said two responding officers found the man in front of the home 'in an aggressive stance' and he 'appeared to be highly agitated before being Tased. Two more officers and a supervisor arrived a short time later. The five officers have roughly 32 years of combined experience. They have been reassigned to administrative duty until the end of an internal investigation. Andy Smith, the president of Brothers Who Care, an organization for black men roughly 100 yards from where the Taser incident took place, said that 'had this happened with any other police agency, I would possibly be concerned or up in arms since the man was black'. He said 'I do not have any suspicion of misconduct on their part in the death of this man', which he called an 'unfortunate incident'. A man with Brown's name who is the same age had a string of previous incidents with the law, including a conviction for distributing drugs.","Darrell Brown, 31, accused of breaking into house in Hagerstown, Maryland .

"Sending dozens of messages or playing games for hours can cause your phone to overheat, which can drain battery and even damage the device. Now an Israeli team of developers has built a 'thermal protection' case that not only warns you when your phone is getting too hot, it will automatically cool it down. Called Amited, the case uses micro-fans to blow heat away from the device, or can heat a phone using resistance coils if it gets too cold. Scroll down for video . The Optimal case (pictured) was designed by Israel-based Amited. Sensors in the case monitor the phone's temperature and if it gets too hot, Optimal will cool the device using two built-in micro-fans. And if it gets too hot, Optimal engages its Anti-Freeze protection mode to gently heat the phone using resistance coils . The recommended storage temperature for most batteries is 15°C (59°F), while the 'extreme allowable' temperature is 40°C to 50°C (40°C to 122°F). Studies have found that a phone is most efficient when it's between 0° and 35°C (32°F to 95°F), and keeping it as near room temperature as possible (22° C or 72°F ) is ideal. At an average temperature of 0°C (32°F), a lithium-ion battery will lose six per cent of its maximum capacity every year. At 25°C (77°F) degrees that number jumps to 20 per cent. Optimal syncs with a smartphone over Bluetooth and constantly analyses the phone's temperature when Auto mode is enabled, using built-in temperature and humidity sensors. Optimal syncs with a smartphone over Bluetooth and constantly analyses the phone's temperature when Auto mode is enabled, using built-in temperature and humidity sensors. The board and fans are pictured . Auto mode can be disabled and users can also manually track temperature changes using an app. This app shows  changes over time, but also reveals which apps in particular are having the highest thermal effect on the phone. Users can then set their own custom temperatures zones and set alarm thresholds . Inside the 0.19-inch (5mm) thick case is a pair of 'virtually silent', 0.07inch (2mm) micro-fans with air flow of 1.3 litres per minute. These dissipate the heat and cool the phone down. Amited is also fitted with an ultra-thin heating coils attached to the back of a conductive copper plate. When Optimal notices a drop in temperature, Anti-Freeze mode will engage these coils to stop the phone from freezing, even in sub-freezing conditions. Optimal's sensors are pictured. When Optimal's air vents are blocked, for example when the phone is in a pocket or bag, it will alert the user to warn them the temperature in their phone needs to be corrected. Alternatively, the phone can use Optimal's built-in battery as a backup . Optimal is fitted with temperature sensors, resistance coils and two 2mm micro-fans. It syncs with a smartphone over Bluetooth and constantly analyses the phone's temperature when in Auto mode. If it gets too hot, Optimal will cool the device using the micro-fans. These fans help the phone dissipate heat faster and cools down the device. And if the phone gets too hot, Optimal engages its Anti-Freeze protection to gently heat the phone using the resistance coils. Optimal remains in low-power, 'sleeping mode' the rest of the time to conserve battery. Auto mode can be switched off at any time, though, and people can manually analyse their phone's temperature, as well as see which apps impacting the device. Plus, when Optimal's air vents are blocked, for example when the phone is in a pocket or bag, it alerts the user to warn them the temperature of their phone needs to be corrected. Alternatively, the phone can use Optimal's built-in battery as a backup. Amited is launching an Indiegogo campaign to fund production of the case (pictured) on 9 April. Optimal will be available for pre-order for Apple, Samsung, Nexus, HTC & Xperia phones. Prices haven't been announced . Studies have found that a phone is most efficient between 0° and 35°C (32°F to 95°F), and keeping it as near room temperature as possible (22° C or 72°F ) is ideal. At an average temperature of 0°C (32°F), a lithium-ion battery will lose 6% of its maximum capacity every year. At 25°C (77°F) degrees that number jumps to 20%. Batteries exposed to hot temperatures lose their ability to store energy and the hotter the temperature, the faster they lose this ability. Extreme heatcan also cause permanent battery failure if exposed for long periods. In the cold, when the temperatures drop low enough, the phone could think its battery is empty even if it’s fully charged. The colder it gets, the least amount of energy that the battery can provide. In addition, the internal resistance of the battery grows, causing the output voltage to drop. When Auto mode is enabled, these subtle temperature changes are tracked automatically, but this mode can be disabled and users can manually track these changes using the Optimal app. This app shows temperature changes over time, but also reveals which apps  are having the highest thermal effect on the phone. Users can then set custom operation modes based on their activity and location, set their own custom temperatures zones and set alarm thresholds. 'Heat is the worst enemy of your smartphone battery,' said Amited. 'Like all electronics, constant exposure to the elements will have a negative impact on your smartphone. 'Intense usage will lead to overheating, while extreme cold weather will lead to some circuits freezing inside your smartphone. 'In time, these can affect the performance of your phone’s CPU, battery and GPU. And, eventually, they’ll let you down completely.' 'Optimal is the world’s first thermal protection case designed to keep your smartphone working at its best, no matter where you go or how excessive you use it.'

"Accused: Charlene Mess, 48, allegedly murdered her husband of 30 years at their New York farm . A farmer's wife murdered her husband then buried his dead body beneath a pile of manure, authorities have said. Charlene Mess, 48, was arrested on Monday after her husband of 30 years, 52-year-old Douglas Mess, was found killed at their farm in Attica, New York. State police troopers went to the home at 1229 Exchange Street Road after the couple's son, Douglas Mess, Jr., 29, reported that his father was missing. The younger Mess said that his dad had failed to show up to work on Monday morning and had not been seen since 8pm on Sunday. An air and ground search was carried out by the Wyoming County Sheriff's Office, local volunteer fire companies, friends and family members, and more than 25 members of the New York State Police, Trooper Victor Morales told DailyMail.com. It took seven hours to locate Mess' body, which was concealed in a mound of manure at the back of the 300-acre farm, he added. The farmer's wife, Charlene Mess, remained on the property throughout the entire search and was later taken into custody. Authorities believe she murdered her husband but have not commented on what led to his death or how she allegedly carried out the murder.

"Bridget Klecker, 42, died on Friday after being struck by a vehicle fleeing the police in San Francisco . A pedestrian was killed and another injured when they were struck by a car fleeing police during a wild chase through San Francisco, and the suspects involved were still on the loose Saturday. Officers tried to stop the suspects' stolen car around 10pm on Friday just moments after they committed the latest in a series of robberies while armed with handguns, police said. But the car sped off with police in pursuit and struck a woman in a crosswalk, killing her. The San Francisco medical examiner's office identified the woman on Saturday as Bridget Klecker, 42, of San Francisco. 'I just kept saying that this can't be real — this just can't be real,' Kristine Mendoza, 35, who described Klecker as her close friend, told the San Francisco Chronicle. She and Klecker had planned to attend Monday's San Francisco Giants home opener together and were heading to Mexico in two weeks on a trip, she said. Witnesses who were riding a cable car saw the black sedan go airborne, and the windshield was badly damaged, according to KGO-TV. The car later hit a second pedestrian and then crashed into another car before slipping away from police in the South of Market neighborhood. 'It was one of those unreal experiences to see a car speeding in the intersection at us like that,' Micaela Davis, 35, a passenger in the car that was struck, told the Chronicle. Davis said the suspects' vehicle ran a red light and the driver of the car she was in swerved to avoid it. Neither she, the driver nor a second passenger was injured. A close friend of Klecker (right) said that the pair were supposed to go to the San Francisco Giants season opener on Monday . Klecker was in a crosswalk at California and Kearny streets (pictured) when the car struck her. She died at the hospital .

Police were not able to give a comment of the status of the suspects on Saturday. The second person struck was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, police said. Two firearms believed to be thrown from the car during the chase were recovered. The suspects have committed several armed robberies during the last three days, including three on Friday night alone, police said. A white sedan was struck and totaled by the fleeing Toyota after it hit Klecker and another pedestrian. The Toyota Corolla was later found abandoned .

Victoria Wasteney, 38, says she was branded a ‘religious nutcase’  when she was suspended from her job as a senior occupational therapist, after her colleague Enya Nawaz, then aged 25, accused her of trying to convert her to Christianity. Her lawyers have now submitted a challenge to an employment tribunal, arguing that they broke the law by restricting her freedom of conscience and religion - enshrined in article nine of the European Convention of Human Rights. Miss Wasteney, a born-again Christian, was working at the St John Howard Centre in Homerton, east London, when she became friendly with a junior colleague Miss Nawaz. The two women had discussed Islam and Christianity, as well as the work done by her church at the Christian Revival Church in the O2 Arena in Greenwich against human trafficking. When Miss Nawaz was upset about health problems, Miss Wasteney said she offered to pray for her – putting her hand on her knee and asking God for ‘peace and healing’. She also invited her to church events and gave her colleague a book, I Dared To Call Him Father, about a Muslim woman who converts to Christianity, but denied she was trying to make Miss Nawaz convert. Miss Nawaz went onto make a formal complaint, and the East London NHS Foundation Trust suspended Ms Wasteney on full pay from her £50,000-a-year job for nine months while they investigated in June 2013. A disciplinary hearing upheld three complaints about the book, the invitation to attend church and Miss Wasteney’s offer to pray for Miss Nawaz, and gave her a written warning for misconduct. She continues to work for the Trust, but not in her specialist field. She launched her own employment tribunal against the NHS in January, saying she wanted to raise awareness about the increasing difficulties experienced by religious people in the workplace and claiming the organisation had failed to clear her of wrong doing because it would be 'politically incorrect' to find a Christian innocent. Speaking in January to the Daily Mail Miss Wasteney said: 'I'm not anti-Muslim and I'm always very mindful to be sensitive to other people's beliefs. The senior occupational therapist put her hand on her Muslim colleague's knee while praying for her . 'We discussed our beliefs but I certainly didn't tell her that my way was the only way. I don't even believe it's possible to force someone to convert. 'But the way it was all handled left me looking like a religious nutcase and I would like an acknowledgement that there is a negative attitude towards Christianity in some areas of the public sector.' The latest legal bid, she argues, will have implications for the right to express religious beliefs in the workplace. Miss Wasteney will be represented in court by human rights barrister Paul Diamond, and her appeal is supported by the Christian Legal Centre, according to The Sunday Times. Chief executive of the centre Andrea Williams told the paper: ‘Persecution starts with marginalisation. ‘Where countries let go of a cohesive Christian world view you get chaos and marginalisation. ‘We are letting go of what has given us our freedom.’ Miss Wasteney was suspended for nine months at the St John Howard Centre, a secure psychiatric hospital in east London, after a colleague claimed she had tried to 'bully' her into converting to Christianity . She added:'The tribunal found it was inappropriate for her to engage in prays or give her colleague a book given her senior position. 'She is just an open, friendly, kind person and had a normal relationship with a colleague and there was nothing untoward. 'We are going to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and will be arguing that the ECHR enshrines the freedom to be able to speak about faith in the workplace and not be disciplined for it and have conversations with others. 'We lodged the papers on Thursday. 'The NHS is increasingly dominated by a suffocating liberal agenda that chooses to bend over backwards to accommodate certain beliefs but punishes the Christian.' - June 2013: Enya Nawaz makes a formal complaint about Victoria Wasteney after she prayed for her and invited her to attend church events.

"Italian police who arrested a crew attempting to smuggle desperate migrants to Europe on a luxury yacht have estimated their illegal cargo was worth $800,000. Police in Ragusa, a Sicilian port town, arrested three Syrian men who were at the helm of the Turkish-flagged yacht attempting to reach the Italian coast. It is thought the smugglers had charged each person $8,500 (£5,700) to make the crossing, with police saying the total earned by the organisers was somewhere in the region of £536,000. Scroll down for video . The luxury yacht, which was flying a Turkish flag, was stopped as it approached Europe with a 'cargo' which is thought to have been worth $800,000 - or £536,000 - to the organisers . This is far more than the usual cost of between 1,000 and 1,500 euros - £720 to £1,080 - to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. However, the boat was far more seaworthy than some of the other vessels used, which can be anything from wooden fishing vessels to old cargo ships. Yet even the yacht failed to make the journey in its entirety: the attempt was discovered when two merchant ships were called out to aid a boat in distress. Selfies and other photos snapped by the Syrian and Palestinian passengers helped police identify the smugglers, police said in a statement. Police also revealed there were 23 children on bard the yacht. Harroum Almotassem Billah, Haj Slima Moustafa and Sabaj Ahmmed were all arrested for allegedly being part of the crew. Harroum Almotassem Billah, one of the three Syrians that were taken in custody by police for allegedly being part of the crew which was at the helm of the yacht . Haj Slima Moustafa was also taken into custody after the yacht - filled with Syrian and Palestinian migrants who paid $8,500 each for the journey - called for help as it approached the coast . Sabaj Ahmmed was the third member of the alleged crew attempting to bring the migrants, including 23 children, to Europe . The boat is the latest vessel to be stopped making the dangerous crossing from north Africa to Europe, packed with migrants desperate to start a new life. But many of the trips end in tragedy: so far this year, 1,776 have died, according to the U.N. refugee agency, which estimates that 219,000 people made the crossing in 2014. On Sunday alone, 900 men, women and children are believed to have died after their boat got into difficulty and overturned off Libyan waters, south of the southern Italian island of Lampedusa. There were only 28 survivors. These infrared images show the rescue operation after migrant ship capsized on Sunday . Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . Doctor Giuseppe Pomilla, of the Order of Malta, described the three hours he searched for the living among hundreds of dead floating corpses. He told the MailOnline: 'It was like a nightmare. It was a cemetery. There were bodies everywhere you looked.'","Three-strong crew at helm of luxury yacht arrested by Sicilian police .

"A 69-year-old mentally impaired man from Connecticut celebrated walking free from jail today after spending more than two decades behind bars for the rape and murder of his wife's grandmother. Last month a court ruled Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, was deprived of a fair trial for the 1987 killing and on Friday, a judge ordered him to be freed on $25,000 cash bail. The former inmate was photographed walking out of the hearing alongside his attorney and another supporter with his arms weakly raised in the air.In lieu of his prison jumpsuit, . Lapointe opted for a dark T-shirt over a dress shirt emblazoned with the words 'I didn't do it'. He later described his release as 'wonderful' and during a press conference he said he'd always dreamed of going home. His attorney said he will stay under a 7pm to 7am curfew with a couple in East Hartford. Last month a court ruled Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, was deprived of a fair trial for the 1987 killing and on Friday, a judge ordered him to be freed on $25,000 cash bail . One of his first requests Friday was for a steak dinner. He also expressed fascination with the smartphones reporters were using during the news conference. Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 and was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole. Lapointe's lawyer and supporters said the evidence showed he could not have committed the crimes and his mental disability made him vulnerable to giving a false confession. His case became a cause celebre, receiving widespread publicity as advocates for the mentally disabled and other supporters - including writers Arthur Miller and William Styron - rallied to prove his innocence. Finally, last month the state Supreme Court ruled that Lapointe was deprived of a fair trial because prosecutors failed to disclose notes by a police officer that may have supported an alibi defense. The former inmate was photographed walking out of the hearing alongside his attorney and another supporter with his weakly arms raised in the air . In lieu of his prison jumpsuit, Lapointe opted for a dark T-shirt over a dress shirt emblazoned with the words 'I didn't do it'. The decision upheld an earlier ruling by the state Appellate Court, which in 2012 overturned Lapointe's convictions for capital felony murder, sexual assault and other crimes. The court ruled that Lapointe be released or given a new trial. Murder charges have been refiled but the prosecutor, Gail Hardy, said the state needs to review the evidence before deciding whether it can go forward with another trial. Lapointe is due back in court on May 15. On Friday Lapointe, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, shackles and thick glasses, was hunched over and visibly shaking as he sipped from a cup of water in court. His supporters and attorneys say Lapointe could not have committed the crime due to his disabilities. One of his first requests Friday was for a steak dinner - he also expressed fascination with the smartphones reporters were using during the news conference . Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 and was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole (undated inmate photo above) He suffers from Dandy-Walker syndrome, which affects brain development and causes intellectual and physical impairments. They say Lapointe, who confessed after nearly ten hours of police interrogation, was railroaded under pressure and that he barely understood what was happening to him. Lapointe's release was processed by court officials, and he was freed from custody in the afternoon. The judge rejected a request by prosecutors that Lapointe wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. Defense attorneys say their client cannot drive and is barely able to walk, therefore he does not pose a flight risk. 'We are ecstatic that after all these years Richard is finally being freed. 'This was a travesty of justice from the start,' said Kate Germond, director of Centurion Ministries, a nonprofit organization that works to vindicate people who have been wrongfully convicted. 'He will finally get to sleep in a real bed and breathe some fresh air today for the first time since his unjust incarceration,' she said.","Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, confessed to raping and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 .

"Tim Tebow will sign with the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday, just in time for the off-season program, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports. The agreement with Tebow, 27, stemming from a framework that was put into place when he worked out with the team last month, has been finalized, reports say. Tebow's last regular-season NFL game appearance was in December 2012 with the New York Jets, from which he was released in 2013 having thrown only eight passes and run just 32 times in his lone season on the team. Scroll down for video . Tim Tebow will sign as a quarterback with the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported. He will join the team just in time for the start of the off-season program . Though Tebow hasn't been a part of an NFL organization since 2013, he spent the last two season training with noted throwing coach Tom House, who also worked with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady . The New England Patriots made Tebow one of their final roster cuts in 2013 and he spent last year as a college gridiron television commentator when no NFL team wanted him. Prior to agreeing to sign Tebow, the Eagles wanted to trade backup quarterback Matt Barkley, but couldn't get enough in return, Schefter said in a Facebook post. The Eagles decided to still bring Tebow on to the roster so he could be present for the team's whole off-season program. It was originally reported after his training session with the Eagles that Tebow would not be joining the team. But now he will join a crowded quarterback roster, which included Sam Bradford, March Sanchez and Barkley. Tim Tebow's last regular-season NFL game was with the New York Jets in 2012 . Not only will this give Philadelphia three former first-round picks at the quarterback position and another decorated college player, but it will also reunited Tebow and Sanchez, who were teammates when they both were on the Jets roster. Tebow's pursuit of being an NFL quarterback is back on, after being on hold since being cut from the Patriots. 'I will remain in relentless pursuit of continuing my lifelong dream of being an NFL quarterback,' Tebow wrote on Twitter after he was released by New England, according to Schefter. Since then, Tebow spent two full seasons training with noted throwing coach Tom House, who also worked with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. He has also been working for ESPN and as an analyst for the SEC Network. Tebow has an 8-6 record as an NFL starting quarterback with a career 48-per cent completion rate for 2,422 yards with 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Philadelphia Eagles coach Chip Kelly has made several off-season moves this year. His remake of the Eagles' roster has included trading star running back LeSean McCoy to Buffalo, then signing Offensive Player of the Year DeMarco Murray to replace him. Clearly, Kelly - who took over personnel duties after last season - is unafraid to look anywhere for possible upgrades. Although Tebow had some success in Denver, his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence has plagued him in the NFL. His strength has been running the ball or improvising.","Tim Tebow is expected to sign with the team Monday, in time to participate in the entire off-season program, reports say .

A brewery has seen a spike in sales following a bizarre Twitter spat with teetotal politician George Galloway. Matthew Halliday, the owner of the Bradford Brewing Company, said throngs of people have turned up at the brewery's Brewfactory bar in the wake of the online row. The spat started after the Respect Party parliamentary candidate for Bradford West seemed to take offence after the brewing firm asked him if he was 'still a thing'. Mr Galloway, who doesn't drink, responded to the beer makers, saying: 'What does that mean? And as a licensed premises in my constituency really be writing that?' The brewer carefully reminded the politician that he was no longer the MP for the area after parliament was dissolved last Monday. Galloway hit back, saying: 'Well then, I shall return to this matter after the election. You have been most unwise.' Mr Halliday, 29, said: 'We have seen a bit boost in customers because of this. Almost everyone who came in yesterday did so because of Twitter.' 'It was a cheeky tweet that I sent while I walked past his office early in the morning that just seemed to have escalated. We are now completely blocked and anyone connected to us has been blocked. 'I only asked him because he is the only candidate standing here that hasn't been into the pub to say hello.

I don't want to say too much as it is top secret right now, but all I can say is it is weak, bitter and has a frothy head.' The brewery also said that they would put forward a candidate at the next general election if Mr Galloway retains his seat on May 7.

"Petrol heads suffering Top Gear withdrawals will be pleased to know the car show-sized hole in their lives will soon be filled by the return of For the Love of Cars for a second series. The Channel 4 programme, hosted by actor Philip Glenister and car designer Ant Anstead, celebrates the duo's love affair with classic cars. And each episode looks at the history of various types of vehicles, as the pair give old-bangers a new lease of life by restoring them to their former glory. Actor Philip Glenister and car designer Ant Anstead return to present a new series of For The Love of Cars . A teaser from the first episode shows Glenister – perhaps most recognisable behind the wheel of a red Audi Quattro while playing Gene Hunt in Ashes to Ashes – test driving an Aston Martin Vantage. Revving the engine before taking off at speed around a winding country road, Glenister appears to wipe the colour from Anstead's face before stating: 'This is Bond.' The second series also sees the pair broaden their horizon by working on a number of foreign-manufactured cars as opposed to just primarily British ones. Additionally, they work on more than one vehicle per episode and complete stalled restoration projects, instead of just finding dilapidated cars to fix. The finished products are then auctioned off at the end of every programme, and Anstead admits that the quality of the restorations make it hard for the owners to let go. He said: ‘You have to remember, these cars have a special place in the hearts of these people, for various different reasons. Glenister and Anstead speed around a bend as they test drive a classic Aston Martin Vantage . ‘For somebody to let go of something that important to them is hard enough, but when they see the results at the end of the restoration, it’s really tough. ‘These are jobs that they’ve not been able to finish themselves.’ The cars featured in the series include a quintessentially British Aston Martin DBS, which was brought back to life after been recovered from a barn in Oxfordshire. For The Love of Cars series two is branching out beyond just British vehicle makeovers . And a Rover SD1 police car – the classic panda car of the early 1980s – which features in a  race conducted by the show’s presenters, to find out what side of the law had a speed advantage. The pair also restore two of the most iconic cars to ever come out of Europe – a run-down Fiat 500 and a VW Beetle. The first episode of For the Love of Cars will broadcast on Channel 4 on Sunday, April 19 at 8pm.","The second series is hosted by Philip Glenister and Ant Anstead .

"Evidence has emerged of a wartime blunder that resulted in millions of pounds of Russian bullion, supposedly bound for America, being lost in the river Clyde. The gold and silver bars had been loaded in Murmansk onto a former Irish Sea ferry, converted into a battle cruiser with her superstructure stripped to take part in a dangerous Arctic convoy. The bullion was to pay the Americans for arms shipped to Russia during one of the most crucial stages of the Second World War. Scroll down for video . The bullion was loaded onto the HMS Ulster Queen (pictured) in 1942 and was being transferred to the U.S. as payment for weapons when the case of precious metals was lost overboard . The former ferry, HMS Ulster Queen, arrived in Greenock in November 1942, after 13 days at sea and two ships sunk by German U-boats. But as a delicate operation began to transfer the cases of treasure onto a waiting boat, one slipped and fell into the muddy waters. Such a veil of secrecy existed over the whole operation it is not known if it was ever recovered. In fact, the incident has only come to light thanks to a secret diary kept by one of the Ulster Queen's engineers, and now revealed by his daughter for the first time in a new book. Edinburgh man Leonard H. Thomas served on the Ulster Queen on four convoys to and from Murmansk and Archangel in Russia's extreme northwest. Mr Thomas had got into the habit of keeping copious notes and sketches during his pre-war role as a crewman on the research ship RRS Discovery II in the Southern Ocean. He had joined the Discovery as a 17-year-old in his native Portsmouth. He continued his writings on the Convoys - but aware that should any of his diaries be discovered he would be in serious trouble, he wrote in code and secreted them well. Before he died in 2000, aged 88, he transcribed some of them into four A4 journals, which his daughter, Leona Thomas, has now edited into a book. Edinburgh man Leonard H. Thomas served on the Ulster Queen on four convoys to and from Russia's extreme northwest . Leona, 61, a retired school teacher, said yesterday: 'The story about the Russian bullion is fascinating. It must be documented somewhere, but I have never been able to find out what happened afterwards.' According to her father's notes, there had been 'a peculiar silence all through the ship' as she was loaded in Russia. No one was allowed on deck, no one was allowed along the alleyways forward of the engine room, and no one off the mess decks unless they were on watch. Mr Thomas recorded: 'No scuttles [were] allowed to be opened, but someone got a gleek out and saw mighty big steam locomotives smothered in soldiers, up and down the cleared area of the track, hundreds of them, all with rifles and many with Tommy guns. 'Our guards lined the deck, we later heard, either side of a small derrick which handled the paravanes [mine detectors]. A huge, dark wagon was coaxed, nudged, and jogged until the derrick's fall was hanging vertically and a rope net was placed on the ground. 'Officers approached the wagon and examined locks and bolts [with] armed troops literally surrounding it. Then began the laborious manual exercise of [unloading] what looked like ammunition boxes, which required two men to lift. 'Surely this wasn't small arms ammunition! Not with our own guards and hundreds of troops watching it loaded into us. It certainly was not. It was bullion! 'Two boxes were enough to load the sling and up they went, deposited on our deck, from where each one was slid and lowered down into the 'B Gun' magazine, never out of sight of at least one officer. 'This was the arrangement so that the millions could be spent in the USA to arm the Russians.' 'Then into the Wardroom [went the] harassed officials, who, we heard, lashed into the whisky ""as if it were free."" Probably, with all that off their hands, they could afford to.' Once back in the Clyde, after 'a fast run down the Minches', calamity was to come, however. Mr Thomas wrote: 'It was very late when we saw the welcoming but shaded lights of the Boom Control vessels, hauling left and right to usher us through the widening but regulated aperture, and suddenly the serenity of approaching a hallowed anchorage and being met by a small but important armada and a lighter. 'For the next hour it was cloak-and-dagger stuff again, no one allowed on the upper deck forward of the Wardroom or on the working alleyways. We heard that troops and all sorts were organised to receive the bullion from where it had been man-handled onto the upper deck. 'The paravane derrick was reeved [threaded] and a wire was taken with snatch blocks to a winch. The first two boxes were slung with a hemp rope-sling. Mr Thomas, who died in 2000 aged 88, pictured with his late wife Louie in 1996 . 'In the shaded lights were many officials, officers, men in good suits, bayonets, torches, clipboards, tarpaulins, surreptitious smokers, but nary an onlooker. 'Our Captain anxiously peered over the port wing of the bridge, his nose barely over the canvas dodger, to observe the last rites of the Russian bullion. 'And then it happened. The first boxes, two in number, were being hauled toward the lighter, and who knows what happened, but one slipped and fell with a resounding thump and a splash into the Clyde. 'I was told on good authority that it was nothing so much as resembling a H. M. Bateman cartoon. Needless to say, all were to blame according to what was imparted as a result of this shocking affair. 'The rest was capably transferred to a lighter, various bits of paper signed, exchanged, and pocketed, and a tug chuffed up to pull the lighter clear.' Written in the diaries left for his daughter, Mr Thomas said: 'I was thankful to keep all these years, the actual daily scroll of some of the harrowing times I found myself in, especially the runs in the arctic waters so fraught with danger, both man-made and that of nature.' Leona said of the gold: 'Who knows, it may still be there.' Mr Thomas wrote in his diary how the crew of the Ulster Queen had hoped their ship would be chosen to steam straight for America, so they could 'live it up' for a few days before returning to war-torn Europe. In the end, the decision was apparently made to off-load the cargo in the Clyde, for eventual transfer to another vessel for the Atlantic crossing.

"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today signalled she would quit the Cabinet if the Tories entered a power-sharing deal with Ukip. The senior Tory said Nigel Farage is 'not my cup of tea' and would question whether she was 'happy to serve' with the Ukip leader. David Cameron has urged Ukip supporters to 'come home' to the Conservatives, but has stopped short of ruling out having to rely on the Eurosceptic party if he falls short of a majority. Scroll down for video . Education Secretary Nicky Morgan signalled she would quit the Cabinet if the Tories entered a power-sharing deal with Ukip . Mr Farage sparked controversy last week when he used a televised leaders' debate to target people with HIV coming to Britain. The Ukip leader was greeted with silence in the hall when he said during the debate about the NHS that of the 7,000 diagnosed with HIV, 60 per cent were born abroad. After saying this was something the other leaders would be 'mortified that I dare to even talk about it', he said: 'You can come to Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient. 'I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need is to put the National Health Service there for the British people and families who have paid into this system for decades.' It later emerged the comments were pre-planned in what Ukip insiders called a 'shock and awful' strategy. In an interview with The Times, Mrs Morgan condemned the remarks. She said: 'To say that in a calculated way to appeal to your core vote is pretty stomach-turning.' She added it is a 'legitimate question' to ask senior Tories about the make-up of future coalitions, if as the polls suggest no party gets an overall majority. Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who spent today on a boat in Grimsby with reality TV star Joey Essex, has said he is not seeking ministerial office in a coalition. But Mrs Morgan suggested she would not be willing to sit around the Cabinet table with Ukip: 'I can give you the answer which is that we are not talking about anything but a majority government. 'But I think if we end up in coalition discussion territory people will have to ask themselves who they are happy to serve with. 'It is difficult envisaging what might happen but Nigel Farage is not my cup of tea.' Mr Farage, who spent today on a boat in Grimsby with reality TV star Joey Essex, has said he is not seeking ministerial office in a coalition. But he would demand a referendum on Britain leaving the EU as the price for Ukip MPs supporting a Tory minority government. However, recent polls have suggested support for Ukip is slipping and Mr Farage might struggle to win his own seat in South Thanet. Mr Farage yesterday admitted Ukip has 'slipped back a bit' in the polls as the sense of euphoria among the party's supporters has waned. The Ukip leader has seen support for his party drop from 16.75 per cent in November to just 12.25 per cent today, with voters appearing to switch to the Tories in the run up to the election. Mr Farage is also facing a fight to win his own election battle after falling behind the Tories in Thanet South, Kent - despite enjoying a 12 point lead over his Conservative rival just two months ago. Speaking on a tour of the Midlands, he added: 'We are exactly where we were last August, having won the European elections - we were on 14-and-a-bit per cent. 'We won the European elections, we found that level and we did have a rally in the Autumn through the remarkable events of first Clacton and then perhaps more remarkably the Rochester by-election . 'We've slipped back a bit since then, there are 30 days to go and I think the issues Ukip is campaigning on are back in play.' David Cameron has urged Ukip supporters to 'come home' to the Conservatives, but has stopped short of ruling out having to rely on the Eurosceptic party if he falls short of a majority . Mrs Morgan is the only senior Tory minister defending a marginal seat, in Loughborough. Elected in 2010, with a majority of 3,744, Mrs Morgan became a Treasury minister in 2013 before being promoted to the Cabinet in July last year. Her rejection of the idea of power-sharing with Ukip comes after weeks of contradictory statements from senior Conservatives. In January, Tory party chairman Grant Shapps insisted his party would not enter a deal with Mr Farage. He said: 'I can rule [it] out, we are not going to do pacts and deal with Ukip, we are looking for an overall majority.' But Mr Cameron has only said that he is pushing for a majority, telling MailOnline in February: 'I'm not going to speculate about any outcome other than victory.' On Tuesday he issued a plea to those who had left the Tory fold: 'Look, we've heard the message loud and clear about the things you want to see changed and we'll change those things. Come with us, come back home to us, rather than risk all of this good work being undone.'","Education Secretary suggests she would not be 'happy to serve' with Ukip .

"Even in a world of flash cars and designer clothes, many will be familiar with the saying: 'Money doesn't buy happiness.' It turns out, there are things that you can do to make you feel slightly happier everyday. The best part? According to author of Happier People Healthier Planet, Dr Teresa Belton, they're all completely free. Dr Teresa Belton insists that there are many simple things - such as inviting a lonely person out to tea - that we can do on a daily basis to increase happiness, and they are all free . Researcher and education expert at the University of East Anglia, Dr Teresa Belton, believes that people living modestly tend to find more satisfaction in their lives. Simple activities such as inviting someone out for a cup of tea, singing in a community choir and practicing good posture can all improve general wellbeing. This is because they are all activities that generate a sense of belonging, and help the person adopt confident habits. Author Belton has insisted that practices as small as going on walks can be calming and restorative . The 62-year-old believes simple acts such as straightening posture (left) and joining a community choir (right) can increase happiness levels over time . Firstly the doctor emphasises that it is important to prioritise 'wellbeing' over happiness. Belton says: 'Wellbeing is a continuing state, while happiness can come and go. Wellbeing means that we both feel good and function well.' Her book, Happier People Healthier Planet, supports the belief that while many strive for material things that may generate temporary happiness, it is not sustainable way to be. Belton insists that it's actually non-material things that support our wellbeing, like good relationships and a sense of belonging. List five things for which you are grateful: Whether they are big or small things, Belton recommends doing this for ten weeks can have a big impact on wellbeing . Among her simply everyday tips to feeling happier right away - see below - she highlights seemingly trivial activities such as standing up straight and smiling, and even hanging washing up outdoors. The doctor and author also highlights that there are ways you can invest in happiness and wellbeing for the long run. Practices include regularly making lists of things for which you are grateful. In fact, studies have shown that doing this for a period of ten weeks can have a real lasting affect on wellbeing. Other practices include mindful meditation and taking up voluntary work. Declutter:  Give stuff away, donate possessions to charity or pass them on to someone who could use them. This can relieve stress and create a sense of lightness and unburdening. A less cluttered bedroom can also bring the added bonus of better sleep. Hang washing up outdoors: Getting some fresh air and creating an orderly line of washing will give you a relaxing break and a reason to get outside in the garden. Invite a lonely person to tea: Or offer to help your neighbour with their garden, leaking pipe, shopping, etc. Feeling needed and having a sense of belonging to a community are important factors for a sense of wellbeing. Go for a walk: Time spent in green surroundings has shown time and time again to be calming and restorative. Even a green view is beneficial, so try and buy some indoor plants too: geraniums for a window sill, ivy for a dark corner, and herbs for the kitchen. Stand up straight, and smile: The way we hold ourselves and our facial expression affects the way we feel. Adopt a confident posture and you will feel more confident; look calmly on the world and it will seem a friendlier place. Visit an empty beach or hilltop: Being a tiny part of an immense landscape can reassuringly put worries into perspective. Get moving: Physical activity gets us out of our heads and generates endorphins, the hormone which makes us feel good; dig the garden, cycle, walk, dance, make pastry, or even mow the lawn. Appreciate the little things: From a spider spinning a web, to a bird singing: these are just a few of the endless everyday details which we often overlook or take for granted, yet which can delight us if we let them. List five things for which you are grateful: Whether they are big or small. Research has shown that doing this every week for ten weeks can result in lasting increases in wellbeing, as it gets us into the habit of seeing our life through a positive lens. Join a community choir: Singing regularly with other people is rewarding not only because of the pleasure derived from the music itself, but also because it is sociable and it demands effort, commitment and attention. Take up regular voluntary work: Social connectedness, as well as freely giving your time, attention and energy, and making a positive difference  all contributes to our own satisfaction with life. Get stuck in: Active engagement is a big aspect of personal wellbeing. If you really enjoy your chosen activity, you will lose yourself in it and experience a wonderful sense of 'flow'. Think about your place in the scheme of things: Having a sense of meaning or purpose in life, whether it is religious, political, social, artistic or any other framework, is known to be important for wellbeing. Take up mindfulness meditation: Regular practice of mindfulness meditation decreases anxiety and increases calmness, working memory and flexibility of thought. Take charge: Start a petition, write to your MP or local councillor, or join a campaign about an issue that concerns you. We are happier if we are proactive and feel like we have a say in things. Value relationships over material objects: Levels of wellbeing have not risen in the UK since the 1970's despite an increase in affluence. It's relationships and social networks that contribute towards enduring happiness.","Teresa Belton, 62, is author of Happier People Healthier Planet .

"I really enjoy celeb watching. For me it's all about watching the parade of stunning women wearing dresses that I would neither be able to fit into nor afford. As I get older however, different things draw my attention. A clear sign that I'm firmly settled in middle age may be the utterly sad truth that, I am riveted by the tight jaw lines. And on a recent trip to the U.S. it seemed that I am not the only one. I spent my time there scouring the faces of the women - and men - that I met, trying to spot a wobby chin or weak lower cheek. As a matter of fact I couldn't find a single jowl on anyone. These women had expression lines, wrinkles around their eyes and on their forehead when speaking, but chins and jaw lines that were as tight as a girl just sitting her GCSE's. Scroll down for video . Forget botox or chemical peels the latest celebrity beauty craze is having a tight jawline like Emma Stone . And I'm not just talking about 20-something's like Emma Stone or Margot Robie, but even amongst the over 40's, and the 50-somethings, there wasn't a slackened jowl in sight. It's not just about being thin, there's tightness that on planet earth, as far as I can tell, just shouldn't naturally be there. So just how do they do it? As a 40-something woman who is sadly observing a jaw line that appears to be more and more desperate to rendez-vous with my neck each and every day – it has become my latest obsession. After some calls to my best insider A-list Docs, it seems the new trend in celebrity-ville these days is not about hiding your wrinkles, instead it's the Nefertiti lift, aptly named after the Egyptian queen famous for (amongst other things) her very defined jaw line. Dr Barbara Kubicka says she has clients coming in each and every day asking for botox not on their foreheads but designed to firm their jaw line. Dr Barbara Kubicka sees a host of celebrities at her Knightsbridge clinic and says that 'While the whole world expects it's wrinkles that age you, it's actually your face shape that's making you look older.' She has clients coming in each and every day asking for Botox not on their foreheads but designed to firm their jaw line. Here's why: 'The first thing that our mind assesses when it come to judging the age of the person is shape of their face,' Dr Kubicka says, 'Our faces change with time from a triangle (high cheek bones and defined jaw line) to a square with a heavy jaw line and double chin. The shape of the face is much more important than the lines and folds. In fact, according to recent research we universally recognise as younger, a person who is wrinkly but has a youthful face shape. Thus, traditional Botox on the forehead alone doesn't improve appearance, but changing the shape of your face and tightening your jaw line, does.' Getting a Nefertiti Lift, or lower face rejuvenation has become a must have in Hollywood right now, and you can understand why. Ashley says the latest anti aging treatment is the Nefertiti lift for jowls . Think about the love scenes. How many of us can say with confidence we don't have double chins when lying down? I dread to think what mine looks like. And these actresses are filmed that way and just as badly – from the side whist talking. How I dread those photos showing up on Facebook! Indeed, for those of us who live our lives 'off camera' or shall we say with less pressing incentive than our celebrity friends have, there's still a feeling of wanting to look the way we used to. The good news is though, that apart from a lower face lift – which lets be honest plenty of actresses have – for those of us who want to avoid going under the knife there is a lot of other stuff out there we can do. Indeed, Dr Kubicka of ClinicBe confirms that there's a lot that can be done without surgery: . You can jab it: Access to soft and fat tissue around the jaw line and under the chin can be corrected with up to 3 sessions of Aqualyx (which is a new and improved version of 'flab jab') It works to dissolve fat cells and allows us to pass them out of our bodies when we urinate. 550 pounds per treatment. You can tighten it: Loss of skin laxity can be rectified with different skin treatments like Dermaroller, Radio Frequency or laser and loss of volume on the upper face resulting in a lower face drop can be improved with Dermal Filler or Sculptra. You can lift it: Over active Platysma muscle on the neck that pulls the corner of the jawline down with every contraction can be relaxed with muscle relaxant injections such as Botox which gives an effective lift. Botox (muscle relaxing injections): Nefertiti Lift £350 (Treatments last 3 - 4 months) And finally Dr Kubicka says that the best innovation over the last couple of years is threads. These have been around for a while (remember Madonna was snapped with that suspicious scarring that was widely believed to be a thread lift?) Brand new to the market are PDO threads - a Korean innovation that is suitable for both lifting and tightening. It's far less invasive than traditional threads (there is no hook to hook them on) and there are many sizes and lengths of threads available which allows treatment to every part of the face and even the body. As much as they lift they result in an increase of collagen production and line improvement as a bonus. PDO Threads - Price on Consultation. (Treatments last up to 18 months) And with all of these treatments, subtlety is what you're aiming for. Says Dr Kubicka: 'The greatest advantage is that we can improve the lower face, lift it and tighten without adding extra volume (as seen before with the dreaded 'pillow faces look') which allows us to achieve not only a younger but as well more naturally beautiful facial appearance.'","Celebrity doctors are seeing an increase in demand for Botox in their jowls .

"An epic stunt by the Ecuador tourist board saw it fool a group of 40 visitors into thinking they had flown to Costa Rica to enjoy the delights of its famous port town Golfito. But in fact, the group of tourists were exploring the activities on offer in the country's Napo Province, in the Amazon rainforest. The publicity stunt saw the tourists enjoy white water rafting, swimming near waterfalls and hiking, but it seems that Costa Rica was not amused by the ruse. The creative prank was executed by the Ecuadorean airline Tame, Ecuador's Tourism Ministry and Ministry of Transport and Public Works . The unusual video sparked a diplomatic incident, with the Costa Rican government and Ambassador to Ecuador complaining to the authorities and resulting in Ecuador issuing an apology. The creative project was executed by the Ecuadorean airline Tame, Ecuador's Tourism Ministry and Ministry of Transport and Public Works. But the stunt sparked outrage from the Costa Rican Tourism Institute, the presidential palace and the Foreign Ministry. As Ecuador residents arrived, not in Costa Rica but another Ecuador airport, Tena, where they were given fake stamps in their passports as they went through a staged passport control. No attention to detail was spared as huge posters were placed over the welcome billboards at the airport. Adverts depicting Imperial beer and 'Esencial Costa Rica,' Costa Rica's national brand,  were displayed in the airport to throw the group off the scent. Even fictitious immigration documents and car licence plates were created to make the group think they were in Golfito, a port town in Costa Rica. On top of all that organisers used mobile phone and GPS blockers to keep passengers from using technology to discover the hoax. The Tame airline staged the prank in a bid to demonstrate that Ecuador should be considered a top tourist destination . A fake passport control was set up, which even gave out fake stamps for passports . The unsuspecting tourists took part in a number of exciting activities, from white water rafting to hiking . The prank was captured by video but following complaints, the tourism organisers in Ecuador took the video down. 'We're unhappy about their use of our country to trick their people into getting to know their own country,' Costa Rican tourism minister Wilhelm von Breymann told The Tico Times. The trip aimed to show citizens that Ecuador can be a great tourist destination, featuring many incredible site like the breathtaking volcanic crater lake, Quilotoa . The prank was captured by video but following complaints, the tourism organisers in Ecuador took the video down . In a note posted on the foreign ministry's website, the government stated:' The Costa Rican government expressed its discomfort at the use of its image in publicity about Ecuadorean tourism. 'The Ambassador Alejandro Solado spoke with the highest Ecuadorian authorities about the display in the publicity video and the South American country will take the post down from the Internet.' The Ecuadorain Ambassador Ricardo Patino then followed up with an apology to Costa Rica and confirmed Ecuador had sent a letter to the government to settle the matter. Although they were previously considering legal action, they have since accepted the apology, La Nación reported. Costa Rican outlet La Nación uploaded it on YouTube where it has been viewed by 60,000 people. At the end of the trip, the organiser tore down an 'Esencial Costa Rica' banner that had been posted at the airport to throw the group off the scent. This revealed the Ecuadorean tourism slogan: 'love life' Tame, the largest airline of Ecuador, was part of the big-scale prank, and helped the tourism group to fool the visitors .","The stunt was pulled by local tourism groups and an Ecuador airline .

"Wealth:Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and his wife Princess Haya of Jordan Royal Ascot race meeting, plans to build six-storey car park . The ruler of Dubai is set to build a personal six-storey super car park in London for his fleet of more than 100 luxury motors. The ultimate toy cupboard will house up to 114 cars and have five-star accommodation for chauffeurs and staff. It is being built by the billionaire emir of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, one of the world’s richest men. The car park will be built next to Battersea heliport by the River Thames, allowing him and his associates – including his 23 children – to arrive in the capital by helicopter and jump straight into whichever luxury car they like. But neighbours are worried their road will be spoilt by the estimated 120 cars arriving and departing each day. The Sheikh, who is also vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, has business interests including the Godolphin horseracing stables and the Jumeirah luxury hotel group. His super car park will have two basement floors and six above ground, to include offices, bathrooms and three triple-bedroom flats for the drivers. Though the site is already used for storing cars, angry neighbours are opposed to the car park being built, with one writing: ‘Mendip Road has become the personal fiefdom of the drivers who work from the current car storage facility.’ Another, Jane Helm, 52, said: ‘This sounds like another example of an enormously wealthy foreigner making big plans without thinking much about local people who just want to live in peace. Plans: The car park would have two basement floors and six storeys above ground if planning permission is granted . Massive fleet: The Sheik has 114 cars that he hopes to park in six-storey building by the Thames . 'The last thing we want is a Sheikh and his kids roaring in and out of a great big car park everyday. ‘If it’s as bad as we think it’s going to be, the whole area will be spoilt.’ Plans for the land were submitted by Smech Management Company, which is also behind the Sheikh’s proposed 16-bedroom mansion in the Scottish Highlands. Planning proposal: Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, one of the world’s richest men, is looking to build a six-storey car park to house his fleet . The planning application was approved by councillors at Wandsworth Borough Council. No figure was given for the cost, but construction sources estimated it would cost about £4million to build up, three times as much to excavate the basements, and another ‘couple of million’ for any finishing touches, making an estimated total of nearly £20million. However the source said: ‘That’s just the basic structure. Obviously it will be a lot more if he’s planning to cover it in marble.’","Car park will be next to Battersea heliport so Sheik can fly in .

"A 36-year-old Indiana woman now in police custody is suspected of carrying out a twisted plot of kidnapping and killing a young mother in order to steal the victim's newborn baby and claim the child as her own. The suspect, who has not been identified, lives in Gary, Indiana, where the body of the victim, Samantha Fleming, was found Friday wrapped up in plastic and doused with bleach. Police believe the woman went to the home of 23-year-old Fleming in Anderson, 180 miles away, posing as a Child Protective Services employee and convinced Fleming to come with her to Gary. Fleming recently gave birth to a daughter, Serenity, and lives with her boyfriend, but disappeared with her baby on April 5. Incredibly, the baby has been found by police and is safe, CBS reported. Scroll down for video . Killed: Police believe Samantha Fleming, 23 (left), was lured from her home by a woman pretending to be a social worker, so that the woman could murder her and steal Fleming's three-week-old baby, Serenity (right) Found dead: Fleming went missing from her home in Anderson, Indiana, on April 5. Her body was found Friday at a house 180 miles in Gary. The woman who lives at the property is the suspect in the case . The suspect is said to have known a lot of personal information about Fleming and successfully posed as a case worker, leading Fleming to believe she had to attend a court hearing. Fleming was reported missing by her boyfriend. Police were led to Gary after Fleming's cell phone signal was picked up in the city, where the young mother's wallet was also found near an apartment block. Police followed other leads to the suspect's home, but the woman wasn't there. Investigators said they smelt a foul odor coming from the small one-story house. Inside they found the body of a young woman that had been stabbed, covered in bleach, wrapped in plastic and stuffed in a plastic tub. As officers searched the home, the suspect's sister came by. She had a baby with her and was had come by to pick up some things. Police quickly realized the baby was Serenity. Scene: The body of Samantha Fleming was found stabbed, doused in bleach and wrapped in plastic inside this home at 1987 Cleveland St., in Gary, on April 17 . The sister told police the suspect had asked her to care for the baby and had gone to visit their mother in Texas. The suspect is now said to be in police custody at a Texas hospital, where is she is under mental health care. The infant was handed over to police by the sister, according to the Chicago Tribune. Police have not released the name of the suspect and no charges have been filed. Lt. Thomas Pawlak told The Tribune that the suspect's house had been fitted out with a nursery. 'It appears that she had been planning this,' Pawlak told the newspaper. 'There was everything you would buy for a new baby. A crib, changing table, diaper bag, carrier, new clothes.' A neighbor told the paper the suspect said she was pregnant with twins. The neighbor said around Easter the suspect said one of the twins had died but that she had given birth, only the child was still in hospital with jaundice. New mom: Fleming went missing just three weeks after giving birth to her daughter, Serenity . Safe: Serenity was found in the custody of the suspect's sister. The baby will soon be returned to relatives in Anderson following the tragic death of her mother . When the neighbor eventually saw the woman with the child, she said she found the baby to be 'lighter-skinned' than she expected. The woman also had a bandage on her hand. The alleged kidnapper asked her neighbor to watch her house because she was going out of town. Just days before the woman left, the neighbor said she saw her going back and forth from her house to her garage and carrying small plastic grocery bags. The neighbor said they had been texting regularly since the woman left. But when she texted the alleged kidnapper after she saw police enter her home on Friday, the messages stopped. Pawlak believes the alleged kidnapper was very familiar with Fleming, and they are trying to work out how. The woman is not believed to be affiliated with Child Protective Services in any way. 'She knew a lot about this mother,' he said. 'Enough to convince her she was with CPS.'","Samantha Fleming, 23, and newborn daughter, Serenity, were last seen at their home in Anderson, Indiana, on April 5 .

"An aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed Germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics 'hacked' before it crashed killing all 150 on board. The theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected Financial Times newspaper from aviation boss Matt Andersson, president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace. The French Alps tragedy which occurred on the flight between Barcelona to Dusseldorf has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28. He is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the GermanWings A320 Airbus before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside. Scroll down for video . Disaster: An aviation expert says an external factor like 'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the Germanwings plane crash that claimed 150 lives . Tragedy: The crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who investigators say locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet . Investigation: But Matt Andersson - president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace - says any number of causes could have caused the crash . Doomed: Recordings from the cockpit suggested that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (left) locked himself in the cockpit while the Captain Patrick Sondenheimer desperately tried to break in . Investigators point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer. Mr Andersson says the French accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane 'accelerated in its descent'. But he writes in the FT: 'That may be, but it could be from any number of causes, including external electronic hacking into the aircraft's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception.' 'This is one reason military and head-of-state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures,' and he stresses: 'Civilian aircraft are not.' Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion. He added: 'The public should patiently wait for a through, multi-party professional air safety investigation, while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses.' Setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings, Mr Andersson said: 'Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) of the Germanwings flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards. 'Until they are, many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous, misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions –including misplaced liability, financial and insurance claims.' Damaged: Despite revelations from the plane's flight data recorders (pictured), Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries . Aftermath: He claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its 'control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception' Since the crash, European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck, requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit. Mr Andersson writes in the FT that the 'slow drip' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive. He said the European Cockpit Association representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots 'has rightly criticised the premature release' of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder. Investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside. Protection: Since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck .

"An ex-wife of a North Carolina man serving life in prison for the murder of his third wife has opened up about the abuse she faced when she was married to the man. Amanda Casey, also of North Carolina, was married to Michael Wilkie for four years and had a daughter with him before the couple divorced. He went on to marry his third wife, Shelby Wilkie. Michael Wilkie was found guilty of first-degree murder in January for the 2012 killing of Shelby Wilkie and is serving a life sentence without parole. Amanda Casey has opened up about the abuse she faced at the hands of Michael Wilkie, who in January was found guilty of the 2012 murder of his third wife . 'He said if I ever tried to take his daughter away from him that he would kill me,' Casey told ABC's 20/20. Casey and Shelby Wilkie had met Michael Wilkie through an online dating site. Casey said they dated for a year-and-a-half before getting married. 'He was very friendly, very charming, easy to talk to, very soft spoken, and he had a good job and seemed to be pretty good,' Casey said. A couple months after marrying in 2004, Michael Wilkie began controlling aspects of Casey's life and alienating himself from Casey's daughter from a previous marriage, Casey said. 'If I planned to do something with one of my friends, he would manipulate the situation, and there would be something that came up that would interfere or get in the way,' she said. And then he began to get physically abusive and attacked her when she was pregnant with their daughter. He grabbed me around my throat and threw me around our bedroom and on the bed. My shoulder went through and made that hole in the sheetrock in the bedroom,' she said. Michael Wilkie (left) was sentenced to life in prison with no parole for killing his third wife, Shelby Wilkie (right). Shelby and Michael Wilkie, both of North Carolina, had met on an online dating site . But Casey never reported the incident and her friends and family were not aware of Michael Wilkie's abusive side because 'he was so good at masking'. 'It was like Jekyll and Hyde: two personalities and you didn't know which one you would get,' Casey said. 'You didn't know which one. You would meet when you got home.' She said she 'had thoughts' that Michael Wilkie would kill her, 'mainly because he told me he would kill me'. But Casey didn't leave Wilkie for quite some time. 'I am the type of person that I will stay in a situation, whether it's a job or a marriage … longer than I should because I don't give up hope easily,' she told 20/20. 'And I am always thinking about, 'What could I do to make it better?' After an argument about pictures taken of their daughters together in 2006, Casey left Michael Wilkie. She took her older daughter but left the couple's three-year-old behind. The couple later divorced in 2008. Casey eventually remarried and gained joint-custody of her and Michael Wilkie's child, and met her former husband's new wife, Shelby Wilkie, at a school event for their daughter. Shelby Wilkie was murdered in 2012 and her remains were found after a long search. Her and Michael Wilkie's child, Sydney (left), is in the process of being adopted by Shelby's brother, Bill Sprowls, Jr, against Michael’s wishes . She did not, however, warn Shelby Wilkie about the abuse she faced when she was married to Michael Wilkie. 'I had hoped that things had changed, and that it was me and not, you know, him. And that way, hey, he could be happy. She could be happy, and it could be a nice household environment,' Casey said about the couple. Just before Shelby Wilkie went missing the pair did have a short conversation. 'She said, 'I just want to ask you some things about Michael, is that OK?' And I said, 'Sure,' Casey recalled. 'And I said, 'Shelby, if there is anybody that knows what you are going through, it's me.' Casey told Shelby Wilkie she had to go shortly after and asked her to call her back. She never got a call back, and instead saw Michael Wilkie pleading for Shelby Wilkie to come home. Casey (right) married Michael Wilkie in 2004. She said a few months after the wedding be become controlling and eventually physically abusive. At times, she said she feared he would kill her . At first, Casey thought that Shelby Wilkie had run from her husband, but Michael Wilkie was then arrested, charged and found guilty of his wife's murder. Shelby Wilkie had filed two domestic violence charges against her husband before her death, but both were voluntarily dismissed, according to WSOC. Blood and her ashes, along with a charred bracelet her mother had given her, were later found and Michael Wilkie was arrested, according to ABC. And it wasn't until his arrest that Casey finally felt safe, she said. 'It's made me grow as a person,' she said. 'And it has made me stronger as a human being.'","Michael Wilkie was found guilty in January of first-degree murder in January for the 2012 killing of his third wife, Shelby Wilkie .

"A chef who rose from homelessness to own one of Chicago's most well-respected restaurants, Moto, was found dead on Tuesday, in the midst of a bitter lawsuit lodged by an investor. Homaro Cantu, 38, was found hanging inside Crooked Fork Brewery, the new restaurant he was opening up with his business partner on the north side of Chicago. An autopsy has been scheduled for Wednesday, but authorities have already said they are investigating the married father-of-two's death as a suicide. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Homaro Cantu, the owner of famed Chicago restaurant Moto, was found dead Tuesday from an apparent suicide . Apparent suicide: Chicago authorities say Cantu's body was found hanging inside of Crooked Fork Brewery, the brewpub he was planning to open with his business partner . Married father of two: Cantu leaves behind wife Katie McGowan (left) and their two young daughters. Cantu and McGowan met while he was working at Chicago restaurant Charlie Trotter's. The family pictured above in a photo posted to Cantu's Facebook . Friends say Cantu had recently become strained by a lawsuit filed by a former investor in Moto and iNG, a restaurant Cantu shuttered last year. Last month, investor Alex Espalin accused Cantu in court papers of co-mingling funds from Moto to keep iNG afloat, even though he advised Cantu to close the business. He claimed Cantu stopped talking to him after he confronted him about using Moto's bank account for personal expenses including, trips, meals, a cookbook and other unrelated ventures. According to the lawsuit, Espalin initially invested $100,000 in Cantu's businesses and another $50,000 later on and had a 15 per cent ownership in Moto. Inspiring: Cantu worked for famous chef Trotter at his eponymous restaurant from 1999 until 2003, when he left to start his own restaurant, Moto. Pictured above outside of moto with Chris Jones, chef de cuisine . Strained: A month before his death, Cantu was hit with a lawsuit from an former investor in Moto and failed restaurant iNG, who accused him of commingling Moto's funds to keep his other business ventures afloat . Food scientist: Cantu was known as a pioneer in the culinary field of molecular gastronomy. Above, a dish of raccoon meat is made to resemble a road kill scene at Moto . Fellow chef Matthias Merges lives just a few houses away from Cantu and his family, and last saw the chef four days ago when they talked about his business issues. 'We talked about Berrista [Cantu's cafe] a little bit. He was asking for some advice,' Merges told DNAinfo. Giving back: After mentor Charlie Trotter died in 2013, Cantu helped start the Trotter Project to mentor high school and college students in Trotter's memory . 'He definitely had a strain, from all publicity going around [from the lawsuit]. As we all know, it's tough. He talked about it. He just said, ""It's a difficult situation."" I told him just hang in there and power through it. 'I don't even know what to think. I see his girls almost every day.' Cantu's sudden and surprising death is all the more tragic considering his inspiring rise to success. Growing up in Portland, Oregon, Cantu struggled with drug addiction and was even homeless before he found stability cooking in kitchens on the West Coast. In 1999, he moved to Chicago where he got a job at Charlie Trotter's by knocking on the back door of the world-famous restaurant. It was at Charlie Trotter's that Cantu met his wife, Katie McGowan, who worked as a guest chef one night. The two married in 2003 and have two young daughters. 'They're just a natural, young family,' neighbor Jean Boisvert told DNAinfo. 'I feel horrible for his two young, beautiful daughters.' From February 1, 1999 until February 1, 2003, Cantu worked under Trotter, one time holding the position of sous chef, before he left to start Moto - which earned a Michelin star in 2014. When Trotter died in 2013, Cantu helped head a non-profit called the Trotter Project to mentor high school and college students and which raised money to keep Trotter's restaurant open. Cantu was known as a pioneer in the culinary field of molecular gastronomy, though perhaps not as famous as another food scientist in Chicago, Alinea's Grant Achatz. Edible paper and carbonated fruit are just two of the curious items served at Moto. The culinary world grieves: Fellow Trotter alum Graham Elliot, now a judge on TV show MasterChef, tweeted condolences after hearing about Cantu's death . 'I hear a lot of stories about a top chef coming up from nothing and going on to great things, but his nothing is a much deeper place than almost anybody I ever knew as a chef,' Chef EL Foss told the Chicago Sun-Times. 'To go and to have success that he did. It’s just sad that it has to end like this, and we’re just pretty broken up tonight.' Foss last saw Cantu on March 25, when Cantu agreed to guest chef at Foss' themed-dinner series. Foss said he expected Cantu to cancel, since an Eater article about the Moto lawsuit came out the same day as the dinner. However, he was pleasantly surprised when Cantu showed up as agreed, though he says he did seem a bit 'withdrawn'. 'He was definitely a little bit bummed out. But I didn't get the impression that it was going to defeat him. But I guess you get to a certain age and a certain time, and I guess the idea of picking up the pieces and starting over again could be intimidating. But I did not see this coming. I'm just very shocked and extremely saddened by it all,' Foss told DNAinfo. In the wake of Cantu's death, MasterChef judge Graham Elliot, who also worked at Charlie Trotter's, tweeted sympathy to his friend's family. 'Please everyone, send your thoughts/prayers to the family & loved ones of chef Homaro Cantu. A great friend, a horrible loss; speechless,' Elliot said. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Homaru Cantu, 38, was found dead inside his upcoming restaurant, Crooked Fork Brewery, on Tuesday .

"An Australian businesswoman has come out on top against the world's 13th richest billionaire after stopping BeneFit Cosmetics from using the term 'Brow Bar' exclusively. Beautician Chernae Noonan, who founded eyebrow shaping business The Brow Bar, has blocked the cosmetic giant's application to trademark the phrase. BeneFit is owned by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), which is run by luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault. Australian beautician Chernae Noonan founded eyebrow shaping business The Brow Bar in 2003 . Mr Arnault's estimate wealth is thought to be $37.4 billion and makes him the second richest person in France, according to Forbes. The case between Ms Noonan and BeneFit was heard in the Australian Trade Marks Office earlier this year in February and ruled in the Queensland woman's favour. Ms Noonan started her business in 2003 in her Springwood home and since then it has seen 'significant growth'. She has rolled out six stores across Australia - including on the Gold Coast, Sydney and Melbourne. She has stopped BeneFit Cosmetics from using 'Brow Bar' exclusively after the company launched an application to trademark the term in Australia . The Brow Bar services 'women of relatively high disposable income aged 25 to 55' along with a small group of men. Ms Noonan took action against BeneFit when the cosmetics giant sought to trademark 'Brow Bar' in Australia in 2011. BeneFit is owned by luxury goods company LVMH, which is run by the world's 13th richest billionaire, Bernard Arnault (pictured) She said customers would confuse her business, The Brow Bar, with BeneFit Brow Bar at Myer stores in Western Australia, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. According to the ruling, Ms Noonan said journalists, media writers and online forum contributors often confused the two. Lawyers for BeneFit told the Australian Trade Marks Office the company had already trademarked the term in Hong Kong and Mexico, and had been using the name in its United States stores since 2003. Hearing officer Nicole Worth said she did not consider the word 'Brow Bar' to be used commonly enough to be deemed as 'generic' as lawyers for BeneFit argued. She added the addition of the word 'BeneFit' to 'Brow Bar' also did not help differentiate the cosmetic giant's services from Ms Noonan's business. 'Additionally, although [BeneFit] did not know of [Ms Noonan's] trademark when it adopted the phrase ""browbar"" in the USA, it is reasonable to expect that it ought to have checked the Australian market for conflicting trade marks before entering it,' Ms Worth said. 'It also continued to expand its business under the [trademark] in the knowledge that a prior conflicting mark was registered and being used... That it did so is a risk it chose to bear.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Noonan for further comment but she did not wish to as BeneFit is appealing the decision. A statement on the matter has also been sought from the cosmetics brand.","Owner Chernae Noonan stopped BeneFit Cosmetics from using 'Brow Bar'

"David Cameron has revealed that he and his wife Samantha were 'falling apart' with the pressure of trying to care for their son Ivan after he was born disabled. In an intensely personal interview, he revealed: 'We weren't falling out with each other, but we were falling apart just coping with the nights and everything.' His comments were echoed by his wife who, in a separate interview, said the stresses of looking after Ivan pushed their relationship close to 'breaking point'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron has revealed that he and his wife Samantha (pictured together in 2008 with their son Ivan) were 'falling apart' with the pressure of trying to care for their son  after he was born with a rare brain disorder . Ivan (pictured) was born with Ohtahara Syndrome, a rare brain disorder which left him in a wheelchair, needing to be fed through a tube and suffering from cerebral palsy and severe epileptic fits. He died aged six in 2009 . In a tearful interview, Mrs Cameron spoke for the first time of the 'nightmare' of learning that their first child had a rare disorder which left him needing round-the-clock care. Within a year, she said, looking after him had left the Camerons 'totally shattered' and trying to 'find a way through'. And she described the shock of his sudden death, which came 'out of the blue'. Ivan was born with Ohtahara Syndrome, a rare brain disorder which left him in a wheelchair, needing to be fed through a tube and suffering from cerebral palsy and severe epileptic fits. He died aged six in 2009. Speaking days ahead of what would have been his 13th birthday on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said: 'It's true – it is a knock. You are exhausted. You become a part-time parent, nurser, carer, doctor.' Mrs Cameron recalled how within days of Ivan's birth she knew 'something wasn't quite right' because he was making 'funny, jerky movements'. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday – which pictured her at home in Downing Street with her husband and their other children – she said: 'It's your worst nightmare. They did a whole load of tests, they push the box of tissues towards you and you feel like you're in an episode of Casualty.' Mr Cameron said Ivan was a 'blessing in lots of ways' but admitted the strains he created on their life left them both 'falling apart'. He said: 'We both worked out that we could cope, and find a way through this' Dressed, fittingly, in a fleece, David Cameron took a break from the campaign trail yesterday to be photographed feeding a newborn, orphaned lamb. He cradled the young animal to feed it milk from a bottle after dropping in at Dean Lane Farm in his Witney constituency in Oxfordshire. At one point they were snuggled up so close that they were nuzzling each other’s faces. Inevitably, it prompted a flurry of comments on Twitter, several from Labour supporters, many of them unrepeatable and several referring to mint sauce. David Cameron took a break from the campaign trail yesterday to feed a newborn, orphaned lamb in Witney . The diagnosis had 'frightening' and 'scary' implications, she said, adding: 'It changes your life for ever. It's tough, lonely and isolating. You are terrified of not being able to cope.' She praised her 'amazing, strong and steady' husband and his 'sense that it's going to be OK'. Mr Cameron, in a separate interview with the Sunday Times, said Ivan was a 'blessing in lots of ways' but admitted the strains he created on their life left them both 'falling apart'. He said: 'It takes over your life. We both worked out that we could cope, and find a way through this.' In a frank admission of the pressures their son's condition had placed on their relationship, Mrs Cameron said: 'There's lots of people in our situation whose marriages don't survive. 'Looking after a disabled child pushes you to the limits of what you can cope with physically, emotionally. By the end of the first year we were totally shattered and pretty much at breaking point. Samantha Cameron . Samantha Cameron has said she would be ‘fine’ if her children copied her and got a tattoo. The Prime Minister’s wife has a leaping dolphin on her right foot which she had done during a gap year spent travelling in Indonesia following her A-levels. Asked how she would feel if her children followed her example, she told the Mail on Sunday: ‘I’d be fine about it. ‘Obviously you’d have to explain that they might not want it in certain places where it would be for ever. But no, I wouldn’t have any problem with them having a tattoo.’ 'The doctors realised we needed help. But as parents you have this feeling that you shouldn't ask for help.' She added that they were 'so, so proud' of Ivan, saying: 'He was very beautiful, one of the great gifts in our lives. A day when you haven't been to hospital, a day when he smiled, or a day when you haven't cried, becomes the most amazing day.' She described her battles with education bosses who tried to send Ivan to a mainstream school, before his parents secured him a place at a special needs school. 'Ivan had a feeding tube, very bad epilepsy. He couldn't sit up. He couldn't communicate at all. He needed to be somewhere more sensory and stimulating with people who knew how to look after him,' she said. His death came as a big shock. 'It was totally out of the blue and happened so quickly,' she said. 'It takes a long time before you see sunlight poking through the dark fog but never does the pain go as it's so connected to the love.' She said she still receives some bereavement counselling. Mr Cameron also spoke of Ivan's death: 'Your whole world collapses. You push pause on your life; you stop and have a think. Nothing really matters at that stage.' In her interview Mrs Cameron also revealed that her taste in music includes US psychedelic band Polica, whose latest album Shulamith has on its cover a topless woman with her back turned and her hair and neck covered in blood. Mrs Cameron saw the band perform in London when they toured Britain. The album is named after Canadian Marxist Shulamith Firestone, the author of The Dialectic Of Sex: The Case For A Feminist Revolution. Mrs Cameron also told of her embarrassment at being told Nancy and Elwen were having a 'huge pillow and duvet fight' when the family stayed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at her schloss near Berlin in 2013. This picture - from a new set of photographs showing the Camerons at home in Downing Street - has a clear message: That while the Prime Minister has been holding down the most important job in Britain for the past five years, he’s also made time to learn the all-important art of tying up his daughter’s hair for school. Showing that being left-handed is no handicap, he holds four-year-old Florence’s hair with one hand while brushing with the other. Behind them, the dishwasher looks suspiciously empty in the midst of the morning chaos inevitable in the home of any family of five, but reaching down to it provides the Prime Minister’s wife with an opportunity to show off her enviable figure . While this battered ministerial red box may have carried some of the most important documents in British history, as it lies around in the Cameron household it becomes the perfect toy. In this previously unseen 2011 family photograph of Florence as a toddler, she fits perfectly into the box as it sits perched on the yellow sofa from the Fancy Nancy range at sofaworks.com (£1,579). Tucked behind it appears to be a label from one of daddy’s trips to Brussels. And behind Florence, standing on the chest of drawers, is a Ribbon Copper Large Table Lamp from Habitat (£160) and a rattan tissue box cover (£26) from Oka . Breakfast and the family enjoy porridge – the pot is on the table in front of Mrs Cameron, who wears a cashmere grey, red and white Chinti and Parker sweater (£295). A box of Weetabix Organic is also just visible. The black mug is from Whittard, while the green chairs are by Knoll Saarinen, and cost £816 each. On the white marble breakfast table (£750 from amodernworld.co.uk) is a plastic tub containing toothbrushes, hairbrushes and nail scissors. There’s also a wicker basket containing Boots dietary supplements . This is our house! The Camerons’ children Elwen and Nancy in a photograph taken five years ago .

"Fort Hood victims are set to receive Purple Heart medals today - amid claims they are being denied crucial financial support. Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan opened fire on November 5, 2009, killing 13 men and women at the military post in Killeen, Texas, injuring 30 others before he was shot himself. Authorities initially classed the mass murder as ‘workplace violence’ but it has since been acknowledged that the attack was an act of terrorism - because it was inspired by a foreign terrorist group. Scroll down for video . Victim: Staff sergeant Shawn Manning was shot six times during the Fort Hood attack - but claims he is being denied vital financial support . Authorities initially classed the mass murder as ‘workplace violence’ but it has since been acknowledged that the attack was an act of terrorism . Earlier this year, it was ruled that victims will be honored with Purple Hearts - awarded in the name of the President to those wounded or killed, while serving. But one victim claims he is still going without certain benefits after the Military rejected his claims that his injuries were sustained in the line of duty, Fox News reported. Staff sergeant Shawn Manning, who was shot six times with two bullets still in his body, told Fox News: ‘I think it's almost unheard of for someone to receive the Purple Heart but not have their injuries deemed combat-related. Honor: Fort Hood victims are set to receive Purple Heart medals today . ‘I know that was not what Congress intended to have happen, but it is what currently the Army has determined is going to happen.’ Manning, who says he suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, applied to the Army in the hope his injuries would be recognised as having been sustained in the line of duty – but this was rejected by a physical evaluation board. A letter he received said that the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act did not offer combat benefits ‘for service members permanently disabled in attacks inspired or motivated by foreign terrorist organizations.’ He says the decision means his family will miss out on $800 a month in benefits – as well as back pay – and fears other survivors of the shooting rampage will be in a similar position. An Army spokeswoman told Fox News that Purple Heart Medal recipients would receive benefits ‘to which they are legally entitled’ under the terms of the National Defense Authorization Act 2015. She added: ‘In the case at issue, no final decision has been rendered, and the Soldier will have a full opportunity to present evidence at a formal hearing.’ It is now known that prior to the attack, Hasan had exchanged emails with Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda spokesman. Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan opened fire on November 5, 2009, killing 13 men and women at the military post in Killeen, Texas, injuring 30 others before he was shot himself . Hasan (pictured) was convicted by a military judge in 2013 in the killings, and he recommended the death penalty . Al-Awlaki praised Hasan's actions after the shooting, writing; 'Nidal Hassan is a hero. 'He is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people. ... The U.S. is leading the war against terrorism which in reality is a war against Islam.'

Gabbard's report says that Kimmel was ordered to stop, but instead dismounted and ran away wearing only a brown hat, jeans and boots. Trooper Gababrd launched a manhunt for Kimmel and later found him on horseback again and according to the FloydCountyTimes, he resisted arrest, saying, 'I didn't do s***, I was just riding my horse.' According to the arrest report, Kimmel would not take a sobriety test and refused a breath and blood alcohol test. However, officers said he had slurred speech, smelt of alcohol and was unsteady on his feet. “Subject made threats to ‘[expletive] [expletive] up driving drunk in a car next time and he would give me something to worry about,’” the arrest citation quotes Kimmel as saying. Kimmel, who has used the alias “Mike Bicycle,” is currently on probation for a prior conviction for burglary. He is currently+ in the Floyd County jail on $5000 cash bond.

"The girlfriend of a teenager with a life-threatening tumour has spoken of how his condition has left him paralysed and unable to dress himself. Jahnae Jackson has put her psychology studies on hold in order to care for her long-term boyfriend, Jackson Byrnes after he was diagnosed with a stage four brain tumour four weeks ago. The 18-year-olds from northern NSW have raised over $80,000 from community generosity for his life-saving surgery to be performed on Wednesday by renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Charlie Teo. 'He's already paralysed and I have to help him do many things, including dress him' Jahnae told Daily Mail Australia. Jackson's girlfriend Jahnae Jackson (right) noticed he had developed a lump three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI . For the past week Jackson and girlfriend have been desperately raising the sum needed to pay the hospital . Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for specialist who was willing . Three weeks ago Jackson was told by doctors that the tumour was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for a specialist who was willing to perform Jackson's urgent surgery and that's when she found Dr. Charlie Teo from The Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. 'I had to be positive for Jackson as I knew there was always a way to help,' she said. On Monday morning they reached the target on their GoFundMe page, and although they still need an additional $45,000 to cover chemotherapy and other hospital fees, they are overwhelmed by the community support from the small town of Casino in northern NSW. 'It's absolutely unbelievable that a small town can do so much,' Jahnae said. 'It makes us feel so much better.' Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. 'I was devastated when I found out, but I couldn't really react,' she said. The 18-year-old completed school at the end of last year and admits she wanted to go to university to study psychology or social work but has put it off due to Jackson's condition. 'I'd rather help my boyfriend out and worry about university later,' she said. Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation and instead wants to get it over and done with . After desperately fundraising for a week and finally reaching his goal, Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation. 'I just want to get in there and get it over and done with,' Jackson told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm just really thankful to the community as I didn't think we would raise this much money, it all happened so quickly.' Dr Teo, director of Sydney's Centre for Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery, said other surgeons were technically able to perform the surgery but he was the only one prepared to do it. 'People think that it's futile because he's got a malignant tumour and it's very aggressive,' Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's significant weakness down his left side and they think his quality of life is such that he wouldn't want to live anyway.' But Dr Teo said he makes decisions based on what his patients want. For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront for the risky surgery . Jackson Byrnes was diagnosed with a stage four tumour three weeks ago and needed $80,000 for surgery . Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page, but said the family still needed more . 'If a patient really wants it and knows the risks and understands how risky the operation is I'll usually respect the patient's wishes,' he said . 'He is a lovely boy and he's only young. 'I said ""You know you're going to be paralysed"", I've told him the worst case scenario. 'He understands that and he wants to live.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain. Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard. Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed . Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday . 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads. 'It is not a time to be enduring a fight for your life.' Victorian finance, leasing and risk management company Morris Finance have made the largest donation to the cause by pledging $2000. Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday. 'He needs to get some scans on Tuesday and then they will schedule his surgery for the next day,' she said.

"President Barack Obama is calling for an end to psychiatric therapy treatments aimed at changing the sexual orientation or gender identity of gay, lesbian and transgender youth. The move comes in response to an online petition posted on the White House website following the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn. The petition currently has over 120,000 signatures. The transgender teen committed suicide in December and left behind writings mentioning religious therapy. End to conversion therapy: President Barack Obama is calling for an end to psychiatric therapy treatments aimed at changing the sexual orientation or gender identity of gay, lesbian and transgender youth . The petition: The move comes in response to an online petition posted on the White House website following the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn with over 120,000 signatures . In a statement late Wednesday, White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said the administration supports banning so-called conversion therapy treatments for minors. 'We share your concern about its potentially devastating effects on the lives of transgender as well as gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer youth,' Jarrett said. 'The overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrates that conversion therapy, especially when it is practiced on young people, is neither medically nor ethically appropriate and can cause substantial harm.' The White House is not explicitly calling for Congressional legislation to ban the therapies nationwide. But Jarrett's statement highlighted states that have outlawed the practice and expressed hope that there will be broader action. The White House says lawmakers in 18 states have introduced legislation similar to measures already in place in California, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. The laws ban licensed professionals from using conversion therapy on minors. The American Psychiatric Association has long opposed conversion therapy, which the organization says is based on the assumption that homosexuality is a mental disorder. Suicide: Leelah Alcorn's (pictured) death spurred the White House petition with many signatures . Alcorn, the Ohio teen whose death spurred the White House petition, had gained an online following through her Tumblr posts. She wrote about depression and isolation, lamented that her life would only get worse, and expressed frustration that her parents wanted her to be 'their perfect little straight Christian boy.' She said she was taken to 'Christian therapists' who were 'very biased.' Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, welcomed Obama's statement. 'Having President Obama and the weight of the White House behind efforts to ban conversion therapy is so critical in the fight for transgender and LGB young people,' Keisling said in a statement. 'My hope is that when a transgender person's struggle is acknowledged by one of the most recognizable figures in the world, it positively changes the way they view themselves. The pseudo-science that propels conversion therapy cannot match the self-acceptance that comes with this kind of change'","President Barack Obama is calling for an end to psychiatric therapy treatments aimed at turning gays into heterosexuals .

"A Russian-Ukrainian film about a legendary Soviet sniper nicknamed 'Lady Death' is aiming to be a hit in both nations despite the crisis that has turned the former allies against each other. Titled 'Battle for Sevastopol' in Russia but 'Indestructible' across the border in Ukraine, the movie – about a female sharpshooter who reportedly killed more than 300 Nazi troops – is a co-production between the two countries made just before relations nosedived. And despite the freeze in ties between the former Soviet nations that has seen Ukraine ban a slew of modern Russian films, the $5million (£3m) movie was launched last week with glitzy gala premieres in both Moscow and Kiev. Scroll down for video . Nazi killer: A Russian-Ukrainian film about legendary Soviet sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko (left) who was nicknamed nicknamed 'Lady Death' is aiming to be a hit in both nations despite the current crisis. The film (right) is titled 'Battle for Sevastopol' in Russia but 'Indestructible' across the border in Ukraine . Will it bring unity? The movie – about the female sharpshooter who reportedly killed more than 300 Nazi troops – is a co-production between the two countries made just before relations nosedived . Director Sergei Mokritsky, who grew up in Ukraine but lives in Russia, told AFP: 'Despite everything, it has been accepted both by the new Ukrainian authorities and our Russian ones. 'I am hoping this film will unite people and at least for two hours, for the length of this film, people can come together in our shared history.' The Russian-language film is about Ukrainian-born sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko – nicknamed 'Lady Death' – and comes out ahead of the 70th anniversary in May of the Allied victory in the European theatre of World War Two. Trained as a sharpshooter and sent to fight on the frontline in 1941, aged 25, Pavlichenko was said to have killed 309 Nazis in less than a year during battles in Odessa and the strategic city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. Hard-hitting biopic: Russian actors Yevgeny Tsyganov (left) and Yulia Peresild (right), who plays Ukrainian-born sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko are seen in a still from Sergei Mokritsky's 'Battle of Sevastopol' film . Bringing together a shared history: The Russian-language film (above) comes out ahead of the 70th anniversary in May of the Allied victory in the European theatre of World War Two . Heroine: Pavlichenko was said to have killed 309 Nazis in less than a year during battles in Odessa and the strategic city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula during World War Two . Lyudmila Pavlichenko was sent to the frontline in 1941 at the age of 25 after being trained as a sniper. An unyielding character, she is said to have killed no fewer than 309 Nazis during the sieges of Odessa and later the strategic city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. It is said she once lambasted a fellow sniper for firing a shot than ended the agony of a dying Nazi, saying: 'They don't deserve an easy death.' She then falls for a fellow sniper and the couple plan to marry, but she is devastated when he, too, is killed. Finally she is evacuated from Sevastopol after getting injured, soon before the Nazis captured the strategic city in 1942. Sensing her propaganda value, the Soviet Union then sent her to tour Canada and the United States, where she called for the opening of a new front in the war. Dressed in an army tunic and cap, she became an object of fascination, nicknamed 'Lady Death' by journalists. She met American First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and was invited to stay at the White House as a personal guest. The women stayed in touch and Roosevelt met her again years later in Moscow. The new biopic was shot on location in Sevastopol in November and December 2013 during the Maidan popular uprising in Kiev, shortly before the toppling of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych and Russia's annexation of Crimea. 'I thought we can't stop filming, whatever happens,' Mokritsky recalled. 'The faster, the better, because later, it may not be possible.' The differing titles for the film highlight some of the bitterest divisions between Russia and Ukraine. In Russian, the title 'Battle for Sevastopol' resonates with the patriotic fervour generated by Crimea's annexation in March last year. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian name 'Indestructible' hints at the national spirit as government forces battle a pro-Russian uprising in the country's east. As played by Yulia Peresild, the film's heroine is unsmiling and unremittingly tough. 'War's no place for cowards,' she says. She vows to ""kill 100 enemies"", hugging her rifle and upbraids a fellow sniper for firing a shot to finish off a Nazi dying in agony. ""They don't deserve an easy death,"" she says. In graphic battle scenes with blood spurting and shells exploding, she shoots to kill without flinching. But she has a softer side, too. She finds love in the arms of a tough commander, who is killed soon afterwards. She then falls for a fellow sniper and the couple plan to marry, but she is devastated when he, too, is killed. Finally she gets injured and is evacuated from Sevastopol, soon before the Nazis captured the strategic city in 1942. The next stage in Pavlichenko's life is far from the horrors of the frontline. Sensing her propaganda value, the Soviet Union sent her to tour Canada and the United States, where she called for the opening of a new front in the war. Dressed in an army tunic and cap, she became an object of fascination, nicknamed 'Lady Death' by journalists. Pavlichenko was trained as a sharpshooter and sent to fight on the frontline in 1941 at the age of 25 . She met American First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and was invited to stay at the White House as a personal guest. The women stayed in touch and Roosevelt met her again years later in Moscow. In the film, she reveals her emotional turmoil while cooking borscht with a motherly Roosevelt, played by British actress Joan Blackham. The film comes hot on the heels of the global smash directed by Clint Eastwood about a U.S. Navy Seal sharpshooter 'American Sniper'. Critics have lauded the vivid photography in the Ukrainian-Russian film, but complain that Pavlichenko does not come across as a fully-rounded character. 'She faces all these events with the same tense expression,' wrote Gazeta.ru news site. As for the two governments now locked in a bitter feud, both say they are rooting for the film to be a success - just not quite for the same reasons. 'We see it as a Ukrainian film,' a spokesman for Kiev's state film agency told AFP, saying that 79 percent of the film's financing is Ukrainian, both from the state and private investors. Meanwhile in Russia, an unusually conciliatory Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said he hoped the movie might remind the rivals of when they fought side by side. 'It's very important today that it's a Ukrainian-Russian co-production. This is a film about our shared victory,' Medinsky said. SIEGE OF ODESSA: . The Ukrainian city of Odessa was subjected to an unrelenting aerial bombardment by the Nazis and their Axis allies in June 1941. Surrounded on three sides, it was anticipated that Soviet forces would succumb quickly, but a channel via the Black Sea allowed for supplies and reinforcements to make their way into the city. A second onslaught began in mid-August, but was forced to halt around a week later for a few days because of heavy casualties at the hands of the Red Army. Heavy artillery: German troops during the siege of Odessa against the Soviet army in World War Two . Soviet soldiers march through a muddy field near Odessa . However, by September 15, Soviet troops began to fall back towards the city and by early October, Moscow ordered a retreat. In the first two weeks of October, more than 120,000 troops were evacuated, along with 1,000 trucks and 20,000 tons of ammunition. On October 15, Romanian troops – part of the Axis alliance – entered the city. The Romanians lost nearly 18,000 troops while the Soviet Union lost around 16,000. Source: World War II Database . BATTLE FOR SEVASTOPOL: . Sevastopol, a key port city on the Black Sea, came under attack from five Nazis divisions, supported by Luftwaffe bombardments, in May 1942. Soviet troops were battered by up to 1,800 aerial sorties a day and were outnumbered by two to one on the ground. The Soviet Coastal Army, led by General I.E. Petrov, mustered 106,000 men, 600 artillery guns, 100 mortars and 38 tanks. German sappers at Sevastopol, where a massive siege was launched against the Soviet Red Army . The Germans, meanwhile, assembled 204,000 men, 670 artillery guns, 720 mortars, 655 anti-tank guns, 450 tanks and 600 aircraft. By the end of June, the Germans fought their way into the city and an evacuation of Russian forces in the city was ordered on June 30, lasting for four days. By the end of the siege, 90,000 Russian prisoners had been taken and they lost the equivalent of two armies.

"Hidden along a dusty dirt track across several miles of scenic hills, it was formerly home to a post office, a grocery store and even a school house. But now,  Evansville in Comanche County, Kansas, is a shadow of its former self, with its once-thriving commissary building in a state of disrepair. However, the ghost town is still home to two final residents, who tend to the site's numerous cattle - rancher Larry 'Dee' Scherich and his wife, Phyllis. The couple, who live in a house just north of the historic commissary building, do not have to worry about unexpected visitors, nor noisy neighbors. Instead, they encounter only hired workers in the town, which  previously housed the headquarters of the largest cattle ranch in Kansas's history. Remote: It was home to a post office, a grocery store and even a school house in the 1870s and 80s. But now, Evansville in Comanchea County, Kansas, is a shadow of its former self, with its once-thriving commissary building (pictured today) in a state of disrepair . Deserted: Horse harnesses hang empty from the roof of the commissary's stables, while the building's wooden walls are falling apart . No neighbors: However, the ghost town is still home to two final residents - rancher Larry 'Dee' Scherich and his wife, Phyllis (pictured) Rancher: The couple, who live in a house just north of the commissary building, do not have to worry about unexpected visitors, nor noisy neighbors. Above, Mr Scherich talks about the features of the historic commissary building at the deadtown site of Evansville . Long gone: Cattle graze where the former Evansville school house was located, near the beautiful - but mostly treeless - Gypsum Hills . On a regular basis, the Scheriches hike up to a springs, situated near the mostly treeless Gypsum Hills, with their stunning views, canyons and buttes . Here, wild animals and insects continue to drink the natural spring water that still flows at the now-deserted site. 'With no trees to speak of, trees by a springs would have been real respite,' Mrs Scherich told The Hutchinson News. Referring to Evansville itself, which likely began its life as a town in the late 1870s, she added: 'By 1910, there was not much left.' Indeed, the town once boasted a ranch house and a commissary building after four ranchers moved to the area in the 1870s and early 1880s. The men, named as Jess Evans, Wylie Payne, Richard Phillips and Major Andrew Drum, set up an enormous cattle ranch in the region after an Army order banned Texas cattle drives from crossing the Oklahoma Strip, according to the book, Kansas: The Priceless Prairie, by author Mary Einsel. The operation, dubbed the Comanche Pool, which was based at Evans's ranch, began with 26,000 head of cattle. In subsequent years, the area grew into a town, with its own post office, grocery store and other buildings. It even had its own hotel with 'easy access to all cattle camps in the Territory'. Historic: The Scheriches encounter only hired help in the town, which previously housed the headquarters of the largest cattle ranch in Kansas's history. Above, Mrs Scherich believes the middle portion of this house was one of the original buildings in the ghost town . Saved: Four ranchers moved to the area in the 1870s and early 1880s and set up an enormous ranch, dubbed the Comanche Pool. Above, Mr Scherich has kept pieces of barbed wire used in the town, including the wire used by the Comanche Pool's ranchers . Still life: On a regular basis, the Scheriches hike up to a springs (pictured), situated near the picturesque Gypsum Hills, with their stunning views, canyons and buttes. Here, wild animals and insects continue to drink the natural spring water that still flows at the site . Contrast: This photo shows several of the many cowboys employed by the Comanche Pool in Comanche County during the 1880s . The Evansville Herald, which started publishing in October 1885, reported on a prospering town with around 40 residents and several businessmen. However, in 1884, a large portion of Comanche County - where the ranchers had used land 'unofficially' - was bought by settlers for $1.25 an acre. In following years, as the herd law was enacted (forcing ranchers to fence their cattle) and the winters became harsher, the Comanche Pool dissolved. But Evansville continued to grow, David Webb, of Kansas Heritage Center, writes in his and co-author Alzina Baker's book, Comanche County History. A nearby post office moved into the town, a sorghum mill reportedly opened and by November 1886, residents were hoping for a railroad. 'We all want a railroad and now is the time to get one,' the editor of The Evansville Herald apparently wrote at the time, adding: 'We may never have a better chance.' However, several years later, the newspaper had shut down due to lack of profit, while the commissary building and its post office shortly closed. Sawed logs: The historic commissary building was built using rough sawed logs and wood that workers notched to fit (pictured today) Co-manager: Mrs Sherich is pictured looking up inside the commissary. She now manages Merrill Ranch in the town with her husband . Today, horse harnesses hang empty from the roof of the building's ruined stables, while the commissary's wooden log structures are falling apart. In front of the building, broken-off posts stick up from the ground - and a boardwalk that used to be bustling with residents is long gone. 'I'd love to have someone restore it,' Mrs Scherich said of the commissary, adding: 'It would be expensive. I should have done it 20 years ago.' Mr Scherich moved to Evansville with his parents in the 1940s to manage Merrill Ranch - long after the town had been deserted by most ranchers. Although he left the ranch to teach at Inman High School for several years, he eventually returned to the site with Mrs Scherich in 1976. They now manage the ranch and its cattle together.","Town of Evansville in Comanche County was the headquarters of largest cattle ranch in Kansas's history in 1880s .

"In an unprecedented move, Russia has cancelled the release of a Hollywood thriller set in the Stalin era - claiming it distorts history and would air as the country celebrates its victory over Nazi Germany. The film, 'Child 44', starring Tom Hardy, Vincent Cassel and Gary Oldman, tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the Stalin era. It is based on a novel by British writer Tom Rob Smith and was due to premiere in Russia today. Scroll down for video . Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Child 44, starring Gary Oldman (left) and Tom Hardy . The Hollywood blockbuster tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in Stalin era Russia . Russia's culture ministry said the film distorted history as it celebrated its victory over Nazi Germany . Russia's culture ministry said the film's distributors in Russia, Central Partnership, had agreed to withdraw a request for a distribution licence after ministry officials viewed the film. 'Films such as 'Child 44' should not go out in our country on mass release, earning money from our cinema audiences, not in the year of the 70th anniversary of victory, not ever,' Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky wrote on the ministry's website. The move to effectively ban a major mainstream Hollywood film just a day before it was due to premiere is unprecedented. In recent years, Russia has cracked down harshly on negative depictions of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, while criticism of those who fought in the Second World War is taboo. The culture ministry accused the film of 'distortion of historical facts and the idiosyncratic treatment of events before, during and after' the war. The film is set in 1952, a year before Stalin's death, and features a maverick investigator seeking a serial killer, while hindered by official attitudes that such murders are not possible in the Soviet Union. Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky (pictured) condemned the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime . 'You realise murder is strictly a capitalist disease,' French star Cassel hisses in a thick Russian accent in the film's English-language trailer. Culture minister Medinsky slammed the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime and said it misrepresented a country that was 'one of the world leaders'. The film shows Soviet Army officers as 'blood-thirsty ghouls' randomly shooting people, 'especially gays,' Medinsky complained. Soviet women have to offer them sexual favours or 'be sent, as is customary, to the Gulag,' he added with heavy irony. The decision to pull the film came after the culture ministry on Tuesday gave it a distribution licence with an 18+ certificate. The head of Central Partnership, Pavel Stepanov, issued a statement saying he was 'satisfied' with the film's ban. 'We consider it's important in the future to increase state control over distribution of films that have a socially significant context,' he said. On Tuesday, Kultura state-funded arts newspaper, whose editor is a member of President Vladimir Putin's arts council, published a review of the film titled '44 shades of vileness.' 'Daniel Espinosa's film is made up of lies and spitting at Russia and Russians,' it wrote. Earlier this year the outspoken culture minister voiced his dislike of Russian art-house film 'Leviathan,' despite its landmark victory at the Golden Globes and Oscar nomination, complaining it was full of 'existentialist hopelessness.' Last month he sacked the head of a theatre in Siberia after its radical staging of a Wagner opera including images of Jesus Christ angered some Orthodox believers.","Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Hollywood's Child 44 .

"A leading Australian military adviser who worked for the federal government, the RAAF and Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove in East Timor has been arrested in the US on child pornography charges. Dr Adam Cobb was taken into custody on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for receipt and distribution of child pornography after allegedly uploading images of child pornography to the social networking site, Tumblr. If convicted he faces 20 years' jail in the US. Dr Adam Cobb was taken into custody on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for receipt and distribution of child pornography after allegedly uploading images of child pornography to the social networking site, Tumblr . The 45-year-old was in the US working as a research professor and director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island. Cobb took up the position at the US Naval War College in June last year after holding senior military and government roles in Australia and the US, including a recent strategic policy and planning position at US Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida. 'I can confirm that he was a civilian employee and director of the Mahan Advanced Research Project at the US Naval War College,' Captain Christopher Dicomitis, a Rhode Island State Police detective, told AAP on Sunday. Cobb appeared in the US District Court in Providence on Friday and was refused bail. An investigation began in January when The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children reported an individual in Rhode Island had uploaded child pornography to Tumblr. The internet connection at Cobb's Portsmouth home was identified as the origin of the images. Cobb was in the US working as a  director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island after holding senior military and government roles in Australia, including the RAAF . Laptops and mobile phones were seized from his home, while photos and videos of two females were also discovered on a storage device and a computer allegedly belonging to Cobb. Educated at the University of Sydney, Australian National University and University of Cambridge, Cobb built a reputation as a leading military thinker. According to his biography on the US Naval War College website, Cobb worked on the 1999-2000 East Timor crisis with Major General Cosgrove, who at the time was commander of the international peacekeeping mission. 'Overall, my commanders and I found Dr Cobb's work a valuable contribution to our understanding of important issues before us,' Maj Gen Cosgrove wrote in a review of Cobb's work as lead analyst for the Australian Parliament Defence Office. In Australia he was special-director, strategic policy with the RAAF; senior defence adviser for the Australian parliament; an Australian parliamentary fellow; and research fellow at Australian National University's strategic and defence studies centre. Cobb has also worked at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC and was on the staff of former speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.

"It is one of the most prestigious honors bestowed upon journalists and people in the arts. And today, the Pulitzer prize for journalism went to The Post and Courier newspaper of Charleston, South Carolina  - which has a tiny staff of just 80 and a daily circulation of 85,000. The paper's powerful photo series entitled 'Till Death Do Us Part,' on domestic violence scooped the top award for its exploration into why South Carolina is among the deadliest states  for women. Scroll down for video . Winner: This iconic photo by New York Times photographer Daniel Berehulak, was part of a winning series, and shows James Dorbor, 8, suspected of being infected with Ebola, being carried by medical staff to an Ebola treatment center in Monrovia, Liberia . Death: This photograph released by the Pulitzer Board on 20 April 2015 shows one of the winning photographs by Daniel Berehulak who won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography . The newspaper was awarded the gold medal for public service, the first time in five years that the prize has gone to such a small newspaper. Last year, the award went to The Washington Post and The Guardian for their coverage of National Security Agency documents leaked by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden. Executive editor Mitch Pugh said reporters saw annual statistics which ranked South Carolina as the state where the most women are killed by men, according to The New York Times. 'The discussion around the table in the newsroom was why is that. We've written about it every year, but we've never done the deep dive.' The small newspaper's photographs were just one of many by news organizations which looked at the key news events which gripped the nation and international community over the past year. Some of the most vivid portraits came from the New York Times which ran a series of heartbreaking images of the Ebola outbreak as it gripped countries in West Africa. The newspaper won three Pulitzer prizes for international reporting and feature photography for its coverage of the West Africa Ebola outbreak. The Pulitzer committee at Columbia University in New York said The New York Times staff shared the prize for international reporting for its coverage of the deadly Ebola epidemic in west Africa. New York Times reporter Eric Lipton took the prize for investigative reporting on the influence of lobbyists. And freelance photographer for the paper, Daniel Berehulak, won the feature photography award for his Ebola coverage. Heartbreaking: This September 18, 2014, photo by New York Times photographer Daniel Berehulak, part of a winning series, shows Eric Gweah, 25, weeping as a burial team removes the body of his 62-year-old father, who died at home, arms thrashing and blood spewing from his mouth, in front of his sons after being turned away at the treatment centers in Monrovia, Liberia .

"The funeral of South Carolina police shooting victim Walter Scott took on a fiery tone today when the pastor presiding over the service said his death was 'motivated by racial discrimination'. Dr George Hamilton, the Chief Apostle of the W.O.R.D. Ministries in Summerville, South Carolina, launched an attack on officer Michael Slager, who killed Scott last week by shooting him five times in the back, referring to him as a 'disgrace'. Hundreds of mourners were crammed inside the small church today, where Scott's casket, draped in an American flag, was led in, accompanied by his distraught mother. The family had a police escort to the funeral. Hamilton continued to rail against Slager, who has been jailed and charged with Scott's murder, during the service. Referring to the cell phone video which shows Scott being gunned down as he tried to run from Slager, he said: 'It's one thing to have a loved one die... It's another to have to watch them die... and see how they died'. Scroll down for videos .

According to ABC News, he continued: 'Walter's death was motivated by racial discrimination. You've got to hate somebody to shoot them in the back. 'This officer is a disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department... You don't tase a man and then shoot him.A badge is not authority to murder.' Hamilton did add that Slager's actions were not representative of all law enforcement, insisting 'We will not indict the entire law enforcement for the act of one racist'. Judy Scott, Walter's mother, was among the hundreds of mourners at the service today, arriving with other family members in a fleet of black limousines to the service for Scott, 50, who was a father of four. Scott, a former coast guard, had been married twice and was engaged to be married to a third woman before he was pulled over for a broken tail light by Slager, who shot him five times in the back after a confrontation in North Charleston. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. U.S. senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. After the funeral Rep. Clyburn, said he wanted national strategies and standards for law enforcement to be considered. Referring to the suggestion that officers be made to wear body-mounted cameras, he said: 'Body cameras are a good start. They're certainly not a panacea'. In an obituary Scott's family focused on his love for his friends and family, devotion to God, and appreciation for the Dallas Cowboys. At a wake yesterday his casket had also been adorned with Cowboys memorabilia. The obituary said: 'Walter was born in February 9, 1965 native of Charleston, SC area. He attended the Charleston County School System. He proudly served his country by enlisting in the National Coast Guard in 1984 where he was stationed in Baltimore, Maryland. 'He received his massage therapist degree from Miller Motte in 2006. He leaves to mourn loving parents, Elder Walter and Minister Judy G Scott, two brothers Anthony N. Scott and Rodney E.

'Walter loved the Lord; and he expressed it by singing in the choir. He loved all of his family and friends and often embraced others as family. He was a true fan of the Dallas Cowboys.' Scott worked as a forklift truck driver and had served in the Coast Guard in the 1980s. Police escorted a hearse headed towards W.O.R.D. Ministries in Summerville, South Carolina. Mourners waited through light rain as flowers were unloaded and taken to the sanctuary. His family, with a police escort, arrived at the church around 11am in a fleet of three black limousines. Dozens of mourners who were lined up outside the church held up their cellphones trying to capture the scene as Scott's casket was unloaded from the hearse and wheeled into the church.

Local dignitaries: U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn (left, D-SC) attended the funeral, as did Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon (right) Embrace: Two funeral attendees embrace in the rain during the funeral for Scott, held a week after he was shot dead . Tributes: Men carry flowers into the church where Scott's service is being held today. An obituary praised his loving nature and generosity towards family and friends . Sadness: Mourners in Summerville leaned on one another ahead of the service for Scott, who has four children aged 16-24 . The family said they decided to keep the press away after the New York Daily News reported that they had banned Al Sharpton from the funeral - a claim the family and Sharpton have refuted. A wake for Scott was held yesterday, at which his open casket was on display and adorned with Dallas Cowboys memorabilia. At the time he was stopped, Scott owed some $18,000 in child support payments, which family said may have been why he tried to run from Slager. His brother, Rodney Scott, said: 'He had trouble keeping up with the payments, that's all, and he knew he would go to jail. 'His mission was to avoid the police as much as possible.' Dash cam video from Slager's patrol car has shown him pulling over Scott, who got out of his car and ran while the officer's back was turned. Court records show Scott last paid child support in 2012 and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued in early 2013. Scott had been in jail three times since 2008. Rodney Scott said his brother would take long detours while driving to their parents' house because he thought there were more police patrolling the direct, 10-minute route from his home. He said Walter also tried to make sure any vehicle he drove had working headlights and taillights. Some of the city's black residents have told similar stories about being stopped by police over minor infractions or simply avoiding police altogether. Killing: Scott was gunned down as he ran away from Sager, who has since been charged with his murder . Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was in the Coast Guard for two years, and is pictured left in uniform. Slager is being held in jail on murder charges, and is pictured right in his prison mugshot . It emerged yesterday that Scott had also been jailed in 1987 on a charge of assault and battery. A report released by the Charleston County Sheriff's Department on Friday said they had to break up a fight between Scott and another man, during which he shoved a deputy to the floor. Despite Scott's record, those who knew him remember Scott as lighthearted and gentle. They describe a laid-back, fun-loving man who took his girlfriend dancing on weekends, entertained family and friends with backyard cookouts and hosted regular domino games. 'This is a long time coming, but now that it has come all of those things have to be recognized. It's so sad that it happened like that because a lot of this stuff has been on the backburner for a long time,' Ernest Murray, 73, said during Scott's wake. 'He wouldn't hurt a fly, man,' said Ronald Smith, 29, a co-worker who often got advice on marriage and other life decisions from Scott when the older man gave him a lift home after their shift. 'All of us looked up to him.'","Service for Scott, 50, in Summerville, South Carolina, was attended by hundreds of mourners .
