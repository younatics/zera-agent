"(CNN)If that was a tornado, it was one monster of one. Luckily, so far it looks like no one was hurt. With tornadoes touching down near Dallas on Sunday, Ryan Shepard snapped a photo of a black cloud formation reaching down to the ground. He said it was a tornado. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it looked half a mile wide. More like a mile, said Jamie Moore, head of emergency management in Johnson County, Texas. It could have been one the National Weather Service warned about in a tweet as severe thunderstorms drenched the area, causing street flooding. ""To repeat--tornadoes (yes, two) likely W and E of Rio Vista. The one to the E of Rio Vista is a large, damaging tornado,"" the NWS tweeted. Luckily, it tore through countryside, and there have been no reports of deaths. But surveyors had not been out to check for damage or casualties overnight because the weather was so bad, Moore said. There are reports of damage -- including many roofs ripped off -- in Rio Vista and Grandview, both outliers of Fort Worth. On social media, images circulated of flipped 18-wheelers. Tempestuous clouds created dangerous, awe-inspiring funnels and disks as a front swept through. Residents reported hail the size of softballs and posted photos as proof.","Surveyors did not check for damage or casualties overnight due to bad weather .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Four months after the end of the massive Occupy protests that clogged Hong Kong's streets in a bid for greater voting rights, another confrontation is heating up in the former British colony. The flashpoint? A controversial Beijing-backed election proposal tabled Wednesday that pro-democracy legislators have already sworn to veto, describing it as ""ridiculous."" In a speech before the city's legislature, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam said that if approved, the proposal would give Hong Kongers the right to vote for their next leader in 2017. The catch, of course, is candidates would have to be approved by a mostly pro-China committee. Dissenting pro-democracy legislators wearing black marched from the chamber as soon as Lam's speech ended. Some legislators raised yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the Occupy movement. ""Their fake universal suffrage is an insult to everybody's intelligence; that's why we refused to stay in the chamber."" Hong Kong Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau told CNN. Lau said that she and other pro-democracy candidates would cast votes to ensure it does not become law. Hong Kong has become increasingly polarized over the last few years as the city fights over what kind of political system it should have as a Special Administrative Region of China. According to the agreement signed by the United Kingdom that returned the city to Chinese control in 1997, Hong Kong would receive 50 years of ""high autonomy"" under an arrangement called ""One Country, Two Systems."" Part of that deal included establishing an election system based on the principles of universal suffrage. But nearly eighteen years after the handover, the city continues to fight over what universal suffrage really means. Hong Kong's leaders argue its latest proposal fulfills the long-awaited promise of universal suffrage by giving each resident the right to cast a vote. All that's left is for the legislature to approve the proposal, and then everyone can go home happy, they say. Pro-democracy Hong Kongers beg to differ. ""If it is a genuine election, people should be free to stand and people should be free to vote,"" said Lau. ""Now all you have is a vote, and the candidates must be vetted by a committee consisting of business and political elites. It's horrendous. ""To say the majority of Hong Kongers want to support this nonsensical package is a blatant lie.. If nothing is changed, we will definitely vote it down."" To become law, the proposal must receive the support of two thirds of Hong Kong's 70 legislators. But Lau and 26 other pro-democracy legislators make up more than a third of the chamber, meaning they can veto the bill. If they do, then the city's electoral reform process will effectively return to square one. Hong Kong's leadership has warned pro-democracy legislators against the veto, saying the city might never again receive a chance for political reform. ""We must strive for consensus,"" Lam told legislators. ""We sincerely hope the pan-democrats abandon their passive attitude."" But consensus seems unlikely. Hong Kong and Chinese leaders have repeatedly said there is no room for the proposal to change. In response, Lau and other pro-democracy legislators will launch a citywide campaign this weekend to rally public opinion against the proposal. And she did not rule out the possibility of a repeat of last year's massive street protests. ""Should people decide to resort to civil disobedience again, its up to them,"" she said. ""Whatever we do, our struggle must be peaceful, orderly, nonviolent. And we will do our best."" Wayne Chang and CNN's Vivian Kam contributed reporting.","Reform proposal would give Hong Kongers right to vote for their next leader in 2017 .

"(CNN)Australia has recalled its ambassador to Indonesia for consultations after two Australians were among eight drug smugglers executed by firing squad early Wednesday. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called the executions ""cruel and unnecessary"" because both men, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, had been ""fully rehabilitated"" during a decade in prison. Abbott didn't say what permanent actions, if any, would be taken against Indonesia. ""This is a dark moment in the relationship, but I'm sure the relationship will be restored,"" he said. One of the men's Indonesian lawyers, Todung Mulya Lubis tweeted his apologies. ""I failed. I lost,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."" Indonesian President Joko Widodo appeared to shrug off the diplomatic recall, telling reporters that ""our legal sovereignty must be respected. We also respect other countries' legal sovereignty."" Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said the country had no plans to recall its own ambassador in response. ""This is a legal case. This is not a political case so at this very stage, we do not have any plan to call our ambassador back from Canberra,"" he said. Six other inmates were executed, including Nigerians Raheem Salami, Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Okwudil Oyatanze and Martin Anderson; Indonesian Zainal Abidin and Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, who was said to be mentally ill. On Wednesday, Brazil's foreign ministry released a statement expressing ""deep sadness"" at Gularte's execution, saying that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff had urged her Indonesian counterpart to spare him due to his ""psychiatric condition."" Gularte is the second Brazilian to be executed in Indonesia this year, with the first -- Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira -- prompting the country to recall its ambassador for consultations. The Indonesian government had originally announced that nine prisoners would be executed, but at the last moment Filipina Mary Jane Veloso was spared. ""We are so happy, so happy. I thought I had lost my daughter already but God is so good. Thank you to everyone who helped us,"" her mother Celia Veloso told CNN. Philippines embassy officials said Veloso would be returned to Yogyakarta prison in Central Java later on Wednesday. No reason was given for the reprieve but it may relate to developments in her case late on Tuesday. CNN Philippines reported that Veloso's alleged recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio and her partner Julius Lacanilao, surrendered to authorities. The report said Sergio had denied all accusations in relation to Veloso's case. Veloso's lawyers claimed the mother-of-two was the victim of human trafficking. They say she was offered work in Malaysia, but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and wasn't aware the bag she'd been given for the return journey to Indonesia was filled with drugs. A tenth prisoner, Frenchman Serge Atlaoui, was also scheduled to be executed but his case was delayed while a court considers a legal challenge. Candlelight vigils were held for Chan and Sukumaran in the hours ahead of the expected execution. The men's legal teams had been fighting for years for a stay, but it wasn't to be. The men -- then aged in their early twenties -- were arrested in 2005 as part of the ""Bali Nine,"" a drug smuggling gang that intended to import 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of heroin from Bali to Australia. They failed. The pair were transported with other prisoners to Indonesia's so-called ""execution island"" in March, and after being given 72-hours notice of their execution on Saturday, Chan married his longtime girlfriend, Febyanti Herewila, on Monday in prison. The executions of Sukumaran and Chan came despite the fact that both this week received a court date of May 12 to hear an outstanding legal challenge. On Tuesday, lawyers for the men also said Indonesia's Judicial Commission had yet to properly investigate claims of corruption during their original trial and sentencing. They said three of the men's Indonesian lawyers had been summoned to attend the commission on May 7. However, before the executions, Indonesia insisted that all legal avenues had closed. On Tuesday, the prisoners' families were heard wailing as they boarded a boat for the execution site. Visiting hours were extended until 8 p.m. to give them extra time before they were asked to leave. Under Indonesian law, the death penalty is carried out by a 12-man firing squad, although only three guns are loaded with live ammunition. Prisoners are given the choice of whether to stand or sit, and whether they want to wear a blindfold, hood or nothing. The shots -- aimed at the heart -- are fired from between 5 and 10 meters (16 to 33 feet), according to Amnesty International. After the executions, the rights group released a statement condemning them as ""reprehensible"" and issue fresh calls for a moratorium on the death penalty. While the Bali Nine have garnered much international attention, their punishment is part of a larger government effort to combat illegal drug trafficking. Indonesian President Widodo has insisted that Indonesia would not be swayed by appeals for clemency because the country is dealing with a ""drugs crisis."" He told CNN in January that clemency would not be extended to drug traffickers, leading to an appeal from Chan and Sukumaran that their cases hadn't been properly considered. Lawyers for the two men said they underwent radical rehabilitation during their 10 years in Kerobokan prison and were helping to counsel and support other inmates. Chan was ordained as a Christian minister who led prayer meetings, while Sukumaran became an accomplished painter and established his own art classes inside the Bali prison. The Indonesian government didn't confirm until late Tuesday that the executions were to go ahead. Preparations were clearly underway earlier that day, with the arrival of ambulances at the port where boats leave to go to Nusa Kambangan island where the prisoners were being held. Images showed individual crosses bearing the prisoners' names and the date April 29, 2015. Families were in little doubt as to what lay ahead. When reports of his death emerged, Sukumaran's cousin tweeted: ""I love you more than you can imagine. Your legacy will live on. I promise. Save me a place in heaven.""

"(CNN)This week, social media heralded as #motheroftheyear Toya Graham, the Baltimore single mom who pulled her son, who was holding a brick, away from the scene of a riot. A video of Graham yanking young Michael from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral. Many called her a hero: a mother determined to stop the cycle of violence. And yet, wasn't she also promoting violence? Her own reaction, after all, was to yell, curse and hit. ""Why is America celebrating the beating of a black child?"" asked a writer at The Washington Post. Isn't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home? Isn't this why rioting happens? I'm not excusing violence in any form. I wish it didn't exist. But Baltimore isn't on fire because of mothers like Graham. In fact, what we need, not only in communities like Baltimore but also in communities around the country, are more mothers like her. Mothers who will do whatever it takes to protect their children and steer them through the increasingly tricky course of adolescence. I don't see Graham as an abusive mother spreading the gospel, or at least the inevitability, of violence. I don't see her as a hero, either. What I do see in Graham is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents, mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence. Mothers who know the anger and frustration that can result when they catch their teenager in a lie. As Graham told Anderson Cooper, she'd told Michael the night before not to join in any riots. He swore he wouldn't. But her momma bear sense kicked in, and when she heard that school was closing early, she didn't take the chance that he'd stick to his promise. She went to the site of the riots to make sure that she could help him stay the course. She went there so that she could help him keep his promise. And when she got there and saw he hadn't, as she suspected, she reacted in the way that she knew would, in that moment, be most effective to get him out of there. And that's the key here. It's easy to punish a teenager for acting out, just as it's easy to punish Graham for taking out her frustrations on Michael in a physical way. But Graham's actions are evidence of her commitment as a parent. For better or worse, she knows her son. And she knows her community, and her reality. She knows that she's the mother of an adolescent boy living in a city caught up in a very heated, violent moment. And she will do anything to protect her son, including put herself in a dangerous situation to pull him out of there. Can we all say that? Toya Graham raises an important point that's often missing in the discussions of how to curb violence: Moms have power. The world needs more momma bear types -- mothers who might be willing to put themselves between their child and certain danger. Mothers who are willing to defy the ""expert"" advice telling them that teenagers need the room to make mistakes; that hovering or even trying to anticipate their misbehavior only stunts their development and leads to more misbehavior. Now more than ever, there are exceptions to that rule. Those of us who live in communities that are generally safe can't imagine the level of fear and frustration that must run through the very core of a mother like Graham. We don't all face the same obstacles as the people who live in places like Baltimore. But we all face the same challenges in raising children. Perhaps it's time to recognize that, at least in that sense, we're more alike than we are different.","Peggy Drexler: Video of Toya Graham hitting son as she drags him from protests has raised questions. Was she a hero? Abusive?
Neither, she says; she was a mom trying to steer her adolescent in a heated city conflict, and more moms need this kind of commitment ."
"Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)There are plenty of details left to iron out, but negotiators took a significant step Thursday toward a landmark deal aimed at keeping Iran's nuclear program peaceful. After a marathon stretch of late-night negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland, diplomats announced they'd come up with the framework for an agreement that's been months in the making. Iran would reduce its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98% and significantly scale back its number of installed centrifuges, according to the plan. In exchange, the United States and the European Union would lift sanctions that have crippled the country's economy. ""It is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a speech from the White House Rose Garden. ""This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon."" The deal would include strict verification measures to make sure Iran complies, he said. ""If Iran cheats,"" Obama said, ""the world will know it."" Key points of the deal . The world powers involved in the talks with Iran were the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom and Germany. For the United States and Iran, two countries with a long history of strained relations, the negotiations took on an added significance. Just two years ago, they hadn't talked with each other officially in nearly four decades. ""I think there was a seriousness of purpose,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN in an interview shortly after the framework was announced. ""People negotiated hard. It was tough, very intense at times, sometimes emotional and confrontational. It was a very intensive process, because the stakes are very high, and because there is a long history of not talking to each other. For 35 years, we haven't talked with the Iranians directly like this."" On Thursday, Iranian state television broadcast Obama's speech live, something many Iranians described as unprecedented. Some Iranians marked the historic moment in U.S.-Iranian relations on Twitter by sharing ""selfies"" of themselves in front of the live Obama speech. But U.S. leaders were still talking tough, even as they praised the agreement. Kerry stressed that if a final deal is reached with Iran, the removal of any sanctions against Tehran will come in phases. ""And if we find out at any point that Iran is not complying with the agreement, the sanctions can snap back into place,"" he said. Iran didn't seem to be changing its tune, either. ""Iran-U.S. relations had nothing to do with this. This was an attempt to resolve the nuclear issue. ... We have serious differences with the United States,"" Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said after the deal's framework was announced, noting that ""mutual mistrust"" had been a serious problem in the talks. The preliminary agreement will not put an end to Iran's enrichment activities, Zarif said. ""None of those measures include closing any of our facilities. The proud people of Iran would never accept that,"" he said. But he said Iran will abide by the agreement, which would limit enrichment activities to one location, he said. 21 questions on Iranian nuclear talks . But work on the deal isn't finished. There's a June 30 deadline for coming up with a final agreement. In the United States, the Obama administration could face an uphill battle selling the deal to a skeptical Congress, which has threatened to impose new sanctions on Iran. Already, there were rumblings of the looming political fight. Kerry said he didn't believe Congress would block the deal, telling CNN it ""would be very irresponsible to make politics trump facts and science and the realities of what is possible here."" House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement that he was planning to stand strong and press the administration with tough questions. ""The President says negotiators have cleared the basic threshold needed to continue talks, but the parameters for a final deal represent an alarming departure from the White House's initial goals,"" he said, arguing that Congress must review details of a deal before any sanctions are lifted. Obama warned leaders of Congress not to stop the deal. ""If Congress kills this deal not based on expert analysis and without offering any reasonable alternative, then it's the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy,"" Obama said. ""International unity will collapse."" Obama maintains the deal would shut down Iran's path to getting a nuclear bomb. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the opposite is true. ""Such a deal would not block Iran's path to the bomb. It would pave it,"" he said in a statement. ""It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war."" Netanyahu has been lobbying against an agreement since the talks began, warning U.S. lawmakers in a congressional address last month that Iran can't be trusted. Israeli government officials vowed to continue their push against what they called ""a poor framework that will lead to a bad and dangerous agreement."" ""If an agreement is reached on the basis of this framework, it will result in a historic mistake that will make the world a far more dangerous place,"" the Israeli officials said in a statement. ""This framework gives international legitimacy to Iran's nuclear program that aims only to produce nuclear bombs."" Obama said that he was reaching out to Netanyahu to explain and defend the tentative framework. ""If, in fact, Prime Minister Netanyahu is looking for the most effective way to ensure that Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon, this is the best option,"" Obama said. Negotiations between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States -- plus Germany began in 2006 and have had a tortured history. Over the past nine years, the push and pull over Iran's nuclear program produced a bewildering array of proposals. Meanwhile, as talks dragged on, the United States, the European Union and others imposed sanctions on Iran, provoking resentment among Tehran's leaders, who called the sanctions a crime against humanity. The challenge all along was twofold: To assure the international community that Iran could not develop nuclear weapons (which it denied in any event that it was doing); and to accommodate the country's assertion of its right -- as a signer of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons -- to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes. The broad outlines of a deal seem to have been clear for some time. But the devil was in the details, and the numbers, timing, sequencing and verification procedures proved devilishly difficult to resolve. Until now. The 2013 election of Hassan Rouhani, a political moderate, to Iran's presidency infused the talks with new hope, though questions lingered over whether he could persuade the country's hard-liners to accept an agreement. U.S. leaders also were divided over the agreement as envisioned. In a March 9 letter signed by 47 Republican U.S. senators, Iran's leaders were warned that any deal not approved by the Senate could immediately be revoked by President Barack Obama's successor in 2017. Democrats denounced the sending of such a letter to foreign leaders as an unprecedented intervention in negotiations between the administration and another country. And Iran's leaders also dismissed the letter.​ . CNN's Elise Labott reported from Lausanne and Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet wrote the story in Atlanta. CNN's Don Melvin, Mark Bixler, Cynde Strand, Sarah Aarthun, Jedd Rosche, Jethro Mullen, Greg Botelho and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","Netanyahu says a deal would pave the way for Iran to get a nuclear bomb .

"(CNN)This is week two of an ongoing series: A Catholic Reads the Bible  This week covers the Book of Genesis, chapters 1-11. A week ago, I was worried I wouldn't have anything to write about. Now, I don't even know where to begin. The first step was choosing a Bible. I went with the version that I received for winning the religion award at Rice Memorial High School in South Burlington, Vermont. As I mentioned in the first installment of this series, I'm a lifelong Catholic who finally plans to read the Bible from cover to cover. The Bible I'm reading is ""The Deluxe Catholic Bible,"" published in 1986 by World Bible Publishing. After four days of reading this week, my journal is full of observations and ideas. With my crazy schedule, I found that reading at night was a perfect way to unwind and reflect. And as I started reading, I didn't want to stop. In order to fully process Scripture, I need to slow down and read the footnotes. Footnotes are my friend. First of all, Genesis starts with two separate creation narratives. How did I not know this? The first chapter is the seven days story with God creating the Earth. In the second chapter the Earth is again created and man is formed out of clay. Talking with a CNN colleague, I mentioned how there seems to be fascination in Genesis with dirt and clay. My colleague pointed out that even Adam's name is a play on the Hebrew word ""adama,"" meaning ground. It struck me that the whole first two chapters have everything to do with the Earth and man's place in it, a struggle that we can relate to even now. From the creation of the Garden of Eden to the fall and the banishment, the bounty of the land and the access to it seems to be the area of highest concern. My greatest surprise, though, came when I read about Seth. Seth? Who? I started asking people if they had remembered the story of Seth. My unscientific poll of friends is that 9 out 10 people I asked had no idea who he was. Turns out, Seth is the forgotten son of Adam and Eve who is born after Cain kills Abel. Adam fathered Seth at 130 years old. Yes, we are getting into the part of the Bible with fantastical life spans that allow for the transition from the stories of Adam to Abraham. (Again, thank you footnotes). Unfortunately, we don't learn much more about Seth. When he is mentioned, it's about his descendants. But, because this was my first biblical surprise, I will never forget him. Thank you, Seth. As a woman, though I was waiting to read more about the role of women. Did you know that Eve is the first person named in the Bible? (I expected Adam, but he is called ""man"" in the first references.) Moving on, we have these tales about the ""sons of heaven"" seeing Earth's beautiful women and taking them as wives. Um? What? I had never heard that one before. I had to read that passage a few times and, again, the footnotes helped. They say the story is an inclusion from mythology. But why? My first hunch is that it might have been a way to take a story that everyone knew at the time and make it part of a new narrative. Familiarity would lead to followers. Of course,  many Christians don't cite the ""sons of heaven"" today because it would take too much time to explain. Maybe that's why I don't ever recall hearing this passage read at Mass. With that in mind, I read about Noah, descendent of Seth, with a different perspective, too. I have never believed there was an ark. I never thought that God dictated the dimensions of the boat to save the animals two by two. It is a story told to make you realize the power of God. The explanation for the flood is that man had become more and more wicked, but  I didn't expect, though, that God would ""regret"" creating man. Ouch! It really makes the reader want to stay on God's good side. This ""wickedness"" of mankind and the ""regret"" from God sounds as if God made a mistake and decides to fix it, to start over, in essence. ""Never again will I doom the Earth because of man, since the desires of man are evil from the start. ..."" That phrase reminded me of my dad's favorite saying, ""To err is human but to forgive is divine,"" which comes from a Pope, but not a Catholic holy man. But enough about that, I have to get back to reading.","Laura Bernardini, a lifelong Catholic, has decided to finally read the Bible from cover to cover. This is week two .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)Lee Min-bok didn't laugh once when he watched ""The Interview.""  The North Korean defector calls the Hollywood comedy ""vulgar,"" admitting he couldn't even watch the whole film. Yet he is still sending thousands of copies across the border from South to North Korea in balloons, determined his people will see the movie in which the leader Kim Jong Un is assassinated on screen. ""The regime hates this film because it shows Kim Jong Un as a man, not a God,"" says Lee. ""He cries and is afraid like us and then he's assassinated."" Kim is portrayed in the movie as a Katy Perry-loving, sensitive soul with daddy issues, clashing with the all-powerful image beamed out by Pyongyang's tightly controlled state media and propaganda machine. At 1 a.m., Lee makes a final check of the wind speed and direction, then heads towards the border with North Korea. He has company. The South Korean police and military drive closely behind. After Pyongyang fired on similar propaganda balloons recently, they are monitoring launches very closely. This irritates Lee. ""We can help towards reunification with these balloons,"" says Lee. ""It costs millions of dollars to buy a F-22 fighter jet which the South Korean government insist they need and that's not for peaceful purposes. So why do civilians like me have to do this under cover of darkness?"" At 3 a.m., Lee fills the balloons with helium and ties the bundles of DVDs, dollar bills and political leaflets to the bottom. A timer is attached which will release the bundle once safely in North Korean territory. He has no way of knowing what will happen to the goods after that. He doesn't know if ordinary North Koreans will watch the movie and read the leaflets. The fact that Pyongyang acts with fury against these so-called propaganda balloons suggests some information is seeping through to the hermit kingdom. ""If you tell the truth in North Korea, you die.  But by using these balloons from here, I can tell the truth in safety,"" Lee adds. The decision to launch the balloons in the dead of night is not just to avoid confrontation with North Korea, but also with South Korea's local residents. After Pyongyang fired on balloons last October and South Korea returned fire, those living close to the border have been trying to physically stop the launches, arguing they are being put in the line of fire. The chances of at least some North Koreans having watched the film that North Korea sees as ""an act of terrorism"" is certainly possible.","Defector deploys balloons with ""The Interview"" to North Korea .

"(CNN)A second individual has been charged with attempting to carry out an ""ISIS-inspired"" terror plot, Australian police say. Five young men were arrested Saturday in Melbourne, Australia, in what police called a major counterterrorism operation. Two of the teens, 18 and 19, have been released ""pending further inquiries,"" Australia's Federal Police said. Sevdet Besim, 18, was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act, and was denied bail Saturday. The person charged Monday is accused of conspiring to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts. The suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Saturday. ""The act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers,"" he said. There was also a risk to the public, police said. Police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on Anzac Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps Day), which is April 25 and this year is the centennial of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. Abbott avoided the term ISIS -- or Islamic State -- to call out those who authorities believed influenced the suspects. He instead referred to the group as the ""Daesh death cult,"" employing the acronym that is transliterated from the group's name in Arabic. It's a handle ISIS is known to loathe. Police also distanced the suspects from any ethnic connection. The men ""are individuals acting by themselves. They are not representatives of any religious, cultural or national group,"" Victoria Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said.

"(CNN)The Arizona police officer who slammed into an armed suspect with his patrol car told investigators he thought he was too far to take a shot at the man, so he chose the other option, CNN affiliate KVOA reported Wednesday. Officer Michael Rapiejko ran his car into Mario Valencia in February as the suspect carried a rifle he had just fired in the air. Rapiejko sped around another officer as Valencia walked through a business park, hit the man from behind with the left side of his front bumper. Valencia, who flew through this air, survived and faces more than a dozen charges for an alleged crime spree that day. His lawyer has said police used excessive force and could have killed a man who was obviously unstable. The Marana Police Department has defended Rapiejko, saying deadly force was warranted because the suspect had a rifle, ammunition and was walking toward offices where hundreds of people work. Marana is just northwest of Tucson. Officer who drove into suspect justified, chief says . KVOA obtained police inquiry tapes on which Rapiejko tells investigators why he chose his car as a weapon. The officer, who has been a cop for more than a decade but joined the Marana Police Department in 2014, said he was 50 yards away from the suspect and worried a missed shot might hit another officer or bystanders. ""There were occupied businesses, and there were two officers at the other side of the street,"" he says on the recording. ""This is what I deem as a lethal force encounter. I have two thoughts that go in my mind: I need to shoot him to stop the threat, or I need to run him over to stop the threat."" Another officer, who was slowing trailing Valencia and ahead of Rapiejko, says on another recording that if a civilian had stumbled upon Valencia, the suspect might have taken a hostage or killed the person. Video of the car striking Valencia sparking nationwide debate on what type of force police should use to go after armed suspects. Many people commended the officer. Some people said the police should have set up a perimeter around the man and talked him into surrendering. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN last week that ""it is miraculous that my client isn't dead."" Valencia, who is in Pima County Jail, is scheduled to appear in court again on May 18. Authorities chose not to charge Rapiejko.

"London (CNN)If you're hunting for the earliest galaxies and clues about potential life on other planets you are going to need a very big mirror and a golf ball of gold. They are both necessary for the construction of The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), intended as the successor to the Hubble instrument that has been operating in space for 25 years. It's going to be a tough act to follow. Hubble has returned spectacular images during the past quarter century but also helped scientists discover that almost every galaxy has a massive black hole at its heart and that the expansion of the universe is speeding up. But there are limits to how far it can see. Now scientists are working on an alternative way to peer into the past and search space for signs of life with JWST -- scheduled to launch in October 2018 on an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana. NASA spokesperson Lynn Chandler told CNN that the mission was like opening up the curtains on the universe and peering inside. ""Hubble rewrote the text books and we're planning to rewrite the text books again,"" she said. ""JWST will answer the questions which at the moment we can't think to ask."" The Webb telescope is a big probe. Hubble is about the size of a school bus but JWST is as big as a tennis court. There isn't a rocket currently capable of carrying that so as Chandler explained: ""It has to be folded up like a flower and then unfurled like a transformer."" Named after James E. Webb, a former NASA leader, JWST is being designed to study the first stars and galaxies that formed in the early universe. NASA says that to see these objects the telescope will have to detect objects which are 10 to 100 times fainter than Hubble can currently see. Instead of studying visible and ultraviolet light like Hubble, the JWST will work in the infra-red spectrum, allowing scientists to detect more distant targets. The new telescope requires a huge mirror of 25 square meters (about 270 square feet) -- and a golf ball of gold (about 48 grams or 1.7 ounces) to optimize it for infra-red light. It is then coated with glass. But technology like this doesn't come cheap. According to NASA, the mission, which is in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and involves a total of 14 countries, will cost $8.5 billion. NASA says that the project has four main goals -- namely, to search for the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang, find out how galaxies evolved, observe the birth of stars and planets and investigate the potential for life on other planets . Scientists hope the telescope will be able to tell us more about objects that formed 13 billion years ago -- about 700-800 million years after the Big Bang. But closer to home, scientists also believe the new telescope will able to detect planets around nearby stars. NASA says JWST should be able to operate for between five and 10 years, restricted only by the amount of fuel it has to maintain orbit and the ability of the electronics to stand up to the harsh space environment.

"(CNN)It would have made Thomas Jefferson proud. Established on the birthday of the American founding father, Liberland -- the world's newest micronation -- is founded on a firm belief in liberty and noninterference from the powers-that-be. A tiny, 7 square-kilometer parcel of land, marked on maps as Gornja Siga, its territory abuts the Danube on the border between Serbia and Croatia. The victim of a border dispute between Serbia and Croatia, it is claimed by neither side -- effectively a no-man's land. No one lives on this patch of land, which is heavily forested and contains only badly-maintained access roads and a run-down house, abandoned for decades. This is where Euroskeptic Czech politician Vit Jedlicka stepped in. On April 13 he planted his newly-designed yellow and black flag in the territory, declaring the area the Free Republic of Liberland -- a tiny sliver of a country, bigger only than the Vatican and Monaco. He tells CNN that the country will be formally founded on May 1 and is inviting, through the media, the world's heads of state to attend a formal ceremony marking the presumptive nation's birth. He says that he will also invite 7,500 of the 300,000 applicants that applied to become citizens of Liberland to the ceremony, where he will grant them citizenship. ""I will grant citizenship if they can make it to the party,"" he told CNN by phone. ""It's short notice but a good challenge, and also for  the presidents (and other heads of state) if they can make it to the founding of our country."" Jedlicka, an active member of the Czech Republic's Party of Free Citizens, opposes excessive government interference. He says his attempts to enact change in his home country led him to the political experiment that is Liberland. ""I would describe it as a global revolution. It's just the beginning,"" he tells CNN via Skype. Founded on staunchly libertarian principles -- its motto is ""To live and let live"" -- its website describes its system of governance as being a ""constitutional republic with elements of direct democracy."" It will use a form of cryptocurrency -- similar to Bitcoin -- as its national currency, bypassing the need for a central bank and will, according to its constitution, keep government's noses out of everything possible, from the banks to prostitution. ""Liberland prides itself on personal and economic freedom of its people, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, which significantly limits the power of politicians so they could not interfere too much in the freedoms of the Liberland nation,"" the world's newest constitutional document states. Financial regulation will be minimal, if at all present. Jedlicka says almost 300,000 applications for citizenship have been received, about 20 of which have been accepted. ""Thousands of Americans, Swiss people. Also a lot of Arabic peoples who feel oppressed by the regimes there."" He envisions, ultimately, a community of around 35,000 Liberlanders, not all of whom will be full-time residents. He says he expects trouble from his neighbors, whose land he has effectively annexed. ""From Serbia, Croatia, we expect some trouble but we expect international laws will applied and any movement against us would be an attack on a sovereign nation, and we will offer nothing but passive resistance. For now, (though) we will make roads, docks."" For its part, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement to CNN that stated that Liberland would not theoretically impinge upon its border, which is delineated by the Danube, but ""the Ministry also considers this a frivolous act which needs no further comment."" Croatia's counterpart was similarly dismissive. ""Virtual quips, however interesting they occasionally sound, remain what they are -- virtual quips, and for them we have no official comment.""","Vit Jedlicka, the first president of Liberland, tells CNN that the country will be formally founded on May 1 .

"(CNN)President Abraham Lincoln never lost his ardor for the United States to remain united during the Civil War. In his Second Inaugural address he attempted to salve the nation with an eloquent summation of his philosophy and plans for putting it into practice. ""With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,"" he orated, ""let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations' wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."" The spirit of Lincoln's second inaugural was self-evident on April 9, 1865 -- 150 years ago -- when Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee dramatically surrendered his approximately 28,000 troops to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse (McLean House) in Virginia.  Over 600,000 Americans -- Northerners and Southerners alike -- had perished in the bloody Civil War.  But the carnage was now about to end. The historic meeting between Grant and Lee began with pleasantries about the weather and their mutual service in the Mexican War.  The good fellowship was palpable.  Lee, in fact, had to abruptly remind the chatty Grant about the diplomatic business at hand.   After all, they were at Appomattox Courthouse to hash out terms of surrender. Grant purposely ended up being generous to Confederate soldiers. They would be paroled, not condemned to prison camps.  Rebel officers were even allowed to maintain their sidearms.  Personal property of Southerners would now be respected.  Even rations were provided by Grant for Lee's hungry soldiers. It was Palm Sunday and in the spirit of Christian reconciliation Grant ordered that no celebration occur within Union Army ranks.  ""The Confederates were now our prisoners,"" Grant wrote, ""and we did not want to exult over their downfall."" The myth-making about Appomattox started from the moment Lee left the courthouse on his horse to travel to Richmond.   Surrendering hadn't been easy for Lee.  Sullen from defeat, his own family property in Arlington had been confiscated by Union forces (converted into a Union cemetery with lines of white crosses on the lawn). All 11,000 acres of his Virginia land holdings had been stripped from him by the U.S. government.  With no real home, Lee rode to Richmond, depressed and destitute, rendezvousing with his sick wife Mary Curtis Lee at a spare apartment.  Remarkably, the stoic Lee didn't express bitterness in public. When news reached Lee that Lincoln had been murdered, in fact, he was distraught, calling it ""a crime"" that was ""unexampled"" and ""deplorable."" Although much remained unresolved between the victors and vanquished, the little courthouse became a symbol of unity, just like the ""Star Spangled Banner"" from the War of 1812. One post-Appomattox story that has long interested me was that of Littleberry Walker.  After being present at Lee's dramatic surrender at Appomattox, Walker, a battle-fatigued Confederate, laid down his rifle and journeyed back to red-clay, Georgia, traveling mainly on foot, passing ragged clusters of Rebel amputees, many hobbling on bayonet crutches, others with arms or heads swathed in bandages and all heading in the same direction: home. Upon arriving in Atlanta, a weary Walker found the Confederate railroad-city smoldered in ruin, the handiwork of Gen. William T. Sherman's ""scorched earth policy.""  (One-hundred-twenty years later, Walker's great-grandson, 39th President Jimmy Carter, would construct his Carter Center, an NGO dedicated to diplomatically resolving global conflicts, on the very hilltop overlooking Atlanta on which Gen. Sherman once stood.) Upon leaving Atlanta, Walker continued walking south, anxious for his kinfolk.  Unfortunately, he returned to Sumter County only to learn that his father had died and that the family farm was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. One suspects Inman, the main character of novelist Charles Frazier's ""Cold Mountain,"" spoke for the battle-hardened Civil War veterans like Walker, when he lamented that, ""What you have lost will not be returned to you.  It will always be lost.  You're left with only your scars to mark the void.  All you can do is go on or not.  But if you go on, it's knowing you carry scars with you."" As we reflect on the sesquicentennial of Lee's surrender at that forlorn Virginia courthouse, today marvelously maintained by the National Park Service, we recognize that the scars of the Civil War are still with us.  The Mason-Dixon Line divide still exists.  Almost all the old Confederate States are now considered ""Red"" (Republican), while the Union States are ""blue"" (Democrat) -- a residual variation of Big Federal Government versus States' Rights paradigm of the Civil War era. While the old spiritual ""Slavery Chain Done Broke at Last"" was sung by blacks in the hours following the Appomattox surrender, racism sadly continues to be a crippling national scourge. While there no longer are beatings in Congress (like in 1856 when Preston Brooks of South Carolina caned Charles Sumner of Massachusetts on the Congressional floor) the gridlock on Capital Hill in 2015, the inability to get anything done, is similarly cold-cocking the spirit of our participatory democracy. All American eyes should be fixated on Appomattox today.  The McLean house is our collective sanctuary of national healing.  As a public place, the McLean parlor remains small but the legacy which Grant and Lee made at the truce table is timeless in world history. For while the scars of the monstrous Civil War still remain, the wounds have closed since 1865, in large part, because of the civility of Grant and Lee.  With grace and dignity, these brave West Point generals gave righteous credence to Lincoln's ""with malice toward none"" finery.","150 years ago on April 9, Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House .

"(CNN)It's only June, but 2015 may be remembered as the year the term ""transgender"" fully entered mainstream consciousness. In January, President Obama condemned the persecution of ""people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,"" becoming the first president to utter the word in a State of the Union address. ""Transparent,"" about an aging father who begins living as a woman, won two top awards at the Golden Globes, while transgender actress Laverne Cox of ""Orange is the New Black"" -- who made the cover of Time magazine last year -- was just cast in a new CBS drama. The May issue of Vogue has a photo spread with transgender model Andreja Pejic, who said on Instagram this week that she ""was told by various people many times over that the chances of me ending up on these pages were slim to none."" A transgender character had a recurring storyline on the just-wrapped final season of ""Glee,"" while transgender activist and YouTube star Jazz Jennings will star in a reality show debuting on TLC this summer. And then there's Bruce Jenner, whose physical appearance has become more feminine in recent months as the Olympic hero turned reality TV star underwent a very public gender transition. Jenner ended months of speculation in an interview that aired April 24 on ""20/20"" with Diane Sawyer. ""Are you a woman?"" Sawyer asked. ""Yes,"" Jenner replied. Now comes the new issue of Vanity Fair, with Jenner on the cover in makeup and a skimpy dress, along with a new name: Caitlyn. It's more obvious than ever that transgender people, long relegated to society's shadows, are finally stepping into the light. ""We are at a social inflection point on transgender issues,"" says Riki Wilchins, a former transgender activist and author of three books on queer theory, who believes all the attention could have a positive impact. ""Civil rights for minorities come in fits and starts. We're on an upswing now."" Opinion: Why we need to listen to Bruce Jenner's story . Transgender is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity -- their internal, personal sense of being a man or a woman -- differs from what's typically associated with their sex at birth. Some transgender people alter their bodies through hormones and or surgery, although many don't. A 2011 study estimated that 700,000 American adults, or roughly 0.3% of the population, identified themselves as transgender. For decades, trans people, as many transgender people like to be called, rarely saw themselves represented in popular culture. But recent years have brought the ""Dancing with the Stars"" contestant Chaz Bono; filmmaker Lana Wachowski, formerly known as Larry Wachowski, a co-director of ""The Matrix""; Jared Leto's Oscar-winning role in ""Dallas Buyers Club""; and of course, ""Orange is the New Black,"" whose cast is a mix of ethnicities and sexualities. Now, between ""Transparent"" and other shows, recognition from Obama and tabloid headlines about Jenner, the national conversation around gender identity appears to have reached a new level. All this makes transgender advocates cautiously optimistic. Hayden Mora, deputy chief of staff at the Human Rights Campaign and a transgender man, remains hopeful that the growing number of transgender faces beaming weekly into America's living rooms can only have a positive effect. ""I believe that the more people who know transgender people, the more they will understand, accept and support us,"" Mora says. ""That happens only if they acknowledge our humanity, and not treat us like tabloid fodder."" The transgender life: What to know, say and understand . Still, activists agree there's a long way to go before transgender people stop facing discrimination or worse. For relatives and friends who are used to seeing someone as male or female, gender changes can be hard to accept. Transgender people have long been misunderstood and persecuted -- as recently as 2012, the American Psychiatric Association classified them as having a mental ""disorder."" A recent report by the Human Rights Campaign found that transgender people in the United States are more likely to face discrimination from employers and the effects of unemployment and poverty. Many also are denied services from safety-net providers such as emergency shelters. A poll last year found that 59% of Americans believe transgender students should use the bathroom of their birth gender. In December, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that transgender people will receive federal protection from discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But violence against trans people -- especially transgender women of color -- remains a national plague. According to recent statistics from the Human Rights Campaign, at least 13 transgender women were slain last year in the United States and at least seven have already been killed this year. Of those 20 victims, all but one were black or Latina. ""We are definitely in a critical moment for the trans movement. Over the last year we have ... seen an increase in visibility that was unimaginable even just a few years ago,"" said Kris Hayashi, executive director of the Transgender Law Center. ""At the same time it is clear that visibility is not enough."" In one case that made national headlines, a transgender Ohio teen committed suicide in late December after her parents refused to acknowledge her wish to live as a girl. ""Transgender people are still subject to profound discrimination and violence,"" said Wilchins. ""Greater acceptance is really needed, and long overdue."" When your young daughter says 'I'm a boy' So what impact will Bruce Jenner's story have on all this? Gender-rights activists are reluctant to speculate. Some fear the media firestorm around Jenner, fueled by ties to the camera-loving Kardashian clan, trivializes what is a wrenching personal journey for many people. ""You want to wish Bruce the best. But at the same time, you wish it wasn't being played out for reality-TV entertainment,"" said Wilchins, the gender-rights advocate. ""Yes, it's great that we're educating people. But we're talking about a civil rights issue that keeps getting recast as entertainment."" As a much-hyped TV event, the Jenner interview gave millions of viewers their first exposure to gender-identity questions and put a sympathetic human face on an issue that remains perplexing to many people. But it could also trigger a backlash, some say. Amy Stone, associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, fears Jenner could provoke those who already are averse to gay or transgender people. Such people ""tend to use these moments to frighten the general public, relying on fears about trans women in bathrooms or locker rooms,"" said Stone, author of numerous books about queer politics and culture. ""Usually these moments tap into pre-existing panics about gender or sexuality, not necessarily spawning new ones.""","Olympic hero Bruce Jenner appears on Vanity Fair cover as ""Caitlyn""

"(CNN)She could stand on a strand of human hair, with room to spare. The microscopic polymer statue by South African sculptor Jonty Hurwitz, entitled Trust, measured just 1/100th of a centimeter and had been called the ""smallest sculpture ever made."" But the world's tiniest woman suddenly disappeared to an unknown location, likely never to be seen again. While she was being photographed through an electron microscope -- the only way to view the minute creation -- Trust vanished, with only a smudged fingerprint left behind by her photographer as a clue. After an hour long search, Hurwitz and the photographer gave in: ""It was horror. I remember saying to him: 'You just destroyed or lost the smallest human form that was ever created in history,' said Hurwitz to CNN Ones to Watch. ""It was gone."" But was it, really? Hurwitz is an entrepreneur-turned-artist who has applied the same tech wizardry to sculpture that he put into coding a finance site valued at over $500 million. The 45-year-old's ""Nano-sculptures"" are made from a mysterious resin -- ""a big scientific secret"", says Hurwitz -- and created through a process called ""two-photon lithography."" Hurwitz works with a team of nanotechnology engineers at Karlsruhe University, who focus beams of ultraviolet light to ""zap"" solid the liquid resin, one 3D pixel at a time. The resulting sculptures -- he has also created a statue depicting the classical myth of Cupid and Psyche -- can lie on an ant's head. Put one into the eye of a needle, and it will barely occupy one corner. The ""Nano"" project is just one of Hurwitz' science-inspired sculptural experiments. Another one explores the properties of the mathematical constant Pi, presenting an indecipherable, ""anamorphic"" physical sculpture, whose hidden form becomes clear only when reflected in a cylindrical mirror. And he hints that a forthcoming project will also be influenced by his love of the natural world, but will sit at the opposite end of the scale to his nano-models. Hurwitz, who first made his name as the UK-based co-founder of controversial ""payday"" loans business Wonga, says he makes visual art with a team, as in traditionally collaborative art forms, such as cinema. He discusses accumulating collaborators as an aggressive start-up accumulates new talent: . ""I spent a huge amount of time scouring the world for amazing achievements of humanity and contact these people to work with them. For me the creation of an artwork these days is analogous to the creation of a film: for each piece there may 20 people involved, each one brilliant in their field."" Hurwitz makes no secret of his desire to bring together contemporary science and art -- delighting in the fact that his nano-scale and 3D printed pieces depend on cutting edge technology, and would have been unimaginable just 10 years ago. Online, fans response has been overwhelming, he says, and the internet has become his exhibition space. It provides an ""epic scale"" that brick-and-mortar galleries can't match, he says, and estimates 13 million people have seen his sculptures since they hit the web in November last year. ""I love the buzz. I love the buzz when I launch a piece on the Internet and on Google Analytics, you suddenly see society engaging... millions and millions of people engaging."" ""You put a few images on the internet and just watch society consume, engage and think. With comments and blogs and people saying 'It's not art' and people working out the science behind it and people complaining... I just love that buzz! I love influencing society."" There's also another side -- what Hurwitz calls ""the traditional side of the geeky art world"" -- accusing him of being just an engineer rather than an artist. But he's unapologetic: . ""A lot of the artistic expression that I bring to the world represents the absolute current moment in human development. Whether it's 3D printing, technology or science, I love to represent the now."" Hurwitz says the creation of the physical artwork is ""just the beginning of its lifecycle."" So what about the missing woman, whose lifecycle has tragically been cut short? She came back to life during the filming of CNN Ones to Watch (in the video above) -- Trust v.2, her new name, has taken the absent dancer's place. Even still, there are some who think neither dancer was ever there. Invisible to the naked eye, how can we trust this sculpture ever existed beyond the computer screen? For Hurwitz, this mystery gets right to the heart of nano-scale's appeal: . ""You've got this 'emperor's new clothes' element to this end of the scale spectrum, because you look at these nano-sculptures and there's nothing there, there's an element of me going: 'this sculpture... believe me, it's there.' ""At that scale, the sculpture doesn't really exist, or our perception doesn't allow us to perceive its existence. ""In a way, it challenges the whole idea of contemporary art, by asking: 'Hang on, a piece of art you can't really see, is it really a piece of art?'""","London-based artist Jonty Hurwitz creates sculptures that are smaller than a human hair .

"(CNN)They were huddled in the back of a tugboat. Some were without shoes. Their coats and jackets, still wet, were piled up in a huge container behind them. The 117 migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, arrived in the port of Augusta, Sicily, around 1p.m. Tuesday, after being picked up by the tugboat off the coast of Libya. The two boats they had been in were barely seaworthy, the tug's Montenegrin captain told me. The discarded coats, he said, would be thrown away. We had flown to Sicily from Rome following news that as many as 400 migrants had been lost at sea. The tragedy adds to the mounting death toll among those fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. So far this year as many as 900 have lost their lives. Last year at least 3,200 died making the journey. Since 2000, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), almost 22,000 people have died fleeing across the Mediterranean. Thousands may have died, but even more have succeeded in making the treacherous journey. This small group in Augusta were among nearly 10,000 migrants who have arrived on Italian shores since the weekend, according to the Italian Coast Guard. With the onset of spring and calmer seas, it appears that the flow of migrants is not relenting. The group, which included 31 women, was composed mostly of Nigerians and Gambians. As they filed off the boat, representatives of the Italian Red Cross did a quick visual inspection, checking for fever, scabies, any sign of illness. One woman, they discovered, was two months pregnant. Timothy, in his mid-20s from Nigeria, told me he left his home nine months ago. He paid human traffickers in Tripoli 1,000 Libyan dinars, more than $700, for the voyage. For him, it's a fortune. I asked 28-year-old Jibril, from Gambia, why he had left his home. ""It's not like in Europe,"" he told me. ""After 20, 25 years, you have to make a future for yourself. But in Gambia, I couldn't. My family, they don't have nothing. They are poor people."" Mercy, from Kano in northern Nigeria, seemed shell-shocked. In a faint voice she told me she had left Kano because her family feared she that would be taken by Boko Haram. ""I was scared,"" 25-year-old Al-Haji from Gambia told me about the journey from Libya. ""I was taking a big risk. Either I enter Europe or I die."" Another man, from Liberia, told me he had lived and worked in Libya for 15 years, but was terrified at the prospect of ISIS gaining even more territory. An Egyptian translator working for the Italian police told me they had information that a large group of Syrians were gathered in a Tripoli warehouse, and were expected to make the journey to Italy in the coming days. It seems that all the victims of the multiple tragedies and woes of Africa and the Middle East -- grinding poverty, war and the rise of ISIS -- are washing up on the shores of Italy. The wars, unrest, upheaval, misery and injustice I've covered over the last 20 years, in Syria, in Libya, in West Africa and elsewhere, seem to be coming together to remind those who have enjoyed Europe's relative peace and prosperity that no man is an island. The small group of migrants in Augusta has been taken in by the Italian authorities. They've been fed, clothed, received medical treatment, and will be taken to migrant camp in northern Italy. Most will then try move further north, to countries like France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK, where economic opportunities are better than in austerity-wracked Italy. Others will stay in Italy, trying to eke out a living in the twilight economy as street vendors and beggars. And as they settle in, somehow or other, more and more will come to Italy's shores.","Migrants rescued in Augusta, Italy tell CNN why they fled .

"(CNN)He's been part of a wildly popular superhero team since its very beginning. But there's something we never knew about Bobby Drake, aka Iceman of the X-Men. Wednesday's issue of ""All-New X-Men"" No. 40 reveals the truth: Bobby is gay. ""There are thousands if not millions of stories of people who, for many different reasons, felt the need to hide their sexuality,"" Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote the issue, said in a statement to CNN. ""The X-Men, with the conceit of time travel, give us a fascinating platform in which to examine such personal journeys. This is just the first little chapter of a much larger story that will be told."" Iceman's outing happens in an unusual manner. In the ""All-New X-Men"" storyline, members of the X-Men team travel to the past, as younger versions of themselves. Mind-reading mutant Jean Grey (also an X-Men original) asks Bobby why he calls women ""hot,"" when she knows he is gay. In comic book pages provided to CNN, Bobby doesn't immediately acknowledge that she is telling the truth. The character of Iceman is perhaps best known for his appearances in many of the ""X-Men"" films, as well as the 1981 animated series ""Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends."" The ""X-Men"" series of comics have long been progressive in terms of diversity, with a black female character, Storm, appearing in the 1970s, and the first gay mainstream comic book character, Northstar (who later married in the pages).

"(CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won't consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. ""Marijuana...?"" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, ""I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing."" I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't. Instead, she added, ""You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering."" I don't think we had ever had a conversation like that one. At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears. The word revolution, comes from the Latin revolutio, to ""turn around."" I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana. Hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic. Even patients I spoke to were reluctant to share their stories. It can be tricky, I learned, to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology. When we put the first ""Weed"" documentary on television in August 2013, I didn't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation. Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care. Is weed legal in your state? Just two years later, in ""Weed 3,"" we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing. You will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD. You will meet patients such as Sean Kiernan, an accomplished investment banker, and Amelia Taylor, a stay-at-home mom. They are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart, successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat PTSD can be worse than the underlying disorder itself. Sean Kiernan nearly died, trying to get better. You will see what weed really does to your brain, in crystal clear images. This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States. This is what a revolution looks like. Your medical marijuana questions answered . When ""Weed 2: Cannabis Madness"" aired in March 2014, Boston researcher Rick Doblin believed the right people were watching. Just four days later, Doblin received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study. The federal farm where Doblin would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year. Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen. It was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that spearheaded the research into a cure for AIDS, as well as stopping the spread of West Nile Virus. They were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox. Other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project, the BRAIN initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative. There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment. 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact . There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's, to name a few. With regard to pain alone, marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses, which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country. As I sat across from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), I knew something extraordinary was happening. They were reciting the story of Charlotte Figi and countless other children. They were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations. They were extolling the potential virtues of the plant, and all of that was before the interview even started. There was an impatience about them, and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform. They want marijuana to be rescheduled. They want it now. They want doctors to be able to prescribe it at VA hospitals all over the country. They want it now. They want research dollars freed up to study the plant. They want it now. They want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world, including the citizens of the United States, have known for a long time: Marijuana is a medicine, that should be studied and treated like any other medicine. And they want all of it now. I spent much of our interview challenging them. I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time. I reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them. I challenged them every step of the way. ""This time will be different,"" Booker confidently told me as he walked out of the room. Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol? I know how easy it is do nothing because I did nothing for too long. Take a good look at the data, educate yourself and talk to the patients, who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant. Journalists shouldn't take a position. It makes sense. Objectivity is king. But, at some point, open questions do get answered. At some point, contentious issues do get resolved. At some point, common sense prevails. So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana. We should do it nationally. And, we should do it now. 9 things to know about legal pot .","CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says we should legalize medical marijuana now .

"(CNN)When drinkers in Clayton's, a beachfront bar in South Padre Island, Texas, belly up for a round of shots, bartender Casey Belue can usually guess what they'll order. It comes in a yellow-labeled bottle with a fire-breathing demon on it. It tastes like Big Red chewing gum. It's Fireball Cinnamon Whisky, and lately it's been as hot as its name. ""Fireball is number one, definitely. That's pretty much the chosen shot,"" said Belue, who enjoys it herself now and then. ""On an average night, we probably go through three or four bottles."" If you're young -- say, under 35 -- this may not be news to you. Fireball, which didn't exist in its current form a decade ago, is the fastest-growing big brand of liquor in America. Retail sales more than doubled last year, and Fireball has come seemingly out of nowhere to become the sixth-most popular liquor brand in the U.S. as measured by retail sales -- ahead of such venerable labels as Jim Beam, Jose Cuervo and Grey Goose. And these figures don't include sales in bars, where Fireball has dethroned Jagermeister as America's party shot of choice. Or social media feeds, which fill with photos of Fireball-flavored revelry and #FireballFriday hashtags. ""Fireball is an incredible phenomenon. The growth of it has just been astounding,"" said Lew Bryson, managing editor of Whisky Advocate and author of several books on whiskey and other spirits. ""For a whiskey, this is unprecedented."" To the uninitiated, Fireball is basically made from Canadian whisky, aged in used bourbon barrels, flavored with sweetener and spicy cinnamon. (The ""whisky"" spelling generally refers to Scotches or Canadian varieties, while ""whiskey"" refers to Irish or American styles.) Its slogan is ""Tastes like heaven, burns like hell,"" but that's an exaggeration. Fireball has a kick, but it doesn't burn as much as straight whiskeys, cheap tequilas or even the Atomic Fireball hard candy that helped inspire its name. It's also only 66 proof, or 33% alcohol -- less than most whiskeys. ""It's so easy to drink that you forget you're drinking alcohol. It's very sweet. You hardly taste the whiskey at all,"" said Zachary Jones, a bartender at Community Smith in Atlanta. ""I've known people who can't do shots, but they can do Fireball."" Fireball is especially popular among young drinkers and women, many of whom say they like that it doesn't singe their throat and leaves a Dentyne-like aftertaste. But not everyone is a fan. Whiskey enthusiasts -- the types who can talk knowledgeably about single-malt Scotches -- mostly turn up their noses at the stuff. ""I've got to be honest: It's not anything I'd reach for, at any occasion,"" Bryson said. ""But clearly I'm not in the mainstream."" Fireball wasn't always Fireball. It used to be known as Dr. McGillicuddy's Fireball Whisky before its maker, the Sazerac Co., rebranded it in 2006. Sales were modest until about five years ago, when Sazerac hired a ""national brand ambassador,"" Richard Pomes, to spread the word about Fireball through event planning and bartender outreach. In other words, Pomes traveled the country serving up Fireball shots in bars. He started in college towns and cities with vibrant bar cultures, such as Austin and Nashville, and then spread to other places. Everywhere he went, Pomes shared his Fireballing exploits on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and encouraged patrons to do the same. Soon, Fireball started gaining traction. Then it exploded. Retail sales jumped from just under $2 million in 2011 to $63 million in 2013 to $130 million last year, according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. Along the way, Sazerac has cultivated a party-hearty social ethos around Fireball, encouraging pics of shots with hashtags such as #WhiskyWednesday. The brand has more than 85,000 followers on Twitter and another 43,000 on Instagram -- more than twice the social reach of Jagermeister -- although on Twitter, it still trails Jack Daniel's whiskey and Patron tequila. And it got a boost in October when someone taped a GoPro camera to a large bottle of the liquor and filmed dozens of guests chugging from it at a wedding reception. The resulting video has more than 2.3 million YouTube views. ""Our fans love it, and they spread the word. The Fireball nation is devoted -- and this is the best kind of marketing,"" said Amy Preske, public relations and events manager for Sazerac, who declined to offer any further explanation for the brand's booming popularity. ""We are very excited and humbled."" So is Fireball a future cornerstone of every well-stocked bar or just a fad? It may be too soon to say. Retail sales remain strong, according to IRI, although Fireball's skyrocketing growth has slowed in recent months. But it's under siege from several fronts. The past year has brought copycats Jim Beam Kentucky Fire and Jack Daniels Tennessee Fire, both bourbon whiskeys infused with spicy cinnamon syrup, along with cinnamon vodkas, cinnamon tequilas and other cinnamon liqueurs. Fireball also endured a public-relations mess last fall when several European countries briefly recalled the liquor over concerns about one of its ingredients: propylene glycol, a chemical used in a variety of food products, e-cigarettes and antifreeze. Sazerac responded that propylene glycol exists in Fireball ""in very small quantities"" -- less than 1/8th of the amount allowed by the FDA (PDF) -- and reassured customers that Fireball is ""absolutely safe to drink."" Then there's the question of whether Fireball will become a victim of its own success. Young consumers are notoriously fickle, and there is anecdotal evidence that some people are getting sick of it. ""It just reached a point where I couldn't drink it anymore,"" said Jones, the Atlanta bartender. ""I think it was the sugar."" Still, its popularity remains on display nightly wherever young people gather. Glasses are raised, someone makes a toast, and down go shots of an orange, syrupy and seemingly unstoppable concoction. ""It's an easy shot. You can drink a lot of them. With Fireball, you don't need a chaser,"" said Kelvin Davis, a bartender at the Nook in Atlanta. ""It's the one thing I can throw out there and it never fails.""","Fireball Cinnamon Whisky is the fastest-growing big brand of liquor in America .

"(CNN)Discovery of the body of a young girl who may have been dead for weeks has led to the arrest of her teen sister -- herself a mother -- and a search for the girls' parents, who may be in California with five other children, police in North Las Vegas, Nevada, said. The investigation began Wednesday when the 4-month-old infant of the 17-year-old was taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in suburban Las Vegas, authorities said. Police arrested the teen mother on one count of child abuse with substantial bodily harm. She was taken to a juvenile facility. Police department spokesman Aaron Patty told CNN affiliate KVVU that the ""infant did not receive the proper care and nourishment that she needed at the time, which is what led to the arrest of the 17-year-old."" A day later, a search warrant was served at the family's home. That's when police found the body of the 3-year-old girl, who had apparently been dead ""for at least a few weeks,"" according to police. The teen mother was then arrested on one count of child abuse with death in connection with her younger sister's death, according to a police statement. The parents left the home several months ago with the other five children, ranging in age from 1 to 9 years old, but, according to Patty, ""they left the 3-year-old child and the 17-year-old sister at the residence alone."" Authorities are seeking the parents, 39-year-old Jondrew Lachaux and 38-year-old Kellie Phillips. Police say the five children with them may be in danger. ""We believe that they went to California at some time and may have gone back and forth during this multiple month process when they left,"" Patty said. No Amber Alert was issued, according to police, because the 4-month-old did not die. Lachaux and Phillips, who are the child's grandparents, are being sought for questioning. ""We are asking for the assistance of the public in locating these two individuals,"" said Patty. ""We believe they can answer many questions on what led up to the death of this child."" The 4-month-old infant was last reported to be hospitalized in critical condition. Her mother's name was not disclosed.","Parents wanted for questioning after girl's body found at home .

"Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya (CNN)At first glance, Sudan looks like any other northern white rhino: stout and agile, with square lips. He grazes under the hot sun, his massive head lowered to the ground,  at  the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in central Kenya. When he's not wallowing in his enclosure, he waddles around the sprawling savannah, stopping briefly to drink water from a concrete hole. But Sudan is not just any rhino. He's the last known male northern white rhino left in the entire world. For an animal on the verge of extinction, the fate of the subspecies rests on his ability to conceive with the two female northern white rhinos at the conservancy. Sudan's female companions,  Fatu and Najin, live at the conservancy, where experts are scrambling to ensure the subspecies does not go extinct. The animals are under 24-hour protection by armed guards. Rhinos are targeted by poachers, fueled by the belief in Asia that their horns cure various ailments. Experts say the rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs. In addition to round-the-clock security, the conservancy has put radio transmitters on the animals and dispatches incognito rangers into neighboring communities to gather intelligence on poaching. The conservancy is also raising funds to help equip and train rangers who guard the rhinos. At 42, Sudan is elderly in rhino years. Fatu, 15, is a spring chicken, while Najin is 25. Though the three northern white rhinos are physiologically healthy, age might be a factor, says George Paul, the deputy veterinarian at the conservancy. ""Sudan is currently old and may not be able to naturally mount and mate with a female,"" he says. In addition, he has a low sperm count, which complicates natural and scientific efforts, experts say. Najin could conceive, but her hind legs are so weak, she may be unable to support a mounted male. ""There has been recorded mating between different pairs over the last few years, but not conceptions,"" Paul says. ""Based on  a recent health examination conducted, both animals have a regular estrus cycle, but no conception has been recorded."" And if one is not recorded soon, the beloved animal will go extinct. Rhinos on a plane: Life-saving mission across borders . In a race against time, international experts are resorting to science to try to sustain the subspecies. The northern white rhino cannot mate with a black rhino, but there is a chance it could mate with a southern white rhino, Paul says. While southern white rhinos are not endangered --  Ol Pejeta has 19 -- they are a different subspecies  from the northern white rhino genetically. Though the offspring would not be 100% northern white rhino, it would be better than nothing, experts say. A committee at the conservancy is also looking at various alternative reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilization. ""In other countries, success has been achieved with embryo transfer in a different rhino species, thus that, as a technique, can be presupposed to be the most promising,"" Paul says. ""However, consultations are ongoing amongst different reproductive technique experts on the way forward."" Bringing rhinos back to Uganda, one calf at a time . The need to preserve the northern white rhino is dire. ""Realistically, we are looking at these animals dying in the next decade or so. But hopefully, using artificial methods of reproduction, we might be able to bring them back in the future,"" Paul says. ""This might mean that it will happen when the current animals are already deceased, but it could happen."" The conservancy acquired the northern white rhinos --  two males and two females -- in 2009 from a zoo in the Czech Republic. Suni, the other male northern white rhino at the conservancy, died last year. In another incident, another male, Angalifu, died at the San Diego Zoo last year, bringing the subspecies closer to extinction. There are no known northern white rhinos left in the wild. A total of five remain in captivity worldwide: three in Kenya,  and one each at zoos in San Diego and the Czech Republic. But Sudan, a male, is in a company of one. 11 wildlife experiences that could vanish in your lifetime .","Sudan is one of a handful of northern white rhinos left worldwide .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)The death toll from the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal two days ago surged past 3,000 on Monday, a government official said. The desperate search for survivors from the country's worst natural disaster in more than 80 years continued. The number of people confirmed dead in Nepal stands at 3,218, said Nepalese Ministry of Home Affairs spokesman Laxmi Dhakal. India has reported 56 deaths, and China another 20. The death toll is expected to climb further as officials get information from the rugged countryside that makes up most of Nepal. As day broke Monday, Nepal was still in survival mode after suffering a series of aftershocks following the huge initial quake on Saturday. The damage was everywhere. Stunned residents wandered the streets of Kathmandu, the capital city of roughly 3 million people that's now the focus of international disaster relief efforts. People dug through piles of debris where their homes once stood, seeking pieces of their former lives and, possibly, family members. Many of the injured were treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dhakal, the government spokesman, said Monday 6,525 people were reported to have been injured. One video aired on Nepal State Television captured a rare bright moment amid the death and devastation. It shows uniformed officers digging though rubble, desperately trying to free a man who is hurt but alive. Rescuers lift him up, and cheers of joy erupt from the crowd. The clip shows him being put on a stretcher and carried to safety. But often, searchers have found bodies rather than survivors. And the odds of saving the living decrease as the crucial first 72 hours tick by. The earthquake and its aftershocks have turned one of the world's most scenic regions into a panorama of devastation. ""The journey towards my family home in Sitapaila was a map of quake destruction, with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart,"" wrote freelance journalist Sunir Pandey. ""A high wall surrounding a monastery had collapsed and the nuns had run to a nearby field,"" he wrote. ""A mud-and-brick cottage had fallen on a blue motorbike but no trace could be found of its rider. Everywhere, survivors gathered wherever they could find open space -- fields, private compounds, empty roadside lots."" At night, many Nepalis slept in the open, shivering in the frigid air of the Himalayan Mountains but at least safe from falling debris. ""The entire city was under darkness,"" Christina Berry of England wrote for CNN affiliate IBN from Kathmandu. ""There was not a single light anywhere. The power supply had been cut off. Our caring hotel manager gave us some food and some candles, too. Me and Alexandra were so scared. We slept in the open verandah of the hotel fearing more quakes in the night."" Read earthquake stories from social media . CNN producer Ingrid Formanek, who arrived Sunday night, said Kathmandu ""looks like a city where buildings have been abandoned. People are hanging out in public squares and at intersections to avoid rubble from buildings."" ""We were able to drive the main road to the hotel we're staying at, but they're not allowing anyone inside because of the aftershocks. The guests are in a big tent used for functions on the lawn. People are squeezed in. There are probably about 100 people in there,"" Formanek said. ""The tents are covered, but water is seeping in from streets puddled with water, especially around the edges of the tent."" Residents of Kathmandu are banding together to get by, with stores shuttered and very few sources of food and drinkable water. ""Communal kitchens have been set up for cooking,"" Formanek said. ""Not by the government -- people set them up on their own."" Many of the city's centuries-old buildings, which had stood stalwart for generations and provided a sense of national pride, have been toppled. Dozens of bodies were pulled from Dharahara, the historic nine-story tower that came crashing down during the quake. A backhoe chipped away at the nub left protruding through its crumbled ruins. When it seemed as if things couldn't get worse, a powerful aftershock jolted Nepal on Sunday, sending people screaming into the streets and causing new injuries for already traumatized residents. Climbers said it set off fresh avalanches on Mount Everest, where at least 17 people were reported to have been killed on Saturday. The magnitude of the new quake Sunday was initially estimated at 6.7 by the U.S. Geological Survey, considerably weaker than the magnitude-7.8 of the devastating one of a day earlier. Four Americans were confirmed to be among the dead. Google executive Dan Fredinburg was one of them. According to an Instagram post by his sister on his account, an avalanche killed Fredinburg on Mount Everest. Marisa Eve Girawong, who went by her middle name, of New Jersey also was killed by an avalanche on Everest. The physician's assistant was working as an Everest base camp doctor for Seattle-based Madison Mountaineering, when she was swept away to her death. Tom Taplin, a filmmaker from Santa Monica, California, was making a documentary on Everest climbers, when wind stirred by the avalanche caused him to take a fall, CNN affiliate KABC reported.

"Delhi (CNN)An international human rights group is calling for an independent investigation of the killings by police of 20 suspected red sandalwood smugglers in southeastern India. ""There must be a criminal investigation to determine whether the police used excessive force, and whether the killings amount to 'fake encounters,' or staged extrajudicial executions"", said Abhirr Vp, of Amnesty International India. ""The police are not above the law, and must not be treated like they are."" Those responsible should be brought to justice, according to Amnesty. ""Lethal force should not be used except when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life,"" Vp said. A police official, Deputy Inspector General Kantha Rao, declined comment Wednesday, saying an ""investigation is still going on."" The incident in question took place early Tuesday in India's southeastern Andhra Pradesh state. Forest officials near the town of Tirupati spotted hundreds of smugglers cutting trees for red sandalwood, Rao said Tuesday. The forest officials, who were unarmed, called for police. ""We saw several trees chopped down,"" Rao said said. ""These guys came prepared and were heavily armed."" Rao said that the ensuing gun battle lasted more than three hours and 20 smugglers were shot. Many of them came from the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu, he said. Amnesty International said the police were claiming self-defense, alleging the suspects attacked them with stone and axes. ""However, no police official was injured,"" the  Amnesty statement said. ""Most of the suspected smugglers were shot in the back."" According to Amnesty, India's National Human Rights Commission has said the incident ""involved a serious violation of human rights of the individuals,"" and that ""the opening of firing cannot be justified on the ground of self defense since it resulted in the loss of lives of 20 persons."" The commission has asked senior government and police officials to explain the actions of the police and forest officials within two weeks, Amnesty said. Police said sandalwood smuggling is common in the area. Local media are reporting that politicians from Tamil Nadu have lodged a protest against the Andhra Pradesh government, saying the alleged smugglers were murdered in cold blood.

"Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic testimony, jurors are set to begin deliberations Tuesday in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who faces life in prison or  the death penalty for working with his brother to explode bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon. The defense and prosecution made closing arguments in the case on Monday. ""The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. ""The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahideen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots Day, Marathon Monday,"" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted each other in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of 8-year-old bomb victim Martin Richard, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ""chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,"" Chakravarty said. ""He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children."" The lawyer waited a beat. ""He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people."" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, ""they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahideen and they were bringing their battle to Boston."" Tsarnaev, 21 years old, stands accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began on March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. ""He was there,"" defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. The prosecution on Monday played a graphic video of the scene of the bombing that showed a chaotic, bloody scene with injured people everywhere. A child's piercing cries are heard. It's the son of Rebekah Gregory, who lost her leg. Then, another photo is displayed. This time jurors see Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of little Martin Richard. ""These children weren't innocent to him,"" the prosecutor said. ""They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do."" Chakravarty quoted Bill Richard, Martin's father, who earlier testified, ""I guess we were just unlucky that day."" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. ""This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,"" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, ""to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' "" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. ""It was Tamerlan,"" defense attorney Clarke repeated during her closing argument Monday. ""In the past few weeks we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,"" she said. ""We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain there is no excuse."" She acknowledged her client participated in a ""senseless act."" But he was only following his brother, she insisted. ""If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,"" Clarke argued. The older brother, a 26-year-old former Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has said. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's ""attempt to point the finger at somebody else."" ""There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,"" he said. They were ""partners in crime."" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. ""Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,"" the prosecutor said. If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?"" From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-yeaer-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims: . Richard's 69-pound body ""was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed."" Lu ""received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open and she bled out."" Krystle Campbell died in less than a minute from ""massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded."" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, ""never had a chance."" He was shot between the eyes. ""They assassinated him."" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officier for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. ""Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,"" the prosecutor said Monday. ""He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans."" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a ""manifesto,"" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan.

"(CNN)To allay possible concerns, Boston prosecutors released video Friday of the shooting of a police officer last month that resulted in the killing of the gunman. The officer wounded, John Moynihan, is white. Angelo West, the gunman shot to death by officers, was black. After the shooting, community leaders in the predominantly African-American neighborhood of Roxbury, where the shooting occurred, were quick to call for calm. One said the officers were forced to return fire. Still, they were glad to see the video released for the sake of transparency. ""I think people understand that the decisions Mr. West made put his life in grave jeopardy,"" clergyman Mark V. Scott told CNN affiliate WCVB. West had several prior gun convictions, police said. Moynihan is a former U.S. Army Ranger who was honored at the White House for his heroism in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. The ""Top Cop"" helped save a transit officer wounded in a gunbattle with the bombers. Last month, he became a gunshot victim when he and other officers in unmarked cars, but with blue lights flashing, stopped the car West was driving. When Moynihan opened the driver's-side door, the video shows, West sprang out and fired a shot with a pistol at the officer's face. As West ran away, he fired back at the other officers with his .357 Magnum handgun, police said. They returned fire and killed him. Moynihan, 34, survived with a bullet wound under one eye. He was placed in a medically induced coma at a Boston hospital. On Saturday, Moynihan was released from the hospital. ""His condition is best described as serious but improving,"" Boston police said in a statement. ""In the days after the shooting, John and his family have been strengthened, humbled and inspired by the outpouring of love and support they've received -- not only from his closest friends and fellow officers -- but also from concerned citizens and strangers from all over the country wishing him a full and speedy recovery."" A woman who was driving by at the time of the shooting suffered a flesh wound in the right arm. She was not identified. Two passengers in the car were arrested on unrelated charges involving an outstanding warrant and a probation violation. ""None of our officers like to use their firearms,""  Police Commissioner William Evans said at the time. ""It's probably the worst thing we have to do in our profession, but here, clearly unprovoked, one of our officers is shot point-blank in the face."" In April 2013, Moynihan was among officers who helped save transit officer Richard H. Donohue Jr., who was shot during a gunfight involving Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the days after the marathon bombings. In the battle, police fired nearly 300 rounds within five to 10 minutes. Moynihan and other Massachusetts officers were cited for their ""heroic and relentless"" life-saving measures on Donohue, who nearly lost his entire blood volume on the Watertown street. At a White House ceremony in May, President Barack Obama honored Moynihan and 52 other officers as ""America's Top Cops."" After Moynihan was wounded and West killed, police and and local leaders sought to allay community concerns at a time when officer-involved shootings have led to protests throughout the nation. Scott, of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston, said Moynihan was shot ""assassination-style."" He called for calm in Roxbury. ""This is not about 'Black Lives Matter,' "" he said, referring to a protest movement that emerged after the shootings. ""It's about 'All Lives in the Community Matter,' and it's about the police ... responding to a concern from the community.""

"Tulsa, Oklahoma (CNN)The Tulsa County deputy who shot and killed a man instead of using his Taser now faces a manslaughter charge. Video shows Reserve Deputy Robert Bates announcing he is going to deploy his Taser after an undercover weapons sting on April 2, but then shooting Eric Courtney Harris in the back with a handgun. In a written statement, Tulsa County District Attorney Stephen A. Kunzweiler said Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter involving culpable negligence. It's a felony charge that could land the volunteer deputy in prison for up to four years if he's found guilty. Scott Wood, an attorney who represents Bates, said the shooting was an ""excusable homicide."" ""We believe the video itself proves that it was an accident of misfortune that occurred while Deputy Bates was fulfilling his duties as a reserve deputy,"" Wood said. ""He is not guilty of second-degree manslaughter."" Investigators' efforts to defend Bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online. Harris' family is demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality. They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation. Daniel Smolen, an attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time. ""It's absolutely mind boggling that you have a wealthy businessman who's been essentially deputized to go play like he's some outlaw, like he's just cleaning up the streets,"" he said. Wood said his client -- who had donated cars and video equipment to the Sheriff's Office -- had undergone all the required training and had participated in more than 100 operations with the task force he was working with the day he shot Harris. But he'd never been the main deputy in charge of arresting a suspect, Wood said, but was thrust into the situation because Harris ran from officers during the arrest. ""Probably in the past four of five years since he has been working in conjunction with the task force he has been on, (there were) in excess of 100 operations or search warrants where he was placed on the outer perimeter,"" Wood said. ""He has never been on an arrest team or been the one who is primarily responsible for the capture or the arrest of a suspect. He is there more in a support mechanism."" Bates, who worked as a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a reserve deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience, according to the Sheriff's Office. He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, including $2,500 to the reelection of Sheriff Stanley Glanz. Tulsa County Sheriff's Maj. Shannon Clark denied accusations that Bates had paid to play a cop, describing him as one of many volunteers in the community who have contributed to the agency. ""No matter how you cut it up, Deputy Bates met all the criteria on the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training to be in the role that he was in,"" Clark said. After the shooting, Bates told investigators that he was ""in a state of shock and disbelief"" after realizing he'd fired his gun. He also said he believed there was a ""strong possibility"" that Harris had a gun. Wood said Monday that Bates is upset over the shooting. ""Obviously he is very upset about what happened. He feels badly,"" he said. ""The incident completely took him by surprise. He has all the requisite training. He is TASER-certified, and if you watch the video you know he was quite shocked when his gun went off."" Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his Taser but ""inadvertently"" fired his gun. They've painted Harris as a dangerous, possibly PCP-addled illegal gun dealer who had recently sold methamphetamine to undercover police and who fled police that day in such a way as to give the impression that he had a gun in his waistband. Though Harris was later determined to be unarmed, Sgt. Jim Clark of the Tulsa Police Department, who has been brought in to review the case, excused the behavior of Bates and an officer who is heard cursing at Harris in the video. Clark said Bates was the ""victim"" of something called ""slip and capture,"" where in a high-stress situation, a person intends to do one thing and instead does something else. It's a controversial argument that drew sharp criticism online as soon as police started making it. One expert told CNN the claim amounts to ""junk science."" ""It's not something that's supported by a testable theory. There's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this. ... It's not generally accepted by the scientific community,"" said Phil Stinson, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University. ""So it's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence."" Andre Harris told reporters Monday that claims his brother was violent and on PCP are false. ""He was nonviolent, he was peaceful, he was loving, he was caring, and he was my brother that I'll never see again 'til I see him in heaven,"" Harris told reporters, accusing the sheriff's office of trying to persuade him not to hire an attorney and quickly make the case ""go away."" He added that the shooting of his brother, who was African-American, wasn't a racial matter. ""I don't think this is a racial thing. I don't think this has anything to do with race. It might have a hint there somewhere. ... This is simply evil,"" Andre Harris told reporters Monday. ""This is a group of people that's spent a lot of time together, spent money together. ... They've gotten real comfortable with how they do things, which when you're the law, I guess you feel like you can do things and get away with it and not get exposed. ""Well, we've come to expose it. We've come to pull a mask off the evil. We've come to shine a light on the darkness."" CNN's Ed Lavandera and Jason Morris reported from Tulsa. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.

"Rome (CNN)Muslims who were among migrants trying to get from Libya to Italy in a boat this week threw 12 fellow passengers overboard -- killing them -- because the 12 were Christians, Italian police said Thursday. Italian authorities have arrested 15 people on suspicion of murdering the Christians at sea, police in Palermo, Sicily, said. Why migrants are dying to get to Italy . The original group of 105 people left Libya on Tuesday in a rubber boat. Sometime during the trip north across the Mediterranean Sea, the alleged assailants -- Muslims from the Ivory Coast, Mali and Senegal -- threw the 12 overboard, police said. Other people on the voyage told police that they themselves were spared ""because they strongly opposed the drowning attempt and formed a human chain,"" Palermo police said. The boat was intercepted by an Italian navy vessel, which transferred the passengers to a Panamanian-flagged ship. That ship docked in Palermo on Wednesday, after which the arrests were made, police said. 'I enter Europe or I die': Desperate migrants rescued this week off Italy . The 12 who died were from Nigeria and Ghana, police said. Thousands of people each year make the dangerous sea journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast, often aboard vessels poorly equipped for the trip. Many of them attempt the voyage to flee war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. More than 10,000 people have arrived on Italian shores from Libya since last weekend alone, according to the Italian coast guard. Many die each year while attempting the voyage, often when boats capsized. Last year at least 3,200 died trying to make the trip. Since 2000, according to the International Organization for Migration, almost 22,000 people have died fleeing across the Mediterranean. The IOM reported Thursday the latest boat to sink in trying to make the journey. Only four people survived from the original 45 on board, bringing the estimated death toll so far this year close to a thousand. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome, and CNN's Livia Borghese reported from Augusta, Sicily. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta.

"(CNN)An Arizona police chief on Wednesday supported an officer's decision to drive his car into an armed suspect, saying that although the move could have killed the suspect, deadly force was justified. Video of the incident, recorded February 19 by the dashboard cameras of two Marana police cars, shows one of the cars running into a suspect with who had a rifle in the city about a half hour from Tucson. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's ""New Day"" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. ""That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,"" Rozema said. ""So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,"" the chief added. The footage has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Officer Michael Rapiejko's camera shows Rapiejko's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. ""We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,"" Rozema said. ""And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' "" The video has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used to detain the man. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that ""it is miraculous that my client isn't dead."" ""Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force, Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several incidents there the day he was struck. At 6:45 a.m. on February 19, Valencia allegedly robbed a 7-Eleven in Tucson with a metal object in his hand. Authorities said he was dressed only in his underwear. He was charged with theft. A little more than an hour later, police said, Valencia set a fire at a church for which he was charged with arson of an occupied structure. Just after that he entered a home and stole a car, police said. Authorities said he drove to a Walmart in Marana, where he allegedly stole a .30-30 rifle and ammunition. He fled the store with Walmart employees in pursuit. Police encountered him in a business park walking down the road. An officer told him several times to drop the rifle, Lt. Tim Brunenkant with Marana police said in an email containing a timeline of events. Valencia, police said, walked away from the officer, turned a corner and stopped. Valencia pointed the rifle at the officer then walked away again toward a Coca-Cola bottling plant and another business. ""As Mario Valencia briskly walked towards Sargent Controls (local manufacturer), Officer Michael Rapiejko uses his marked police car to stop the dangerous situation Mario Valencia created,"" Brunenkant wrote. Brunenkant also said by phone that before Rapiejko's encounter with Valencia, the suspect had pointed the rifle at his head multiple times and threatened suicide before fleeing. Rozema said that Valencia's firing of the weapon, his refusal to obey the first officer's commands to drop the gun and the pointing of the gun at the officer were key. ""And so you have another officer who sees and seizes an opportunity to end the threat and put an end to the situation,"" the chief said. Cohen-Metzger criticized the fact that Rapiejko hit Valencia from behind. ""My client's back was turned and the officer drove right into him,"" she said. ""It isn't that dissimilar to a police officer shooting a fleeing suspect in the back."" CNN affiliate KOLD reported Valencia was in serious condition when he was taken to the hospital and was released into police custody two days later. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer.

"(CNN)The accidental death of a 2-year-old boy in Milwaukee on Sunday triggered a violent chain of events, eventually claiming the lives of three more people. It all started with a birthday party that little Damani Terry was attending. During the family gathering, he dashed out into the street and was struck and killed by a GMC van, according to Milwaukee police. The distraught driver, Archie Brown Jr., 40, immediately stopped and got out to tend to the boy. But it was too late, police said. Damani was dead. Damani's alarmed family came running, including his older brother, 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles, police said. That was not the end of the situation. Soon, two more people would also die: the driver and the teen were both felled by bullets fired by the same man, police said. That man, identified as Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, was located late Wednesday at a Chicago-area hotel. He committed suicide as authorities closed in with a warrant for his arrest, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn told reporters. ""Chicago police and United States Marshals Service entered the hotel room, whereupon Mr. Chiles took his own life with his firearm,"" the police chief said Thursday. An accidental death, a fatal retaliation rips apart two families . Damani's family members had previously identified the shooting suspect as the boys' uncle. ""Sunday was the worst day I ever lived in my whole entire life,"" Lena Tidwell, told CNN affiliate WISN. ""It's a day I wish had never, never came."" Tidwell is the boys' grandmother and the mother of the alleged gunman. She said she was inside eating cake and ice cream at the birthday when her life turned upside down. ""I didn't know my grandbaby got hit, and then I heard people just screaming,"" she said. ""Then I just heard gunshots, and my daughter ran in the house with the baby in her arms."" The family believes the uncle targeted Brown, and Rasheed was struck by an errant bullet. ""I heard he was trying to pick his brother up. He was trying to hold him and save him,"" a family friend, Stephanie Townsend, told CNN affiliate WITI. Earlier this week, Flynn bemoaned the apparent madness of what happened. ""What did we have Sunday?"" Flynn asked.

"(CNN)The Arizona police officer who intentionally slammed his car into an armed suspect previously faced an excessive force lawsuit in New York, according to court documents. Officer Michael Rapiejko was with the New York Police Department from 2003 to 2006. Two years after he left, he was one of the defendants in a suit filed by a man who alleged that Rapiejko pointed a gun and threatened to shoot him and handcuffed and choked him in front of his family during a 2005 arrest. The lawsuit said Luis Colon had parked his car and gotten out when Rapiejko, with his gun aimed at Colon, ordered him back into the car. During his arrest on charges of obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Colon alleged he was yanked from the car, handcuffed and choked. The charges against Colon were dropped six months later. Colon also sued two unnamed officers who arrived after the initial confrontation, court documents show. Colon and the city settled the suit for $20,000. The settlement said the defendants were not admitting to any wrongdoing . Rapiejko had resigned voluntarily in 2006, and there is no indication of any disciplinary action against him from the NYPD, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. The NYPD has said that it will not release further details about Rapiejko. Rapiejko's actions in Marana, Arizona, in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer, have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer for the February incident. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's ""New Day"" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. ""That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive.

"(CNN)After a weekend shipwreck off the coast of Italy that may have killed hundreds of migrants, the International Organization for Migrants said Monday that there may be three more migrant boats in distress in international waters. Authorities still don't know the fate of many of the passengers, including children, who were on the large ship bound from Libya to Europe that capsized Saturday night in the frigid waters of the Mediterranean Sea. That sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages. ""Gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat, sometimes even at gunpoint,"" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said. ""They're putting them on the road to death, really, and nothing else."" A rescue operation is still underway for people who were on the ship from Libya, and the number of potential victims is not clear. A Bangladeshi survivor told investigators there were 950 people on board. Previous estimates put the number around 700. Maltese authorities, who are working with Italian rescuers, said around 50 people had been saved. But the Italian Coast Guard said 28 people had been rescued and 24 bodies recovered. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. On Monday, European Union ministers met in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. ""We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,"" Federica Mogherini told CNN's ""The World Right Now with Hala Gorani."" The EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy said the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. ""We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,"" Mogherini said. ""My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died."" Migrants have been attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sudden surge in the past 10 days, along with a grim spike in the number of those who are killed en route. Already this year, more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the Mediterranean, far more than during the same period in 2014, the International Organization for Migration said last week. Since the beginning of 2015, more than 35,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea -- 23,500 have landed in Italy and more than 12,000 in Greece, according to the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights. While those numbers sound high, they were even higher the previous year. In 2014, approximately 219,000 refugees and migrants sailed across the Mediterranean, with most having to be rescued by the Italian Navy, Coast Guard or merchant ships, the UNCHR said. It is estimated that 3,500 people in 2014 died at sea. On Monday, yet another boat sank off the Greek island of Rhodes, killing at least three people, the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said. Of the 83 people reported on board, at least 57 survived. Those confirmed dead were a man, a woman and a child. The capsizing of the ship that departed from Libya marked the worst such disaster so far. As rescuers approached the boat in response to a distress call Saturday night, authorities say, migrants moved to one side, hoping to be saved. Their movement caused the large, multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya, sending many passengers plunging into the sea. According to one Bangladeshi survivor, large numbers of people remained trapped inside the boat as it sank. Smugglers -- human traffickers organizing the voyages -- had locked the doors to the lower levels of the vessel, the survivor told Italian authorities. ""Our troops, together with the Italian navy, are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who's still alive,"" Muscat said. While the shipwreck was an accident, Muscat slammed the human traffickers whom he accused of risking people's lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters. It's ""genocide -- nothing less than genocide, really,"" Muscat told CNN. ""A mass grave is being created in the Mediterranean Sea and European policies are responsible,"" said Loris De Filippi, the president of the international aid group Doctors Without Borders. He compared the high number of deaths to ""figures from a war zone."" De Filippi called on European states to immediately launch large-scale search and rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to Libyan shores. ""Faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises, Europe has closed borders, forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea,"" he said. ""This tragedy is only just beginning, but it can and should be stopped."" Save the Children similarly called on European officials to do more. ""What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,"" the group's CEO Justin Forsyth said in a statement. ""With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss. Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics."" Many of the migrants who board ships to cross the Mediterranean come from sub-Saharan Africa, often traveling for weeks or months just to get to the ships. They're seeking a better life, but many are exploited by the ruthless smugglers who organize the voyages. ""There is a well-oiled machine with the human traffickers, first by land and then by sea, and they feel the need for these desperate people who just want to get to Europe at all costs,"" said Rome-based journalist Barbie Nadeau. The situation on board the boat that sank over the weekend isn't unusual, based on accounts of previous voyages. On old fishing boats, ""people are crammed into what used to be the frozen live tank compartments in the bottom of the ship,"" Nadeau said. ""Those are the cheaper tickets. People that want to be out on the upper deck, which is the prime space, pay a little more for that service."" Traffickers are believed to charge anywhere from 6,000 euros to 8,000 euros ($6,450 to $8,600) per person for the dangerous voyage, she said. Italy's proximity to the North African coast puts it on the front line of tackling the continent's migration crisis. ""We're swamped,"" Sandro Gozi, the Italian minister for European affairs, told French daily Le Monde. ""There's not even enough space in Sicily's cemeteries to bury the dead."" An Italian search and rescue program, Mare Nostrum, was credited with rescuing more than 160,000 migrants in the space of a year. But it ended in October because of budget constraints and criticism from the European Union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the Mediterranean. The European Union's border control agency, Frontex, started its own mission in November, known as Triton, with a budget of less than a third of that of Mare Nostrum. Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend it ships. As anti-immigrant parties thrive across the continent, European nations are collectively struggling to cope with the migration crisis on their doorstep. ""We can't act as if each tragedy is the last while crossing our fingers that another one doesn't happen,"" Gozi told Le Monde, lamenting ""a total absence"" of European Union policy on how to deal with refugees arriving in Europe. The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, said Sunday it was consulting member states, European agencies and international organizations to prepare what it called a European Migration Strategy to be adopted in mid-May. ""These are human lives at stake, and the European Union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act,"" it said. But international groups say European governments are failing to do enough. Doctors Without Borders will begin its own rescue effort, De Filippi said, because ""as a medical, humanitarian organization, we simply cannot wait any longer.""

"(CNN)The reserve deputy who shot a suspect with his firearm rather than his stun gun, and another deputy who can be heard cursing at the suspect after he was shot, were not in their normal states of mind because of the elevated stress of apprehending the suspect, according to a Tulsa, Oklahoma, investigator. Tulsa Police Sgt. Jim Clark, who has been brought in to review the case, said Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Bates, 73, ""inadvertently"" shot Eric Courtney Harris after Harris -- a possibly PCP-addled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer -- ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting. As deputies tried to handcuff Harris, Bates arrived with a pepper spray gun in hand. He warned his fellow deputies he was going to use a Taser on the suspect, but instead, he fired a single gunshot -- and immediately apologized, Clark said, citing a recently released video. Clark attributed Bates' actions to a phenomenon known as ""slip and capture."" An example is when someone who drives a car with a manual transmission gets behind the wheel of a car with an automatic transmission. The driver will press her or his left foot down when stopping abruptly, even though there's no clutch pedal, he said. Quoting Bill Lewinski, executive director of the Force Science Institute, Clark further explained: ""These are mistakes that are made when you think you are doing one thing but you actually are doing another, and the result often is directly opposite of what you intended. In effect, your intended behavior slips off the path that you want it to go because it is captured by a stronger response and sent to a different direction."" Bates announced that he was going to deploy his Taser, and he pulled the trigger only once, as he was trained to do, Clark said. Police are trained to ""double-tap"" when firing their handguns, he said. The gun jumped out of Bates' hand because he wasn't expecting recoil, Clark said, and Bates expressed surprise and remorse that he had shot Harris. Quoting Lewinski again, Clark said, ""This is the slip and capture. Under time pressure to address a perceived threat, his intention to draw his Taser slipped off his agenda, so to speak, when it was captured and completed by a more well-rehearsed motor program. ... He was not conscious of this unfortunate switch until after the shot was fired. In his urgency, his concentration was focused exclusively on Harris' back, where he intended to place the Taser darts. Because of what's called 'inattentional blindness,' meaning that he wasn't consciously paying attention to and registering it, he wouldn't have been aware that the feel of the gun was different from that of the Taser. And in this case the weight of the gun and Taser are nearly identical."" Clark was emphatic that Bates had done nothing criminally wrong and went so far as to say the reserve deputy was a victim. ""Reserve Deputy Bates did not commit a crime. Reserve Deputy Bates was a victim, a true victim of slip and capture,"" he said. ""There's no other determination I could come to."" When they set up the undercover sting, police wanted evidence on camera. But when they recorded the operation targeting Harris earlier this month, cameras continued to roll as the suspect ran, and as he was fatally shot. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office released the video on Friday. The shooting was an apparent accident, it has said. In the last minutes of the video, Harris lies on the pavement with police on top of him. An officer calls for a Taser, but in place of an electric clicking sound, a gunshot rings out. A voice can be heard saying, ""Oh! I shot him! I'm sorry!""  Another officer screams out, ""He shot him! He shot him!"" Harris, who is bleeding, calls out, too. He's losing his breath, he says. An officer yells back at him. ""You f**king ran! Shut the f**k up!"" he yells. ""F**k your breath,"" he said. Clark defended the officer's language, saying the deputy experienced auditory exclusion, never heard the gunshot and thought the suspect was out of breath from running. The language has no bearing on whether the shooting was justified, Clark said. ""One deputy thought he was going to have to shoot this person at the arrest site. It's very upsetting when you think you are going to have to take someone's life and this deputy, one of the involved deputies, was upset,"" he said. ""Secondly, this is total stress. They are going after a dangerous suspect that they have no idea whether or not this person is armed."" Clark added, ""They did not know that he was shot at this time. They had audio exclusion. They was at a point where they couldn't hear. They didn't even hear the gunshot go off. The officers did not know that Mr. Harris had been shot."" An officer can be seen in the video taking his foot off an object lying on the pavement not far from Harris. Shortly after the suspect is shot, the officers begin tugging Harris' hands behind his back as the video ends. Harris later died at a local hospital. Police said at the time of the shooting that Harris admitted to medics at the scene that he may have been under the influence of phencyclidine, a street drug commonly known as PCP. The video is edited to block out the officers' faces. Harris is clearly visible. Minutes earlier, Harris had climbed into a truck cab, where an undercover officer had set up a camera on the dash to record the suspect. ""What's up?"" they greet each other cordially. Without missing a beat, Harris rummages deep in a backpack and hastily hands over a semiautomatic pistol. Every few seconds, he looks around outside nervously. ""Sweet, that's a nice gun, man,"" the undercover officer says off camera. It's a ""German Luger,"" Harris tells him. He cranes his head around quickly and watches as a car pulls up next to the truck. Officers in uniform jump out, and Harris bolts out the passenger door and sprints off. ""He's running; he's running, he's running!"" the officer in the truck says. As Harris fled, police worried he might still be armed because he ran with his right forearm pressed against his hip, ""consistent with trying to maintain control of a gun,"" Clark said, adding that no gun was found when Harris was searched after the chase. Another video from an officer's body camera picks up the chase. The officer wearing it jumps out of a vehicle and pursues Harris on foot, catching up to him easily. He tackles the fleeing suspect. The officer commands him, ""I need you to roll on your stomach. Now!"" Other officers appear. Someone calls, ""Taser! Taser!"" The gun discharges. Much later in the recording made by the first camera inside the truck, two men are conversing. ""He thought it was his Taser,"" one of them says, as the other curses in frustration. In the background, a woman is crying ""No, no, no!"" Harris had come to the sting deal with a female companion. Police have said that Harris had reached for his waistband, and officers feared he might endanger them. When Harris was on the ground, he ""refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand was near his waistband,"" they said after the shooting. The officer's body camera video did not reveal that area of Harris' body. Bates, a former Tulsa police officer, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, the sheriff's office has said. Asked whether Bates' age may have been a factor in the shooting, Clark said, ""It's happened to 21-year-old law enforcement officers. It's happened to 30-year-old law enforcement officers. Age is not really a factor in consideration for the dynamics behind slip and capture events. Despite the details released over the weekend, Harris' brother says he still want answers. ""I want to know if he was shot in the back accidentally or on purpose. These are all the things that not only I want, but the public wants,"" Andre Harris told CNN affiliate KTUL. Bates' attorney, Scott Wood, told CNN on Friday he would contact the network later. He had not issued a statement or called back as of Sunday.

"(CNN)The shootings' main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed. Outside of that, the highly publicized police shootings in Ferguson and North Charleston bear only mild resemblance. So what's changed between the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, and that of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend? And did the backlash and publicity of the Ferguson shooting influence the handling of the North Charleston incident? It's tough to say for sure, but here are some of the stark differences in the cases, the lessons learned by both police and the public, and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future. Ferguson: Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown after the two struggled over Wilson's gun, and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where Wilson was, where Brown was and whether Brown was surrendering or charging the officer. North Charleston: Though it's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone, it's 100% clear from the video that Scott was not posing a threat to Officer Michael Slager when the policeman opened fire on Scott as he ran away. Takeaway: Where Brown's killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said Wilson was justified and those who said Brown was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the Scott shooting. It would be tough to extrapolate for certain, but it's possible that the clear-cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer, and that quick reaction by authorities in South Carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in Ferguson as the process of determining Wilson's fate dragged on for months. Ferguson: Black residents outnumber whites in the St. Louis suburb by more than a 2-to-1 ratio, yet at the time of Brown's shooting, there were only three black officers on the city's 53-member force, and there was only one African-American member of the six-member City Council. (Two more African-Americans were voted in during this week's city's elections.) North Charleston: It's closer to an even split here, with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's police department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of the 10 City Council members are black. Takeaway: The ratio of white and black officers on the North Charleston Police Department appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the Ferguson Police Department, but both are considerably off. As for the city councils, the latest election in Ferguson makes its governing body more representative than North Charleston's. But before you place too much emphasis on the percentages, there are other variables to consider, like policing methods, as CNN political commentator Marc Lamont Hill pointed out. Changing the racial makeup of a department alone won't do the trick if officers aren't taught the best practices. ""Black people didn't march and fight and struggle to have black officers kill us and black officers beat us and black officers harass us,"" he said. ""I want police officers who are capable of doing the job properly. We need community-based policing if we're going to believe that police are the proper force to be in our neighborhoods."" Ferguson: There was no bystander video of Michael Brown's death -- no concrete evidence to support or refute different witness claims about what had transpired. North Charleston: It's unlikely Slager would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness Feidin Santana. Even North Charleston's police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of Scott's shooting. Not only does the video show Slager firing eight shots at Scott as he's running away, it also shows him placing a dark-colored object next to Scott's lifeless body. That could be significant, because Slager initially said Scott had taken his Taser and he feared for his life. But if investigators determine the object dropped next to Scott's body was actually the Taser, Slager could be accused of planting evidence. The takeaway: Ferguson resident Alexis Templeton said what happened in her city helped people across the country to feel empowered to stand up for themselves. The video of the North Charleston shooting, she said, is vital. ""If there is no video, folks don't believe it because it sounds so asinine that something like this would ever happen in this country,"" she said. ""But with a video, you can't say it's not happening."" Ferguson: The largely peaceful protests in Ferguson were marred by looting, arson and even shootings. Violence erupted again in November after Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, wasn't indicted. And even after Ferguson's police chief resigned last month, two officers were shot during a protest at the Ferguson Police Department. North Charleston: After Scott was killed in South Carolina over the weekend, protests in North Charleston have been peaceful so far. The takeaway: Some Ferguson residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way North Charleston is handling its own tragedy. Lee Smith, who recently made an unsuccessful bid for a Ferguson City Council seat, said he was glad to see authorities in South Carolina charge Slager with murder. ""I am hopeful that their motives are right and not just based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the same types of issues that came down in Ferguson,"" Smith said. Ferguson: It took Ferguson police six days to publicly identify Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, then-police chief Thomas Jackson decided not to visit Brown's family. And rather than charge Wilson and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit -- as many civil rights advocates wanted -- the prosecutor in the case instead made the unorthodox choice of presenting both sides himself and letting the grand jury decide whether to charge the officer. North Charleston: Slager was identified by authorities and charged with murder on Tuesday, two days after Santana shared his video with Scott's family. Mayor Keith Summey denounced the shooting and said Slager made a ""bad decision."" Both Summey and the police chief also visited Scott's family. ""When you're wrong, you're wrong,"" he said. ""And if you make a bad decision -- don't care if you're behind the shield or just a citizen on the street -- you have to live by that decision."" The takeaway: Former Ferguson Mayor Brian Fletcher said the city has influenced others. ""I think these situations are given much more scrutiny now,"" said Fletcher, who won a seat on Ferguson's city council this week. ""They have seen what has happened here in Ferguson. Every mayor and city council is very cautious in what they say and what they do."" Ferguson: After Brown's death in August, many asked why Wilson didn't have a body camera. The shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels. Three months later, President Barack Obama pledged $263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers. North Charleston: Slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed Scott. But after the shooting, the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras ""so every officer on the street"" in the city will have one. That's in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, Summey said. The takeaway: Not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras. Some police unions have scoffed at the idea, and the American Civil Liberties Union has cited privacy concerns. They're also expensive. Several camera models cost at least $500 each, and storing all that footage can cost as much as $20,000 a year. But National Urban League President Marc Morial said more body cameras will help protect not just the public, but also police. ""I think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis, it's going to protect good officers who do the right thing,"" Morial said. ""But it's also going to ferret out, if you will, bad actions by bad officers."" CNN's Moni Basu, Gregory Wallace and Wolf Blitzer contributed to the report.","Protests in South Carolina have been calm compared to the violence in Ferguson .
North Charleston's mayor says hundreds of body cameras will be on officers .

"(CNN)Thousands sought refuge in temporary shelters in South Africa after mobs with machetes attacked immigrants in Durban, leaving at least five people dead, an aid group said Thursday. Heavily armed police have scrambled to stop clashes this week after local residents accused immigrants from other African nations of taking their jobs. The attacks in Durban killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. ""There has been an outpouring of support from ordinary South Africans who are disgusted with the attacks not only because they are foreign, or African, but because they are fellow human beings,"" said Gift of the Givers charity, which is helping those seeking refuge. ""We are preparing aid packages for those who may journey onwards to their home countries."" The charity said about 8,500 people fled to refugee centers or police stations this week because of the violence. That doesn't count anyone who fled their homes to other, private accommodations, the group said. It said it hopes the violence is limited to Durban, but assured immigrants that it has a facility in Johannesburg to help those who might need shelter there. ""We have tents and all essential supplies on standby but pray that sanity prevails and this does not become necessary,"" it said. In the past, Johannesburg has been the epicenter of anti-immigrant tensions. In 2008, scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of Johannesburg. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. In that attack, police arrested more than 200 people for various crimes including rape, murder, robbery and theft.","A charity group is preparing aid packages for those who want to return home .

"(CNN)The bizarre circumstances surrounding Freddie Gray's death have inflamed tensions across the country. How could a man suffer a severe spinal cord injury after getting arrested? And what happened in the 30 minutes before he was taken to a hospital? Gray wavered in and out of a coma and died Sunday, one week after his arrest. It's not clear how he suffered the spinal cord injury. But Gray is far from the only suspect who died under questionable circumstances after he was already in custody. Here are several other cases: . Date of arrest: March 31, 2015 . Date of death: March 31, 2015 . What happened: . Police in Vineland, New Jersey, responded to a call of a disorderly person, and White was arrested and handcuffed. Police dispatch recordings include an officer saying White ""tried to grab my gun."" One witness, Agustin Ayala, told the Vineland Daily Journal that White was resisting arrest. But two others told WCAU that police attacked White while he was already handcuffed. ""They punched him, stomped him, kicked him and then they let the dog out of the car,"" Ricardo Garcia told the station. ""The dog bit him on his face and around his body. There's no call for that. Once a man is handcuffed and unconscious, you should have stuck him in the patrol car and take him to the police station."" Witness Luis Martinez gave a similar account. ""The other cop let the dog out, and they just kept punching him and the dog kept biting him at the same time,"" Martinez told WCAU. ""He was on the floor, like he was knocked out."" As White was taken to a hospital, he became unresponsive, NJ.com reported. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. The aftermath: . The Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office has been investigating White's death, and officials have been waiting for the results of White's autopsy to learn the exact cause of death, NJ.com said. Two Vineland officers have been placed on administrative leave. And after Vineland police received criticism on its Facebook page about White's case, the department started hiding unfavorable comments, the Press of Atlantic City reported. An activist filed an Open Public Records Act request, saying the department's official Facebook page was a matter of public record. Vineland police later restored the critical comments on its page. Date of arrest: March 2, 2014 . Date of death: March 2, 2014 . What happened: . Sheriff's deputies in New Iberia, Louisiana, claimed White shot and killed himself in the back of a squad car -- even though White had been frisked and handcuffed. ""Short of him being Houdini or David Copperfield, it's not possible,"" White family attorney Carol Powell-Lexing said. The incident began when authorities were responding to a fight in a gas station parking lot. About six blocks from the store, an Iberia Parish deputy saw White and stopped him, state police said. According to the service report from the Sheriff's Office, Cpl. Justin Ortis received no description of the men involved in the fight. He was told only that they were black, ""and one of the males mentioned having a gun,"" the report said. White consented to a pat-down, and Ortis found marijuana in his pocket. Attorney Benjamin Crump said that detail makes the official narrative even more suspicious. ""If you pat someone down and you can feel a small package of marijuana, wouldn't you feel a gun?"" he said. State police said once White arrived at the police station, he refused to get out of the patrol car. ""As the deputy requested assistance from other deputies, White produced a handgun and fired one round, striking himself in the back,"" state police said. White was pronounced dead at a local hospital. The aftermath: . An autopsy concluded White's death was a suicide -- but said he was shot in the chest, not in the back, like police had said. The autopsy report also said White was ""reportedly in a locked patrol car with his hands handcuffed behind him when officers heard a shot and found the decedent slumped over."" State police have handed over their investigation to prosecutors, who said a decision won't be made until a federal civil rights investigation wraps up. Date of police encounter: July 5, 2011 . Date of death: July 10, 2011 . What happened: . Officers in Fullerton, California, were responding to a call about a homeless man looking into car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars. Video of the incident showed Thomas, who was schizophrenic, slow to cooperate. Fullerton police Officer Manuel Ramos  then tells him: ""You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up."" Thomas, who is unarmed and shirtless, stands and another officer walks over. They hit him with their batons and hold him on the ground as he begs for help. ""OK, I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry!"" he screams. At one point, Thomas says he can't breathe. The officers tell him to lie on his stomach, put his hands behind his back and relax. Toward the end of the beating, the video shows, Thomas cries out for his father: ""Dad! Help me. Help me. Help me, Dad."" By the end of the video, he is lying in a pool of blood. The aftermath: . The Orange County coroner ruled Thomas' death a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe. Thomas' mother, Cathy Thomas, received a $1 million settlement from the city of Fullerton. Officer Ramos was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli was charged of involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. Both pleaded not guilty. In 2014, a jury acquitted both Ramos and Cicinelli. Date of arrest: September 6, 2013 . Date of death: September 7, 2013 . What happened: . Azucena was arrested after running a red light and leading Los Angeles police on a chase. Over the next half hour, Azucena repeatedly said he had asthma and couldn't breathe, the Los Angeles Times reported. Officers continued ignoring him. ""Help me, help me, help me,"" he said, according to a report by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners. ""I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Help me, please."" ""You can breathe just fine,"" one sergeant told him, according to the Times. ""You can talk, so you can breathe."" He didn't breathe for much longer. Azucena was so weak that officers had to carry him to a station's holding cell for booking and left him face-down on the floor, the Times reported. By the time paramedics arrived, Azucena's heart had stopped. The aftermath: . A coroner concluded that asthma probably killed Azucena and that his death was an accident. Last month, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously agreed to a $1.35 million settlement for Azucena's mother, the Times said. The investigation into the officers' actions is ongoing. Date of arrest: November 19, 2013 . Date of death: November 19, 2013 . What happened: . An officer in Durham, North Carolina, was taking Huerta to the police station for a second-degree trespassing violation. The Durham Police Department said the teen died from a self-inflicted gunshot while handcuffed in the back of the squad car. Durham police Chief Jose Lopez said gunshot residue tests were conducted on Huerta and the arresting officer, and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation ""found that Huerta was wearing gloves and that his gloves had a saturation of gunshot residue on it. Officer (Samuel) Duncan's revealed that he had no gunshot residue on his hands."" But Huerta's family, like Victor White's family in Louisiana, suspect foul play by police. The aftermath: . Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Durham to decry Huerta's death. Some carried banners that read, ""Fue Matado Por La Policia"" or ""Murdered By Police."" A vigil for Huerta turned violent, with six people arrested. The police chief said that as a Hispanic, he had trouble believing the allegations among the Hispanic community that Durham police unfairly target Latinos. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Police say Victor White III and Jesus Huerta shot themselves while handcuffed in cars .

"Atlanta (CNN)A fake name on a Facebook post can still get you in real trouble, especially when you're threatening to shoot every white cop you see. Ebony Dickens of East Point, Georgia, posted her Facebook rant under the name Tiffany Milan, police said. ""All Black ppl should rise up and shoot at every white cop in the nation starting NOW,"" said the post made on Monday. ""I condone black on white killings. Hell they condone crimes against us."" The post was removed a day later, just before Dickens was arrested, CNN affiliate WSB reported. ""I thought about shooting every white cop I see in the head until I'm either caught by the police or killed by them.  Ha!!!!  I think I can pull it off.

Not only the East Point police, but Atlanta police -- whose homeland security unit ""worked diligently ... to identify the true identity of the poster and her whereabouts,"" said Atlanta police spokeswoman Elizabeth Espy -- as well as the FBI and federal Homeland Security Department. ""That's 15 people that she's talking about killing within a day or so, so whether she is serious or not that's something that we have to take seriously,"" East Point police Lt.

After connecting Dickens to the Facebook post, authorities obtained a search warrant for her residence. They took her into custody while executing that warrant. ""A firearm along with three computers was located during the search,"" East Point police said. Dickens, 33, appeared in court Wednesday on a charge of disseminating information related to terrorist acts. A judge set a $10,000 bond for her and banned her from social media. She was then transferred to Fulton County Jail, where she remained until bonding out at 6:19 a.m. Thursday, according to county sheriff's office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan.","Sheriff's spokeswoman: Ebony Dickens is out of jail after posting $10,000 bond .

"(CNN)It took more than seven decades, but England finally got its delivery of tons of silver coins. For most of those years, the money was deep at the bottom of the Atlantic, the monetary casualty of a cruel World War II sinking. In November 1942,  the unguarded SS City of Cairo was sunk by a German U-boat while carrying 296 civilians and cargo that included 100 tons of silver. The vessel sunk to more than 16,800 feet under the surface (5,150 meters) where it went undiscovered until 2011 when Deep Ocean Search decided to go looking for it. The sinking was the stuff of legend. The City of Cairo was bringing silver rupees from India to England as part of the war effort. After a stop in Brazil, two torpedos sank the ship in the Atlantic. After the ship went under, the U-boat reportedly surfaced and the captain said to the survivors in lifeboats: ""Goodnight, sorry for sinking you."" The captain's lament is the title of a book about the event. Only a handful of people died as the ship sank but about 100 more passed away during the desperate attempt of the six boats to make it to land, which was hundreds of miles away. When the last of the lifeboats was found 51 days later, all but two people in it had died. Deep Ocean Search said in a news release that during the 2011 search it located an unnatural object on radar. A sub found the City of Cairo split into two parts, buried by silt. ""Under contract to the UK Ministry of Transport, DOS recovered several tens of tons of silver coins from a depth of (5,150 meters),"" the company said. The depth is a world record, the company claimed. Other deep-water operations reported in the media that are close to this depth include the 1987 search for the wreck of a South African Airways plane at 16,000 feet (4,700 meters) and the discovery of the SS Gairsoppa at about 15,400 feet (4,800 meters) in the North Atlantic in 2011. The BBC reported the City of Cairo salvage operation was completed in September 2013, but the British government made the company keep it secret until this week. The coins were melted and the silver sold, the BBC reported. Deep Ocean Search got a percentage of the sale, and the UK Treasury the rest, according to the BBC. At today's rates, 100 tons of silver would be worth about $50 million. Remains of USS Oklahoma crew to be exhumed at Pearl Harbor .

"Centennial, Colorado (CNN)After months of intensive questioning, a jury has finally been picked for the trial of Colorado movie theater massacre suspect James Holmes. Twelve jurors and twelve alternates are on the list. The group includes 19 women and five men. It's almost entirely white and mostly middle-aged. It's a key step in the case, and it's been a long time coming. Jury selection started in January with 9,000 potential jurors. But the legal wrangling is the case is just revving up. Holmes' defense attorneys asked for a change of venue after the jury was seated Tuesday. The judge denied their request, noting that a jury had already been seated. Opening statements in the trial are scheduled to begin on April 27. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and injuring 70 others when he allegedly opened fire inside a packed theater during the midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" on July 20, 2012. The one-time neuroscience doctoral student faces 165 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. Now 27, he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted of the most serious charges, he could face a death sentence. Wearing a gray dress shirt and tan slacks, Holmes sat quietly in court on Tuesday, looking relaxed and leaning back in his chair for much of the day as lawyers made their picks from the jury pool. He looked down often, but smiled occasionally, such as when the judge made a joke about a juror needing to share his Cheetos and when the district attorney accidentally addressed a male juror as a ""Miss."" Even though he looked calm, defense lawyer Tamara Brady started her question and answer session with jurors Tuesday by expression concerns about Holmes getting a fair and impartial trial, saying ""I'm nervous"" and ""my client is nervous."" District Attorney George Brauchler warned jurors to brace themselves. Tuesday's court session, he said, was the lawyers' last chance to find out if there is ""any reason you shouldn't be one of the 24 to sit through the four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine.""

"(CNN)Are you a boxing fan? Fancy the best seats in the house for Saturday night's showdown in Las Vegas between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao? Got a spare $361,894 for a couple of tickets? No? Ah, well then you might have a problem. Yes, while most of the tickets for the highly-anticipated clash have sold out, there are still some floating around on secondary sites with ringside seats going at crazy money. A ticket at ringside will cost you $180,000 -- a knockout price which might have you seeing stars. As of lunchtime Friday, the most expensive seat on sale through the StubHub website, was retailing for a mammoth $128,705 but has since skyrocketed. Tickets were released last Thursday, just eight days before one of the biggest fights in history after legal wrangling between the two camps. However only around 1,000 were available to the general public, the rest of the estimated 16,500 tickets split between the fighters' camps and the casino as well as promoters and sponsors. Not long after some were made available on resale websites at a mark up that could only be dreamed about even by the sharpest financial trader. Those at the lower end of the eye-watering scale -- priced between $1,500 and $7,500 -- were snapped up in a matter of minutes. The cheapest priced ticket being offered on StubHub as of Monday is $4,600 with that seat right at the back of the MGM Grand arena., . ""We've never seen anything like this in boxing, and I don't think in any sporting event,"" Bob Arum, Pacquiao's promoter, told CNN, . And Arum isn't worried that the steep prices would keep fans away. ""The 1% has so much money, they don't know how to spend it. Whether it's yachts, paintings or tickets to a fight, money means nothing,"" he said. ""There was a craze for tickets and under our agreement with Mayweather Promotions, we felt we were being deprived of our fair share of the tickets (from) the standpoint of number and location. ""It was very, very important to my fighter Manny Pacquiao, to the Philippines people...

"(CNN)Two pieces of audio recorded in the immediate aftermath of a deadly police shooting in South Carolina emerged Monday. The voice of Michael Slager can be heard in both. The former North Charleston police officer is charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. In the first recording, an unidentified officer talks to Slager about what might happen. ""Once they get here, it'll be real quick. They're gonna tell you, you're gonna be off for a couple days and we'll come back and interview you then. They're not gonna ask you any type of questions right now. They're gonna take your weapon,"" the officer says. ""It'd probably be a good idea to jot down your thoughts about whatever happened ... once the adrenaline stops pumping."" Slager responds: ""It's pumping,"" and then laughs. The second audio, taken from dash cam video from inside a patrol car, captures a phone call between Slager and someone CNN believes is his wife. He tells her: ""Hey. Hey, everything's OK. OK? I just shot somebody."" ""He grabbed my Taser, yeah. Yeah,"" says Slager. ""He was running from me. ... I'm fine."" If convicted of murder, the former officer faces up to life in prison or the death penalty, although a death penalty case appears unlikely at this point. ""Based on the facts revealed thus far, it does not appear South Carolina's death penalty provision applies in this case because there are no statutory 'aggravating circumstances' present,"" Scarlett A. Wilson, who is the chief prosecutor for the Ninth Judicial Circuit in the state, said on her Facebook page. Slager was charged after cell phone video emerged, showing him firing at Scott as the man ran away. Who was Walter Scott? Pierre Fulton was riding in a car with Scott before the shooting took place. ""Walter was a dear friend and I miss him every day,"" Fulton said in a statement given to ABC News by his lawyer.  ""Over the past five years he helped me to become a better man and showed me the value of hard work."" ""I'll never know why he ran, but I know he didn't deserve to die,"" Fulton said.  ""Please keep Walter and his family in your prayers and respect my privacy moving forward."" Scott's passenger meets with police . Scott's death has reignited a national conversation around race and policing. Scott was black; Slager is white. The case has also brought to light previous instances in which Slager's behavior on the job is being questioned. On Monday, attorneys for a man named Julius Wilson announced that they were filing a lawsuit in connection with an August 2014 traffic stop. During the stop, three officers -- including Slager -- pulled Wilson out of his car. Wilson was then allegedly shocked with a stun gun. The suit claims Slager used excessive force. Slager was also named in a police complaint in 2013 after he allegedly ""Tased a man for no reason"" before slamming him to the ground and dragging him, according to the North Charleston Police Department. At the time, Slager was searching for a suspect who was described as being 5-feet-5-inches tall. The African-American man he confronted was 6-feet-3 inches tall. A lawyer for Mario Givens, the man who filed the complaint, said last week that his client plans to file a lawsuit. Givens said Slager came to his door, ordered him out of the house and then Tased him. Slager was later cleared in that incident. What we know about Officer Slager .

"(CNN)Robert Boardwine's path to fatherhood was unconventional, but Virginia's appeals court said Tuesday he is legally entitled to be a part of his son's life. Boardwine's friend, Joyce Bruce, had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant. She thought after she learned she was with child that they should just be friends. She also thought that because they never had sex, she was entitled to be the boy's sole parent, according to court documents. The Court of Appeals of Virginia decided differently in weighing the commonwealth's assisted conception statute and denying Bruce's appeal to deny Boardwine visitation. It agreed with a circuit court ruling that method of insemination didn't come from medical technology. ""The plain meaning of the term 'medical technology' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster,"" the appeals court wrote in its decision. Bruce's attorney, Monica T. Monday, said she would need to talk to her client before she can comment about whether they will file an appeal. Boardwine initially was hesitant when Bruce approached him in 2010 with the turkey baster idea, the court document says. They talked about writing their agreement down on paper, but that never happened. They tried the turkey baster method a few times. He'd come over to her house, go to a room alone, bring his sperm in a plastic cup, they'd chat, and he'd leave. Then she'd use the kitchen utensil and wait. After she didn't get pregnant, she twice tried a fertility doctor. No luck. She and Boardwine tried a few more times, and in July, she learned she was going to have a baby. Boardwine came by the house with a stuffed bear and clothes for the baby. Things were OK. He thought he was going to be able to see the newborn as often as he wanted. She thought he could have ""some involvement,"" the appeals court decision says, but she would be the sole parent. He'd be like any other friend, certainly not have formal visitation. Then they argued. Over what to name the baby. They didn't speak for more than five months after that. The baby was born, and Boardwine says he learned about the baby's arrival from someone else. He went to the hospital and saw the boy at Bruce's home. Joyce Bruce said the visits were ""strained."" She told Boardwine to stop coming. So he took the matter to court. Bruce argued that she used ""noncoital reproductive technology"" to get pregnant, and Boardwine was technically a sperm donor. He argued that he always expected to be a dad, going to the kid's games and taking part in making decisions on schools and medical needs. A court-ordered DNA test proved Boardwine is the biological father. The appeals court affirmed the lower court's ruling, saying the turkey baster doesn't constitute reproductive technology. Boardwine was awarded joint legal custody and visitation. CNN also reached out to his attorney Tuesday but didn't get a reply. CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.","In July 2010, Joyce Bruce got pregnant in an unusual way -- with repeated attempts using a turkey baster .

"Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic and emotionally wrenching testimony in the Boston Marathon bombing trial, jurors deliberated for more than seven hours Tuesday. But they haven't reached a verdict yet. The jurors sent out two questions, which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court Wednesday morning. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty. On Monday, the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister. The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15, 2013. At one point, prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling. His mother lost her leg. ""The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. ""The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots' Day, Marathon Monday,"" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. ""If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,"" Clarke argued. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of bomb victim Martin Richard, 8, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ""chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,"" Chakravarty said. ""He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks, and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children."" The lawyer waited a beat. ""He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people."" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, ""they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to Boston."" Tsarnaev is accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. ""He was there,"" Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Jurors were shown a photo of Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of Martin Richard. ""These children weren't innocent to him,"" the prosecutor said. ""They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do."" Chakravarty quoted Martin's father who earlier testified, ""I guess we were just unlucky that day."" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. ""This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,"" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, ""to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' "" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. ""In the past few weeks, we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,"" Clarke said. ""We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain, there is no excuse."" She acknowledged her client participated in a ""senseless act."" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad, and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has maintained. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's ""attempt to point the finger at somebody else."" ""There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,"" he said. They were ""partners in crime."" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing, Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. ""Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,"" the prosecutor said. ""If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?"" The radicalization of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev . From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims: . Martin's 69-pound body ""was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed."" Lu ""received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open, and she bled out."" Campbell died in less than a minute from ""massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded."" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, ""never had a chance."" He was shot between the eyes. ""They assassinated him."" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officer for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Case ends with grisly photos and testimony . Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. ""Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,"" the prosecutor said Monday. ""He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans."" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a ""manifesto"" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan.

"(CNN)Chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" protesters rallied in Baltimore late Tuesday, the same day police released the names of the officers involved in the arrest of Freddie Gray. Gray died of a spinal injury Sunday, exactly one week after he was taken into custody. Demonstrators marched to a local police station that was protected by barricades. One man was arrested after crossing that barricade, but the protest was peaceful. Among the crowd were members of Gray's family, including his mother. She held her head and cried. Many of the protesters clasped hands, and raised them in a show of support. ""Make some noise for Freddie Gray,"" one man shouted into a megaphone. ""We won't stop,"" said another. ""We have the power and, of course, today shows we have the numbers."" Speaking to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she understands where the protesters are coming from. She understands their frustration. ""Mr. Gray's family deserves justice, and our community deserves an opportunity to heal, to get better, and to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again,"" she said. Earlier in the day, the Baltimore Police Department released the names of six police officers suspended with pay. They are: Lt. Brian Rice, 41, who joined the department in 1997; Officer Caesar Goodson, 45, who joined in 1999; Sgt. Alicia White, 30, who joined in 2010; Officer William Porter, 25, who joined in 2012; Officer Garrett Miller, 26, who joined in 2012; and Officer Edward Nero, 29, who joined in 2012. After an ""in-custody death,"" it is standard procedure to release the names of officers involved, said Baltimore Police Department spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk. It doesn't mean the officers did anything wrong, nor does it mean that these were the only officers involved, he said. Of the six officers, three were on bikes and initially approached Gray, another made eye contact with Gray, another officer joined in the arrest after it was initiated and one drove the police van, Kowalczyk said. The autopsy hasn't yielded many answers in Gray's death -- in fact, it's prompted more questions -- but Baltimore's mayor pledged Tuesday to find out how the 25-year-old died after being arrested a week prior. ""I'm going to make sure that as we get information that we can confirm, we're going to put that information out in the public,"" Mayor Rawlings-Blake said. ""I want people to understand that I have no interest in hiding information, holding back information."" She's angry, she said, and among the questions she wants answered are: Why did police stop Gray in the first place? And why did arresting officers make what she called the mistake of not immediately requesting medical attention when Gray asked for it?i . ""He was dragged a bit, but then you see him using his legs to get into the van, so he was able-bodied when he was in the van, and we know that when he was finally taken out of the van, he was unresponsive,"" she said. Challenged on the ""able-bodied"" remark -- video shows Gray's legs hanging listlessly as officers carry him by his shoulders -- Rawlings-Blake said the medical examiner would make the final determination, but ""we know he was fine getting into the van."" ""We will get to the bottom of it, and we will go where the facts lead us,"" she said. ""We will hold people accountable if we find there was wrongdoing."" She further said she ""absolutely believes we need to have an outside investigation,"" especially when Baltimore's dark history of police misconduct is considered. Police plan to conclude their investigation by Friday, May 1. From there, the case will go to the state's attorney's office, which will decide whether to file charges. The Justice Department has been watching developments in the Gray case and is officially looking into whether a prosecutable civil rights violation occurred, a spokesperson said Tuesday. In October, the Justice Department announced a collaborative reform initiative with the Baltimore Police Department to ""include an assessment of policies, training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens."" Police brutality not on rise; coverage is . ""When law enforcement misconduct is uncovered, the U.S. Department of Justice has a variety of tools available to respond. Responses to misconduct in law enforcement organizations fall along a continuum of intervention, with the specific response calibrated to address the particular circumstances of any given situation,"" Ronald Davis, director of the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, said in a statement at the time. The Justice Department began the data-gathering stage of the lengthy process in January and held its first public town hall last week at Coppin State University. It was attended by hundreds of residents, many of whom sounded off about their experiences with Baltimore police. ""Right now, we are past the stage of implementing policies and procedures. This is a state of emergency right now,"" Tawanda Jones told Justice Department officials, according to CNN affiliate WBAL. Jones' brother, Tyrone West, died in police custody in 2013. The mayor issued a statement ahead of the town hall, saying that 230 officers accused of misconduct between January 2012 and February 2015 had accepted punishment outright, while another 61 officers were found guilty through trial board hearings. BPD is the nation's eighth-largest police force with almost 4,000 civilian and sworn personnel. ""I am determined to not allow a small handful of bad actors tarnish the reputation of the overwhelming majority of police officers putting their lives in danger to make Baltimore a safer city,"" Rawlings-Blake said in the statement. The mayor had asked the Justice Department to take a look at the police department, The Baltimore Sun reported, saying that her request came on the heels of the newspaper's report that the city had paid almost $6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011. Overwhelmingly, The Sun reported, the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges. Under Rawlings-Blake's watch, she said, the city has seen a decline in lawsuits, as well as reports of excessive force and discourtesy. ""I went to Annapolis for tougher laws to hold cops accountable. I'm fighting to bring back the trust between the police and the community,"" she said. According to documents obtained Monday, the April 12 incident began when Gray ran from police. While the court documents allege that one of the arresting officers, Garrett Miller, took Gray into custody after finding a switchblade in his pocket, the Gray family attorney called the allegation a ""sideshow."" Gray was carrying a ""pocket knife of legal size,"" attorney William Murphy said. Police never saw the knife and chased Gray only after he took off running, the attorney said. Court documents said Gray ""fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence."" ""The officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of (Gray's) front right pants pocket. The defendant was arrested without force or incident,"" the documents say. ""The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted, one-hand-operated knife."" The mayor has questioned whether police should have pursued Gray in the first place. ""It is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone. So, we still have questions,"" Rawlings-Blake said. Gray was in perfect health until police chased and tackled him, Murphy said. Less than an hour later, he was on his way to a trauma clinic with a spinal injury, where he fell into a coma. The family has not seen the autopsy report yet, Murphy said, and relatives are still waiting to take possession of Gray's body. The family intends to have a second, private autopsy conducted once Baltimore police turn over the body, the attorney said. Police, according to their own timeline, spotted Gray, gave chase, caught him, cuffed him and requested a paddy wagon in fewer than four minutes. The transport van left with Gray about 11 minutes after that, police said, and another 30 minutes passed before ""units request paramedics to the Western District to transport the suspect to an area hospital."" When cell phones began recording, Gray was already on the ground with three officers kneeling over him. He let out long screams. Officers had encountered him a minute earlier in an area where drug deals and crime are common, Deputy Police Commissioner Rodriguez said. Gray has an extensive criminal history, which appears to be mostly drug-related. The officers called for a prisoner transport van. Cell phone video taken from two positions showed officers lifting Gray, whose hands were cuffed, by his shoulders and dragging him to the back of the van. Officers put more restraints on Gray inside the van, police said, while surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking. That was at 8:54 a.m.b . At 9:24 a.m., police called an ambulance to pick Gray up. Murphy and angry residents of Baltimore want to know what happened in those 30 minutes in between. Police said Gray requested medical attention, including an inhaler, and an ambulance later took him to the University of Maryland Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center. ""He lapsed into a coma, died, was resuscitated, stayed in a coma and on Monday underwent extensive surgery at Shock Trauma to save his life,"" Murphy said. ""He clung to life for seven days.""

"(CNN)It's the simplest possible assignment, but it always teaches a huge lesson. Every year, Denver teacher Kyle Schwartz passes out Post-it notes to her third grade students and asks them to complete the sentence, ""I wish my teacher knew ..."" Many of the students she teaches at Doull Elementary just wish they had something in common with her, that she knew soccer or video games. But sometimes, their wishes bring tears to her eyes, and offer a glimpse of painful struggles in their young lives. There's a student who misses her father: ""I haven't seen him in six years."" Another who wants to tell her she's lonely: ""I don't have friend to play with me."" Still another who wants to explain why her reading log goes unsigned: ""My mom is not around a lot."" And other who has big hopes for the future: ""I want to go to college."" The assignment sprang from the kinds of conversations teachers have all the time, Schwartz said: ""What do our students need? How can we best serve them?"" Schwartz always gives her students the option to write their names on their notes or remain anonymous; of sharing them only with her, or with the entire class. It surprises her how often students stand up and want to read their wishes out loud, like the shy student who shared, ""I wish my teacher knew I'm nervous all the time."" ""They feel respected, they feel safe enough to share some of these more sensitive ones,"" said Schwartz, who has been teaching for three years. ""Kids can share what they feel comfortable with."" Recently, Schwartz began to post some students' responses on Twitter using the hashtag #IWishMyTeacherKnew. It spread, as teachers around the country tried it with their own classrooms. They sometimes reveal what kids are most worried about right now, like the child whose mother was sick, or another who had just experienced bullying. One student just wants more attention from the teacher. Sometimes, they have a little fun: ""I wish my teacher knew how to do a backflip."" Occasionally, students want to reassure their teachers that that they're doing a great job. There's a lot for teachers to learn, too: ""They are KIDS who deal with a lot as they grow up,"" one educator posted on Twitter. Schwartz said she's learned not to assume what her students wish. Although most of the students at her school live in poverty, not every message is about a material need. There's no pressure to share something they're not ready to talk about, she said, and ""they're acutely aware of their own needs."" Through assignments like this, she is, too. As her idea spread, many Twitter users asked how they can help to support her students. She's pointed them toward a DonorsChoose.org fund where she posts a classroom project wish list. So far, most have been fulfilled.","Denver teacher Kyle Schwartz asked students to share what they wish she knew .

"(CNN)The officer charged with murder in the shooting death of an unarmed black man in South Carolina has been fired as anger continues to build around his case. A video shows Officer Michael Slager, who is white, firing eight shots at 50-year-old Walter Scott as Scott has his back to him and is running away. Scott, who was unarmed, was struck five times. Timeline of events . The FBI is investigating, and once again, a shooting involving police has sparked national outrage. ""I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,"" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. The mayor spoke at the same news conference that was repeatedly interrupted by protesters, who chanted: ""No justice! No peace!"" They called for Mayor Keith Summey to step down. Summey told reporters that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras ""so every officer on the street"" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a ""Black Lives Matter"" T-shirt who shouted, ""This is what democracy looks like!"" Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. ""We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,"" Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said. ""I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature."" An autopsy of Scott showed that he ""sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,"" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: ""In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there."" The North Charleston Police department was not legally obligated to but chose to hand the case over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, according to a news release from Scarlett A. Wilson, the Ninth Judicial Circuit solicitor. Though Wilson said she is subject to rules that limit what she can say publicly, she stated: ""My role is to hold accountable those who harm others unlawfully, regardless of profession. This office does not dictate nor comment upon police policy, training and procedure. I am, however, deeply concerned when those who are sworn to serve and protect violate the public's trust."" Slager pulled Scott over on Saturday morning for a broken taillight, authorities have said. The beginning of the video shows the two men standing close to each other. Any words exchanged between Scott and Slager are not audible on the released tape. It's also unclear what happened before Scott started to run away, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser stun gun on Scott and that Scott tried to take his weapon. ""Shots fired and the subject is down,"" Slager said, according to police reports. ""He took my Taser."" Before the officer started firing his gun, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced the officer had lied, he told CNN. ""There was not a struggle for the Taser,"" Anthony Scott said. ""I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway."" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was ""running for his life"" away from the officer. ""I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,"" Scott said. The video shows Walter Scott attempting to run away. His back is to the officer, and he is a few yards away when the officer raises his gun and fires. A man walking to work on Saturday recorded the video and provided it to the family. That man, Feidin Santana, spoke to NBC's Lester Holt. He said there had been a struggle between the two men on the ground before he started recording, and that the officer was in control. When asked how he felt about the fact that Slager has been charged with murder, Santana said that ""no one can feel happy."" ""He has his family and Mr. Scott also has his family. But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. And, you know, you pay for your decisions in this life,"" he told NBC's Holt. ""Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that."" If convicted of murder, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? ""People are upset, people are pointing out how wrong the officer was for gunning down Mr. Scott,"" South Carolina State Rep. Justin Bamberg said as he stood alongside Anthony Scott on Wednesday. #WalterScott received 11,000 mentions on Twitter in just one hour Wednesday; 243,000 mentions in 24 hours. #RIPWalterScott is also trending, as is #MichaelSlager. Bamberg said he hasn't heard of anyone acting out violently to protest the shooting. He and Scott stressed they don't want that to happen. ""Things are in play now, and this officer is in the process of being prosecuted,"" Bamberg said, imploring anyone listening to him speak on CNN: ""We ask that you let the justice process run its course."" That message was echoed by Walter Scott's mother, who said she feels ""forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son."" ""He was a loving son, a loving father. He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son,"" Judy Scott told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The Justice Department said it would ""take appropriate action in light of the evidence and developments in the state case."" ""The South Carolina Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation concurrent with the S.C. Law Enforcement Division and are providing aid as necessary to the state investigation,"" the Justice Department said in a statement. ""The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the South Carolina U.S. Attorney's Office will work with the FBI in the investigation."" Whether Scott's civil rights were violated will be part of the Justice Department's investigation. In the meantime, Slager remains behind bars. He was denied bail at a bond hearing Tuesday night, CNN affiliate WCIV reported. Slager will remain in custody unless a circuit court sets his bond, a court spokesman told CNN. The court has not set a date for that hearing. According to WCIV, Slager initially said through his attorney, David Aylor, that he followed the appropriate policies and procedures. But Aylor later told CNN that he no longer represents the officer. It's not clear whether Slager has found a new attorney. A CNN examination of Slager's police job application indicates he has been an employee of the North Charleston Police Department for about five years and five months. Instead of wearing his police uniform, Slager now wears a jail uniform. Who was Walter Scott? CNN's Ryan Scallan, Christine Bear, Tristan Smith, Martin Savidge, Dana Ford, Sam Stringer, Randi Kaye, Chandler Friedman, Evan Perez, Don Lemon and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","Witness who took the video says ""Mr. Scott didn't deserve this""

"(CNN)Thump. The University of Nebraska at Omaha is getting a new $81.6 million stadium for its hockey, basketball and volleyball teams. Thump. It'll have luxury suites and everything. Thump. But it seems all anyone can talk about these days ... THUMP . ... is the taco cannon. That's right, we said taco cannon. An Omaha taco shop has teamed up with the university to shoot tacos into the stands at sporting events. That the foil-wrapped eats will make to fans was made evident when Voodoo Tacos owner Eric Newton demonstrated the power of the cannon for CNN affiliate KETV. That they'll make it undamaged? Not so much. ""I wouldn't say it would be as restaurant quality when it gets to them, but it's edible,"" Newton said. With this latest technological development, the taco will join t-shirts, stuffed toys, balls, biscuits and the lowly hot dog in hurtling into the stands at public gatherings. UNO fans, um, ate the idea up, sending #tacocannon hurtling past #EarthDay as the No. 1 trending topic Wednesday in Omaha. ""How we roll in Omaha...Frozen Four appearances and projectile tacos,"" Twitter user mavpuck said, referring to the school's recent, and sadly taco-less, appearance in the NCAA hockey tournament semifinals.

"Tokyo (CNN)It's a bird -- It's a plane -- It's an insanely fast Japanese bullet train. A Japan Railway maglev train hit 603 kilometers per hour (374 miles per hour) on an experimental track in Yamanashi Tuesday, setting a decisive new world record. A spokesperson said the train spent 10.8 seconds traveling above 600 kilometers per hour, during which it covered 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles). That's nearly 20 football fields in the time it took you to read the last two sentences. Takeo Ookanda, who runs an exhibition center next to the test track, said witnesses erupted with excitement and applause when the new record was set. ""I was moved just like many other visitors here today,"" he told CNN. ""This maglev project... (increases) the hope that Japan can have a good growth again in the future."" The train broke its own record from last Thursday, when it ran at 590 kilometers per hour (366 miles per hour) on a test track. That beat the old record of 581 kilometers per hour (361 miles per hour), which was set in 2003 during another Japanese maglev test. Right now, China operates the world's fastest commercial maglev, which has hit 431 kilometers per hour (268 miles per hour) on a route through Shanghai. By contrast, the fastest train in the United States, Amtrak's Acela Express, is only capable of 241 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour), though it usually plods along at half that speed. Unlike traditional trains, maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward. Japan's maglevs don't use metal tracks — instead, they float nearly 10 cm (4 inches) above special guideways, allowing for frictionless movement. Japan Railways has been testing their train to figure out the best operational speed for a planned route between Tokyo and Nagoya, scheduled to begin service in 2027. That trip can take nearly 5 hours by car. But in the future, a maglev train could finish the journey in 40 minutes. READ MORE: The future of transportation will blow your hair back .

"(CNN)Charlotte Dujardin says she is ""living the dream"" as she cements her status as a dressage legend. Dujardin and Valegro won their their second consecutive Reem Acra FEI World Cup Dressage title in Las Vegas at the weekend -- a trophy to sit alongside Olympic gold and the world and European titles. While their score of 94.196 narrowly missed their own world record in the sport, it was still a full 10 percentage points clear of any rival inside the Thomas & Mack Arena. Dutchman Edward Gal and Glock's Undercover were second with 84.696, ahead of Germany's Jessica von Bredow-Werndl and Unee BB in third with 80.464. ""Valegro just loves his job,"" said Dujardin. ""I don't have to force him to do anything, I just sit there and steer and off I go. There's no sweating, no pushing, no pulling. He knows his job and it's just fantastic"" added Dujardin, who couldn't stop smiling as she was pictured next to an Elvis impersonator after her win. Not everyone finds World Cup success quite that relaxing. Switzerland's Steve Guerdat may be the London Olympic champion, but his Longines FEI World Cup jumping victory in Vegas came at the 10th attempt. Guerdat and Albfuehren's Paille had the last fence down and narrowly avoided a time fault that would have denied them the outright win. ""I don't really want to think about it,"" he joked. ""Coming to the last I knew the time was tight. ""I just went as fast as I could to the finish line, but unfortunately there was a big fence in the way."" He added: ""I've been three times on the podium, twice in the jump-off and always finished in the top 10. I always wanted to win this."" The World Cup Finals are among the most prestigious equestrian titles, but the weekend's events in Las Vegas were notable for the success of younger riders. American dressage rider Laura Graves, a 27-year-old who burst onto the international scene with fifth place at last year's World Equestrian Games, improved to fourth in Vegas. Her performance was outdone by Irish showjumper Bertram Allen, who took bronze on Sunday at the age of 19. The teenager is likely to rise through the ranks of the world's top 10 following that performance, while gaining precious Olympic qualification points. Allen and Molly Malone finished behind French rider Penelope Leprevost, on board Vagabond de la Pomme, who took silver.","Olympic champion Charlotte Dujardin remains world's leading dressage rider after Vegas contest .

"(CNN)They are superstars flown in from across the globe -- and they probably had more legroom than you. The world's leading showjumping and dressage horses have reached Las Vegas for this week's World Cup Finals. The man who arranged their travel says, for horses, it's business class all the way. ""There are two horses per box,"" explains Tim Dutta, who oversaw the loading of more than $150 million in equine talent onto a Qatar Airways flight at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport earlier this month. ""We pay attention to each horse's little idiosyncrasies and requirements -- do they like wet hay, or not? Do we use sea salt to encourage them to drink? ""I like the horses to have some quiet time too, they need that. So when the aircraft is at cruise then they are left alone for a while, to have a snooze and relax, without being bothered by anyone."" No horse is snoozing now. The flights are over and they're in Las Vegas to work. Vegas is home to the finals for the sixth time since first hosting showjumping in 2000. The venue is the Thomas & Mack Center, a stone's throw from the Strip, which had the distinction of being opened by Frank Sinatra and Diana Ross in 1983. Organizers believe more than 80,000 fans will attend this week's event, which boasts an $8 million budget. Expect Elvis Presley beaming down from the Jumbotron; chefs from the Bellagio serving VIP guests who paid upwards of $1,500 a ticket; and tennis legend Steffi Graf presenting the trophies. In the past, that was not your usual showjumping and dressage atmosphere -- but that's something the sport is trying to change. Hosting world-class horsesport in Vegas is a way to raise its profile in the United States. As with this month's showjumping on Miami Beach, the thinking is location, location, location. For the riders, few locations are comparable. ""It's like a Wrigley Field feel,"" said Tim Keener, one of the Vegas organizers, describing how the bowl of the arena will seat spectators unusually close to the action. Showjumping comes here for the showbiz. In previous years, trophies have been handed out by flying showgirls descending from the rafters. Elvis impersonators have burst into the arena on horseback. This year, a ""selfie booth"" will let fans crowd in with leading riders for awkward photos on their phones -- and there will be quite some choice of riders. Since the World Cup Finals are among the most prestigious titles available, the cast list over the next four days features almost all of the world's top names. In showjumping, Germany's Daniel Deusser is both the defending World Cup champion and the new world No. 1, unseating Britain's Scott Brash. The Germans are the most successful nation at the World Cup Finals, with 10 showjumping victories, and three-time champion Marcus Ehning will also compete. The hosts have a superstar and 2013 champion in Beezie Madden, while 2012 champion Rich Fellers will ride aptly named ""comeback king"" Flexible, a horse undeterred by a series of illnesses and injuries which would have seen almost any other stallion retire. In dressage, Britain's Charlotte Dujardin and Valero are the runaway favorites to successfully defend last year's World Cup title. The partnership is the first ever to hold the World Cup alongside Olympic, world and European gold. Few riders are expected to mount a serious challenge if Dujardin and Valegro perform well, but watch out for Germany's Isabell Werth and up-and-coming US rider Laura Graves. Graves, 27, has barely spent a year on the U.S. senior team, yet finished fifth in last year's World Equestrian Games on board Verdades. The action begins on Thursday, April 16, with dressage reaching a climax on the Saturday and showjumping a day later. But if you miss it, the chances are you won't have to wait long for another chance. Vegas is so in love with horses, organizers are already planning a bid to bring the event back in 2019.","Horses complete transatlantic trip to Las Vegas in 'business class' luxury .

"(CNN)As Nepal grapples with an earthquake that has killed more than 3,400 people, Ronen Ziv worries about someone he has never met. His unborn baby is due this week in Kathmandu. He had tickets to travel to Nepal for his child's birth from a surrogate mother, but now he has no choice but to wait in his native Israel for news. ""It's terrifying,"" Ziv said. ""I can tell you I didn't get much sleep ...  all my thoughts and all my prayers are for the surrogate mother and the unborn child."" Nepal is a popular place for Israeli couples to have surrogate children. Ziv's first child, a 15-month-old daughter, was born to a surrogate mother in Nepal. Ziv and his partner, Tom, traveled to Nepal for the birth. They were planning on making the trip once again, but the earthquake forced them to change their plans. Companies that help arrange surrogate pregnancies estimate 25 couples are now in Kathmandu with newborn surrogate children, while 10 to 15 surrogate mothers are due to give birth in the coming weeks. The country is also a popular spot for Israeli travelers. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates there are about 600 to 700 Israelis in Nepal. Israel Defense Forces is sending 260 emergency responders to Nepal, including search-and-rescue teams. The group is also bringing almost 100 tons of medical aid supplies. Ziv says his baby is in a breech position, requiring a cesarean section. In the current chaos of Kathmandu, he worries his surrogate mother, Nafisa Shaje, will not get the proper medical attention required for a safe and healthy birth. Ziv would prefer Shaje fly to Israel, where hospitals can provide the needed medical help. But with only days left until the baby is due, Ziv said putting Shaje on a plane might not be possible. ""If anything else happens, it could very quickly go to absolute catastrophe,"" Ziv says. Hospitals in Nepal have been flooded with injured quake victims. Some have been turned away so doctors can tend to the most severely injured. Cila Tamir, Ziv's attorney, has been working with the Ministry of the Interior to try to bring Shaje to Israel. ""She has no place to deliver. No conditions,"" Tamir said. ""Everything is ruined there, and I'm sure that the hospital doesn't function normally because of the casualties and the injuries.""","Nepal is a popular place for Israeli couples to have surrogate children .

"(CNN)In 1944, 16-year-old Yong Soo Lee of Taegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them, and three other teenage girls, by train, then ship, to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with a venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts of food, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and other Asian nations, who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called ""comfort women"" suffered unimaginable physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a Joint Meeting of Congress on Wednesday, he has an opportunity to do right by these women, and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government. In 2007, in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Japanese government by unanimously passing House Resolution 121, which I authored. The resolution called on the Japanese government to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the ""comfort women"" never occurred; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime. We are still waiting for their government to comply. In 2006, during his first term, Prime Minister Abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of Japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the ""comfort women"" system. And during his second term, Abe and his right-wing allies have continued to question history -- even trying to dilute and rewrite it. Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, calling the timing and contents of the Japanese government report on the 1993 Kono statement: regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Last year, meanwhile, the Abe administration tried (and failed) to get the United Nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery. Most notably, earlier this year, the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in U.S. history textbooks about the ""comfort women."" Some say that Japan has already apologized enough and it's time to move on. To those people I say, in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history, for every step forward the Japanese government takes toward peace and reconciliation, it takes two steps back. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my government put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated 120,000 of us. We were U.S. citizens, but merely because of our ancestry, the government treated us like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our government. In 1988, Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed into law, the Civil Liberties Act, which was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it, and healed many wounds as a result. Japan must now do the same. It must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for its mistake, and thereby gain the trust of her sister Asian nations. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, Germany engaged in a painful national ""coming to terms with the past"" that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. Time is of the essence. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving ""comfort women"" across the Asia-Pacific. Each year, this number declines. Ms. Lee is one of 53 remaining Korean survivors. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice and apology that has been due to them for the past 70 years. The opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of Congress is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies. I will be in the House chamber when Prime Minister Abe delivers his address. Ms. Lee will attend as my guest. Both of us hope the Prime Minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally, and firmly, apologize, and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly. Ms. Lee and her sisters deserve no less.","Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will address Congress on Wednesday .

"Miami (CNN)Despite the glitz and glamour Miami is known for, the odds for some children growing up there are bleak. Almost one of every three Miami-Dade County residents living in poverty is under 18, according to the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources. Many schools face high dropout rates, after-school programs are being eliminated and students are failing. Those at-risk children are ones that Chad Bernstein is trying to help through his nonprofit, Guitars Over Guns. ""Music is the most important tool we have in reaching these kids,"" said Bernstein, 30, a professional musician. His program operates in two of Miami's poorest communities, North Miami and Allapattah. It pairs middle-school students with professional musicians, providing free instrument instruction and mentorship. Since 2008, Bernstein's organization has worked with more than 225 students in Miami-Dade County. He says his group has seen more than a 90% increase in academic performance and school attendance of students in the program. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . Bernstein has been hooked on playing gigs since he was 16. He's gone on to play and record with such musical greats as Shakira, Pharrell, Jennifer Hudson and Pitbull. See more CNN Heroes . I sat down with Bernstein to learn more about the motivation behind his work. Below is an edited version of our conversation. Marissa Calhoun: You're a pretty cool guy — some might be surprised to hear that you were once bullied. What did you experience and how did you overcome it? Chad Bernstein: When I was a kid, I had ears that stuck out the side of my head and really big green glasses. And I was tall and lanky and definitely looked a little different than other kids. I think part of the thing that really stuck with me was this feeling of wanting to belong to something, because I just didn't feel like I fit in with the other kids. When I started playing music it really gave me a sense of identity, something that I belonged to, something that I was good at, something that people would watch me do and say, ""Oh wow, that's really cool or he's really good at that."" I think in that way music really gave me an anchor in my social experience. Calhoun: What can students expect when they join your program? Bernstein: As a new GOGO student you'll get to try out all the instruments. You'll choose an instrument to learn. You'll be paired with a mentor. And then you'll go throughout that year learning how to play the instrument and music fundamentals and songwriting. And by the end of the year, you'll be performing on stage, recording in a studio and will have a very close relationship with that mentor. Our mentors are amazing musicians that are active in the community playing and performing. And some of these mentors are actually from the neighborhoods and the schools that these kids are at currently. We're not policemen. We're not teachers. We're not parents. We're in a unique position to really talk to these kids about the issues that matter most to them. Calhoun: Why do you focus on middle schoolers? Bernstein: It's the time of their life to reach them not only musically, but also as young individuals that are starting to form opinions about who they are and what their world is going to look like. As professional musicians, most of us know what kind of power music has in terms of dealing with the things that are going on in your life.  And the reasons that we target the neighborhoods that we have the program in are because these kids are facing the most challenges with being successful in and out of school. A lot of times, these kids only see to the end of their block and back. We like to bring them to studios and also to other places in Miami because we want them to experience something outside of their own neighborhood. We also provide them with opportunities to get tutoring and have social services, making sure that they're really successful in and outside of school. Calhoun: I've heard you play — you're pretty mean on the trombone. How has that passion translated into your work with these kids? Bernstein: I've built my life on how important the feeling I get from playing music is. And I thought that that was the end-all, be-all feeling, that being on stage and performing was the thing for me. Then I saw a kid have that experience through our program, and it changed everything. There's an amazing sense of pride when I see a kid experience that feeling on stage, where they've connected with an audience or they get a round of applause because they've worked really hard and have a great performance. It's an incredible feeling. I was really fortunate to have the opportunities that I did to learn music. And part of me feels very responsible to provide those opportunities for other people, because there were people along the way in my path and my musical journey that helped me. My hopes for the children that we work with are that their vision of the world and their vision of themselves is changed in some way, that they hold themselves to more than other people might, and that they realize there's a whole world out there that they could very much be a part of that isn't necessarily the one right outside their doorstep. I know music has changed my life in a really dramatic way. And I think it's going to change the lives of these students in a really dramatic way. Want to get involved?

"(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal. And they are struggling in the aftermath. Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12. The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry. ""We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard,"" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food. Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster. ""These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,"" Koirala said. ""They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything. ... If I get more support I will take as many as I can."" About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard. ""They're not injured, but they are terrified,"" Koirala said. ""Everything is broken in the hospice."" Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged. ""It's really very sad for me and for my children,"" Koirala said. ""This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next."" Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field. ""Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are,"" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated. Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. ""It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,"" Basnet said. ""We are really scared."" They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive. ""I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?  Because at least we have our life,"" she said. ""(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me."" Basnet's ""Butterfly Home"" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October. Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year. ""When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered,"" she said. ""I have to restart again."" Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid. To that end, several CNN Heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in Nepal. Jake Wood's disaster relief organization, Team Rubicon, has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in Kathmandu.  The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the Nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city. Six canine-firefighter search teams from the United States also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts. The teams were trained by Wilma Melville's National Disaster Search Dog Foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers, hazmat experts and doctors. Tom Henderson's ShelterBox, which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies, has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families. Dr. Laura Stachel's group, We Care Solar, sent solar suitcases to health care workers, providing them with light and power as they aid survivors. Arlene Samen's group, One Heart World-Wide, has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies, especially in hard-hit districts. Robin Lim, a disaster response midwife who founded Bumi Sehat, joined Samen in Kathmandu to help the mothers. Doc Hendley's nonprofit, Wine to Water, partnered with Appalachian State University in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in Nepal. The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly.","Anuradha Koirala and 425 young women and girls have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN)Nearly 12 million parents in the United States currently are raising kids on their own. When single parents face a devastating illness such as cancer, everyday needs like cleaning and cooking can become a struggle. Jody Farley-Berens saw the need firsthand, when her childhood friend faced that situation. ""Making ends meet is insurmountable,"" said Farley-Berens. ""There are so many doctors' appointments, copays, surgeries, prescriptions.  And then the inability to work -- any savings that there may have been is gone very quickly."" She did all she could to help.  After her friend passed away, Farley-Berens helped start a nonprofit dedicated to assisting others in similar circumstances. Since 2006, Singleton Moms has provided practical, financial and emotional support to more than 300 parents in the Phoenix area. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . Tiffany Montgomery, 48, was a newly single mom when she was diagnosed with stage-4 breast cancer. Farley-Berens' group pitched in to help, so Montgomery could spend more time with her daughter Ezri, now 10. ""When you can't really do much and you're looking at the dirt on the floor, it's one more level of stress,"" she said.  ""You have these people that come in, that don't know you, and 'You're going to help me with cleaning my house?'"" ""Singleton Moms has actually changed my whole outlook. They care about you, and they're demonstrating their love through their actions."" I sat down with Farley-Berens to ask her about her work. Below is an edited version of our conversation. CNN: Tell me about the woman who inspired your work. Farley-Berens:  I grew up with a girl named Michelle Singleton who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30.  She was a single mother of four children and I was a young mom with two kids. And it was scary. You just want to be there to watch them grow up. Paying the bills, cleaning her home, making dinner for her kids -- all of that became a real struggle. I wanted to make things as easy as possible for her. So when I would go to the store, I'd grab an extra Tide and extra toilet paper. When I would make my meals for my family, I would double it and bring a meal over to her house.  Once I helped with an electric bill.  I just tried to do those little things that I hoped would relieve her of some stress. About six months after she passed, we got to thinking she couldn't have been the only one. There were other people like her that needed help.  And that's how Singleton Moms was born. CNN: I'd imagine that many people haven't thought about the struggles of being a single parent with cancer.  How are you able to help? Farley-Berens: We focus on day-to-day support -- financial assistance, housecleaning, prepared meals, supplies for the home, kids' events. It's that old-fashioned mentality of neighbors helping neighbors. Who doesn't like a clean house that they didn't have to clean themselves? We have a team of volunteers that have all been background-checked and they sweep, mop, clean the bathrooms. We even have a couple of volunteers who go way above and beyond and will do laundry and fold clothes. And so, our parents can come home from chemo, sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about, ""Ugh, the bathroom needs to be cleaned.""  It's just to allow them to focus on what's important, which is their health and their family. CNN: Is this work hard for you sometimes, on a personal level? Farley-Berens: About 80% of the parents we support are stage 4, which means that battling cancer is their full-time job. They will not go back to work and for the rest of their lives, they'll be in treatment. It's hard.  It's a rollercoaster.  I've had bouts when a certain mom has passed where I didn't get out of bed for two weeks. And I thought, ""Why am I doing this?""  But then I come back and remember why. And so, while Michelle is and always will be our inspiration, there are now so many others that are just as inspirational. They're why I keep doing what I do. CNN: We should note that name of the organization is no longer entirely accurate. Farley-Berens: We're not just about moms -- we have dads, too! Not a lot, but if you are a single parent, you need the support.  They tend to even get a little special treatment.  Everybody's like, ""Oh, there's a dad here.""  And so they give them lots of hugs and pay a lot of attention to them. CNN:  It's such a serious subject, but your group seems to have a very fun vibe. Farley-Berens: We're very social!  Once a month, all of our families come to pick up their supplies.  We do crafts with the kids, snacks and have a good time.  We like having any event because cancer sucks, and there's not a lot of happy that goes with that. But life does still go on, so it's really important that these families can just de-stress and have fun. No one can understand what they're going through like another single parent with cancer. So giving them the opportunity to meet and support each other is very powerful. Cancer can be so defeating.  It's an ugly word and it's a sad word.  And so, it's my hope that Singleton Moms can bring joy and say to cancer, ""You can't defeat us.  We are still going to be strong and we're going to celebrate life.  And you can't take that away from us."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN)On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled ""Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,"" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal ""what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,"" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans ""targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction."" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book ""Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,"" notes, ""the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems."" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? ""Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!"" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. ""This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it."" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.","Jeff Yang: The media has a misconception about urban unrest in light of Baltimore turmoil .

"(CNN)He might have just won one of sport's most prestigious events, but it wasn't long before Jordan Spieth's thoughts turned to his autistic sister in the glow of victory. The 21-year-old golfer equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record winning score of 18 under par to realize his childhood ambitions of donning the green jacket on Sunday as he swept through the field to become Masters champion at Augusta. An ice-cool display made him the second-youngest winner -- behind only Woods, who was 155 days younger that year -- and only the fifth man to have led from start to finish over the tournament's four days. ""I miss her a lot, and I wish she could have been here,"" Spieth told CNN's Don Riddell in the aftermath of his triumph as he opened up about younger sibling Ellie, who was not able to attend the tournament. ""But I can't wait to get back to her and maybe let her try on the jacket. ""I'll have to bring her back a present from here. That's what she'll be expecting."" Amid all the pressure of playing professional golf, Spieth's 14-year-old sister provides him with perspective. ""How has she shaped my upbringing? Well, she's the most special part of our family. She's the funniest part of our family,"" he said. ""I love having her around. She's an incredible sister, my biggest supporter. She is somebody who you can watch and then reflect on the big picture of life and understand that all these frustrations in a day, or in a round of golf, are really secondary. ""We wouldn't have that realization without her."" At the age of just 14, the prodigy from Texas -- who was named after basketball legend Michael Jordan -- had been clear about what he wanted: his aim was to take the Masters title one day. And he betrayed virtually no sign of nerves throughout his stunningly dominant performance, letting slip only a muttered ""oh dear"" when he marginally sliced a tee shot halfway through the final round. Last year, Spieth lost the lead just before the nine-hole turn on the last day -- but he never looked like being denied this time, beating Phil Mickelson's Masters record of 26 birdies for good measure. ""To sit with this jacket on and to be a part of the history of Augusta National and the Masters was something I watched slip away last year,"" said Spieth, who described the reality of winning as ""even better"" than his dreams. ""I had a chip on my shoulder (about that). I carried some momentum into this week and it all came together, right at the right time."" Shown a picture of himself wearing one of the most coveted pieces of clothing in sport, Spieth, born in Dallas, added: ""Putting on the jacket, it looks good. It looks good. I'm OK wearing green!"" He couldn't stop grinning as he said that he hoped to be finishing his final Masters appearance in 50 years' time, but added that he would ""still remember what it was like walking up the 18th hole today."" And as he looked less far ahead, he revealed that he would be staying true to his roots at next year's Champions Dinner. Asked what he would put on the menu for that event, he said: ""It would be some form of Texas BBQ."" The unassuming Spieth's success brings to mind other stars whose supreme ability and self-belief saw them become major champions in the early days of their careers. In 1985, German tennis player Boris Becker stunned Wimbledon when, at the age of 17, he defeated Kevin Curren to become the event's youngest ever men's champion -- a record that still stands today. Becker said people ""thought I had done something I wasn't supposed to do, something that shouldn't have been possible. But I did it -- and then I did it again at 18, just to make the point."" American player Michael Chang was 118 days younger than Becker when he won the French Open in 1989, while Swiss star Martina Hingis was just 16 when she triumphed at the 1997 Australian Open. Last year, at the age of only 15, Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international footballer when he played in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates, provoking huge media interest and the attention of Europe's top clubs, before he signed for Spanish giant Real Madrid. For them, as for Spieth, perhaps success was meant to be from the earliest days. And as he looked at a picture of himself with a golf club in hand, taken at the age of 6 or 7 at his grandparents' home in North Carolina, he reflected on the determination that had put him in the green jacket, referring to another Major winner. ""How about the focus on that swing?"" he asked. ""That's a little John Daly-like there, isn't it?""","Jordan Spieth hails autistic younger sibling as his biggest supporter .

"(CNN)The last time Frank Jordan spoke with his son, Louis Jordan was fishing on a sailboat a few miles off the South Carolina coast. The next time he spoke with him, more than two months had passed and the younger Jordan was on a German-flagged container ship 200 miles from North Carolina, just rescued from his disabled boat. ""I thought I lost you,"" the relieved father said. Louis Jordan, 37, took his 35-foot sailboat out in late January and hadn't been heard from in 66 days when he was spotted Thursday afternoon by the Houston Express on his ship drifting in the Atlantic Ocean. ""I was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me, and I was grateful to God that my parents were not going to be worried about me,"" Jordan told CNN. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. ""He's got very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,"" Frank Jordan told CNN. ""And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal."" The younger Jordan said he took his sailboat out to the Gulf Stream to find some better fishing, when it capsized.  He broke his shoulder when the boat flipped. Because of the injury, Jordan couldn't repair the boat's mast, which had snapped. ""Everything I owned got broken -- all my electronics, my GPS devices,"" Jordan said.  He was dead in the water. Jordan drifted in the Atlantic, rationing food and water until his shoulder healed. He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, Jordan said, but he could make little headway against the currents. ""It took so long,"" he said.  ""It moved so slowly."" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. ""I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,"" Jordan said.  ""The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. ""Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket."" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jodran came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital at about 7:30 p.m. Jordan was reported missing January 29, a few days after his last contact with his father. Two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son's rescuers. Frank Jordan thanked the captain of the Houston Express. ""You're a good man, I swear.  You did what you are supposed to do, and I sure do appreciate it,"" he says. ""And I know my son appreciates it."" CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","Louis Jordan says his sailboat capsized three times .

"Washington (CNN)Until recently, if you sat in church on Sunday mornings, pollsters could predict where you stood on same-sex marriage. What a difference a decade makes. In 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court became the country's first to legalize same-sex marriage, less than 30% of religiously affiliated Americans supported gays' and lesbians' right to wed. By 2014, that number had climbed to 47%, according to a survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute. That's more than the 45% who said they opposed same-sex nuptials. The margin is small but statistically significant, said Robert P. Jones, CEO of PRRI, because of the exceptionally large pool of respondents: 40,000 adult Americans. (Eight percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their stance on same-sex marriage.) According to PRRI's poll, there are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it, a dramatic turn in one of this country's most divisive debates and a generational shift with the potential to sweep through everything from the wedding industry to the 2016 presidential race. ""There's been a huge swing in the last decade,"" said Jones. ""There are now big, mainstream groups on both sides of the debate."" If the U.S. Supreme Court has been paying attention, it likely saw this trend coming. Each time the high court has considered a case related to same-sex marriage, the pile of amicus briefs from religious groups supporting gay rights has inched a little taller, and the crowds protesting outside their grand marble steps has gradually grown more diverse. On Tuesday, for example, as the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, a case widely expected to produce a landmark ruling on same-sex marriage, an interfaith coalition of clergy led by the dean of Washington's National Cathedral is planning to march in support of LGBT rights. ""I join with many across the spectrum of American faith communities in my hope that the Court's ruling will permit same-sex marriage in all 50 states,"" the Very Rev. Gary Hall, the cathedral's dean, said in a statement. ""I trust that their judgment will end discrimination against those who seek God's blessing on their marriages."" Clergy from Hall's religious denomination, the Episcopal Church, have also submitted an amicus brief in support of same-sex marriage. The brief is endorsed by nearly 2,000 faith leaders, including rabbis, Methodist ministers, Lutheran bishops, seminary professors and Congregationalist chaplains. Another brief, submitted by the Anti-Defamation League, is signed by Jewish, Hindu and Presbyterian groups. In a reverse of traditional arguments against gay marriage, some members of these groups say their religious rights will be curtailed if states do not allow them to perform same-sex nuptials. Prominent and powerful religious groups are lined up on the other side as well, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Association of Evangelicals, Southern Baptist Convention, Assemblies of God and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon church. Together, leaders of these faiths represent more than 120 million Americans. But as PRRI's survey shows, there are often differences of opinion between the pulpits and the pews. Despite vocal opposition from the U.S. Catholic Bishops, for example, 60% of Catholics now favor same-sex marriage. That's a huge increase from 2003, when just 35% backed gay rights, according to survey conducted at the time by the Pew Research Center. Mainline Protestants -- so-called for their prominence in 20th century American life -- also saw a huge shift in the last decade. While 36% supported same-sex marriage in 2003, now 62% do. At a glance, the pro-gay marriage faction is now strikingly diverse, encompassing Buddhists, Catholics, Jews and Hindus. But the pro-traditional marriage crowd is just as motley, bridging black Protestants, Mormons, Muslims and white evangelicals, according to PRRI's survey. Same-sex marriage rights worldwide . Legalized nationwide:Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden . Legalized in certain regions:Brazil, Mexico, United States . Civil unions or domestic partnerships:Andorra, Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Hungary, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Slovenia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay and parts of Australia, Mexico, United States and Venezuela . The survey data comes from PRRI's American Values Atlas, conducted between April and December of last year. PRRI is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that focuses on faith and American culture. Separate surveys conducted by PRRI and other groups show much of the newfound religious support for same-sex marriage is coming from younger Americans. Seven in 10 Millennials, for example, support same-sex marriage and say that faith groups alienate young adults by being judgemental on sexual ethics. Half of millennial Republicans say gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry, and 43% of white evangelical millennials agree. Those numbers could put GOP presidential candidates in a tight spot, said Jones, as they try to expand their base and appeal to younger Americans. ""The real challenge for GOP candidates is how can they plant their feet deftly enough not to offend older conservatives in the primaries but still be able to pivot in the general election to a younger generation,"" Jones said. Politicians may pivot on same-sex marriage, but Bible-believing Christians should not -- even if public opinion turns against them, said Denny Burk, a professor at Boyce College, a Southern Baptist school in Louisville, Kentucky. ""For me, the number of people who come to the message is not the main issue. There are periods when the Gospel is popular and periods when it's not. You can't base your evaluation of its truthfulness on its popularity at a given historical moment."" Still, Burk said he doesn't doubt that more millennials accept same-sex marriage, and he fully expects the Supreme Court to legalize gay weddings countrywide this June when the justices render a decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. But the fight is far from over, Burk said. ""Just like we've seen this decades-long culture war with abortion, we're going to see the same thing with gay marriage.""","There are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it, according to a new poll .

"(CNN)Last week, California Gov. Jerry Brown ordered mandatory statewide restrictions on water use for the first time in the state's history. His action was driven by a specific crisis unique to California at the moment -- the severe drought now in its fourth year there -- but it has significance for the whole nation. As it has in the past, California is leading the way in recognizing that population and economic growth has to respect the physical limits imposed by planet Earth. California developed the infrastructure and system of legal rights it uses to distribute water at a time when the population was much smaller than it is today -- and when the climate was in an unusually wet phase, historically speaking. This led to a system that all but encourages heavy water use in dry parts of the state, with little consistency in allocation or pricing and little disincentive to waste. This has never made a lot of sense, but the new measures are the strongest acknowledgment yet that it just isn't tenable today in a serious drought. As for the drought: It won't be the last, and surely won't be the worst to come in the remainder of this century. Brown's measures may be temporary, but we can hope that they'll be a step toward a more permanent reformation of the state's water distribution system -- one that includes large agricultural users, who are not included in the current measures, although they are the dominant consumers of California's water. How the drought affects rest of the nation . What California does now has global significance: Lack of clean fresh water is a serious problem in much of the world. On the Indian subcontinent, where supply can't meet the demands of rapid development, groundwater is being depleted much as it is in California, and is an equally unsustainable practice in both places. And my colleagues at Columbia recently published a study arguing that drought in Syria was one of the causes of the ongoing war there. They also presented strong evidence that the Syrian drought was in part attributable to human-induced climate change -- in itself, another physical constraint the planet places on growth. Our energy systems, like our water systems, are not sustainable. Is the California drought a consequence of climate change? A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report for which my colleague Richard Seager was lead author, argued that it isn't (though the authors acknowledge that global warming makes the drought worse by increasing evaporation from the soil). California, and southwestern North America, indeed saw worse ""megadroughts"" in the pre-Columbian past, long before any humans burned fossil fuels. At the same time, the latest projections are that the odds of such megadroughts are increasing with warming. So we're left with a complex picture, one typical of many extreme weather events. We know that human-induced climate change is increasing the risk that an event such as this will happen, while at the same time we can't strongly blame climate change for the specific event happening right now. Does it matter whether the drought is climate-change-induced or not? From a pragmatic public relations perspective, maybe. Extreme weather events make people aware that we are all vulnerable to them, and media coverage can draw attention to the scientific evidence that climate change is increasing the risks. At least in principle, this awareness can help to build the constituency for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I lived in Australia for a year in 2007-08 when the country was well into a drought that lasted about a dozen years -- and that led to water restrictions in nearly all the country's major cities. Though the role of greenhouse gases in that drought wasn't clear either, the hardship nonetheless made Australians much more concerned about climate change than Americans were at the time. Polls showed that the issue played a significant role in the national elections held during my year there, with a climate-denialist government falling to a much more climate-proactive one (though the pendulum has since swung back). But being able to blame climate change for a specific extreme weather event shouldn't be the only thing to spur action on reducing greenhouse gases. Whether we're talking about a drought in California, a hurricane on the East Coast, a flood in the Midwest or a tornado outbreak on the Plains, the connection of a single event to climate change is likely to be the subject of legitimate scientific controversy. The reality and seriousness of human-caused global warming, however, isn't. The scientific case that human emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the climate, and that these changes pose serious risks to humans and other species, doesn't rest on single-event attribution, but rather on the statistics of large sets of weather events. That big picture is what should motivate us. And when it comes to our getting better prepared for the degree of climate change that is inevitable, in many cases it matters even less to what extent a given weather event was human-induced vs. natural. California could have had this drought, and worse, without global warming. Similarly, sea level rise is increasing the risk of coastal floods, but cities such as New Orleans, New York and many others were (and are) too vulnerable already. Because really extreme events are by definition rare, most places haven't seen the worst nature can deliver, even without climate change, in their recent histories. So our development planning has tended to proceed under the assumption that that worst won't happen, leaving us with infrastructures that aren't properly adapted even to the current climate. Many of the measures we need to take to close that gap -- such as making California's water distribution system less wasteful, or New York's subways more flood-proof -- will also help to prepare us for the new climates to come. They may not be enough, in the long term, but they're a start. We call these ""no-regrets"" measures, because they are good ideas regardless of how rapidly or slowly global warming proceeds. If California can teach the rest of us something about how to design and implement such measures for water, it will be an upside to what otherwise is nothing but a slow-moving disaster.","Adam Sobel: California's steps against drought are a preview for rest of U.S. and world .

"(CNN)The marriage apocalypse may be coming. Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single. I did. And I do. Recently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. 'Cause, guess what? They don't care what your generation thinks -- they'll get married if and when they want. ""I didn't go to college for four years to be a mom,"" 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. ""There's no housewife degree. I've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well."" Jackie Demate, also 21, agreed. ""I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe."" At first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, ""Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!"" Jackie didn't blink. ""But, Europe!"" she exclaimed. ""I'm really looking for a travel buddy. And I don't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I'm not happy. ... I'm OK being single forever. As long as I'm happy."" Before you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she's coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once. That's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960. What a fine example my generation is! Not. Still, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29. Religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction. A study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says:  ""From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being."" On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be ""more desirable marriage prospects."" Bingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don't want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt. ""Right now, I'm 21 years old. And I'm thousands of dollars in debt,"" Emily Crille told me. ""That wasn't something my parents bore. And it's really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don't have a job, and you don't have a home."" I felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either -- until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable? Perhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it's exactly right. Scandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today: ""In Norway ... 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it's clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying."" The article also points out that ""Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations' quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation's well-being. The USA came in eighth."" In an effort to understand the joys of ""sambo,"" the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden. ""To put it short,"" he told us, ""marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation."" Wow. Fifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, ""I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don't think the whole thing is worth it."" Maybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: ""The notion that marriage is something that you're pressured into seems horrible to me. ... Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities."" My Kent State millennials -- true romantics -- would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, ""Marriage is about love. It's not about planning or timing, and that's what we're all kind of waiting for."" Marriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn't enough. Which brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn't plan to have children, what was the point? In the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with ""I dos""? I don't know. But I would love to know if you do.","Carol Costello: Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free .
In countries like Sweden or Denmark, people don't feel pressured to marry even if they have kids together ."
"(CNN)Anthony Sideri hit rock bottom while wrapped in a dirty blanket on the floor of a jail infirmary bathroom in Middleton, Massachusetts. He was 25, shivering, sweating, throwing up and going through the full withdrawals of heroin. He had just robbed a bank after shooting up heroin all day. That was July 22, 2007, the day his life changed forever. It was the last time he used drugs, the first and only time he was arrested, and the first and only time to fully withdrawal from heroin. ""I knew that my whole world was over, and I thought I was going to die because I never had been so sick,"" Sideri said. ""I had nothing to my name, and I didn't know if anyone else in the world even knew I was there."" Nearly eight years later, Sideri looks back on his drug-using days like it was another person's life. Sideri was your average student in high school playing on the hockey team, occasionally drinking and smoking weed until he began using drugs on a daily basis. He can't pinpoint exactly when it started or how or why, but it got to the point where he was smoking marijuana before, during and after school, and experimenting with mushrooms and acid. ""Anything else that I saw, I would have tried,"" he says now. His grades dropped, he lost his eligibility to play sports, but when he was drunk or high, none of that mattered. ""I didn't have to worry about what anyone thought, I could just go to a fantasy land and not have worries,"" Sideri said. After graduating from high school in 2000, Sideri began abusing Percocet and OxyContin, opium-containing painkillers. As his tolerance to the pills built up, he began snorting the drugs to feel the effects faster. Then he moved on to snorting heroin. ""I wasn't getting the strong effects of OxyContin anymore, and I was already sniffing something else, so it didn't seem like a leap,"" he said. ""It didn't seem like the heroin I grew up knowing about."" By 2005, he had been snorting heroin daily for two years. Even as he was doing more and more drugs, he was in denial about his addiction since he had a job with his family's wholesale snack supply business and a second job as a nightclub bouncer, worked out at the gym and had his own car and a place to live. ""On the outside, I had it all,"" Sideri said. That all changed the day he stuck out his arm and had someone put in a needle. Once Sideri started shooting up heroin, his life spiraled downward in only four months. He was hiding from his loved ones and his drug problem was obvious to everyone around him. He still thought he could control his drug use and quit on his own. ""I really thought I could stop the next day, but I always had an excuse,"" Sideri said. ""I was closed off from the rest of the world. ... I wasn't even a part of it anymore."" By July 2007, he had no more money to fuel his addiction. Out of ""pure desperation,"" he robbed a bank in Danvers, Massachusetts, with another addict. ""Robbing a bank seemed like a way to get a lot of money fast, which equaled a lot of heroin,"" said Sideri. ""That would hold me over for a long time ... I thought."" As Sideri describes it, his partner entered the bank and handed the teller a cell phone. Sideri was on the other end, claiming to have a hostage. The men left with the money and were caught after a brief chase. ""Getting caught never even crossed my mind,"" he said. ""I was instead planning what I was going to do after: Get drugs."" That was the last day he ever used. Sideri spent the next couple of weeks curled up on the floor of a jail cell withdrawing, cold turkey, from his years of heroin abuse. He describes the withdrawals as like ""having food poisoning for three days straight,"" combined with a burning, tingling sensation in his bones. ""I would flex and punch the floor to try to make it go away. I couldn't stop it, and I couldn't sit still,"" he said. ""Boiling hot showers were the only thing that felt better. Burning, burning, burning."" He was convicted of larceny, conspiracy and threatening to steal from a depository for his part in the robbery. He spent a year in court-ordered rehab and another 22 months in jail. ""Jail was the catapult for me,"" Sideri said. ""It finally made me say, 'It's over.' "" Once released in 2010, Sideri vowed to never let drugs influence his life again. He will be celebrating eight years sober this July and has made tremendous strides to repair his life. He is working full time as a salesman for his family's business and is attending school to become a substance abuse counselor. He is married with a 1-year-old daughter. And he completed probation last month. ""I live a life of honesty and integrity, even when no one is looking,"" Sideri said. ""I have a daughter who adores me and thinks I am her hero. And I can be, now."" It's been a long journey. He spent nearly eight years rebuilding his relationships with his family, paying off debts, fixing his bad credit and rebuilding his reputation in his small town of North Andover. He wants others to know him as the hardworking family man he is now and not judge him by his past. He acknowledges that it's always going to be an uphill battle for others to not to have a preconceived image of him. ""Many people only know about my robbery, addiction and jail time,"" he said. ""They have no idea about who or what I am now."" Sideri says he hopes ""the ripple effects of being true to myself will eventually drown out the bad."" He already sees that happening when he Googles his name and the robbery is no longer the first story that comes up. He visits high school groups to help encourage students to not fall down the path he took and to encourage others to get help. ""Anthony was a great kid growing up, but he lost his way, "" said Rick Gorman, executive director of North Andover Youth and Recreation Services. Gorman has known Sideri since he was in middle school, and tried to help him in high school. ""He is a perfect example that addiction doesn't mean the end of the world."" To those trying to recover from drugs, Sideri offers two pieces of advice: . 1. Tell everybody. ""A lot of families and individuals tend to think or say, 'Don't tell anyone,' or 'No one has to know.' The first step in recovery is honesty. When you hide any part of your mistakes or indiscretions, you are blocking yourself from being free from it."" 2. Surround yourself with people who make you want to be a better person. ""If you hang out in a barber shop long enough, you're gonna get a haircut. You have to honestly re-evaluate who you spend time with and remove people who are still using and making other bad choices."" Sideri has many new goals in life. One is to be an example of what recovery looks like and how an addict can truly change. The bottom line, he says: Recovery and long-term sobriety is possible.","Strung out on heroin, Anthony Sideri robbed a bank .

"Catania, Sicily (CNN)We are at the beginning of a massive and mounting crisis with no solution in sight. Perhaps that's incorrect. The migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to Sicily has been brewing for years, but in the past 10 days, with as many as 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean, suddenly minds are focused -- for now. Almost exactly four years ago, in Libya, I caught, perhaps, a glimpse of what was to come. It was late at night in the besieged city of Misrata. Hundreds of African migrants were caught between the Libyan civil war (back then some optimistically called it a ""revolution"") and the deep blue sea. They had come to Misrata from Ghana, Nigeria and elsewhere, hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to Europe. They had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces, but weren't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city. They appealed to us to help them escape. We could do nothing, but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided. The fall of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime, which we reporters covered so avidly, was followed by chaos, which we in the news media largely neglected, focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe, the Syrian civil war. In that chaos, the business of human trafficking has boomed. And now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of Italy. The focus today is on those lost at sea. Aware of the tragedy underway, however, Italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe, according to one European Union official. That is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania, where many migrants arrive. The city's mayor, Enzo Bianco, insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants, but says Catania, and Sicily cannot absorb the ever-growing numbers. The rest of Europe must help carry the burden. ""If something serious isn't done,"" he warns, ""dramas like these will be repeated. This problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand."" Increasingly, some Italians are losing their patience. Two northern regions, Veneto and Valle d'Aosta, have declared they will no longer accept new migrants. The rightist Lega Nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program. Others, however, insist Italy must keep its doors open. In Catania port, I spoke with Grazia Giurato, who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants. ""Many years ago, our grandparents emigrated,"" she recalled. ""Let's keep that in mind."" Indeed, in tougher times, millions of impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the Americas and Australia. They, too, like the migrants from Africa and the Middle East, were fleeing grinding poverty and war. And they, too, experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home. That's the long view, perhaps. But now, today, Italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills, ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption, hopeless poverty, oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan, expensive and politically daunting effort. And while this crisis has been brewing for years, it is now truly upon us.","Hundreds of desperate migrants have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean in recent says .

"(CNN)NASA says its Messenger space probe crashed into Mercury on Thursday after running out of fuel, ending a nearly 11-year journey that provided valuable data and thousands of photos. Mission controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, confirmed the probe slammed into the surface of Mercury, as anticipated, at 3:26 p.m. EDT, NASA told CNN in an email. NASA earlier said the probe was expected to hit the surface at 8,750 miles per hour and to create an impact crater 52 feet (16 meters) in diameter. The crash wasn't visible from Earth because it occurred on the far side of Mercury. Messenger (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was launched in 2004 and traveled more than 6½ years before it started circling Mercury on March 18, 2011. It was the first spacecraft to orbit the planet closest to the sun. It traveled about 5 billion miles -- a journey that included 15 trips around the sun. Spacecraft to make death dive into Mercury . The spacecraft was healthy when it crashed, but was out of fuel. When scientists determined there was no way to save it, they held a briefing this month to celebrate the mission's success. ""For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,"" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington. One of the mission's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. As the end neared, the probe sent back some final tweets thanking mission managers and counting down its final orbits. The Messenger mission is over, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And while the space probe won't be sending back anymore images, you can see Mercury with your own eyes. It's visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May.","NASA's Messenger probe smashes into Mercury, ending mission .

"(CNN)As ash from Chile's Calbuco Volcano spread east into Argentina, geologists warned of the potential for more activity Friday. Evacuations in the region involved not only people but animals as well. ""There is more seismic activity ... and we think there will be more activity today,"" Helmuth Huerta, a spokesman for Chile's National Geological and Mining Service, told CNN. The volcano has already erupted twice this week, spewing ash to a depth of about 23½ inches (60 centimeters) in some places, according to the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety. New advisories say airborne ash could reach an altitude of 12,000 feet. Calbuco erupted twice in 24 hours, the geological agency said early Thursday. The agency said it was evaluating a spectacular nighttime eruption but indicated it was ""stronger than the first one."" In Ensenada, houses, trees and even sheep were blanketed gray with ash, CNN's Shasta Darlington reported. People were removing salmon -- a staple of the local economy -- amid fear of contamination from ash and lava. Trucks were used to evacuate farm animals and pets. Authorities issued a red alert for the popular tourist towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in the south. People were being evacuated to Port Montt on 22 buses and military trucks, the interior ministry said. Officials said that volcanic flows from Calbuco caused rising water levels in the Río Blanco. A 12-mile (20-kilometer) exclusion zone was established around the crater. Military and police forces were helping evacuate more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said. An additional 2,000 residents of Chamiza were being evacuated as a preventive measure after river levels rose due to volcanic flows. More evacuations were expected in Lago Chapo and Correntoso. The first eruption on Wednesday set off a bit of a panic in the region. ""At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew. And later, there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,"" a Puerto Montt resident said. Another person said: ""It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs."" Magma expanse under Yellowstone supervolcano more vast than thought . The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was 1962. There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996. Alejandro Verges, regional director of the Interior Ministry, said that officials are concerned there might be a third eruption. ""The situation is relatively calm right now, although people are understandably anxious about what could happen tonight,"" he said.","Volcano already has erupted twice this week .

"(CNN)Erica Kinsman, a former Florida State University student who has accused star football player Jameis Winston of rape, has filed a lawsuit against the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, her lawyer said Thursday. Kinsman has said Winston raped her in December 2012.  A prosecutor decided against bringing criminal charges in the case. In the lawsuit filed Thursday, Kinsman alleges sexual battery, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Winston has said the sex was consensual. CNN obtained the following statement from Winston's attorney David Cornwell. ""This stunt was expected,"" the statement said. ""Ms. Kinsman's false accusations have already been exposed and rejected six times.  This time will be no different. Mr. Winston welcomes the opportunity to clear his name with the truth. Mr. Winston is looking forward to the upcoming [NFL] draft.  He will not permit this ploy to distract him as he begins the journey of fulfilling his lifelong dream of being a championship quarterback in the National Football League."" CNN doesn't normally identify the alleged victims of sexual assault; however, Kinsman revealed her name this year in a documentary about rape on college campuses. FSU hearing clears Winston . Winston led the Florida State Seminoles to a national championship for the 2013 season and won the Heisman, given to the most outstanding collegiate football player. He is expected to be a top pick in the NFL Draft, which begins April 30. ""As for timing, we didn't want to wait until the eve of the draft or after he signed a contract,"" said Kinsman's attorney John Clune. ""As soon as we finished the various motions briefing on the FSU case, we turned our attention to Jameis and got it filed."" Kinsman also sued the university in January. According to police documents in the rape case, Kinsman said Winston raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar in Tallahassee. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. Kinsman also said she did not remember much of what happened next but that she remembered being in a ground-floor apartment, where Winston took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections, according to police documents. Kinsman reported the alleged assault to FSU campus police that night. A month later, in January 2013, she told Tallahassee police that Winston was the attacker. Tallahassee's interim police chief at the time, Tom Coe, said the woman ""broke off contact"" with investigators in February 2013 and didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family said a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a ""big football town"" and that life could be miserable if she pursued the case. Winston didn't play during the 2012 season but came to Florida State as one of the nation's top quarterback recruits, according to recruiting rankings.","Winston's lawyer: Kinsman's ""false accusations have already been exposed and rejected six times""

"Lampedusa, Italy  (CNN)The cramped galley of the ship is filled with the smell of fresh garlic frying in olive oil. Gaetano Cortese, a tall, thin, sunburned 27-year veteran of Italy's Guardia di Finanza (Finance Police) is waxing eloquent on his favorite subject: food. ""We picked it this morning from the hills of Lampedusa,"" he declares with a flourish, waving thin sprigs of wild asparagus under my nose. He demonstrates how you must break it apart with your fingers, bit by bit, until you get to the hard part, which you keep aside to boil down in water for the pasta sauce he is preparing with his shipmate, Enzo Idone. Cooking, however, may be a positive distraction from dark memories. How I was smuggled into Europe -- and why it was worth it . We boarded the Finance Police's ship, the Calabrese, in Lampedusa harbor earlier in the evening. The Calabrese regularly patrols the Mediterranean off Lampedusa, which is Italy's southernmost territory and just 70 miles, or just over 110 kilometers, from the Tunisian coast. In recent years, it has been the first point of entry to Europe for tens of thousands of migrants from Africa and the Middle East. A few years ago, the Calabrese was on the look out for ""contrabandisti,"" smugglers trafficking in cigarettes and drugs. But in recent years, its 12-man crew has joined Italy's effort to rescue migrants coming from Africa and the Middle East. We spend seven hours on board the ship, but nothing much happens. We see some Italian fishing boats the crew knew by sight. Shortly after sunset, the Calabrese's captain, Gianluca Busonera, begins calling out quick orders to his men as we approach a small boat. The easy-going crew seem to tense up. One man turns on a bright spotlight and focuses the beam on the boat, while another with powerful binoculars read out the name on the back. Busonera peers intently at the boat, which appears to be a fishing vessel, then shrugs. ""It's fine,"" he tells me. ""If it were low in the water, we'd know it was full of people, but this boat is riding high."" He waves to the Tunisian boat, where an older man in a jacket waves back. Busonera gives him a thumbs up, and steers the ship to the right. It's a routine evening for the Calabrese, and that is just fine with the crew. They've seen enough troubles in their time to appreciate an uneventful day's work. Back in the galley, I ask Cortese about his worst experience while serving at sea with the Guardia di Finanza. He and most of his shipmates took part in the rescue effort on October 3, 2013, after a ship with hundreds of migrants had gone down off Lampedusa. More than 350 people died in that disaster. The crew of the Calabrese was able to rescue four of the survivors. Cortese's cheery demeanor suddenly becomes serious. ""I still remember pulling out of the water, with our hands, a young, pregnant woman who had just died,"" he recalls. ""There were children,"" adds his crewmate, Idone, shaking his head. ""We recovered the bodies of children. It was a bad situation. I remember the body of a boy we recovered. We put him in a body bag. His head was in this hand,"" he said waving his hand as if he had just picked up the lifeless body. Why migrants are risking their lives to reach Italy . Cortese and Idone stress that as fathers, there is nothing worse than having to see the bodies of dead children. ""At the moment,"" recalls Cortese, ""we were too busy to think about it, but when we go home, before going to sleep, it comes back to us."" He emphasizes that he and his shipmates were just doing their duty as professional military men. Out in the Mediterranean, with no land in sight, you realize just how vast it is. And although it's been warm on land in Sicily recently, at night on the water, it's cold and windy. On board the Calabrese, we are warm, well-fed and in good company. The ship is well-maintained and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, allowing Busonera to plow confidently through the waves in the dark without fear of running into anything. It contrasts starkly with conditions migrants have recounted to us of the rickety boats and unseaworthy rubber dinghies they use to try to cross the Mediterranean. Often they're without food, water or shelter, their boat's crew inexperienced and untrained. That's if they have a crew at all. Many migrants have been beaten and robbed of all their possessions before they board. And unless a ship like the Calabrese comes to their rescue, death at sea is a definite possibility.","Ben Wedeman joins the Calabrese, an Italian patrol boat as it traverses the Mediterranean looking for migrants .

"Seoul (CNN)North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is continuing to rule with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year, according to an assessment by South Korean intelligence agents, a lawmaker who attended a closed briefing said. Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, told a handful of reporters that he had been given the information by the South Korean National Intelligence Service. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions. The nature of the intelligence supporting the National Intelligence Service allegations was also not immediately clear. North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. According to Shin, intelligence officials say Kim is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views at variance with his own. He considers those a challenge to his authority, the intelligence officials said, according to Shin. For example, a senior official with Ministry of Forestry was executed for expressing dissatisfaction with the country's forestry program, the lawmaker said. North Korean defectors share their ordeals . The vice chairman of the State Planning Commission was executed because he objected to changing the design of a science and technology hall from a rounded shape to one resembling a flower, the intelligence officials said, according to the lawmaker. And in March, according to the South Korean lawmaker, Kim executed on charges of espionage four members of the Unhasu Orchestra, including the general director, because of a scandal, Shin said. Kim became North Korea's Supreme Commander in December 2011 following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. According to the National Intelligence Service, he is reported to have executed 17 senior officials in 2012, 10 in 2013 and 41 in 2014. The National Intelligence Service says there is a strong possibility that Kim will visit Russia, but given his nature, there is no way to be sure until the last minute.

""Or peace of mind in knowing that they're healthy and there's nothing to worry about."" Swift, 25, added that ""usually when things happen to me, I process them and then write music about how I feel, and you hear it much later. This is something my family and I thought you should know about now. ""Thank you for caring about my family so much that she would want me to share this information with you.

Tensions rose as demonstrators confronted police, several of whom shouted: ""Back up!"" The Baltimore Police Department said the two were detained for disorderly conduct and destruction of property. There were no other arrests and the protests -- on the whole -- were peaceful. Protesters rallied at City Hall before marching to a police station. Some walked through traffic. In one instance, they surrounded a police car. Gray died Sunday, one week after he was arrested by Baltimore police. At some point, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. ""The police have a lot of questions that need to be answered,"" Andrew O'Connell, an attorney for the Gray family, told CNN. ""What was the reasonable suspicion? Why were they arresting our client? These are pretty big questions that need to be answered."" ""He had no weapon in his hand. He was committing no crime and he wasn't hurting anybody. The police had no reasonable suspicion to stop or arrest him,"" the attorney said. While Baltimore police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators, the department has not released details of what the officers said or how Gray might have suffered the fatal injury. Protesters are upset over the apparent lack of information, and -- recently -- a police union's comparison of the demonstrations to a ""lynch mob."" ""While we appreciate the right of our citizens to protest and applaud the fact that, to date, the protests have been peaceful, we are very concerned about the rhetoric of the protests,"" the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 said in a statement issued Wednesday. ""In fact, the images seen on television look and sound much like a lynch mob in that they are calling for the immediate imprisonment of these officers without them ever receiving the due process that is the constitutional right of every citizen, including law enforcement officers."" Scenes from Baltimore . That comparison drew swift and sharp criticism, given the history of lynchings of African-Americans in the United States. Rooted in the racial ire of the Civil War, the extrajudicial mob killings of blacks, other minorities and people opposed to oppression of minorities were common in the segregated South. More than 4,000 people were murdered between 1877 and 1950 in 12 Southern states, according to a recent report. But lynchings weren't restricted to the South, and they have deeply scarred race relations in the country. ""Which one is the #LynchMob again?"" John Cotton tweeted, posting a photo of a peaceful protest next to photos of Gray during his arrest and hospitalization. ""The choice of words is not only ironic, it's sad,"" said O'Connell, the attorney for the Grays. ""Police officers are never the subject of a lynch mob. It's actually usually the other way around,"" he told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""And in the context of the powder keg that Baltimore city is right now, referring to the citizens of Baltimore city who are peacefully protesting as a 'lynch mob' doesn't serve to keep the peace. It only heightens the flames, or fans the flames of people who are already on edge."" Amid protests, officials advised people to clear the area or expect delays.  A statement encouraged employees who work downtown to get out of the area to ""avoid major disruptions."" Baltimore police requested and received additional personnel from Maryland State Police. Thirty-two troopers arrived to help with crowd control and serve in a ""backup capacity"" for police, according to Erin Montgomery, a spokesperson for Gov.  Larry Hogan. A small rally and press conference was held at noon, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Peoples Power Assemblies. They announced that they will conduct their own investigation into the events that led to Gray's death. Thursday's events follow a series of demonstrations this week, with protesters demanding elusive answers. Baltimore protests: 5 questions demonstrators are asking . Among the questions: Did something happen inside the police transport vehicle that caused Gray's fatal spinal injury? And what took place in the 30 minutes before police called paramedics to pick Gray up? ""Our position is something happened in that van,"" police union attorney Michael Davey said. ""We just don't know what."" But one question has already been addressed: Did officers have the right to chase Gray in the first place? Police first encountered Gray on April 12 as they patrolled an area known for crime and drug activity. When Gray saw them, authorities said, he started running. Gray's family attorney and protesters claim police didn't have any probable cause to chase him, but did so only because he was ""running while black."" But Davey said officers had every right to give chase. ""There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did,"" he said. ""In this type of an incident, you do not need probable cause to arrest. You just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop."" Gray was arrested after police found what they said was a switchblade on him. An attorney for Gray's family has said the knife was a pocket knife of legal size. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said he met Thursday with the family. ""There was a lot of pain in that family, and I can understand it. If that was my son that ended up the same way, I would be angry,"" he told CNN. Updates and images from the field . One video of Gray's arrest shows officers dragging him to a police van, his legs dangling limply behind him. ""His leg look broke!"" a bystander yells as a witness captures the arrest on a cell phone video. That witness, who only wants to be identified as Kiona, said she knew Gray as a joker and a ladies' man. But that day, he said only one thing to her. ""When I ran up the street and seen him, the first thing I asked him was he OK because I heard him screaming,"" Kiona said. ""He didn't never say yes or no, he just said 'I can't breathe' and just was yelling."" Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Leonard Hamm said he was disturbed by video of the arrest. ""What I see is a person in distress, and what should have happened is at that point, they should have called for medical attention to help him out,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" Hamm led the department from 2004 to 2007. He said he was surprised and disappointed by what has happened. ""I thought we were better than that,"" he said. ""I thought we were better trained than that."" It's not clear whether Gray was injured during the arrest. His family has not yet seen the autopsy report, attorney William Murphy said. The medical examiner's office told CNN it could take up to 90 days to release the report, which is typical. Gray's body is now in his family's care and has been transported to a funeral home. The family has not specified which one.  That information will be released when arrangements have been finalized. Mary Koch, a member of the family's legal team, told CNN that an independent autopsy will be conducted at the facility. The police department is investigating what happened and will turn over its finding to the state attorney's office May 1, the department said. ""As with any criminal investigation, detectives will continue to pursue the evidence wherever it leads, for as long as it takes."" The Justice Department is investigating whether Gray's civil rights were violated during the April 12 arrest. And Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she ""absolutely"" believes an outside investigation is needed, especially given the city's dark history of police misconduct. According to The Baltimore Sun, the city has paid about $5.7 million over the past four years to settle more than 100 cases of allegations of police wrongdoing. Police didn't admit fault in any of the cases. The police union said in a statement Wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple: City officials believe lawsuits are too costly.

"(CNN)For five decades, Bikram Choudhury built an empire. The signature ""hot yoga"" bearing his name drew throngs of devotees, spawning studios teaching the practice all over the world. He became a spiritual leader and celebrity icon with a long list of famous followers and friends. But now, the Bikram brand is in jeopardy, with some yoga studios dropping his name after the guru was accused of rape or sexual assault by six of his former students. Responding to the allegations for the first time in an exclusive interview with CNN, Choudhury said he wanted to set the record straight. ""I want to show you,"" he said, ""tell the truth to the world, that I never assaulted them."" Choudhury repeatedly denied sexually assaulting anyone, saying he would never resort to physical aggression to have sex because he has so many offers. ""Women like me. Women love me,"" he said. ""So if I really wanted to involve the women, I don't have to assault the women."" He said he feels sorry for his accusers, claiming they've been manipulated by lawyers to lie. ""I have nothing against them. I don't think they're bad people. It's not them saying that,"" he said. ""They are influenced by somebody."" But Choudhury's accusers say he's the one who's been lying. ""This stuff that he's teaching is really good stuff, but he's hurting people and hiding behind this good stuff so people don't believe he's capable of hurting people,"" said Sarah Baughn, a former student who now accuses Choudhury of sexual assault. ""He's got to stop lying behind it. And he's got to stop doing this to people."" Choudhury is the founder of Bikram's Yoga College of India. He's featured prominently on its website, which details his system of performing 26 unique yoga poses while in a very hot room. With studios heated to 105 degrees, he credits the steamy, sweaty stretches with transforming people's bodies and minds. He said he's guided by a deep calling to help others. Civil lawsuits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court tell the story of a different Bikram Choudhury, describing him as someone who preyed on young women who looked to him for guidance. Besides Baughn's claim of sexual assault, five other women have come forward with civil lawsuits claiming Choudhury raped them. The Los Angeles Police Department, without explanation, declined to pursue criminal charges in the cases. At first, Baughn said, she felt Bikram Yoga would be the answer to her years of back pain and depression. ""It was really quite life-changing for me. ... I felt good for the first time in a while,"" she said, describing her first class. Baughn said her father helped her take out a $7,000 loan so she could attend Bikram's teacher training. But within the first week, she said, one episode left her feeling uncomfortable. In a meeting in Choudhury's office, she said, the guru seemed to make an advance. ""He said, 'What should we do about us? We need to make this a relationship. ... I've known you from a past life.' It was instantly shocking. I felt like my whole system just sort of imploded,"" she said. Then, she said, Choudhury cornered her late one night, making it clear she had to sleep with him in order to advance her career. ""He crawled on top of me and he put his hand on my, inside of my thigh, and the other hand he wrapped around me, and he was holding me there,"" she said. ""He told me that he needed somebody to be with him, to massage him, to brush his hair, to spend time with him, that he was lonely. And he said, 'And I need someone to, to have sex with me.'"" Choudhury, she said, claimed she'd never win a yoga competition if he didn't have sex with her. ""I pushed him off of me and I said, 'I can do this by myself.' And he said, 'No you can't. There's no way.' And I got up and I left the room,"" she said. In another instance, she said Choudhury pinned her against a door and sexually assaulted her when she was left alone with him late one night at a teacher training course. ""I just remember I was terrified. I didn't want to be touched again. When I reached the door, he was there,"" she said. ""He was only in his boxers and a T-shirt. And he pushed himself up against me and held me up against the door,"" she said. ""And he just started kissing all over my chest and my body. And he pushed himself into me very hard."" Ultimately, Baughn said she was able to open the door and get away. Choudhury said Baughn's claims are false. ""It's not truth. I don't do that. I don't have to,"" he said. He said he makes it a practice to never be alone with any of his students. He repeatedly denied assaulting his accusers or ever having consensual sex with them. But when asked whether he'd had sex with other students, he responded, ""yes and no."" ""I have no intention to have sex with any of my students or any women,"" said Choudhury, who said he's been married to his wife for more than 30 years. ""Sometimes students, they commit suicide. Lots of students of mine, they commit suicide because I will not have sex with them."" Bikram claimed these encounters took place before he was married.  But when asked for evidence, Bikram's attorney advised him not to give CNN names. Robert Tafoya, Choudhury's attorney, said there are plenty of reasons to doubt the accusers' claims. ""We know for a fact that these claims allegedly occurred years and years and years ago, and nobody ever came forward,"" he said. ""And yet, after this lawyer sends out these kinds of blasts in social media asking people if they've been a victim of Bikram Choudhury, all of a sudden these people come forward and all have very similar claims."" Carney Shegerian, Baughn's attorney, said that's simply not true. When Baughn started telling her story, he said, others were inspired to speak out. ""When she came forward and went public, it attracted other people, and the other five plaintiffs to also have a modicum of confidence to discuss what had happened to them,"" he said. Baughn said she was inspired by her young daughter to come forward when she did. ""She's 5 now, 5½. But when I looked at my little girl and all I could see was 10 years down the road, or 20 years down the road, and her being just like me, the only thing I could see was her getting raped and assaulted,"" she said. Choudhury vowed to clear his name. But he said the damage has already been done to his family. He cries as he describes how his wife has responded to the allegations against him. ""My wife never look at me anymore,"" he said. ""My children, my wife ... we only die once in our life. I'm dying every day when I get up in the morning."" The situation, he said, has destroyed his family. ""How can I share my heart, my spirit? Twenty-four hours a day, I work harder than any other human being. And this is the reward? I'm a rapist?"" he said. ""Shame on your culture, Western culture. Shame, shame. Your job (is) to go and tell the world the truth."" CNN's  Catherine E. Shoichet, Dana Ford and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Yoga guru Bikram Choudhury denies sexual assault allegations .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are two dynamic leaders at the helm of the world's two most populous nations. And one is particularly vocal about making his mark on history. When India successfully placed a spacecraft into orbit around Mars last year, Modi reveled in the moment. ""History has been created today,"" he said. ""We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved the near impossible. ""The success of our space program is a shining symbol of what we are capable of as a nation."" Soon after the galactic feat, he took to the stage at New York's famous Madison Square Garden and received a welcome so rapturous that Jon Stewart called him ""America's First Modi."" And all along, Modi has issued his call to ""Make in India,"" encouraging companies all over the world to manufacture their products in India where there is a vast talent pool and low-cost production. While Modi's India is out to put its economy on the fast track, China's economy is slowing after over 25 years of breakneck growth. President Xi is managing the slowdown with efforts to boost domestic spending, while cracking down hard on corruption. And it's been predicted that India could outpace China as the world's fastest growing economy as soon as this year. So is the world's largest democracy primed to overtake the world's biggest single party state as the next economic miracle? OPINION: What India can learn from China . Not so fast, says China watcher and India Today correspondent Ananth Krishnan. ""China is still pulling away from India,"" the Beijing-based reporter said. ""If India grows 7.5% this year and China grows 7.4%, I think it makes a good headline.  But I think people shouldn't get carried away about what it means in terms of a gap between China and India."" China's economy may be slowing down but India faces a longer list of economic challenges including higher unemployment, chronic inflation and an overwhelming lack of basic infrastructure. ""In terms of education, having access to different resources, and job creation, China has done well. It has progressed far better compared to India,"" said Infosys China CEO Rangarajan R. Vellamore. ""Even though there is free movement across the country (in India), the paradox is there are a lot of basic issues related to access to water and basic education."" In a recent budget, the Modi government announced plans to boost infrastructure spending as well as cut taxes on businesses among other initiatives to spur economic growth. But despite Modi's big pro-business push, India simply can't size up against China's raw economic might. ""After 30 years of dedicated efforts in building China into a manufacturing powerhouse, it would take a long time for India to build that kind of manufacturing capability,"" said Haiyan Wang, Managing Partner of the China India Institute. ""It's not just about lower labor costs. You have to have a complex industry cluster of supply chains. You have to have the knowledge. You have to have the skills. You have to be connected to the international market,"" she said. ""So when you ask if India could compete with China, I don't think that is going to be happening -- not in the next 20 years."" The Indian elephant may be charging ahead, but the sinewy dragon has the muscle to stay ahead. China has the capacity, the connectivity, and the capital to throw its weight around. And being a single party state with no free elections, Xi can march toward a long-term goal without fretting about the next election. But that's not to say the autocracy has the advantage on all fronts, especially when it comes to winning hearts and minds in the region. ""Even if China is putting money into the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Silk Road fund, it is also building airstrips on reclaimed islands on the South China Sea,"" said Krishnan. ""There no question that India's rise is far less threatening than China's rise."" With the 1962 border dispute still vividly remembered by many in India, the impression of China as a threat stands in the way of further economic integration between the two countries. ""If you look at India's seven northeastern states, which are probably in the most dire need of infrastructure, it's inconceivable for any of those states to allow a Chinese company to come and build roads,"" said Krishnan. So when Modi touches down in Beijing next month for his second meeting with Xi, can both leaders cast aside areas of political tension to get down to business? ""As pragmatic as President Xi is, as pragmatic as Prime Minister Modi is, economic integration is going to happen regardless of 100% trust or not,"" said Haiyan Wang. Eased by the pragmatism of two ambitious leaders, the elephant and the dragon could together leap at the opportunity for a strong economic alliance. ""If these two countries come together, 40% of the world's people are going to be prosperous,"" said Vellamore. ""If they are able to come together, there can be a new kind of world order in the entire region which is going to benefit all of Asia."" It's a moment for both leaders to make a lasting mark on history.","India predicted to outpace China as as world's fastest-growing economy in next year .

But experts say India simply can't size up against China's raw economic might ."
"(CNN)You know the phrase ""dodging a bullet""? Forget about it. Probably not going to happen anymore. The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In February, the ""smart bullets"" -- .50-caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live-fire tests to date, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the tests, an experienced marksman ""repeatedly hit moving and evading targets,"" a DARPA statement said. ""Additionally,"" the statement said, ""a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target."" In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. ""True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target,"" said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. ""This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers,"" Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.",".50-caliber bullets equipped with optical sensors can follow moving targets .

"(CNN)Sarah Brady, who with her husband, James Brady, pushed for stricter gun control laws, including the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, died Friday, her family said. Brady, 73, died of pneumonia, the family said. ""Sarah courageously stepped up after Jim was shot to prevent others from enduring what our family has gone through, and her work has saved countless lives,"" their statement said. James Brady, President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, was shot in the head by John Hinckley Jr. during his attempt to assassinate Reagan in 1981. Brady spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair, advocating against gun violence. He died in August. Sarah Brady was also involved in gun violence prevention for the past 30 years. She was the chairwoman of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence from 2000 until she died. The National Rifle Association said its thoughts and prayers were with the Brady family. ""Although we disagreed on public policy, Sarah Brady was an honorable American who we always respected,"" the gun rights organization said. People we've lost in 2015 . On the Brady Campaign's website, she said she got involved in gun control after her young son picked up what she thought was a toy gun on the seat of a friend's pickup. Her son started to wave it around and she took it from him. It was not a toy, she said, and she fumed over what she imagined could have happened. The loaded gun was much like the one used to shoot her husband. ""It just hit me like a ton of bricks,"" she told CNN in 2013. ""So I asked Jim if he felt comfortable with me speaking out, and he said, 'Of course.'"" After that, the Bradys made it their business to be gun control activists. Despite budgets that were just a fraction of the gun lobby's, the Bradys and their colleagues helped pass federal and state laws, including Maryland's 1988 ban on cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials, 1993's Brady law requiring background checks on certain kinds of gun purchases and a ban on manufacturing and future sales of some military-style firearms, which lasted from 1994 to 2004. Read Sarah Brady's 2014 op-ed for CNN.com . Former President Bill Clinton, who signed the Brady bill in 1993, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a joint statement Saturday that the Bradys ""were fierce champions of sensible gun legislation."" Sarah Brady ""transformed tragedy into a courageous campaign, and because of her work and her remarkable life, American families are safer today,"" the Clintons said. Brady Campaign and Center President Dan Gross said in a written statement that few people are responsible for saving as many lives as Sarah and James Brady. ""Our nation has lost a great hero, and I have lost a dear friend,"" he said. ""I am certain that she would want nothing more than to know we are carrying on her and Jim's legacy with the same fiery compassion and dedication that made her so remarkable."" Sen Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who helped write the Brady bill, concurred. ""She was strong and forceful, sweet and kind, and someone I considered a friend and patriot for decades,"" he said. ""She was a true hero and will be missed by America."" James Brady was one of four people wounded in Reagan's shooting outside a Washington hotel. Suffering a head wound, it was erroneously reported at one point that Brady had died. He was, however, left partially paralyzed. Reagan, severely wounded as well, also survived the attack and served two terms as President. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting and has spent the ensuing years in a psychiatric hospital. The Brady bill was fiercely fought over for seven years before Congress approved it and President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday gave the United Nations' refugee agency three months to relocate refugees from the Dadaab camp -- the world's largest -- to Somalia, or ""we shall relocate them ourselves."" ""The way America changed after 9/11 is the way Kenya will change after Garissa,"" Ruto said in Nyeri, according to a statement from his office. Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in eastern Kenya this month, killing 147 people. Kenya's government says that attack was masterminded by senior Al-Shabaab leader Mohamed Mohamud, whose ""extensive terrorist network within Kenya"" extends into the sprawling Dadaab complex, according to a Kenyan government document given to CNN. Students wake to Islamist militants' terror . Ruto, who is the second highest-ranking person in Kenya's government behind President Uhuru Kenyatta, said his government has had discussions with United Nations officials about what to do with the camp. On Saturday, a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees officer said the agency had not received any formal request from Kenya's government about moving Dadaab. The U.N. refugee agency manages the Dadaab complex, having set up the first camps there in late 1991 amid Somalia's civil war. The agency and the governments of both Kenya and Somalia agreed in 2013 on a process for the repatriation of Somali refugees. But that was supposed to be mutually agreed-upon and voluntary, in accordance with the refugees' ""freely expressed wish and their relevant knowledge of the conditions"" where they'd end up, according to the pact. None of those things, it seems, applies now to the move pushed by Ruto on Saturday. It's not clear where he expects the refugees to go, other than somewhere into Somalia and out of Kenya. Any mass move would be a monumental task, disrupting the already difficult lives of more than 600,000 Somalis who call the camp their home. Simply meeting basic needs is a challenge in the vast complex, which has seen devastating droughts, contagious diseases and other travails that have tested its residents and those trying to help. Still, as tough as conditions there are, they are seen as a better alternative to life back in Somalia, where Al-Shabaab is based and has carried out violent attacks for years. Yet the Islamist extremist group hasn't confined its terror to its homeland, as illustrated by the Garissa attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, which ended with at least 67 dead. The Dadaab complex came under government scrutiny after the Westgate Mall attack, too. But just a few weeks later, CNN's Nima Elbagir managed to go from Somalia to the Dadaab refugee camp undetected by taking one of the panya, or ""rat routes,"" just like many others have done, Al-Shabaab sympathizers among them. Such illicit travel along porous borders as well as police officers' willful ignorance of migrants' fake IDs, as acknowledged by then-Interior Minister Ole Lemku, illustrates Kenya's challenge in keeping out threats from Somalia. That's why, in addition to moving the Dadaab camp, Kenya is building of a 435-mile (700-kilometer) wall covering most of the Somali border from Mandera to Kiunga -- a wall that Ruto says has begun to prevent Al-Shabaab elements from getting into Kenya. The deputy president also vowed that any businesses collaborating with the militant group will be shut down. These measures are in addition to Kenyan airstrikes on Al-Shabaab camps in Somalia in the days after the Garissa massacre. ""We must secure this country at whatever cost, even if we lose business with Somalia,"" Ruto said Saturday. ""No politics, no games, no half-measures should apply, as the death of the 147 students must touch all Kenyans."" CNN's Lillian Leposo reported from Nairobi, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote this story from Atlanta.","The Dadaab refugee camp is the world's largest, with more than 600,000 people .

"(CNN)Greenpeace activists have climbed aboard a Shell oil rig to protest the company's plans to drill in the Arctic near Alaska. The six protesters used ropes and harnesses Monday to scale the huge platform in the Pacific Ocean, tweeting images of their daunting climb as they went. ""We made it! We're on Shell's platform. And we're not alone,"" wrote Aliyah Field, an American activist taking part in the protest. ""Everyone can help turn this into a platform for people power!"" The rig, the Polar Pioneer, is on its way to the Arctic via Seattle. The environmental activists caught up with it about 750 miles northwest of Hawaii, Greenpeace said. They plan to occupy the underside of the rig's main deck and say they have enough supplies to stay there for several days. Shell didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment late Monday. But company spokeswoman Kelly Op De Weegh told Agence France-Presse that the boarding was illegal and jeopardized the safety of the activists and the crew. Greenpeace is furious over a decision last week by U.S. authorities to lift the suspensions on leases to drill for oil and gas in the Chukchi Sea, which lies between northern Alaska and Russia. Shell and several other oil companies bought exploration leases for the sea in 2008. The U.S. government's decision ""means that in 100 days, Shell could begin drilling in the Alaskan Arctic,"" Greenpeace said. Federal agencies still have to review and approve companies' plans before exploratory drilling can start. Shell's work in the Arctic has suffered some setbacks in the past, including a drilling barge that ran aground off southern Alaska on December 31, 2012. Greenpeace has repeatedly used the occupation of drilling-related vessels to bring attention to its cause. One group of its activists was detained for months by Russian authorities in 2013. In the current episode, the activists pursued the Polar Pioneer, which Shell is leasing from Transocean, as it traveled thousands of miles aboard a transport vessel from Malaysia, Greenpeace said. Besides the American protester Field, the activists come from Australia, Austria, Germany, New Zealand and Sweden. The U.S. Coast Guard wasn't immediately available for comment late Monday on the incident. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Six protesters scale the Polar Pioneer, hundreds of miles northwest of Hawaii .

"(CNN)In Russia's tightly-managed democracy, where being an opposition politician can seriously damage your health, chances to question the country's leader are rare. President Vladimir Putin cuts an isolated figure, closely guarded behind the walls of the Kremlin, traveling to-and-fro by helicopter or high-speed motorcade. His almost daily appearances on state television often show him in formal meetings with subordinates, or visiting dignitaries. Interaction with ordinary Russians is usually carefully controlled and fleeting. That is why this annual Q&A session -- in which Putin will spend hours fielding questions from the general public on live television -- is such a widely anticipated event which provokes such excitement. It is direct access to the Russian leader, or at least as direct as most Russians will ever get. In recent years, sitting in a shiny studio surrounded by a hand-picked audience of soldiers, doctors, teachers, factory workers and so on, Putin has held forth on subjects from parenting to food prices, to relations with America. Last year he spoke for three hours and 55 minutes. In 2013, it was a record-breaking 4 hours and 47 minutes. Organizers say this year, public interest is especially strong. At one call center in Moscow, where the public are encouraged to pitch their Putin questions, officials say more than 200,000 questions were submitted in the first hour after lines opened. The Kremlin says they will have to sift through well over 1.7 million emails, video messages and texts to decide who gets to ask what on the big day. A few would-be questions released ahead of the event give us a flavor of what's on Russia's mind. One man, who identifies himself as Vitaly from the Leningrad region, asks: ""Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin's middle name), why are prices going up in the shops but wages are staying the same?"" Sanctions and Russia's deep economic crisis, which saw the value of the Russian currency, the ruble, plunge in value by 50% against the dollar, is set to be a major a theme. So too is foreign policy. With Moscow at odds with the West over Ukraine, some of the released questions show how concerned ordinary Russians are about their country's place in the world. One unidentified schoolgirl asks: ""Is there a threat to Russia's interests from the United States and Europe? And will there be a new Iron Curtain?"" It's not just Russian schoolchildren who want to hear Putin's answer. Critics of the Kremlin, of course, slam this entire event as Russia's imitation of democracy in action. It's hard to imagine a truly critical question, they say, getting aired on national television here. In fact, its best not to look at this event as an opportunity for Russians to question their leader at all. Instead, it is more like a highly produced, highly choreographed chance for their leader to speak to them, and to the world. Sometimes, the Kremlin likes to throw in a nasty surprise, too. Last year saw NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, granted asylum in Russia, address Putin by videolink. Who knows who may pop up this time.","Putin to spend hours fielding questions from the general public on live television .

"(CNN)Yemeni officials said Saudi airstrikes targeting a military base on Tuesday hit a nearby school, injuring at least a half dozen students. The information came from two officials with the governor's office in Ibb province, where the school is located, as well as Houthi sources from the rebel group that is fighting for control of the country. A third source, with the Education Ministry in Ibb, said three students had been killed at the Al Bastain School in Maitam, in southwestern Yemen, as a result of an airstrike. The officials from Ibb's governor's office said the Al Hamza military base was targeted because Houthis have been sending reinforcements from Ibb to nearby provinces. There were no casualties on the base, the officials said, but it was heavily damaged. The school, which is about 500 meters (one-third of a mile) from the base, was not the main target, the officials said. Schoolchildren were heading to their lunch break when the attacks took place, the officials said. The incident was another example of what has become evident in recent days: The chaos in Yemen, now the scene of some of the most chaotic fighting in the Middle East, has left civilians -- noncombatants, both locals and foreigners -- caught in the crossfire. Those trying to escape the violence, either by leaving their homes or by leaving the country altogether, have been flung into a vortex of fear, fatigue, flight and death. Explosions shattered windows in Sanaa, the country's capital. The fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks. At least 74 children are known to have been killed and 44 children maimed since the fighting began on March 26, UNICEF said Monday in a statement. That did not include the children reportedly killed Tuesday in Maitam. Separately, Saudi airstrikes wiped out about a fifth of the armored vehicles recently captured by southern separatists opposing the Houthis near Aden, according to a senior official in the separatist movement. The official expressed frustration about the lack of coordination between the Saudi military and friendly forces in the region, including the anti-Houthi southern separatists. (The Houthis are also sometimes referred to as southern separatists). ""The Saudis have no one on the ground in Aden,"" he said, calling for the military to work out a means of coordination. ""There is very little coordination."" The group had recently captured about 100 pieces of mixed armor. Among the captured weaponry, the official said, were tanks, armored personnel carriers, and some large artillery.  About 20 pieces were destroyed in the Saudi attack that took place near an old oil refinery. Over the weekend, a Saudi-led coalition smashed parts of Yemen's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital, senior Yemeni officials said. Despite the rain of bombs, the Houthis still control Sanaa. But the airstrikes have destroyed much of the city's infrastructure. The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas, the Yemeni officials said. Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well. Yemenis and foreigners are scrambling to leave. Passengers carrying duffel bags and plastic sacks stuffed with clothes were seen boarding an Air India flight as they hastened to leave the capital. Some of them sprinted to the plane. This was a flight that no one wanted to miss. Many were not newcomers to Yemen. Damodar Thakur, a professor at Sanaa University, had lived in the capital for 34 years. ""I never felt like a foreigner,"" he said. He was exhausted by the shelling. ""At night, my goodness!"" he said. ""Gunshots being fired every minute. Sometimes the sky full of sparkling lights. Some women crying, children terrified. Really bad."" Over the last few days, India has evacuated 2,500 people from Yemen, said Vijay Kumar Singh, the Indian deputy foreign minister overseeing the evacuation. The flights are going to Djibouti, a small African nation about 430 kilometers (265 miles) away. Some evacuees are fleeing on boats from port cities such as Aden. ""More cars in the streets in #Aden. Scared families rushing away in cars with smashed windows & suitcases & mattresses on the roof,"" tweeted Robert Mardini, head of operations for the Middle East for the International Committee of the Red Cross. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? Houthi rebels control Sanaa, including the airport. But because of the airstrike campaign, the Saudis to some extent control air access, so getting people out requires coordination. The Saudi air force gave Air India a four-hour window to go to and from Sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing. As the Air India plane approached the city, the crew could see the scars of the fighting. There were no cars on the roads. Dozens of buildings were destroyed. At the airport, the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by Saudi bombs, but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits. Loading of the passengers was swift. They approached the planes carrying boarding passes -- a touch of normalcy in an otherwise abnormal event. They didn't pay for the flight, but they had to purchase exit visas from the Houthis. Children sat on their parents' laps to maximize the number of people on the plane. Some passengers fell asleep as soon as they took their seats before takeoff. Everyone seemed to carry the weight of war, especially nurses who had tended the wounded. From Djibouti, the evacuees will most likely disperse to their home nations. ""Now I can only pray for Yemen and those we left behind,"" Thakur said. Who's joining Saudi Arabia's fight against the Houthis? Yemen has descended into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels, Shiites who complain of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country, forced President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overran Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself still President. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominantly Sunni nation and Yemen's neighbor to the north, to intervene with force along with other Arab nations. The Houthis are allied with Iran, Saudi Arabia's bitter rival across the Persian Gulf, and the Saudis do not want an Iranian proxy in power on their border. At his daily briefing on Tuesday, Saudi Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri told reporters that the ties between the rebels and Iran were clear. He accused Iran of training Yemeni youths to use military aircraft and weapons. After the Houthis seized Sanaa, he said, ""there were 14 flights a week coming from Iran carrying weapons and ammunition for the Houthi militia."" The U.S. role in backing the Saudis has grown since the bombing campaign began two weeks ago. ""We have expedited weapons deliveries, we have increased our intelligence sharing, and we have established a joint coordination planning cell in the Saudi operation center,"" Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said. In addition, the United States has promised to resupply the Saudi weapons stocks used in the last two weeks. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter ""emphasized the importance of limiting civilian casualties when conducting airstrikes"" when he spoke with Saudi Defense Minister Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, the Pentagon said. What about sharing intelligence when it comes to identifying targets? That's a sensitive issue, given the rebels' ties to Iran and concerns about civilian casualties. Guidance from U.S. Central Command stops short of allowing the United States to tell the Saudis what targets to bomb, according to two U.S. defense officials who confirmed details of the guidance to CNN, but declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. The guidance allows the United States to review targets the Saudis have selected, the officials said, and advise them if there are civilian areas nearby or other ""no go"" spots such as mosques and hospitals. CNN's Samira Said, Joe Sheffer and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Saudi military official accuses Iran of training and arming rebels .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, a former top deputy to Saddam Hussein and more recently a key figure in Sunni extremist groups battling the Iraqi government, has been killed in a security operation in that country, Iraqi state-run television reported Friday. Al-Douri was the highest-ranking member of Hussein's regime to evade capture -- the ""King of Clubs"" in a deck of playing cards used by American troops to identify the most-wanted regime officials. He also was a man thought to have led the post-Hussein Sunni extremist group Naqshbandi Army. Military analysis website Globalsecurity.org says the Naqshbandi Army supports ISIS, which has taken over parts of Iraq and Syria. Al-Douri was killed in an operation by Iraqi security forces and Shia militia members in the Hamrin Mountains between Tikrit and Kirkuk, Iraq, Shia militia commander Hadi al-Ameri said. That militia is a predominantly Shiite fighting group that worked with Iraqi troops earlier this month to liberate the Iraqi city of Tikrit from ISIS. The death of al-Douri was also reported by the governor of Salahuddin province, Raid al-Jubouri, who spoke by phone on Iraqi television. Al-Douri's body arrived Friday in Baghdad, where DNA samples were taken to confirm the identity, said the spokesman of another Shiite militia called Hashd Shaabi in an interview with state-run Iraqiya TV. DNA test results could be available in 48 hours, Hashd Shaabi spokesman Yousuf al-Kilabi told the outlet. The U.S. military is aware of the media reports but doesn't have further information to evaluate them, said Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command. While officials are aware of al-Douri's role in the Hussein regime, Ryder declined to comment about whether the United States or the coalition was targeting any specific individuals. Al-Douri was a military commander and vice chairman of the country's revolutionary command council in Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime -- effectively Hussein's No. 2 man. Hussein's regime fell during a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. The U.S. military had said that after the Iraqi leader's fall, al-Douri helped finance a Sunni insurgency with money he transferred to Syria before the government collapsed. A month before the invasion, al-Douri presided over a military parade in Mosul, an event covered by CNN, and his participation became one of the last times he was seen in public, covered by CNN. Al-Douri saluted troops from the reviewing stand as they marched by. Then, just days before the U.S. invasion, al-Douri addressed an emergency summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to discuss ultimately unsuccessful ways to avert the war. Al-Douri accused the United States of aggression and blamed Kuwait for his country's suffering, calling leaders of the neighboring Gulf state ""traitors"" for cooperating with the United States and Israel. That comment prompted the Kuwaiti representative to stand up and protest, to which al-Douri countered, ""Shut up, sit down you small agent [of the U.S.], you monkey!"" Kuwaiti television cut away from the heated exchange and rejoined the conference later. Al-Douri's efforts were all in vain. The United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, ousting Hussein, al-Douri and the entire regime. In subsequent years, several claims asserted that al-Douri was either killed or captured during the war and its aftermath. At the same time, a man claiming to be al-Douri released a number of audio messages over the years taunting Iraqi and U.S. officials. In 2012, a series of videos appeared online purporting to show al-Douri deriding the Shiite-led government that took over Iraq after Hussein's ouster. CNN couldn't independently verify the authenticity of those videos on YouTube or the identity of the man speaking, though he bore a striking resemblance to al-Douri. In the clips, the man who claimed to be al-Douri wore an olive military uniform and sat behind a desk with an Iraqi flag in the background. He derided Iraq's Shiite-dominated government, led by then-Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, as well as what he described as meddling by neighboring Iran. Al-Maliki's Dawa party, says al-Douri, ""has announced Iraq as the Shiite capital."" At that time, nine years had passed since the invasion and, al-Douri claimed that Iraq was still in peril. ""Everyone can hear the sounds of danger echoing daily and threatening the country,"" he said. The videos were posted on what was the 65th anniversary of the Arab Socialist Baath Party, a political party founded in Syria that later provided the political basis for Hussein's now outlawed Baath Party. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Baghdad. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta and Michael Martinez from Los Angeles. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed from Washington, D.C.","U.S. military doesn't have further information to evaluate the Iraqi media reports .

"(CNN)The Solar Impulse 2, the experimental plane attempting to fly around the world without using a drop of fuel, has been grounded by the weather in China. What was supposed to be an overnight pit stop in the southwestern city of Chongqing has now stretched into a two-and-a-half week stay. It's an unexpected layover that is testing the patience of the pilots and more than 60 team members, just a quarter of the way along a journey that will cover some 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles) over five months. ""You can believe that your will can influence the weather,"" says pilot Bertrand Piccard, who comes from a long family line of explorers.  But ""then you'll be really disappointed because it doesn't work. ""Or you just know that it's an adventure you do with the forces of nature."" Piccard, along with Andre Borschberg, a Swiss engineer, are taking turns flying the single-seater aircraft, which took off from Abu Dhabi on March 9 and has successfully flown through Oman, India, and Myanmar. There is much at stake. Their mission, which the pilots say is aimed at proving the power of renewable energy, and inspiring innovation, has been 12 years in the making. In many ways, it has become Piccard and Borschberg's raison d'etre. But so far, the Solar Impulse 2 has been spending a lot of time on the ground. The latest setback came when a Thursday takeoff was canceled, because the cross winds in Nanjing, the plane's destination, were forecast to be too strong around its expected landing time. Because of its weight, at just 2,300 kilograms -- about the same as a large SUV -- the aircraft needs near perfect weather conditions, including cross winds of less than 4 knots, or about 7 kilometers an hour, in order to fly. While the team is used to waiting, they are clearly eager to move on. ""Our boss is the sun,"" says Solar Impulse spokeswoman Claudia Durgnat. Durgnat says there may be a tiny window ahead, with the next possible departure from Chongqing on Tuesday. ""It's not good before, and the days after don't look very clear."" Even with the delay, Durgnat says, the plane technically isn't behind schedule. That's because the team needs to wait until the end of the month for the northern hemisphere days to get longer, before the plane can venture across the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. With more than 17,000 solar cells along the tops of its wings and fuselage, the Solar Impulse 2 stores up energy during the day, in order to power the motors that carry it through the night, typically at speeds no faster than a car on a highway. Inside a specially constructed tent at the end of the runway at Chongqing International Airport, a skeleton team of less than a dozen people works to complete the day's tasks. The rest of the crew has been waiting for weeks in Nanjing. Even with the extended stay, no time is wasted. Piccard spends a few hours of the afternoon in the cockpit, training to prepare for the Solar Impulse's crossings over the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, what the team calls ""the moment of truth."" The plane will then return to Abu Dhabi, where it had taken off. Nearby, two technicians repair a couple of the flight computers, which display critical information in the cockpit, punching extra holes in their casings so they don't overheat. Meanwhile, Borschberg has returned to Switzerland to rest and get medical treatment for a migraine and a skin condition. The team expects him back in China early next week. Borschberg is still scheduled to fly first leg of the Pacific crossing, which could last up to five days and nights. ""The airplane is ready. The mission control center is ready. We've been waiting for that moment since so long,"" says Piccard. Borschberg and Piccard, who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the U.S. in 2013, are no strangers to adventure. Borschberg is a former fighter pilot, and Piccard was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999.","Solar plane attempting to be first to circumnavigate world without using fuel is stuck in China .

"(CNN)It has all the key points you'd expect on a birth certificate -- baby's weight, length and date of birth confirmed with an official insignia. The difference here is the governing authority's stamp: The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. It's one of many official documents relating to matters such as vaccination schedules, fishing methods and rent disputes in the areas now controlled by ISIS. For ISIS sees itself as a government operating under a rule of law, even if the group is most often talked about for its barbaric punishment of anyone who resists or defies its medieval interpretation of that Islamic law. The ISIS documents, some shared with CNN by researcher Aymenn Al-Tamimi, give a window into the bureaucracy of the self-declared caliphate. Last summer, ISIS fighters swept through the Iraqi city of Mosul. Once they took power, leaders wanted to show they could bring stability allowing daily life to resume. So, they quickly reopened the University of Mosul, albeit under a radically altered curriculum. Notices went out that classes would resume on 24 Dhu al-Hijjah 1435 in the Islamic calendar (or October 18, 2014, in the Western calendar), about four months after ISIS overran the city. But some subjects would be banned -- democracy and political thought, also hotel management and tourism and archaeology. Families flee ISIS in Iraq . ""The banning of archaeology is not a surprise,"" says Al-Tamimi, who is a Shillman-Ginsburg Fellow at the Middle East Forum at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, in Israel. ""We see that reflected in ISIS destruction of ancient artifacts. ISIS regards pre-Islamic artifacts as relics from the 'period of ignorance', jahiliyah. Their main concern with archaeology is that it would become a subject turning to idol worship, which is strictly forbidden in Islam. ""Hotel management and tourism may seem strange as first. But there are no hotels under ISIS. They have all been taken over and shut down, either rented out or become places to house families."" Mosul University still has the same professors and teachers, Al-Tamimi says. ""But now teachers are subjected to Sharia sessions, to learn what is and what is not acceptable to ISIS. So, they have preserved the prior system but within ISIS Sharia law conditions."" The ISIS Health Department runs hospitals for anyone feeling ill, not just wounded fighters. It has maternity wards, health clinics, even a mobile vaccination unit. And while an ancient interpretation of religion remains at the heart of rules, there is more nuance than was seen in Afghanistan and areas still controlled by the Taliban. ""This is one thing that distinguishes ISIS from groups like the Taliban, which forbids vaccinations.  Polio is a problem in Pakistan because the Taliban believes the vaccines are a forbidden substance.  But ISIS is not that primitive,"" says Al-Tamimi. ""This is also reflected in education:  The Taliban, forbids all girls' education. But ISIS allows girls to go to school, albeit in a segregated environment."" However, education for girls is limited to the age of 15. Reporting from areas controlled by ISIS is near impossible but anecdotes of daily life and death do emerge. Al-Tamimi's conclusions on ISIS's governing principles and methods follow similar findings by the Quilliam Foundation, other researchers and social activists. How ISIS makes (and takes) money . It is an Islamic principle to care for the environment, so that's one reason that using explosives to catch fish is banned. And a quote from the Quran saying property owners should lessen the burden on renters to earn spiritual rewards is used at the start of a document outlining a policy on rent control. ""A general theme for ISIS is that they try, initially when they seize control, to portray themselves as more just, more fair to the inhabitants than the previous ruler,"" explains Al-Tamimi. ""For example, in Syria, the first thing ISIS did was lower the price of bread. This is as much about winning over the population as it is about religious rulings."" At times, such as taking up the case of renters, the regime can seem almost benevolent, Al-Tamimi says. ""If someone does complain, especially in Syria, ISIS does actually try to deal with it,"" he says. ""That's why they've been seen by many in Syria as imposing order, especially in areas where multiple parties, rebel factions and the Syrian government were previously in control."" ISIS control of its territory is absolute -- bus schedules show routes from Raqqa to Mosul and Qaim with no acknowledgment of the Syria-Iraq border, just the new provinces created by the group for its territory. Detained ISIS members speak from Iraqi jail . And inside that territory, even entertainment is regulated. Foosball can be played, provided there is no gambling and the faces or heads are taken off the figurines to prevent idol worship. A fatwa on entertainment goes on to say that chess, billiards and other ""contemporary games"" do not benefit Muslims but may be played if they do not distract from religious obligations.  It reaches that conclusion from the Quran and other religious teachings. That's also part of ISIS strategy, says Al-Tamimi. ""One of ISIS's goals is to present this very religiously learned image, showcasing their knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence to justify to their following that they are the moral authority.  It's clear that ISIS and their religious clerics and scholars are extremely familiar with religious texts and use them to convince and persuade ISIS followers, which also makes them impervious to any religion-based counterargument.""","ISIS is known for brutal takeovers and medieval justice, but it sees itself as a state .

"Beijing (CNN)A day after the Chinese government released five young feminists on bail, their families and supporters expressed mixed emotions on the unexpected development. Wei Tingting, Wang Man, Zheng Churan, Li Tingting and Wu Rongrong were freed from the Haidian Detention Center on the outskirts of Beijing late Monday. The five activists on women's rights -- aged from 25 to 32 -- were picked up by police in three different cities just before March 8, the International Women's Day. They had been planning a campaign against sexual harassment on public transportation. ""I'm still speechless and don't know how to react,"" tweeted Li's girlfriend Suan Xiaola to the couple's friends upon hearing the news. ""No tears, no ecstasy... just wondering what we're going to do next."" ""I can't hide my happiness for the women but being released on bail is not the end of their ordeal,"" echoed Li's lawyer Yan Xin on Chinese social media. ""Without closing their cases, they still can't live without shackles -- we'll have our work cut out for us."" Police had recommended last week that prosecutors press charges of ""assembling a crowd to disturb public order,"" which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The women are still considered suspects in an ongoing criminal investigation and may face charges in the future, Wu's lawyer Liang Xiaojun told CNN. They will be under surveillance for a year with their movements and activities restricted, and police can summon them for questioning at any time, Liang added. ""This shouldn't be a moment of celebration,"" he said. ""The arbitrary detention and release of these women really shows the backwardness of China's legal system."" Under China's household registration system, only Li is considered a Beijing resident. Police sent the other four back to their hometowns, disrupting their work and lives, according to the women's lawyers. Many have called the five members of Women's Rights Action Group trailblazers. Staging their protests through performance art or flash mobs, they highlighted feminist causes ranging from fighting domestic violence, gender equality at work, to more female public bathrooms -- drawing nationwide attention and even state media praise. Their detention had drawn widespread condemnation, including from the United States. ""Each and every one of us has the right to speak out against sexual harassment and the many other injustices that millions of women and girls suffer around the world,"" said John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, in a statement Friday. ""We strongly support the efforts of these activists to make progress on these challenging issues, and we believe that Chinese authorities should also support them, not silence them."" Kerry's predecessor Hillary Clinton -- a longtime champion of women's rights who just announced her bid for the U.S. presidency -- called the jailing of the feminists ""inexcusable"" on Twitter, joining the ""free the five"" hashtag campaign. China had rejected all international criticisms, insisting it's a country ruled by law and that its judicial sovereignty be respected. Supporters of the woman activists, however, sense the chilling effect of their ordeal on China's nascent civil society, as the ruling Communist Party under President Xi Jinping continues to tighten its grip over the country. ""Of course people will feel more afraid,"" said Wei's lawyer Wang Qiushi. ""Women's rights is among the most politically correct issues in China -- now even those who took up that cause ended up in jail.""","Wei Tingting, Wang Man, Zheng Churan, Li Tingting and Wu Rongrong freed .

"(CNN)A Columbia University student who was accused of rape is suing the New York City school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a ""serial rapist"" According to the lawsuit, Paul Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in Emma Sulkowicz's 2013 rape claim, as well as others that came to light after Sulkowicz went public with her allegations in various media interviews. Her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school's handling of the complaint, saying she hoped to show how ""flawed"" the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases. CNN does not usually name individuals in sexual assault cases, but in this instance, both parties have spoken publicly about their experience. They have also both said in separate interviews with The New York Times that Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in a disciplinary hearing. Nungesser, an international student from Germany, filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school; its president, Lee Bollinger; and the visual arts professor who oversaw Sulkowicz's mattress project, ""Carry That Weight,"" as part of her senior thesis. The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Nungesser's right to an education free of gender-based discrimination by allowing Sulkowicz to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing. During an April 2014 news conference at Columbia University, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stood alongside Sulkowicz as she called Nungesser a ""serial rapist"" and said she fears for her safety while he's still on campus. The harassment continued, the lawsuit claims, when Columbia visual arts professor Jon Kessler let Sulkowicz ""transform her personal vendetta"" into a ""Columbia-sponsored calumny"" by supporting ""Carry That Weight"" for her senior thesis, allowing her to earn school credit through ""this outrageous display of harassment and defamation."" Bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 New York Magazine profile of Sulkowicz, now a senior at Columbia. ""This is a person who is one of my students, and I care about all of my students. And when one of them feels that she has been a victim of mistreatment, I am affected by that. This is all very painful."" The defendants ""had the power, as well as the legal and contractual obligation"" to protect Nungesser, who is also a senior, the lawsuit claims. ""By refusing to protect Paul Nungesser, Columbia University first became a silent bystander and then turned into an active supporter of a fellow student's harassment campaign by institutionalizing it and heralding it."" Columbia University declined to comment on the lawsuit. The school also declined to confirm the outcome of Nungesser's disciplinary proceedings. ""As we have said consistently, we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law, but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff, the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them,"" spokesman Robert Hornsby said in statement. Kessler also declined to comment on the lawsuit. The case has produced dueling narratives from both sides in national media outlets. The most recent came from Nungesser in a Daily Beast article titled, ""Columbia Student: I Didn't Rape Her,"" in which he shared a long exchange of Facebook messages to support his claim that their sex was consensual. Some of those exchanges were included in the lawsuit, but Sulkowicz told CNN they were taken out of context in the suit. She also balked at the idea that Nungesser would sue the school or her professor ""for allowing me to make an art piece."" ""It's ridiculous that he would read it as a 'bullying strategy,' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation, when really it's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma I've experienced at Columbia,"" Sulkowicz wrote in an email. ""If artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences, then how are we to heal?"" The project essentially consists of Sulkowicz carrying a twin-size mattress wherever she goes on campus, but not off campus. She's allowed to accept help carrying the object but does not allow herself to ask for help.​ . Nungesser's complaint seeks damages to be determined at trial for harm to his reputation, loss of educational opportunities and future career prospects. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia and Camille Cava contributed to this report.","Paul Nungesser says he was target of gender-based harassment campaign .

"Panama City (CNN)This was the handshake that shook the Western Hemisphere. President Obama briefly met his Cuban counterpart, Raul Castro, on Friday night at a dinner for the dozens of Latin American leaders convening in Panama City for the Summit of the Americas. This was historic. The two nations have barely been on speaking terms -- officially -- for more than 50 years. The meeting was so important that Bernadette Meehan, National Security Council spokesperson, issued a statement: ""At the Summit of the Americas this evening, President Obama and President Castro greeted each other and shook hands."" Cuba and the United States had endured a half-century of enmity, the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart. Key events of those years include some of the most traumatic in modern U.S. history, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs and the Mariel boatlift of 1980. But the two leaders have been building up to the historic face-to-face. Obama spoke by phone Wednesday with the Cuban leader before heading to Panama. They met Friday at the dinner and are expected to spend a lot more time together on Saturday when the summit begins in earnest. Obama arrived in Panama late Thursday for the conference, which in years past was tinged with animosity at Cuba's exclusion. Moments after Marine One, Obama's helicopter, touched down in Panama City, Castro's plane landed on the same tarmac. Panamanian television carried both arrivals live. During their phone call Wednesday, Obama and Castro discussed the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba, according to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. He said it ""made sense"" for the two leaders to communicate before their anticipated interactions Friday and Saturday. Those run-ins will represent the highest-level talks between the United States and Cuba since a meeting between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and then-Prime Minister Fidel Castro in 1959. ""We're in new territory here,"" Rhodes said on Friday. ""The reason we're here is that the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused totally on isolation, focused totally on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed."" Obama was expecting a warm welcome from the dozens of countries represented at the conference, after announcing in December he was seeking to engage Havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel. In Panama, Obama is expected to announce he's removing Cuba from the United States' list of countries that sponsor terrorism, a major advance in building diplomatic ties between the two countries. The State Department delivered its report on the designation to the White House on Wednesday; Obama said on Thursday a panel of experts was reviewing it before he makes a final determination. The White House isn't ruling out a final decision before Obama leaves Panama late Saturday night. In remarks during a brief stopover in Jamaica on Thursday, Obama strongly hinted he was ready to remove Cuba from the list, which also includes Iran, Sudan and Syria. ""Throughout this process, our emphasis has been on the facts,"" Obama said. ""So we want to make sure that given that this is a powerful tool to isolate those countries that genuinely do support terrorism, that when we make those designations we've got strong evidence that, in fact, that's the case."" ""As circumstances change, then that list will change as well,"" he said. While some inside Cuba have expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of the diplomatic thaw, U.S. officials say they're pleased at the progress toward re-establishing diplomatic ties, which the White House argues has helped improve relations with other countries in the region. Obama said in Jamaica he ""never foresaw that immediately overnight everything would transform itself."" The overtures to Cuba have not been universally popular in the United States; some lawmakers were irate that Obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government. Even as Obama landed in Panama the long-standing tensions between pro- and anti-Castro activists was on full display. Dissidents opposed to Castro's regime were violently accosted earlier this week by supporters of the Cuban government. Rhodes said the White House had ""expressed serious concerns"" about the violence and would continue to speak in support of human rights reforms on the island.","U.S. President Obama, Cuban President Raul Castro meet in Panama City .

"(CNN)The lawyer for a Baltimore community activist whose arrest was broadcast live on CNN said Thursday morning that his client had been released from jail. As viewers watched, Joseph Kent held his hands up and walked in front of a phalanx of police Tuesday night after a citywide curfew had started. Seconds later, several officers in riot gear rushed out of their line and arrested him, just as a Humvee passed between the camera and the police, making social media churn with questions about what happened to Kent. Attorney Stephen Patrick Beatty confirmed he is representing Kent. He was still trying to get in touch with his client after Kent was released. ""He wanted me to tell people most that he doesn't want violence in his name,"" Beatty told CNN's Don Lemon on Wednesday night. The incident unfolded live on CNN about 40 minutes after the 10 p.m. curfew went into effect and as authorities tried to prevent the kind of rioting -- part of protests over the death of Freddie Gray -- that plagued the city Monday. Kent was being held on a charge of curfew violation, according to the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. People on Twitter continued to circulate the name of Kent, a young activist, making #JosephKent and #WhereIsJosephKent hot topics. Investigators made 10 arrests in Baltimore on Tuesday night, city Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said. Seven were for curfew violations, he said. Beatty said he met with Kent on Wednesday afternoon. ""He said he's physically OK, not injured. He's safe in there,"" Beatty said. But even though more than 100 people who had been held at the city's booking center were released earlier in the day, Kent was not one of them. Beatty initially checked on Kent's status, despite not officially representing him. He said Kent was just trying to help with getting people to go home when he was arrested. ""He went out there to try to settle things down because he had seen what happened in this city previously,"" Beatty said. ""And the last thing he wanted was any more violence, and he was trying to stop it."" Kent once was employed as an intern, through an outside company, at Morgan State University's Entrepreneurial Development and Assistance Center, the school said Wednesday. But Kent is not a student there and, as far as the school can tell, never has been, MSU spokesman Clint Coleman said. A woman who answered the phone at the EDAC said that no one there was available to talk about Kent and that she'd have no further comment. In November, the Baltimore City Paper ran a story about Kent, then 21, and his participation in Baltimore protests over a grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the August shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. He helped lead protesters who walked through Morgan State's campus and eventually to City Hall on November 25, the newspaper reported. ""Everyone knows me at Morgan already, organizing and making sure everything (is) running the correct way and peaceful and everything like that,"" he said, according to the City Paper's article. ""So, everybody already knows I'm going to do things the right way, so when everybody else and community people and civilians and people who joined and saw that the Morgan students were looking up to it, before you knew it, the whole city was on my back and I was just carrying the whole city.""

"(CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: ""Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival."" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to ""reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred."" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","SpaceX founder Elon Musk: ""Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival""

"Washington (CNN)Supreme Court justices appeared divided Tuesday during historic arguments over the constitutionality of gay marriage, with Justice Anthony Kennedy returning to a familiar role as the court's pivotal vote. Chief Justice John Roberts -- who shocked conservatives with his swing vote to uphold Obamacare -- this time seemed to lean more closely to conservative justices. The arguments unfurled inside a packed courtroom on Tuesday while supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage rallied outside -- with one protester even interrupting the arguments from within. RELATED: How a Cincinnati judge could shape the gay marriage case . Many questions on Tuesday centered around the definition of marriage and whether the decision to authorize or ban gay marriage should be left to voters in individual states or decided by the judicial system. All eyes were on Justice Anthony Kennedy, considered a key vote for challengers to the state bans, who has penned three decisions in favor of gay rights over the years. At the start of arguments he joined other conservatives concerned with the fact that  marriage has been defined between a man and a woman for a long time. ""This definition has been with us for millennia,"" he said. ""And it's very difficult for the court to say: 'Oh, well, we know better.' "" But later Kennedy pressed John Bursch, a lawyer defending the bans: ""Same sex couples say: 'Of course, we understand the nobility and the sacredness of the marriage. We know we can't procreate, but we want the other attributes of it in order to show that we, too, have a dignity that can be fulfilled.' "" Kennedy also said that Bursch's assertion ""that only opposite-sex couples can have a bonding with the child"" was ""just a wrong premise."" When Bursch said the rate of out-of-wedlock birth has gone up in the country, Kennedy noted that if Bursch were to prevail, it might be difficult for same-sex couples to ""adopt some of these children."" ""I think,"" Kennedy said, ""the argument cuts quite against you."" He also brought up the fact that marriage ""bestows dignity."" ""These parties say they want to have that same ennoblement,"" he said. Chief Justice John Roberts was also concerned with the traditional definition of marriage. He said this to Mary L. Bonauto, an attorney representing the challengers: ""You're not seeking to join the institution, you're seeking to change what the institution is."" He expressed concern about closing off the debate currently going on in the states. ""I mean, closing of debate can close minds, and it will have a consequence on how this new institution is accepted."" ""People feel very differently about something if they have a chance to vote on it, than if it's imposed on them by the courts,"" he said. Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Samuel Alito were sharply critical in their questioning of Bonauto. Scalia said that the issue is not whether there should be same-sex marriage, ""but who should decide the point."" Alito brought up how long marriage has been considered between a man and a woman and cast doubt that such a definition was meant to demean same-sex couples. Justice Sonia Sotomayor and other liberals seemed supportive of the challengers. When Bursch said that the issue should not be decided by the courts,  Sotomayor pushed back. ""I suspect even with us giving gays rights to marry that there's some gay people who will choose not to. ... Just as there are some heterosexual couples who choose not to marry. So we're not taking anybody's liberty away."" Steve Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at American University and CNN analyst, said Tuesday's session revealed few surprises to close observers of the court who expected Kennedy and Roberts would be the swing votes on this case. RELATED: John Roberts' big moment: Will he anger conservatives again? ""We heard both of them in the arguments today showing support for both sides of the argument, showing skepticism for both sides of the argument,"" Vladeck said. ""I think the headline here is it's about what we expected. It's going to be close, it's going to be divisive and it's going to come down to Kennedy and Roberts."" Vladeck also cautioned against reading too much into the justices' questioning and comments during the oral arguments, which account for just a few hours in the multi-month process of deciding such an consequential case. The emotion of the case also flooded into the courtroom, as one protester seated inside began shouted and screaming in the middle of the arguments. ""If you support gay marriage you will burn in hell,"" the protester shouted before police quickly detained the man and dragged him out of the courtroom while he continued to scream. RELATED: Meet the lawyers who will argue the gay marriage case . ""Rather refreshing actually,"" conservative Justice Antonin Scalia quipped as the man was dragged out to laughter in the courtroom. Lawyers with the pro-gay marriage organization Lambda Legal, which represented two of the cases wrapped into the Supreme Court case ""an awe-inspiring and singular moment in the march towards justice."" ""It was incredibly moving to gather in the Supreme Court chamber with their parents and all 30 plaintiffs in these historic cases.   Mary and Doug were fantastic, making a compelling and to my mind irrefutable case on their behalf,"" Lambda Legal's Alphonse Gerhardstein said of the lawyers who argued in favor of same-sex marriage before the court on Tuesday. U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who represented the Obama administration's views, also presented arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, focusing on equal protection under the 14th amendment and likening bans on same-sex marriage to handing second-class status to gay Americans. ""I don't know why we would repeat history,"" he said.","Questions Tuesday centered on whether defining marriage should be left to voters in individual states or decided by  judicial system .

"(CNN)The arrest and death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore has sparked protests and accusations of police brutality. But it's unclear how Gray, who was arrested on a weapons charge April 12, suffered a severe spinal cord injury that led to his death seven days later. Here are the big questions surrounding this controversial case: . What we know: Gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a high-crime area of Baltimore known for drugs. He ""gave up without the use of force,""  Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said last week. An officer apparently took his Taser out and was prepared to use it on Gray, but he never deployed it, Rodriguez said. And none of the six officers involved in the arrest described using force against the 25-year-old. Gray was placed inside a police van and was able to talk, said Rodriguez, who described Gray as upset. ""And when Mr. Gray was taken out of that van, he could not talk, and he could not breathe,"" according to Rodriguez. Police have said Gray was not buckled in with a seat belt during the ride to a booking center. What we don't know: It's unknown what caused the spinal cord injury that led to his death a week after the arrest, and it's also unknown what, if anything, happened inside the van. What we know: Segments of cell phone video shot from two different positions appear to begin after Gray has been arrested and show officers dragging Gray, who is handcuffed, to a van. He can be heard screaming. ""He was dragged a bit,"" said Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, ""but then you see him using his legs to get into the van, so he was able-bodied when he was in the van. And we know that when he was finally taken out of the van, he was unresponsive."" One woman who recorded a video of the arrest said she knew Gray. ""When I ran up the street and seen him, the first thing I asked him was he OK because I heard him screaming,"" the woman said. ""He didn't never say yes or no, he just said 'I can't breathe' and just was yelling."" Surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking, police said. That was at 8:54 a.m. At 9:24 a.m., police called an ambulance for Gray. Police say Gray requested medical attention, including an inhaler, and an ambulance later took him to the University of Maryland Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center. Rawlings-Blake and  Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis have said the arresting officers should have asked for medical attention immediately after Gray asked for it. What we don't know: It's unknown why Gray screamed, and the cell phone video doesn't capture the entire incident, start to end. And it's unclear why police didn't call for an ambulance sooner. What we know: In the wake of Gray's death, six police officers were suspended. Their names were released last week. The suspensions are standard procedure after an ""in-custody death,"" said Baltimore Police Department spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk. It doesn't mean the officers did anything wrong or that they were the only officers involved, he said. They are: Lt. Brian Rice, 41, who joined the department in 1997; Officer Caesar Goodson, 45, who joined in 1999; Sgt. Alicia White, 30, who joined in 2010; Officer William Porter, 25, who joined in 2012; Officer Garrett Miller, 26, who joined in 2012; and Officer Edward Nero, 29, who joined in 2012. Three of the six responding officers were on bicycles when they initially approached Gray, according to Kowalczyk. Another officer joined the arrest after it was initiated, while one more drove the police van, the police spokesman said. What we don't know: The officers say they didn't use force against Gray, but that's not certain. In fact, details about what each of the officers specifically did have not been released. What we know: According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death. The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property. Gray was due in court on a possession charge on April 24. He had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, according to Maryland Department of Corrections spokesman Gerard Shields. In February 2009, he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver. Shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved. Gray was paroled on June 30, 2011. On April 4, 2012, Gray was arrested for violating parole but he didn't go back to prison, Shields said, reasoning that  whatever Gray allegedly did, it ""was something minor."" Gray did return to prison in May 2013 for drug possession, serving a month behind bars before his release in June. What we don't know: It's not known whether Gray's criminal past had anything to do with his arrest, or his death. What we know: Protesters have taken to the streets of Baltimore daily since two days after Gray's death, rallying around his family.  On the first night, they marched to a local police station chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" On another occasion they marched to City Hall. The demonstrations have been peaceful on most nights, but on Monday rioters damaged buildings and destroyed police vehicles. Looters stole goods from several stores. Some groups of people intervened, keeping additional looters out of trashed businesses. The demonstrators are pushing to get answers about Gray's death and for ""justice,"" as they define it. Similar protests were held in Ferguson, Missouri, following Michael Brown's death and in New York, after the death of Eric Garner. Other small protests have sprung up in other cities in the past week. ""Mr. Gray's family deserves justice,"" Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Anderson Cooper last week. ""And our community deserves an opportunity to heal, to get better, and to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again. The mayor said that any confirmed information will be promptly relayed to the public. ""I want people to understand that I have no interest in hiding information, holding back information,"" Rawlings-Blake said. Some protesters have called for the officers to be arrested and charged. One organizer called for Police Commissioner Anthony Batts to resign. What we don't know: There's no guarantee protesters will get the kind of definitive answers they want about how and why Gray died. What we know: Baltimore police are looking into Gray's death and are expected to have a report for prosecutors by Friday. The probe, like the suspensions of the six police officers, is standard whenever someone dies while in custody. The police's findings will go to the state's attorney's office, where prosecutors will decide whether charges should be filed. Batts said recently that a medical examiner had some initial findings, but needed to get back the results of toxicology reports, which could take weeks. Rawlings-Blake asked for an outside investigation, given the city's dark history of police misconduct. The U.S. Justice Department, which announced a collaborative reform initiative with Baltimore police in October in light of its past problems, is looking into the Gray case, a spokesman said last week. The point of that federal investigation will be to gauge whether a prosecutable civil rights violation may have occurred. What we don't know: What information that investigators, both local and federal, will turn up and when. It is also unclear if the medical examiner called in spinal experts to view the evidence, a possibility Batts raised at a news conference. What we know: Court documents allege that Baltimore Police Department Officer Garrett Miller arrested Gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket. The Gray family attorney called the allegation a ""sideshow."" Gray was carrying a ""pocket knife of legal size,"" attorney William Murphy told CNN. Police never saw the knife and chased Gray only after he ran from them, the attorney said. The court documents also say that Gray ""fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence."" ""The officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket. The defendant was arrested without force or incident,"" the documents say. ""The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring-assisted, one-hand-operated knife."" Maryland law makes it illegal to ""wear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind"" -- including switchblades -- ""concealed on or about the person."" What we don't know: It's not clear that simply having a knife is a crime, said Rawlings-Blake. ""It is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone. So, we still have questions,"" she said.

McLaughlin, Dana Ford and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Freddie Gray was arrested on a weapons charge April 12; he was dead seven days later .

"(CNN)The United Nations is appealing for $174 million to help Nigerian refugees who've fled to neighboring nations following militant attacks. Boko Haram has killed thousands in the nation's northeast by attacking villages, schools, churches and mosques. It has also kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls abducted in April last year. A majority of them remain missing. The militants have attacked relentlessly for six years, sending 192,000 people seeking shelter in Cameroon, Niger and Chad. ""Displaced people in northeastern Nigeria and across borders are in a very dramatic situation, they fear for their lives and are at this point unable to return to their homes,"" said Liz Ahua, who's coordinating Nigerian refugee efforts for the U.N. Aid agencies are scrambling to provide the refugees with clean water, shelter, food and access to education. ""In the refugee camps, thousands of school-age refugee children cannot attend school because of lack of classrooms and teachers,"" Ahua said. Mental health needs are crucial to help the survivors of physical attacks and those who've witnessed violence, according to the U.N.  Some children are separated from their parents amid the trauma. ""The conflict has had a devastating impact on children, including many who were forcibly recruited by the insurgents in Nigeria,"" Ahua said. The appeal encompasses the needs of 23 agencies and nongovernmental organizations helping the refugees. ""Adequate funding is crucial to make sure aid agencies can improve the living conditions for refugees in asylum countries and respond to their protection needs,"" Ahua said. ""We relocate refugees away from the conflict border areas, and establish additional refugee camps where needed."" The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. An additional 1.2 million people are displaced within Nigeria as a result of the insurgency.

"(CNN)This week brought a dramatic turn of events in a small community outside of Detroit: A man bloodied during a traffic stop was cleared of all charges, the police officer who arrested the motorist is charged with beating him and the community's police chief has stepped down. On Monday, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced charges of assault and mistreatment of a prisoner against William Melendez. He's the 49-year-old former Inkster, Michigan, police officer who is seen in police car dashcam video grabbing the unarmed motorist, Floyd Dent, around the neck while he lay on the ground and punching him several times in the head. ""The alleged police brutality in this case cannot and will not be tolerated,"" Worthy said. On Wednesday, drug charges against Dent, 57, were formally dropped in Michigan Circuit Court, clearing the motorist of all wrongdoing. ""He busted out crying and was very emotional,"" said Angela Martin, the assistant to Dent's attorney. In the wake of the reversal of fates, Police Chief Vicki Yost announced Wednesday her resignation, according to Inkster City Manager Richard Marsh. Marsh would not cite a specific reason for Yost's investigation, though she had been the face of the Police Department during the investigation into her former officer. In a statement, Dent and his attorney Greg Rohl told CNN: ""We are all ecstatic, especially Mr. Dent. This is another step in the right direction. The system is still working, and we are very hopeful the prosecutor's net will catch even more fish in the near future."" Yost did not respond to a request for comment. Dent, a veteran Ford automotive worker, was arrested after the January traffic stop on charges of drug possession, assaulting an officer and resisting arrest. With the court decision Wednesday, all charges from the arrest have been dropped. Melendez pleaded not guilty to the new charges brought against him in an arraignment Tuesday at Inkster District Court, according to his lawyer, David Lee. ""We intend to vigorously contest the charges,"" Lee said. ""I can understand how people might be disturbed by looking at [the video]; however; I hope everyone will withhold judgment until all the facts come out where they should in a court of law."" Worthy's announcement came after the conclusion of two investigations into the incident by Michigan State Police and the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office. In the police report written after the January arrest, Melendez wrote that he hit Dent only after Dent had threatened him and bit him in the arm. Melendez wrote that as he approached the car, Dent kept his hands from view, looked at him ""with a blank stare as if on a form of narcotic,"" and said, ""I'll kill you."" Dent told CNN at the time that he had never threatened nor bit the police officer. ""I didn't bite anyone. I didn't have time to bite anyone. He was too busy pounding me in my head,"" Dent said. Rohl also alleged that the cocaine found at the scene had been planted by Melendez. ""My client's fingerprints will not be on that bag,"" Rohl told WDIV.","Inkster, Michigan, Police Chief Vicki Yost resigns in the wake of charges against one of her former officers .

"Atlanta  (CNN)Silently moving deep beneath the ocean's surface, combat submarines can employ the element of surprise to carry out devastating attacks on naval fleets and land targets. For decades, the U.S. military has maintained its dominance in the depths of the world's oceans by boasting the most technologically advanced submarine fleet. However, officials say China and other nations are rapidly expanding the size and scope of their own submarine forces. And, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, the U.S. must rethink the role of manned submarines and prioritize new underwater detection techniques. ""We know they are out experimenting and looking at operating, and clearly want to be in this world of advanced submarines,"" Vice Adm. Joseph Mulloy told the House Armed Services Committee's sea power subcommittee in February. Mulloy, who is deputy chief of naval operations for capabilities and resources, says Chinese submarines are still technologically inferior to those used by the United States, but that margin of difference is shrinking. Concern that China could match U.S. underwater capabilities in the near future has encouraged the development of an unmanned drone ship to independently track enemy ultra-quiet diesel electric submarines over thousands of miles to limit their tactical capacity for surprise. Initiated by a Pentagon research group called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Vessel (ACTUV) would be able to operate under with little supervisory control but also as remotely controlled or piloted vessels, depending on the circumstances of specific missions. ""We're looking for test-ready, multi-sensor approaches that push the boundaries of today's automated sensing systems for unmanned surface vessels,"" said Scott Littlefield, DARPA program manager. ""Enhancing the ability of these kinds of vessels to sense their environment in all weather and traffic conditions, day or night, would significantly advance our ability to conduct a range of military missions."" DARPA says the so-called drone ships will be 132 feet long and likely cost about $20 million, significantly less than the billion-dollar manned warships currently in use. The development of the ACTUV aligns with the ""culture change"" described by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus Tuesday at the Navy League's Sea Air Space symposium at National Harbor, Maryland. ""Unmanned systems, particularly autonomous ones, have to be the new normal in ever-increasing areas,"" Maybus said. Maybus said new staff will be put into place to help streamline, coordinate and champion unmanned systems in ""all domains."" An ACTUV prototype vessel is already in production and, if testing is successful, the Navy could move to the next phase of development by 2018.","U.S. Navy is developing an unmanned drone ship to track enemy submarines to limit their tactical capacity for surprise .

"(CNN)Nobel literature laureate Guenter Grass, best known around the world for his novel ""The Tin Drum,"" has died, his publisher said Monday. He was 87. Grass died in a clinic in the city of Luebeck, where he was taken over the weekend, said Steidl publishing spokeswoman Claudia Glenewinkel. German media are reporting he died of pneumonia. Grass focused in much of his work on learning from the horror of war and genocide by exploring motifs from his childhood city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk, Poland. During the Nazi era, ethnic Poles and Jews were persecuted and deported from the multicultural city, at a time when they faced the possibility of mass murder. ""In his excavation of the past, Günter Grass goes deeper than most and he unearths the intertwined roots of good and evil,"" the Nobel committee wrote, when it awarded him the literature prize in 1999. But Grass, an outspoken public figure, has sparked controversy in the last decade. In 2006, he confessed that at the age of 15, in 1943, he volunteered for military service in Germany's war of aggression and ended up in the notoriously bloody Waffen SS. Grass said he had no excuses for his choices back then, and that, as a teen, he may even have been excited about belonging to the unit, which he saw then as an elite group. A year later, he penned a detailed account in The New Yorker on how he spent his war years up to the death of German dictator Adolf Hitler. Three years ago, Grass drew controversy again, when he published a poem in a German newspaper discouraging Germany from selling more submarines to Israel. In ""What must be said,"" Grass accused Germany of selling weapons to a potential aggressor out of guilt over the Holocaust. Grass said Israel could use nuclear weapons to kill masses of Iranians. German commentators pilloried him as subconsciously anti-Semitic. Israel invoked a visa ban, and then-Interior Minister Eli Yishai declared Grass a ""persona non grata"" in Israel, the Jerusalem Post reported. Grass' novel characters are the forgotten, the downtrodden and the weird, the Nobel committee said. And like Oskar Matzerath, the boy in ""The Tin Drum,"" they often slip into surreal situations. This was a literary innovation, the committee said, which was furthered by other great authors, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nadine Gordimer and Salman Rushdie. On Monday, Rushdie tweeted about Grass' death:  ""This is very sad. A true giant, inspiration, and friend."" ""The Tin Drum,"" which was published in 1959, ""breaks the bounds of realism by having as its protagonist and narrator an infernal intelligence in the body of a three-year-old, a monster who overpowers the fellow human beings he approaches with the help of a toy drum,"" the Nobel committee wrote. The committee praised Grass' mastery of the German language and his ability to artfully exploit its possibilities of creating seemingly endless yet graceful sentences. Grass was an icon in contemporary German culture with an unchanging iconic look -- his broad mustache, his eyes gazing over the top of his glasses, a tobacco pipe a constant companion in hand. In his later years, he became known for his continuing critique of human history in the 20th century -- and of current events. As recently as March, Grass criticized the anti-Islam movement PEGIDA, Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West. He used the opportunity fire a jab at government that he said was corrupted by money interests. ""It's not Islam that threatens the Federal Republic (of Germany),"" he said in an interview with rp-online.de, ""but political lobbying. Democracy has decayed into fake democracy."" Grass has also suggested that Germans should be forced to invite refugees from crisis regions to live in their homes as a way of offering more shelter to the world's destitute.","Grass tried in his literature to come to grips with World War II and the Nazi era .
His characters were the downtrodden, and his style slipped into the surreal .
He stoked controversy with his admission to being a member of the Waffen SS ."
"(CNN)Feidin Santana, the man who recorded a South Carolina police officer fatally shooting a fleeing, unarmed man, told CNN on Thursday night he was told by another cop to stop using his phone to capture the incident. ""One of the officers told me to stop, but it was because I (said) to them that what they did it was an abuse and I witnessed everything,"" he told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360˚."" Santana told Cooper an officer told him to wait where he was but eventually he left the scene to go to work. In other interviews, Santana has said he feared for his life, which almost kept him from revealing the recording. Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday. That evidence led to the officer's firing and arrest on a murder charge. Santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. He could hear the sound of a Taser in use. At no time did Santana see Scott go after the Taser. He believes Scott was trying to get away. ""Mr. Scott never tried to fight,"" Santana told CNN. Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser. After Slager shot Scott five times, the officer went back to pick up something. Santana thinks it was the Taser but said he wasn't 100% sure what it was. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana had yet to begin recording. What we know about Officer Slager . The cell phone video, which Santana revealed this week, reignited national outcries surrounding police treatment of African-Americans and led to a murder charge against Slager, who is white. Scott was black. Police said Slager pulled the 50-year-old Scott over for a nonworking brake light on Saturday morning. Scott, according to a dash cam video, fled from Slager for unexplained reasons, and the officer chased him on foot. When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager. The video shows Slager shooting at Scott eight times before Scott falls down. Who was Walter Scott? Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told Cooper this week that she would want to thank Santana for coming forward. ""He was there. God planned that. He's the ram in the bush -- I truly believe that,"" Judy Scott said. Santana agreed. ""I think she was right,"" he said. ""God put me there for a reason."" Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording. ""When I saw my son running and I saw the policeman behind him, I couldn't take it,"" she said. ""I had to turn away. I couldn't handle it. In an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Santana suggested that he was giving media interviews in part to protect himself against retribution. ""At some point I thought about staying anonymous, and don't show my face, don't talk about it. But ... if I wouldn't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am,"" Santana said. Santana did not say whether he had received threats. His attorney, Todd Rutherford, said Santana's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether Scott received prompt medical attention. In the last half of the video, a second officer appears to examine Scott with gloved hands. Witness video, official accounts raise questions . Santana said after he stopped recording, he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform CPR. A police report says a third officer -- not shown in the video -- reported seeing an officer administering first aid, and that the third officer approached and helped that person ""with first aid and CPR."" On Wednesday, asked whether CPR was performed on Scott, North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers said: ""In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.""

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Rescue crews and residents in Nepal early Sunday began the desperate search for survivors after a magnitude-7.8 quake near the capital of Kathmandu a day earlier flattened homes, buildings and temples, causing widespread damage across the region and killing more than 1,800 people. Follow the latest coverage of Nepal earthquake . Whole streets and squares in the capital of more than 1 million people were covered in rubble. Stunned residents stared at temples that were once part of their daily lives and now were reduced to nothing. Locals and tourists ferreted through mounds of debris in search of survivors. Cheers rose from the piles when people were found alive -- but mostly bodies turned up. The injured ended up being treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic nine-story Dharahara tower that came crashing down during the quake. At least 17 people were reported killed on Mount Everest, where the quake caused multiple avalanches. A seemingly endless series of aftershocks continued to roil the area, further traumatizing survivors. Residents huddled in the cold rain overnight for safety. The death toll of 1,832 is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. The loss of life reported so far ""is really based on the information we have from the main cities,"" Lex Kassenberg, Nepal country director for CARE International, told CNN.  ""But if you look at the spread of the earthquake a lot of the rural areas have been hit as well. The information we received from the field is that 80% of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed."" The quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years. Residents are used to earthquakes in Nepal, and many thought the start of Saturday's quake was a tremor, until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down. ""The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,"" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement. ""It is clear that very many lives have been lost."" An estimated 4.6 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the Nepal earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said via Twitter. Thirty out of 75 Nepal districts were affected by the quake. In neighboring Tibet, roads buckled, buildings collapsed and at least 13 people were killed, China's state media reported, citing local authorities. Separately, at least four Chinese citizens in Nepal -- two workers with a Chinese company, a tourist and a mountaineer -- have been killed, state media reported, citing the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu. Officials in India confirmed at least 34 deaths in three states from the Nepal quake. The quake struck at 11:56 a.m. local time (2:11 a.m. ET)  and was centered less than 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu. It occurred at a depth of 9.3 miles, which is considered shallow and more damaging than a deeper quake. It was reported by people in the area as having lasted a long time. One person said he felt as if he were on a ship in rough seas. Kathmandu sits in a valley surrounded by the Himalayas. Siobhan Heanue, a reporter with ABC News Australia, told CNN she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake. Several temples collapsed around her, she said. ""It's not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life,"" Heanue said, adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe. ""It was utterly terrifying."" Heanue watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple. They found 12 bodies. ""Unfortunately, that search was not fruitful,"" Heanue said. ""There were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square. This was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake."" The Dharahara tower, the landmark nine-story structure, was packed with people when it collapsed.  Heanue said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of Dharahara. The tower, built in 1832, provided visitors with a panoramic view of the Kathmandu Valley. Are you in Nepal or have loved ones affected? Please share with us if you are in a safe place. Kanak Masni, a journalist in Kathmandu, told CNN by telephone that this appeared to be ""the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934."" In that quake, which was 8.1 magnitude and centered near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were killed. Thomas Nybo, a freelance photographer, was sitting in a coffee shop in Kathmandu's Thamel district. It appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity, he told CNN. Thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub. ""This region is no stranger to earthquakes,"" he said. ""A lot of people had the same feeling: This is a tremor, it passed. When that wasn't the case, they were in uncharted territory... It's basically an unwritten book."" Outside the coffee shop, Nybo said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a six-story building. One woman said children were trapped beneath rubble. ""We ran over and ran around the rubble and couldn't hear anything,"" he said. ""There was no chance that they survived."" Nearby, another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water, Nybo said. A voice was heard coming from the rubble. ""A group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks, hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy... It took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive."" Two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued, Nybo said. Not far away, lay the bodies of three or four women. ""Who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble?"" he said. The streets of Kathmandu were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who didn't want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks. Rob Stiles and his wife had just checked into a hotel in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. ""It felt like it went on forever,"" the California resident said. Witnesses: ""People are panicked, running down to street"" Outside, people ran onto the street, with the temblor knocking some off their feet. A huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car. Later, as they walked around the city, an aftershock hit. ""People were screaming and looking around,"" he said. ""There were people clearly shaken, upset, crying."" Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, told CNN that weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage. ""Building codes in Kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years,"" he said. ""Efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but, unfortunately, this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the Kathmandu Valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes."" Chitra Thapa, 48, a CNN security guard in Atlanta, said he spoke by telephone with relatives in Kathmandu and Pokhara, a city about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital. They were fine and were staying on streets. ""Everybody's in shock,"" he said. ""They never felt an earthquake that big."" Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water and shelter. The international community must react quickly to save lives -- particularly those of children -- said Devendra Tak, of the aid agency Save the Children. ""With every minute the situation becomes worse,"" he said. Food, clothing and medicine will be urgently required, Tak said. The U.S. government is providing $1 million in immediate assistance to Nepal, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal said. American disaster response teams are also on their way to Nepal, the Embassy said via Twitter. ""To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. ""The United States stands with you during this difficult time. How to help the earthquake victims .

The force of the quake was said by people who contacted the USGS to be from ""severe"" to ""violent,"" nearly the highest rating on the intensity scale. Tremors were felt as far as New Delhi, more than 200 miles away in neighboring India. An official said they were felt there at magnitude 5.0.

"Tokyo (CNN)A former school principal in Japan says he paid for sex with more than 12,000 women -- some of them girls as young as 14 -- during repeated visits to the Philippines over more than a quarter of a century, according to police. Now, at the age of 64, he's facing criminal charges. Japanese police say they arrested the man, Yuhei Takashima, on Wednesday over allegations he photographed an obscene act with a girl of 13 or 14 and produced pornography in a hotel room in Manila, the Philippine capital. Police officers seized 147,600 photos that Takashima took of his activities over the years, said Takeshi Akimoto, the police officer in charge of crime involving minors in Kanagawa, a prefecture south of Tokyo. The pictures were kept in more than 400 photo albums, he said. Takashima, who comes from the city of Yokohama, told police that he began paying for sex with women in 1988 when he went to work at a Japanese school in Manila. He said that stepping outside of moral codes relieved the heavy pressure he felt at work, according to police. Takashima told police that he continued to pay for sex because it was so cheap. After the end of his three-year stint at the school in Manila, he frequently returned to the Philippines on vacations in order to buy sex. He said the ages of the prostitutes he hired ranged from 14 to over 70. The Philippines is a notorious destination for sex tourists, including pedophiles. The country's sex industry is tied to human trafficking and feeds off the high poverty rate. Akimoto, the police officer, said Takashima's case had been under investigation since 2013. The incident for which he was arrested is believed to have taken place in Manila in January 2014. Yokohama education authorities said that Takashima became a junior high school teacher in 1975 and was sent to work at the school in Manila between 1988 and 1991. He served as a junior high school principal from 2008 until his retirement in 2011. The education authorities said that the crime was very regrettable, if proven to be true, and that the city government works hard to try to prevent inappropriate actions. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","Police: Yuhei Takashima, 64, says he had sex with girls as young as 14 in Philippines .

"(CNN)When 65 cases of 20-year-old Pappy Van Winkle -- one of the rarest and most expensive bourbons in the world -- were reported missing from a Kentucky distillery in October 2013, it was the crime heard round the whiskey-drinking world. Franklin County Sheriff Pat Melton, the man leading the investigation into the estimated $26,000 in missing Pappy, said at the time that  the high-end heist was ""indicative of an inside job."" But ever since, the trail went largely cold. Until now. On Tuesday, a Franklin County grand jury indicted ""nine members of a criminal syndicate that collaborated to promote or engage in the theft ... and illegal trafficking"" of liquor from two different Kentucky distilleries: Frankfort's Buffalo Trace -- makers of Pappy -- and the nearby Wild Turkey Distillery, makers of the eponymous bourbon, according to the indictment. Just like making good bourbon -- a specific type of whiskey synonymous with the Bluegrass State --  Melton's case required time to develop and old-fashioned Kentucky ingenuity. The sheriff's hunch was reflected in the indictment: Of the nine named, two worked at Buffalo Trace and one worked at Wild Turkey. The alleged ringleader, according to Assistant Commonwealth Attorney Zach Becker, is Gilbert ""Toby"" Curtsinger, a 45-year-old loading dock worker at the Buffalo Trace Distillery. Curtsinger and his wife, Julie, each face eight charges for allegedly engaging in organized crime. Curtsinger -- who has worked at Buffalo Trace for more than 20 years -- was arrested in March after authorities, acting on a tip, found five barrels of bourbon behind a shed on his property, according to CNN affiliate WKYT. Those barrels, weighing more than 500 pounds each and worth up to $6,000 apiece, had recently been stolen from Wild Turkey, Melton told BourbonBlog.com's Tom Fischer. While an additional search warrant allegedly turned up illegal steroids from Curtsinger's home, there was no sign of any Pappy. ""He doesn't know anything about (stolen Pappy Van Winkle),"" his mother, Teresa Curtsinger, told CNN last month. In fact, she said, once he bonded out of jail, Curtsinger returned to his job at Buffalo Trace. However, according to Melton, ""Curtsinger was involved in numerous thefts of Pappy Van Winkle, as well as Eagle Rare bourbon, both in bottles and barrels."" Melton said Curtsinger distributed the highly coveted bourbon through a network of connections in his softball league. Teresa Curtsinger did not immediately return a message Tuesday.  But Gilbert Curtsinger's attorney, Whitney Lawson, told the Courier-Journal of Louisville, ""we've been waiting patiently for this to happen. We're glad that if they're going to indict that they've indicted so we can get to work."" At a press conference announcing the indictments, Melton got emotional as he described the tremendous amount of effort put into the investigation. ""(Franklin County detectives) have done an absolute incredible job,"" he said as he choked back tears. ""And I'm thrilled to have been a part of it."" Fischer, the whiskey blogger, got a different kind of emotional tug from what flanked the sheriff: several hundred thousand dollars' worth of recovered booze -- including 20 cases of Pappy. Whether those 20 were among the 65 that vanished is not immediately known, but that didn't matter to Fischer. ""On behalf of bourbon lovers everywhere, we are thrilled that the Pappy is back!""","9 indicted on organized crime charges related to bourbon thefts .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)Throngs of protesters packed the streets of major Brazilian cities on Sunday, pushing for the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Fueled by mounting anger over a corruption scandal that has implicated politicians in Rousseff's party, demonstrators chanted ""Out with Dilma"" and ""Time for change."" Police estimated that 275,000 demonstrators marched in Sao Paulo. A sea of protesters dressed in the green and yellow of the Brazilian flag used decades-old rallying cries to fire up their ranks, singing rock songs that date back to protests of the country's one-time military dictatorship. It's the second day of nationwide anti-government demonstrations in less than a month. And protesters vowed that it wouldn't be the last. There are a number of issues at play. One of the biggest: an investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme at the state-run oil company Petrobras. Most of the politicians accused in the investigation belong to Rousseff's Workers Party and its allies. And during many of the years that the alleged corruption took place, Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras. There hasn't been any evidence she was involved with the scheme, and her supporters say the position is merely a figurehead. Rousseff has defended Brazilians' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at Petrobras but denied any prior knowledge of the alleged kickback scheme. Brazilians are still outraged. Rousseff won re-election with just over 50% of the votes in October, but her approval rating plummeted to 13% after protests began last month. ""Many things have changed since the election,"" Janaina, a protester in Sao Paulo, said on Sunday, noting that even some people who voted for Rousseff were in the crowd. Some protesters said they'd rather see Rousseff step down than push for impeachment, which could be difficult to push through without evidence tying the President directly to the corruption scandal. But Janaina said impeachment remained a realistic option. ""Yes, it has to be,"" she said. ""It's our last hope."" CNN's Shasta Darlington reported from Sao Paulo. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto, Catherine E. Shoichet and Jessica King contributed to this report.","Police say 275,000 demonstrators marched in Sao Paulo .

"(CNN)Freddie Gray did not get timely medical care after he was arrested and was not buckled into a seat belt while being transported in a police van, Baltimore police said Friday. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told reporters there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station. Five days after Gray's death and amid ongoing protests, police officials acknowledged mistakes were made during and after his arrest. Gray, who was stopped April 12 after a foot pursuit through several housing complexes, should have received medical attention at the scene of his arrest, said Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis. A witness said the man was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing. Batts told reporters in an afternoon news conference: ""We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times."" Investigators are trying to learn more about Gray's condition at each of the three stops the van made on its way to a police station. At the first stop, Gray was placed in leg irons. The driver stopped a second time ""to deal with Mr. Gray and the facts of that interaction are under investigation,"" Davis said. The van stopped one more time to add a second prisoner. Batts told reporters that at the third stop an officer saw Gray on the floor of the van, asking for a medic. The officer and the van driver picked him up and put him on the seat, the commissioner said. When the van arrived at the Western District station, police called for an ambulance, said Davis, who is in charge of the investigation. An attorney for the Gray family said it was positive news, but there is a more important issue. ""It's certainly a step towards acknowledging the truth that the police did not follow their own internal regulations,"" Jason Downs told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""What it does not get at is, it does not get at the core of this case and that is why did Mr. Gray need medical attention in the first place? ...  That's the question that still has not been answered."" The developments came two days after a police union attorney spoke of the possibility that the injuries occurred during a ""rough ride,"" a frequently claimed practice in which police vehicles are deliberately driven in a way that injures suspects. At least two suspects have won court cases against the city after being left paralyzed in such rides over the last decade or so, The Baltimore Sun reported Thursday. Gray died Sunday, one week after Baltimore police arrested him. At some point, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. Batts said he had been given preliminary results of an autopsy on Gray. The medical examiner's full autopsy may take another 30 to 45 days, Batts said, because toxicology tests still need to be examined and spinal experts may be brought in to assess Gray's injury. Meanwhile, anger over the incident and the police response to it continued to grow ahead of a major rally that organizers vowed would ""shut this city down on Saturday."" ""The people are demanding immediate arrests, immediate end to the protracted investigation, and immediate end to the stonewalling,"" said Malik Shabazz, president of Black Lawyers for Justice. But he and other officials vowed the protests would be peaceful -- much as they were Thursday night, despite a few scuffles and two detentions. ""No one has come to try and burn Baltimore down,"" another protest organizer, the Rev. Tim Sutton, told reporters. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake thanked those protesters who have demonstrated peacefully. ""Our community is very clear. They demand answers and so do I,"" she said. The mayor said that will take some time, but she had concerns about what happened to Gray. ""I still want to know why the policies and procedures for transport were not followed,"" Rawlings-Blake said. ""I realize there is frustration over this investigation, but I want to be clear: there is a process, but we have to respect that process."" Batts addressed calls for his resignation after Gray's death by saying he would not step down. Police first encountered Gray as they patrolled an area known for crime and drug activity. When Gray saw them, authorities said, he started running. Gray was arrested after police found what they said was a switchblade on him. An attorney for Gray's family has said the knife was a pocket knife of legal size. One video of Gray's arrest shows officers dragging him to a police van, his legs dangling limply behind him. ""His leg look broke!"" a bystander yells as a witness captures the arrest on a cell phone video. That witness, who only wants to be identified as Kiona, said she knew Gray as a joker and a ladies' man. But that day, he said only one thing to her. ""When I ran up the street and seen him, the first thing I asked him was he OK because I heard him screaming,"" Kiona said. ""He didn't never say yes or no, he just said, 'I can't breathe,' and just was yelling."" Gray's family attorneys and protesters said police didn't have any probable cause to chase him but did so only because he was ""running while black."" Police union attorney Michael Davey said officers had every right to give chase. ""There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did,"" he said. ""In this type of an incident, you do not need probable cause to arrest. You just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop."" Andrew O'Connell, an attorney for the Gray family, said ""police have a lot of questions that need to be answered."" ""What was the reasonable suspicion? Why were they arresting our client?"" he said. ""He had no weapon in his hand. He was committing no crime, and he wasn't hurting anybody. The police had no reasonable suspicion to stop or arrest him,"" the attorney said. The Gray family has not yet seen the preliminary autopsy report, attorney William Murphy said. Downs said the family has commissioned an independent autopsy. While police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators, the department has not released details of what the officers said or how Gray might have suffered the fatal injury. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions, Batts said. Baltimore protests: 5 questions demonstrators are asking . The Justice Department is investigating whether Gray's civil rights were violated during the arrest. Rawlings-Blake said earlier she ""absolutely"" believes an outside investigation is needed, especially given the history of police misconduct. A wake will be held Sunday for Gray, with a memorial service and funeral following on Monday. CNN's Holly Yan, Carolyn Sung, Ashley Fantz, Kimberly Hutcherson, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Catherine E. Shoichet, Kevin Conlon and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Attorney for the family of Freddie Gray says developments are step forward but another issue is more important .

"(CNN)In 2001, the Taliban wiped out 1700 years of history in a matter of seconds, by blowing up ancient Buddha statues in central Afghanistan with dynamite. They proceeded to do so after an attempt at bringing down the 175-foot tall sculptures with anti-aircraft artillery had failed. Sadly, the event was just the first in a series of atrocities that have robbed the world of some of its most prized cultural heritage. But historical architecture is also under threat from calamities which might well escape our control, such as earthquakes and climate change. The thought of losing a piece of our collective history is a bleak one. But if loss can't be avoided, technology can lend a hand. Now CyArk, a non-profit company founded by an Iraqi-born engineer, is using groundbreaking laser scanning to ensure that -- at the very least -- incredibly accurate digital versions of the world's treasures will stay with us forever. Ben Kacyra was born in Mosul, Iraq, in 1940. He moved to the United States in 1964, and in the 1990s he was instrumental in the design of the first portable laser scanner. He founded CyArk, a company that specializes in digital preservation of threatened ancient and historical architecture, in 2003. ""Two events happened that really influenced me and my wife,"" he told CNN's Nick Glass, ""The Taliban blew up the Buddhas and an earthquake happened in Bam, in Iran. ""It demolished a whole mud city. So we looked at each other and we said, you know, sometimes you can't prevent an earthquake, obviously, and it's very expensive to go back and rebuild, but if it had been scanned, our children and grandchildren would get the opportunity to come back and learn the history of that place."" Since then, Kacyra has been doing exactly that: in a 2011 TED talk he explained his quest to preserve our ""collective treasure"", and he has a plan to scan 500 World Heritage sites in five years. So far, the list of completed scans includes Ancient Thebes, Chichen Itza, Fort Laramie, Mesa Verde, Mount Rushmore, Petra, Pompeii, Rapa Nui, the Sydney Opera House, Tikal, and his native Mosul. The idea is not just to protect endangered structures, but to offer free educational access to the digital recreations of important monuments via the web. ""We have that data, and if something -- God forbid -- happens to these, the data is there,"" says Kacyra. In fact, current events have already caught up with the project: the Royal Tombs of Kasubi, in Uganda, were destroyed in 2010 by suspected arson. CyArk had mapped them a year earlier, and that could lead to the reconstruction of what was lost. ""I'm constantly looking at what's happening in Iraq and Syria. ""I'm so glad that we had already started and developed the tools that allowed us to go and be proactive to capture some of these things before these very unfortunate events."" To scan the surroundings, CyArk uses a portable, eye-safe laser device based on a technology called Lidar -- a portmanteau of the words light and radar. It accurately maps a physical area much like a radar, but using lasers instead of radio waves. ""We have a very powerful laser that sends a beam of light  pulsing 50,000 times per second,"" explains Kacyra, ""which means that it's collecting 50,000 points of everything that's in front it as it pulses up and down and in a circular fashion, generating the geometry of everything that's in the space around it."" In other words, ""We gave the world a 3D laser scanner that has revolutionized how reality is captured."" Although its focus is in providing open access to cultural heritage, CyArk is also attracting interest for alternative uses of the technology. ""We are discovering applications way beyond what we had anticipated,"" says Kacyra. ""For example, the Highway Patrol wants to use it in accident reconstruction on the road or in crime scene investigations. Where did the bullets go, trajectories and all that - this gives you the entire thing in minutes and then you can do all the analysis work."" Not even Hollywood is immune from the allure of laser scanning. ""Imagine it going all the way to art, the movies, movie sets. My wife got really excited about the first use in the movie field."" Before founding CyArk, Kacyra had developed a similar technology called Cyrax, which he then subsequently sold. This technology was first used during the production of the 1997 sci-fi cult movie Starship Troopers, to scan an underground cave. ""They found out it was going to cost too much money to measure the cave so they could model it, something like half a million dollars and six weeks. ""They had heard about our scanning system so we went there. I think we did it for 20,000 dollars, and in a day or two, and it got used in a movie for the first time. ""It's ubiquitous now in the movie industry for virtual sets.""","A company called CyArk specializes in digital preservation of threatened ancient and historical architecture .

"(CNN)Would a taste of the finest Swiss chocolate make you happy? Or soaking in the warm Icelandic springs? Perhaps the great jazz and rock music scene in Denmark is for you? It's not just the fun activities that make locals and travelers to those countries happy, according to the third World Happiness Report, released by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations on April 23. People who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies and more social support, experience more generosity, have more freedom to make life choices, have lower perceptions of corruption and have a higher gross domestic product per capita, the report shows. The tiny country of Bhutan, a very happy country famous for measuring the ""Gross National Happiness"" of its people, gets the credit for focusing world attention on happiness: Its Prime Minister proposed the idea of a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011. Recognizing ""happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world,"" the U.N. General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day in 2012. This officially designated happy date marked its fourth year last month. Through the happiness report, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network hopes to encourage governments at every level to measure and improve their people's happiness. ""There is no single key to happiness,"" said Jeffrey Sachs, the network's director and an economics professor at Columbia University. ""All of these countries do well in several ways. Being rich? That's good, but it's only a modest part of the story. Trusting society, having a government that ranks on low in corruption, a society where people are generous and volunteering -- all of these are important for happiness."" Even if you don't live in one of the 10 happiest countries in the world, a visit to these happy places will give you a taste of what the locals enjoy every day. Here are the top 10 happiest places on Earth, according to the World Happiness Report. 1. Switzerland . Switzerland took the top spot from Denmark in 2015, rising from third to first place in this year's list of the world's happiest countries. Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, has the cobblestone streets and medieval architecture that make it apparent why the old city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the city's founding in the 12th century, it has expanded in an often neat and orderly fashion. And the lovely River Aare offers in-town swimming and boating. Looking to get out of the capital city? Book a trip to Lucerne, where you can take a boat trip on the lake, ride the panorama gondola, take in the views on the new Dragon Ride aerial cableway and ride on the world's steepest cog railway. Book the Golden Round trip and get all four trips -- and stunning views of the Alps -- in one day. (The railway reopens in mid-May.) And no matter where you go, there will certainly be plenty of delicious chocolate to try. 2. Iceland . Nature and culture combine to make Iceland a truly happy place, so delightful that the tiny country jumped from ninth to second place this year. Explore South Iceland, where many of the ancient tales -- called sagas -- that document Iceland's 10th- and 11th-century history are remembered.  A two-hour drive from the capital city of Reykjavik, south Iceland is home to Vatnajokull Glacier, the 60-meter (197-foot) Skogafoss Waterfall and amazing fresh seafood. (Though you could probably skip the fermented shark ...) No matter where you visit, there's probably a geothermal swimming pool or hot spring spa to soak your weary bones after a long day of exploring. And when you get back to the capital, note that the renowned annual Reykjavik Art Festival will take place from May 17 through June 7. 3. Denmark . Never mind that Denmark lost the top spot this year and is now the third-happiest country in the world. Looking at all that Danes have to be happy about, you won't notice the slight dip while you're enjoying jazz at the Copenhagen Jazz Festival in July, hanging out with the hipsters at Queen Louise's Bridge, taking a canal tour or playing beach volleyball in front of the Royal Danish Playhouse. Prefer your music in the woods? Head to Smuk Fest (""The Beautiful Festival""), a rock/pop festival in the woods of Skanderborg held in August. Wherever you go, enjoy that Danish tradition of ""hygge,"" sometimes translated too simply as the need for ""coziness."" It's really a complex sense of intimacy, community and contentment that generally happens with friends and family, and it makes for one happy country. Project Happy: 10 ways to get happy . 4. Norway . The sun never sets in some parts of Norway during the summer months, and the North Cape area is one of the best spots to play when the sun stays out for 24 hours. Visitors love to golf, hike and even run a marathon during the months ruled by the midnight sun. If your taste buds dictate your travels, head to the Norwegian capital city of Oslo, a gastronomic paradise where the Michelin food guide has awarded five stars among four restaurants: Ylajali, Statholdergaarden and Fauna (one star each) and Maeemo (two stars). 5. Canada . Canada combines European style, sensibility and history with the enormous natural wonder of North America. Within the French-speaking province of Quebec, a tour through the historic city of Old Quebec is a treat for any Francophile. Founded in the early 17th century, it's the only North American city north of Mexico that still has its fortifications. The historic district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Just a few minutes from downtown Quebec City, Ile d'Orleans is a small island where farming and agriculture are still a way of life. And if nature is what you crave, in less an hour from Québec City, you could be hiking through the Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier, home to the glacial Vallée de la Jacques-Cartier. 50 states, 50 spots to get happy around the U.S. 6. Finland . What a happy event to spot the rare Saimaa ringed seal, which adapted to freshwater living after the Ice Age cut off its lake home from the sea. There are only about 300 of them in the world, and they can be found at Lake Saimaa in eastern Finland. But you might have more luck spotting the white whooper swan, Finland's national bird, whose arrival heralds the start of spring. For a more urban experience, visit Helsinki's Market Square and Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma. And you can still spot animals in the capital city: In mid-May, the cows will be herded into the fields in Viikki, a neighborhood in Helsinki, after the long winter. Locals always gather to celebrate this moo-ving event. 7. Netherlands (Holland) Though the Netherlands' tulips are without equal, and they are most stunning at Keukenhof (known as the Garden of Europe), there are so many beautiful spots across the country to walk and bike to welcome spring and its trademark flower. For a more regal celebration, note that the kingdom celebrates its 200th year this year with many festivities. 8. Sweden . In a country that's very fond of celebration, Swedes love to celebrate midsummer, the longest day of the year, most of all. It's a national holiday marked with traditional food and dances around a maypole. Can't make the midsummer parties? There's still plenty to do. Just 20 minutes from the capital city of Stockholm, the Stockholm Archipelago of about 30,000 islands offers endless opportunities for contentment. Swimming, hiking, cycling, fishing, horseback riding -- it's all within your reach by booking a boat ride. (Some boat trips include meals and tours of many of the islands.) 9. New Zealand . New to the top 10 list of happiest countries, New Zealand has plenty of reasons to celebrate. Though it's always been an attractive spot to explore, Peter Jackson choosing the country to host the filming of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy has given New Zealand more attention than money could buy. The capital city of Wellington has benefited from the growth of the movie industry, developing a happening restaurant and design scene. And many of the country's natural wonders have gained international attention, including the 2,291-meter (7,516-foot)-high Mount Ngauruhoe, which played the fictional Mount Doom. It's part of Tongariro National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 10. Australia . The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest collection of coral reefs, is a natural phenomenon not to be missed. Australians are arguing fiercely over manmade threats to its existence  (and no one is happy about that). Once you've had a chance to explore that magical underwater realm, head to the Australian state of Tasmania, an island 240 kilometers (149 miles) off the mainland coast. The Tasmanian Wilderness, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, includes one of the last surviving temperate rainforests in the world. To see the wilderness up close, try hiking the stunning 65-kilometer (40-mile) Overland Track. It takes about six days for hikers (who must book the trip in advance), but day-trippers can take short hikes starting at Cradle Mountain Visitor Centre and Dove Lake.","The World Happiness Report highlights the happiest countries .

"Panama City, Panama (CNN)Ending a decades-long standstill in U.S.-Cuba relations, President Barack Obama met for an hour Saturday with his Cuban counterpart Raul Castro, the first time the two nations' top leaders have sat down for substantive talks in more than 50 years. The meeting in a small conference room on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas came as the two countries work to end the Cold War enmity that had led to a total freeze of diplomatic ties. And while both leaders proclaimed progress had been made, a key stumbling block -- Cuba's place on the U.S. list of countries that sponsor terror -- remained unresolved. ""This is obviously an historic meeting,"" Obama said at the beginning of his session with Castro, claiming that decades of strain had done little to benefit either Cubans or citizens of the United States. ""It was time for us to try something new,"" he said. ‎""We are now in a position to move on a path toward the future."" Castro, who earlier in the day said he trusted Obama, acknowledged there would be difficult stumbling blocks as his nation works to repair ties with the United States. But he said those differences could be surmounted. ""We are willing to discuss everything, but we need to be patient, very patient,"" Castro said. ""We might disagree on something today on which we could agree tomorrow."" Speaking to reporters after his session with Castro, Obama said the meeting was ""candid and fruitful"" and could prove to be a ""turning point"" in his push to defrost ties with Cuba. But he said he hadn't yet decided whether to remove Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terror, an outcome that had previously been expected during the summit. The State Department provided Obama with a review of the terror status this week. ""I want to make sure I have a chance to read it, study it before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be,"" Obama said. ""But in terms of the overall direction of Cuba policy, I think there is a strong majority both in the United States and in Cuba that says our ability to engage, to open up commerce and travel and people to people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for Cuban people."" On Friday night, Obama and Castro greeted each other courteously amid an explosion of camera flashes, shaking hands before dining at the inaugural session of the conference. The two sat at the same table but not directly next to one another. Before Obama arrived in Panama on Wednesday, he spoke with Castro by phone, laying the groundwork for what will become a new era of relations between the neighboring countries. ""The Cold War has been over for a long time,"" Obama said during opening remarks at the summit Saturday. ""I'm not interested in having battles, frankly, that began before I was born."" That exhortation, however, seemed to be lost on Castro himself, who expanded what was meant to be a six-minute speech into a 50-minute address lecturing leaders on Cuba's revolution and giving a litany of perceived grievances to Cuba over the past 50 years. But he distinguished Obama from past American presidents, saying he respected Obama's move toward reconciliation. ""In my opinion, President Obama in an honest man,"" Castro said through an interpreter. ""I admire him, and I think his behavior has a lot to do with his humble background."" A U.S. administration official said Castro's long list of grievances was expected, despite the move toward diplomatic ties. ""(What's) unique and new is what he said about the president,"" the official said of Castro's praise for Obama. Obama announced in December that he was seeking to renew diplomatic relations with Cuba after half a century of strife, including eventually opening embassies in Washington and Havana. Obama set to test engagement doctrine with Cuba in Panama . His meeting with Castro on Saturday isn't being billed as a formal bilateral session, but Obama's aides are still characterizing the event as the highest-level engagement with the Cuban government since then-Vice President Richard Nixon met with Fidel Castro in 1959. ""We're in new territory here,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Friday. ""The reason we're here is because the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused entirely on isolation, focused entirely on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed."" The overtures to Cuba have not been universally popular in the United States; some lawmakers were irate that Obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government. ""A recommendation to remove Cuba from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism would represent another significant misstep in a misguided policy,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat who used to the chair the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a statement last week. In Latin America, however, Obama was receiving a warm welcome after announcing he was seeking to engage Havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel. 9 things you wanted to ask about the Cuban embargo . He noted to applause during a session Friday that this was the first summit with Cuba in attendance. And he's cast the decision to reopen the U.S. relationship with Cuba as beneficial to the entire hemisphere, which has also embraced his immigration executive action. But even as Obama landed in Panama, the longstanding gulfs between the two countries' governments were on display. Dissidents opposed to Castro's regime were violently accosted this week by supporters of the Cuban government, a scuffle the White House said was unacceptable. ""As we move toward the process of normalization, we'll have our differences, government to government, with Cuba on many issues -- just as we differ at times with other nations within the Americas, just as we differ with our closest allies,"" Obama said at a meeting of civil society leaders Friday. ""There's nothing wrong with that."" ""But I'm here to say that when we do speak out, we're going to do so because the United States of America does believe, and will always stand for, a certain set of universal values,"" he said. The long history between the U.S. and Cuba . Obama closed out his time in Panama with a news conference where he covered topics ranging from Hillary Clinton's expected presidential announcement to his framework deal with Iran on its nuclear program. The President had pointed criticism for Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. Earlier this week, McCain accused Secretary of State John Kerry of intentionally mischaracterizing what the sides had agreed to in the Iran nuclear deal. ""John Kerry is delusional,"" McCain said on the Hugh Hewitt show, a conservative talk radio program, adding that the view from the Supreme Leader of Iran of the provisions agreed to ""is probably right,"" rather than what the United States maintains are the agreed provisions. While discussing the Iran agreement Saturday, Obama brought up those remarks without being asked. ""When I hear someone like Sen. McCain recently suggest that our secretary of state, John Kerry, who served in the United States Senate, (is) a Vietnam veteran, who's provided exemplary service to this nation, is somehow less trustworthy of the interpretation of what's in a political agreement than the Supreme Leader of Iran, that's an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries,"" he said at the news conference. After the President's remarks, McCain tweeted ""So Pres. Obama goes to #Panama, meets with Castro and attacks me - I'm sure Raul is pleased."" As for his 2008 Democratic rival, Obama said, ""If she decides to run, if she makes an announcement, she's going to have some strong messages to deliver,"" he said.","""The Cold War has been over for a long time,"" President Obama says .

"(CNN)Much of the world has been stunned by the huge increase of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean this year, increasing the number of deaths at sea by a factor of 30 compared to the same time last year. Almost all the deaths have occurred in the perilous central Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy. The flows of migrants across the Mediterranean are unlikely to stop -- Italian authorities estimate that up to 200,000 migrants in Libya are waiting to cross, following 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived in Italy last year. These flows reflect a significant increase in the number of refugees and internally displaced people across the world, with a total estimate of 51.2 million people. The latest sinking has triggered some action in the European Union, which has unveiled a new ten-point action plan. The plan includes both deterrent mechanisms, such as efforts to capture and destroy vessels being used by smugglers and a rapid return system, but also an expansion of search-and-rescue programs and a proposed new voluntary resettlement scheme, though it is reported that this may only provide 5,000 spaces. But some EU critics called for much tougher action to deter asylum seekers from making the risky journey. In a column published in the UK's Sun newspaper just hours before the sinking, Katie Hopkins declared: ""It's time to get Australian. Bring on the gunships, force migrants back to their shores and burn the boats."" Since then, Australia's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, has also suggested that Europe adopt a tougher approach, saying, ""The only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the people smuggling trade. The only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats... That's why it is so urgent that the countries of Europe adopt very strong policies that will end the people smuggling trade across the Mediterranean."" So what would it mean if the EU did ""get Australian"" in its approach to asylum seekers? And could Australia's current policy be used as a global solution, or at least one for asylum seekers trying to cross the Mediterranean? There were dramatic changes in Australia's immigration policy in 2013, in the final months of the Labor government, led by Kevin Rudd, which have been followed up and taken further by the current Liberal National coalition government, led by Abbott. In 2013, with bipartisan support of those two major parties, mainland Australia was legally ""excised"" from the migration zone. It was done so that anyone arriving without a visa by boat would not be processed in Australia. All people who seek to enter Australia by sea, under the Asylum Legacy Act, are no longer entitled to enter or stay in Australia while their refugee claims are processed. Instead, they can be transported to detention facilities in Papua New Guinea or Nauru. Alternatively, under a recent agreement, they can also agree to move to Cambodia. Beyond this, the Abbott government has also returned some boats to Indonesia without processing asylum seeker claims and, in two instances, to Sri Lanka following a very brief teleconference interview with the asylum seekers on board. That process was widely condemned by human rights advocates, given ongoing human rights abuses in Sri Lanka. That shift in policy under successive Labor and now the Liberal National governments in Australia has been chiefly designed as a deterrent: or, to use Tony Abbott's slogan, to ""stop the boats"". So has it worked? First, the numbers. If your sole criteria for success is the number of boats arriving in Australia each year, then ""no advantage"" (meaning no asylum in Australia) and ""stop the boats"" (including the turning back of boats in international waters) has worked. In 2013, the Australian government reported that 300 boats with approximately 20,000 people on board arrived; in 2014, there were 0. The current government has argued that its objective was to end the people smuggling trade -- and this required secrecy concerning the extent of its operations and turn-backs. So we do not know how many boats tried to enter Australian waters with asylum seekers. It also appears that no asylum seekers drowned in Australian waters during the 2013-2014 period. Abbott explained the tactic of secrecy and turn-back in the following statement: ""We are in a fierce contest with these people smugglers. And if we were at war, we wouldn't be giving out information that is of use to the enemy just because we might have an idle curiosity about it ourselves."" If we accept that these responses have worked, the question for Australia's government is whether it is sustainable, and whether it alleviating the flow of asylum seekers in the larger Asia Pacific region. In sum, if this policy had to end due to its financial cost, has this policy been a ""solution""? The later years of the Howard administration saw both policy and budget departures from 2001's ""Pacific Solution,"" which first introduced the excision zones and temporary protection visas as deterrents to asylum seekers. The Rudd government abandoned temporary protection visas altogether but retained the excision zones; this occurred in a period of heightened regional instability, leading to an increase of asylum seekers under the Rudd era. The earlier Howard years of deterrence did not provide long-term solutions regarding the regional flow of asylum seekers. At present, in the greater South-East Asian region, we may see potential regional pressures finding a way to Australian shores. The drowning of asylum seekers who sought passage via people smugglers appear to have increased, in particular, in the Bay of Bengal. At the same time, the number of asylum seekers attempting to flee within the Asia Pacific region has increased; they are just not making it to Australia yet. On cost alone, it is hard to see Australia's approach to asylum seekers working or being affordable in Europe. For Australia, these short-term solutions have been extraordinarily expensive. A 2014 report by the Guardian estimated that the Australian government may have spent as much as A$10 billion ($7.72 billion) on its detention policies since mid-2007-- and that each person in offshore detention costs the government as much as A$440,000 ($343,000). For comparison, we estimate that a similar model to respond to the 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived last year in Italy would cost A$75 billion ($58.5 billion). The Australian government's ability to ""stop the boats"" -- or at least keep asylum seekers offshore -- depends on a number of factors, including tolerance from Indonesia, significant spending devoted to asylum deterrence and weathering international condemnation for violating the human rights of asylum seekers. The consequences of a policy of no asylum and no refuge in Australia for those who arrived by boat from July 2013 has been asylum seekers placed in situations where they are vulnerable to abuse, as we saw with the death of an Iranian refugee in the Regional Processing Center on Manus Island and sexual and physical assault of asylum seekers held at the Regional Processing Center in Nauru. The Australian government's interception of asylum seekers attempting to reach Australia by boat, and then their relocation to Nauru or Papua New Guinea (or perhaps Cambodia), does not remove or absolve the human rights obligations that Australia has to these populations. The operation to stop and return the boats, called ""Operation Sovereign Borders"" has been politically tumultuous for Australia's relationship with Indonesia. Returning boats to international waters potentially violates Australia's obligation to international maritime law; push-backs to Indonesian waters violates Indonesia's sovereignty and has placed people at great risk. In 2013 and 2014, the Australian government sought the Sri Lankan government's assistance to intercept those attempting to flee, and receive those who had already fled the country, at a time when that government was under investigation by the UN Human Rights Council for war crimes and crimes against humanity. As the situation in Europe illustrates, just because people are not making it to your shoreline to seek asylum does not mean people stop attempting asylum. In the short term, the ""stop the boats"" approach appears to be working for the Australian government. It is questionable whether this policy is financially or politically sustainable in the long term. It certainly has not ended people smuggling or people's attempts to seek asylum in the wider Asia-Pacific region. Nando Sigona argues that the recent tragedy in Italy is not just about how to manage search and rescue operations, but requires consistent and long-term engagement with the root causes of refugee flows. This is a message that both the European Union and Australia should heed. Italy is a good example of the failure of trying to stop asylum seekers with deterrence. The Italian government ended its Mare Nostrum search and rescue program last autumn, which was effective but was also costing the Italian government €9.5 million per month. It was replaced by a much smaller European Union-run program, Operation Triton, which has a smaller patrol area and a budget of less than a third that of Mare Nostrum. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, has noted that this new program is totally inadequate and ""more geared to border control and policing the seas than to saving lives"". In Italy, both Mare Nostrum and Operation Triton were stemming an inevitable tide given the political instability in North Africa. The migrants currently in Libya are in a perilous limbo, with a growing civil war having displaced more than 400,000 Libyans and with Human Rights Watch noting that the conflict and collapse of government authority has ""eliminated any semblance of law and order from large parts of Libya."" Second, such policies have significant legal implications. The Australian High Court has ruled that these policies are legal as long as they take place outside of Australia's migration zone, an area that today includes all of Australian territory for the purposes of boat arrivals. By contrast, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2012 that efforts by the Italian government to return migrants intercepted at sea to Libya violated its legal obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights because the migrants ""were under the continuous and exclusive de jure and de facto control of the Italian authorities."" This suggests that similar practices to Australia's would be illegal under the European Convention. Copyright 2015 The Conversation.

"(CNN)Working as a warden in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park, home to the endangered mountain gorilla, Edwin Sabuhoro was determined to do whatever was necessary to protect the animals he was committed to defend -- including putting himself in harm's way. Following a series of incidents in 2004 where wildlife had been lost, Sabuhoro volunteered to infiltrate poachers on their own turf by disguising as a potential buyer for a baby gorilla. The mission was successful and the culprits were put to prison. ""I felt so bad that I had put these people in jail -- but I felt so good that I saved a baby gorilla,"" recalls Sabuhoro, whose next move was to visit the jailed poachers, as well as their families, to apologize for tricking them and find the reasons behind their actions. What he heard was stories of starvation and desperation. Poaching, he found, was the only way for these people to survive. ""That's when I decided that what I was doing was not part of giving a solution to what is wanted outside the park,"" says Sabuhoro. He quickly decided to quit the job and come up with an idea to help poachers make a living -- a plan that didn't include killing wildlife. ""I thought of an idea of turning poachers to farmers,"" says Sabuhoro, who took all of his savings -- $2,000 -- and divided it to poachers to rent land, buy seeds and start farming. ""I left them with that and they started farming, and when I came back six months after I found they had harvested enough -- they had enough food at home, but they were [also] selling more in the markets."" But Sabuhoro wasn't finished. While talking to tourists who came to visit the volcanoes, Sabuhoro came up with an idea to capitalize on their interest in the area, and provide work for former poachers. ""I started a tour company called Rwanda Eco Tours, and I said for tourism to thrive in the country we need eco-tourism where tourists can give back to the community and then the communities will have an incentive to conserve the park. So we built a cultural village in 2006 -- before we finished, we had tourists visiting us."" he says. ""In 2010, we got $30,000 net income from the cultural village and put this back to different activities in the village level."" Sabuhoro, whose work with the cultural village has received international recognition, including a chance to briefly meet U.S. president Barack Obama as a Young African Leader, is now trying to take his idea further to other national parks across Africa where poaching is causing similar problems. ""If we can work together, on a regional level, continent level, we can save these species,"" he says. ""Because these are the last species that we have. And as human beings we can't afford to fail the wildlife."" Watch this: Meeting the men who poach Rwanda's gorillas . Watch this: Flourishing community protects gorillas .

"(CNN)ISIS operatives have executed two groups of prisoners, believed to be Ethiopian Christians, in Libya, according to a video released Sunday by the terror network's media arm. The Ethiopian government confirmed Monday that 30 of its citizens were among the two groups, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. The al-Furqan Media video -- which is highly produced and titled ""Until There Came to Them Clear Evidence"" -- shows two groups of men, one in orange jumpsuits and the other in black, being killed at different locations in Libya, according to the video's narrator. One group is beheaded on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is shot in Southern Libya, hundreds of miles away. ""All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed. To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap,"" the narrator says in Arabic on the 39-minute video. The narrator continues, ""In fact, their blood is the purest blood because there is a nation behind them (which) inherits revenge. And we swear to Allah: the one who disgraced you by our hands, you will not have safety, even in your dreams, until you embrace Islam."" Quoting Mohammed, the narrator says that those who ""perform prayer and pay alms"" will have ""their blood and property"" protected by the Prophet unless Islam dictates otherwise. ""You pay (tax) with willing submission, feeling yourselves subdued. Our battle is a battle between faith and blasphemy, between truth and falsehood, until there is no more polytheism -- and obedience becomes Allah's on its entirety,"" the narrator says. Earlier in the video, a different speaker says Christians in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul were given the choice to embrace Islam or maintain their Christian faith and pay a tax. ""The Islamic state has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this, but the Christians never cooperated,"" the speaker says. At the beginning of the video, a man who appears to be a judge in a court enforcing Islam's Sharia law holds up documents and says a Syrian Christian had owed a Syrian Muslim 550,000 Syrian pounds (about $2,900) since 2004, but the Muslim was unable to obtain the money under President Bashar al-Assad's regime. ""After applying to the Islamic court he got his money back within one month,"" the man says. The law cited throughout the video comes from the Quran's Surah 9:29, whose exact translation is an area of dispute among religious scholars. The gist is that Muslims are commanded to fight those who don't believe in Allah or the Last Day (Islam's equivalent of Judgment Day) unless the nonbelievers pay a tax or tribute. In February, ISIS released a video of 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt being executed on a Libyan beach. Those captives, too, wore orange jumpsuits. In that video, released by al-Hayat Media Center, another ISIS media arm, a masked man references the killing of Osama bin Laden and his burial at sea. ""The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,"" he threatens in English.

"(CNN)As art, film stills are often overlooked. The photographers tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer. Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. Which is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. Haas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets. It was a necessity in those early days, said John Jacob, the editor of a new book of Haas' movie photography, ""Ernst Haas: On Set."" ""Working on film sets was really important to Magnum, and all of the photographers working with Magnum in the '50s did films,"" says Jacob, now the McEvoy Family Curator for Photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. And the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work. The photographers ""are definitely producing work for posterity, that very much has their own fingerprint on it,"" Jacob said. Such distinction is obvious from looking at Haas' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on. There's a striking picture of Orson Welles in 1949's ""The Third Man,"" hemmed in by the darkness in a way that suggests the shadowy themes of the classic film. Another, of Gregory Peck and Chuck Connors in 1958's ""The Big Country,"" is as dramatic as any full-scale movie duel. (Westerns were a specialty.) But Haas also has a way of documenting the artificiality of film work, whether it's capturing the sprawling, workaday set of 1965's ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" or snapping a relaxed picture of Barbara Streisand as Dolly Levi in 1969's ""Hello, Dolly!"" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The former is particularly interesting: an image of actors splayed on crosses for the crucifixion scene, surrounded by ladders, a camera crane, a painted scrim and several casually dressed crew members. Jacob observes that in each of Haas' images there's an eye for the unusual. The black-and-white work from ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" for example, is almost prayerful, while the color images call attention to the artificiality of film. And some of Haas' other color images, especially his work for 1961's ""West Side Story,"" fit in neatly with others in his catalog, as Haas was known for an impressionistic blur of hues that Jacob calls ""the Haas effect."" Haas died in 1986, and despite being celebrated during his life, his name is somewhat forgotten these days. Jacob hopes that ""Ernst Haas: On Set"" reminds people just what a master he was. ""A lot of these are familiar images, but you don't necessarily associate them with Haas,"" he said. ""On the other hand, people who know Haas well don't actually know this work, because it was work for hire and wasn't ever put together in this way before."" Ernst Haas was an Austrian photographer who passed away in 1986. He was a member of Magnum Photos.","Ernst Haas, a celebrated 20th-century photographer, was a regular on movie sets .

"(CNN)Like phone booths and typewriters, record stores are a vanishing breed -- another victim of the digital age. Camelot Music. Virgin Megastores. Wherehouse Music. Tower Records. All of them gone. Corporate America has largely abandoned brick-and-mortar music retailing to a scattering of independent stores, many of them in scruffy urban neighborhoods. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Yes, it's harder in the Spotify era to find a place to go buy physical music. But many of the remaining record stores are succeeding -- even thriving -- by catering to a passionate core of customers and collectors. On Saturday, hundreds of music retailers will hold events to commemorate Record Store Day, an annual celebration of, well, your neighborhood record store. Many stores will host live performances, drawings, book signings, special sales of rare or autographed vinyl and other happenings. Some will even serve beer. To their diehard customers, these places are more than mere stores: They are cultural institutions that celebrate music history (the entire Duran Duran oeuvre, all in one place!), display artifacts (Aretha Franklin on vinyl!), and nurture the local music scene (hey, here's a CD by your brother's metal band!). They also employ knowledgeable clerks who will be happy to debate the relative merits of ""Blood on the Tracks"" and ""Blonde on Blonde."" Or maybe, like Jack Black in ""High Fidelity,"" just mock your lousy taste in music. So if you're a music geek, drop by.

"Cairo (CNN)Mohamed Morsy went from prison to the presidency. And now he's going back to prison. The ousted President was convicted on charges of violence and inciting violence and sentenced to 20 years in prison for the torture of protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012. But he was acquitted of murder in the deaths of protesters. He stood trial with 14 co-defendants, including some of his presidential staff. All 14 co-defendants were also convicted of violence and inciting violence, and all were also acquitted of murder. Morsy, who became Egypt's first democratically elected President in June 2012, was deposed by a popularly backed military coup in July 2013. After the sentencing, his Freedom and Justice Party called the trial a ""travesty of justice."" ""This is a sad and terrible day in Egyptian history,"" the party said in a statement Tuesday. ""Coup leaders have sentenced Mohamed Morsi to decades in prison for nothing more than championing the democratic will of the people."" But Ramy Ghanem, a civil plaintiff lawyer representing one of the torture victims, said the conviction was fair. ""This is a very appropriate and clear verdict on people that committed the crime,"" he said. ""This, in fact, was the maximum sentence for the charges. The surprise was the acquittal."" Hoda Nasrallah, a lawyer representing two torture victims, called the outcome of the case typical for Egypt. ""All the cases involving big gatherings and demonstrations in which protesters were killed usually see the culprits walk free. This case is a manifestation of this,"" she said. ""The public will always see the verdicts as politicized because there is no regime put on trial before falling, so everyone sees it as settling scores. It's not about Morsy only, but it also applies to (former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak and others. This is the status quo in Egypt. We wish we could see the trial of a regime when it is in power, not after that."" Nasrallah called for a ""fair trial,"" criticizing the fact that seven men killed during the December 2012 clashes were not included in this case, because they were affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, and that the involvement of other sides, including police, wasn't investigated. Morsy can appeal his conviction. But Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Mohamed Montasser has already issued an ominous warning on Twitter: . ""Sentencing the president won't pass,"" he said. ""The revolution will be ignited, popular anger will increase and we promise you unexpected revolutionary surprises."" At various points in the trial, Morsy said that he was still the President of Egypt and refused to recognize the court as legal. Attorney Mohamed Selim El-Awa cited constitutional articles to the court that stipulated the steps for removing a president and putting him on trial -- something that required the approval of two-thirds of the parliament and a special court made of the country's top judges. A judge on Tuesday rejected the argument presented by El-Awa and court-appointed lawyer El-Sayed Hamed that the court had no jurisdiction. Hamed was appointed by the court after Morsy's defense team withdrew. He told CNN he met with Morsy about three times over the past 16 months. He praised the ""neutrality of the court,"" rebuffing accusations of politicization. ""Before the case reached the court, it was dominated by politics more than the law, and I said this in my argument at the court. But by reaching the court, the court examined the documents from the legal aspect and saw that they were innocent of accusations of murder and guilty of other charges. Consequently, we will appeal this sentence,"" he told CNN. Early in the trial, Morsy and his co-defendants were held in a metal cage in court. Later, that cage was enclosed in soundproof glass. This is the first trial Morsy was referred to after his removal from power. He is also standing trial in three other cases, including two on charges of espionage. The third trial involves a 2011 jailbreak. Morsy and 18 other members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood allegedly broke out of the  Wadi-Natroun prison, Egyptian state-run media reported. In that trial, Morsy and his 130 co-defendants, who include 71 Palestinians tried in absentia, are accused of collaborating with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah to break into several prisons across Egypt in January 2011 and facilitating the escape of Morsy and 20,000 others. In May, Morsy is scheduled to start a fifth trial -- this one on charges of insulting the judiciary. Sarah Sirgany reported from Cairo; Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN)Ever had a headache so big, you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out? In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines. It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds. But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian. Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels. At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge. When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce. Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring. Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades. ""The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring,"" he said. ""It makes for the best cosmetic outcome."" He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut. Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian. Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel. The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference. ""It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh',"" Dr. Green said. ""Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw."" Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal. ""The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'"" he said. ""If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically. ""It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery. ""You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!"" And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel. ""What's really fun is seeing it heal,"" he said. ""Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring."" In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal. ""For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer,"" the company says. At €99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at €712.50 ($772.60). But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use. Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone. ""If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it,"" he said. ""It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off.""","Obsidian can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels .
Some surgeons still use the blades in procedures today ."
"(CNN)Several of the world's worst terrorist groups, like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, aim to create societies governed by strict, distorted versions of Sharia law. That means anyone who doesn't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- Christians included. Of course, Christians aren't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations. For example, most victims of ISIS are fellow Muslims who refuse to go along with the ISIS worldview and ruthless tactics. Still, there's ample evidence that Christians have been targeted. The latest came Friday, when an Italian prosecutor revealed that a network of Pakistanis associated with al Qaeda talked about attacking the Vatican back in March 2010. ""This is ... a reminder about the world we're in right now,"" U.S. Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland, told CNN on Friday. ""...I do think there's a larger narrative about Christian persecution (by) militant groups around the world."" This attack wasn't carried out, but many others have been. Some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific, such as reports that Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. Other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups, including these recent examples: . Sid Ahmed Ghlam asked for an ambulance to come to his Paris home on Sunday after (he claimed) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh. Besides getting medical help, Ghlam was arrested after authorities found four Kalashnikov guns, a revolver, ammunition, police armbands and more in his car and residence, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on Wednesday. They also turned up ""documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS"" and correspondence with someone in Syria ""asking him to target a church."" Prime Minister Manuel Valls later went to a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif, one of the at least two such Christian places of worship that Ghlam allegedly targeted. While he didn't elaborate, Molins said that the satellite navigation system in Ghlam's car -- which included a loaded Kalashnikov and more -- had one church's location plugged in. It's not clear what group, if any, Ghlam was working with or possibly getting orders from. Still, authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain, whom Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since the Charlie Hebdo massacre and kosher market siege in January. Regardless of whether Ghlam is ever convicted in Chatelain's killing, it appears unlikely that he'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon. ""A terrorist attack has been foiled,"" French President Francois Hollande said. ISIS has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows, producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror. What set the one from April apart were the number of people killed and that they were Christians from Ethiopia. Ethiopia's government said Monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in Libya in a video released a day earlier, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. That 39-minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away, to southern Libya. ""All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed,"" the video's narrator says in Arabic. ""To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap."" The same video brazenly claims that ISIS has been merciful to Christians in Iraq -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to Islam. But not all have taken this offer, according to a different speaker. ""The Islamic State has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this,"" this speaker says, using the name ISIS calls itself. ""But the Christians never cooperated."" Everyone at Kenya's Garissa University College suffered in some way when a handful of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month. But death was reserved for Christians. According to AFP, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians. Nightmare accounts soon emerged, like that of Cynthia Cherotich, who told CNN that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates. ""(The attackers) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, ... then you lie down,"" recalled Cherotich, who refused to come out for two days. ""And then, if you know, you go to the other side."" This tactic of separating non-Muslims from Muslims mirrors what Al-Shabaab attackers did in December at a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, where at least 36 were killed, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. One of Al-Shabaab's explicit aims is to turn Somalia, its home base, into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. But that's not its only apparent goal, as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring Kenya, which is 80% Christian -- to inflict pain and terror. After the the Kenya university attack, which left nearly 150 people dead, Nadif Jama, Garissa's regional governor, dismissed Al-Shabaab's claims that it only kills non-Muslims as ""a tricky way of doing business."" ""The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that, in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,"" Jama said, claiming the group's militants are ""bent on nothing but destruction. ... That is something we need to fight."" Two suicide blasts rocked a Christian community in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more, according to officials. And that's just the beginning, pledged the Pakistani Taliban. One of the blasts left behind panicked residents, twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the Nishtar Colony of Lahore, according to video aired by CNN affiliate GEO News. Afterward, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. These blasts recalled one from September 2013, when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the All Saints of Church of Pakistan in Peshawar. Two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded, blowing themselves up, according to the Protestant diocese. Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among the dead. In a subsequent statement, the Rev. Humphrey S. Peter, the bishop of Peshawar, called the attack a ""total failure"" of official efforts to protect minorities such as Christians, who make up less than 3% of Pakistan's population. Sadly, the shock of the mass killings of the Ethiopian Christians in April may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before. ISIS released a five-minute video in February showing the mass murder of Coptic Christians from Egypt. Produced by the Islamic State's propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, the video shows black-clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a Libyan beach. Some of the hostages cry out ""Oh God"" and ""Oh Jesus"" as they are pushed to the ground, just before they take their final breaths. ""The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,"" a masked man says in English before the beheadings. News of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. The ISIS video shows the beheading of around a dozen men, though Egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped Christians were killed. Egypt's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. ""Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty,"" the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. Modern-day Assyrians are a significant part of human history, tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations. Their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace Christianity in large numbers. Now the Assyrians are battling ISIS for survival in their native Syria and Iraq. This fight came into focus in February, when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 Assyrians hostage in northeastern Syria, according to Osama Edward, the founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Edward expressed fears then that these Assyrians in Syria would meet the same fate as others in neighboring Iraq. Some of the Assyrian hostages taken in February have been released, but the fate of many more remains unknown. Even those not in captivity face dire threats, given ISIS's well-established reputation of offering little to no mercy to Christians. The number of Christians in Iraq has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today, according to estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq. ISIS isn't the only reason for this drop, but it certainly is a big one. The militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in Iraq as well as Syria, with Christians among its targets. That includes its taking over Iraq's largest Christian city, the mostly Assyrian community of Qaraqosh, in August 2014. ISIS has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond Qaraqosh, though, like its capture and control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group's advance there prompted Christian families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to Islam, paying a fine or facing ""death by sword."" Mark Arabo, a Chaldean-American leader and spokesman for the group Ending Genocide in Iraq, claims that Iraqi Christian children have been beheaded, mothers raped and fathers killed by ISIS militants in recent months. ""This is truly a living nightmare that's not going away,"" Arabo told CNN. ""Christianity in Mosul is dead, and a Christian holocaust is in our midst.""","An Italian prosecutor announces suspected al Qaeda affiliates may have targeted the Vatican .

"Cairo (CNN)An Egyptian court has sentenced 71 people to life in prison for their role in the August 2013 burning of a Christian church in the Giza province village of Kafr Hakim, state news reports. The Virgin Mary Church was torched and looted by a mob, some of whom chanted against Coptic Christians and called for Egypt to become an ""Islamic state,"" one of at least 42 churches and many more businesses and homes targeted that August, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch reports. Others attacked included St. George Church in Sohag, a city south of Cairo on the Nile River, and Prince Tadros Church in Fayoum, which is southwest of Cairo, according to reports. In addition to those getting life sentences, two minors were sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds (about $1,300), Egypt's official Egynews reported. Most of those sentenced -- 52 of the 73 defendants -- were tried in absentia, with 21 already in prison, according to Egynews. Some blamed the church and other attacks on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that backed Mohamed Morsy. Morsy became Egypt's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was pushed out by Egypt's military. Morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this month after being convicted on charges related to violence outside the presidential palace in December 2012.

"(CNN)An Oklahoma reserve sheriff's deputy accused of fatally shooting a man he says he meant to subdue with a Taser pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a charge of second-degree manslaughter. At the hearing, the judge granted Robert Bates permission to go to the Bahamas for a family vacation. That decision prompted a response from the family of Eric Harris, the man Bates killed. ""We are not surprised that Mr. Bates pled not guilty.  We are, however, surprised that Mr. Bates would choose to go on a vacation to the Bahamas during this tumultuous time.  Whether intended or not, Mr. Bates' vacationing in the Bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and Eric's life.  At a time when we are still mourning the death of a loved one that he shot down in the street, Mr. Bates will be relaxing and enjoying his wealth and privilege."" Bates' preliminary hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. July 2. ""This will give us an opportunity to deal with the facts in the courtroom instead of the media and we're looking very much forward to that,"" said  Clark Brewster, one of his lawyers, after the hearing. Bates, 73, was working as a reserve deputy for the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office on April 2 when he was involved the arrest of Eric Harris in a weapons sting operation. Bates claims he meant to stun Harris with a Taser after Harris fled from officers, but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun instead. Bates has said the shooting was accidental. He has apologized to the Harris family, as has Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations. Over the weekend, one of Bates' lawyers released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training.

"(CNN)It's one of the most famous faces in history, even though no one really knows what he looked like. Instead, every culture, every generation, remakes Jesus in its own image. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed savior when America was mostly Anglo-Protestant, at least in Hollywood's eyes. An androgynous, meek-and-mild messiah during the anything-goes 1970s. A studly action-figure hero after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Flip through the gallery above, and you'll see what I mean. If you turned on the television this past Sunday, though, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal. If not following all of history's clues -- Hollywood has yet to cast an actual Jew as Jesus -- then at least inching closer. Flipping through the channels on a day millions of Western Christians celebrated the resurrection of their savior, viewers could choose from ""Killing Jesus,"" a NatGeo production rebroadcast Sunday on Fox. ""A.D.,"" NBC's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries ""The Bible,"" and ""Finding Jesus,"" CNN's addition to the ever-burgeoning body of Christ-centered TV fare. Does God have a prayer in Hollywood? What unites these disparate projects, besides a recognition that Jesus always draws an audience and the Good Book is good for business, is the type of men chosen to play Christ. They are brawny, with brown eyes and dark complexions. They look like men who could be carpenters, if not in Nazareth, than at least in the Mediterranean neighborhood. Haaz Sleiman, from ""Killing Jesus,"" was born and raised in Lebanon. He's also Muslim, a fact that annoyed some Christians, who took to Twitter to voice their displeasure. Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage, including Native American, portrays Jesus during the historical reenactments in ""Finding Jesus."" And Juan Pablo Di Pace -- a Argentinian named after the late St. Pope John Paul II -- takes a starring role in ""A.D.,"" replacing Diogo Morgado, dubbed ""hot Jesus,"" by some, ""smarmy Jesus"" by others. You could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm, and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible. Contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels-and-sandals epics of eras past. But there's another, deeper meaning behind our new, multicultural Jesuses, scholars say. ""Filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of America has changed,"" said Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, a religion scholar and author of ""Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ."" ""A large number of Americans are people of color: Latinos and Middle Easterners and people from India,"" Humphries-Books continued. ""That means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways."" The audience base may be shifting, but it's also tuning in. Each of the Jesus shows drew big ratings, which means you'll likely be seeing more of Christ as you channel surf. But according to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong: his flowing locks. Real men don't wear long hair, said the New Testament scribe.","If you turned on the television this past Sunday, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal.
According to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong."

""This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,"" he says, adding they share the grief of their neighbors in North Charleston and with the Scott family. ""It breaks everyone's hearts, wherever we live."" Meanwhile, police continue to investigate the incident in which Scott ran from his car after a traffic stop then was shot while fleeing from Slager. On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car when Slager pulled it over for a broken taillight. The passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. The passenger was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the friend by name, nor did Thom Berry, a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division spokesman, who confirmed Friday's meeting. Slager has been fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on a murder charge. Video shot by a witness shows the officer shooting Scott in the back as he runs away. Slager had told investigators he feared for his safety after he and Scott tussled over his Taser. His lawyer, Andy Savage, said Friday he ""has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has."" Savage's office said in a written statement that it has yet to receive ""any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant."" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to ""is no longer involved in the case."" On Thursday, dash cam video and a new witness emerged from the day Scott died. The dash cam footage shows Slager talking calmly to Scott during the traffic stop. Scott apparently says he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Moments later, Scott gets out of his car and bolts. A foot chase ensues. Scott never reappears on the dash cam video, but a witness later takes video of the officer shooting Scott several times in the back as he is running away. ""Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,"" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. ""The question here is whether the use of force was excessive."" On Thursday, a new witness emerged in the case. Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw a scuffle between Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. ""It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,"" Nichols said. ""I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' "" Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That may be why he ran, an attorney for the family said. Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. ""Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,"" Callan said. ""And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing."" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. What we know about Officer Slager . The investigation has been turned over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, or SLED. In a statement released Thursday, SLED said its investigators found troubling inconsistencies from the very start. ""We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,"" SLED Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. ""The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions."" Feidin Santana, who took the video of the shooting, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. He said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. Santana said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. ""Mr. Scott never tried to fight,"" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. His video shows Scott running away from Slager before the officer aims his gun. Slager fires eight shots toward Scott, striking him five times. A timeline of events . While the initial traffic stop may have seemed to be perfectly normal and professional, and the foot chase a reasonable choice, an analyst saw little justification for that last act. ""I'm not familiar with South Carolina police training, but I guarantee you that they do not teach to shoot a fleeing unarmed man in the back,"" said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit. There are several claims in the initial police reports that are not supported in Santana's video. And there may be more to the investigation than just whether Scott's killing was justified, CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos said. ""If it's determined that multiple officers attempted to cover for the shooting officer, and it's shown that those reports were false, this will be a devastating blow for law enforcement everywhere,"" he said.

"(CNN)Just eight months ago, a young woman named Fatu Kekula was single-handedly trying to save her Ebola-stricken family, donning trash bags to protect herself against the deadly virus. Today, because of a CNN story and the generosity of donors from around the world, Kekula wears scrubs bearing the emblem of the Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing in Atlanta, where she's learning skills she can take back home to care for her fellow Liberians. ""It's a surprise -- a young child like me who came from a very poor background coming to the U.S.,"" she said. ""I'm thankful to CNN and I appreciate the people who made donations, and I'm thankful to Emory for accepting me to study."" At Emory, Kekula has asked for special training on certain skills, such as caring for burns, a common type of injury because children in Liberia sometimes fall into the open fires used for cooking. One of her instructors, Kelly Fullwood, said Kekula's an excellent student who has taught her teachers a thing or two about how to do procedures without costly equipment, as she's been forced to do in Liberia. ""She fascinates me every day,"" Fullwood said. ""She gets nursing. She gets what it's about."" Kekula, 23, was just a year away from finishing up her nursing degree in Liberia when Ebola struck and her mother, father, sister and cousin came down with the disease. Hospitals were full and no doctors would visit her home, so with just advice from a physician on the phone, Kekula took care of all four of her relatives at the same time. All but her cousin survived -- a high success rate considering that at the time, about 70% of Ebola patients were dying in Liberia. Kekula couldn't continue her nursing education in Liberia, because the schools had closed. A CNN story about Kekula in September prompted donations from around the world to IAM, an organization that raises money to help African natives pay for education. David Smith, an associate dean at Emory's nursing school, said they accepted Kekula because they were struck by how both she and Emory each treated four Ebola patients at around the same time last year -- and Emory had dozens of doctors and nurses and millions of dollars in technology while Kekula had nobody and nearly no supplies. Stop Ebola where it starts . ""It was obvious to us that this woman was intelligent and strong and fearless,"" he said. Kekula is scheduled to return to Liberia in August. ""These things that I have learned here I am going to take back to my fellow nurses,"" she said. ""I love to care for people. I love to save lives.""

"(CNN)Authorities in South Carolina have released dash cam video in connection with the fatal shooting of Walter Scott, but the footage does not show the actual shooting. Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott. Slager approaches Scott's vehicle. The two men speak. Scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle. Slager then returns to his patrol car. Scott exits his vehicle, briefly, and Slager tells him to stay in the car. Scott then gets out of the car, again, and runs away, out of the range of the dash cam. The video, which was released Thursday, also shows a passenger in Scott's car. The passenger's identity was not given in a police report obtained by CNN, but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. He did not identify the friend by name. When asked what might have motivated Scott to run, Justin Bamberg, another attorney for the family, speculated that Scott might have been concerned about child support issues. Scott owed back payments on child support totaling $18,104.43, according to Charleston County family court documents obtained by CNN. He had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by Slager. But Bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened. ""This dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed Mr. Scott -- that shooting was completely unjustified. And that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit,"" the lawyer said. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing more information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing that's being conducted by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Many questions remain about what happened on Saturday when Officer Slager pulled Scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight. In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street. ""Shots fired and the subject is down,"" the officer writes that Slager said. ""He took my Taser."" But a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw Scott try to get Slager's Taser. Feidin Santana was walking to work when he saw Slager and Scott struggle on the ground, he told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday. Santana then took out his phone and started recording video. ""I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott,"" Santana said. Then, Santana said, he heard the sound of a Taser. It seemed to Santana that Scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the Tasered again. On Thursday, a second witness spoke to CNN about what she saw. Gwen Nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and, curious, she followed them. She saw Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. ""It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,"" said Nichols, who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw. ""I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' "" she said. Feidin showed the video to the Scott family. But Santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape. In interviews with MSNBC and NBC, Santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video. ""I ... thought about erasing the video,"" Santana told MSNBC's ""All in With Chris Hayes"" in an interview that aired Wednesday evening. ""I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger."" The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear . An autopsy showed that Scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body. Before the officer starts firing his gun in the video, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's also not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager has been fired and charged with murder. He is white. Scott, who was unarmed, was black. Timeline of events . Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. Asked how he felt about Slager being charged with murder, Santana answered that ""no one can feel happy."" ""He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family,"" he told Holt. ""But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. ... Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that."" Lessons learned from Ferguson to North Charleston . The FBI is investigating, as is SLED. ""I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,"" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. Mayor Keith Summey spoke at the same news conference, which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted: ""No justice! No peace!"" They called for the mayor to step down. Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras ""so every officer on the street"" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a ""Black Lives Matter"" T-shirt who shouted, ""This is what democracy looks like!"" 2010 census data show that North Charleston is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's Police Department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of 10 City Council members are black. It's unclear what Slager's motivation was, or if race played a part in Scott's slaying. ""We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,"" Scott family attorney Stewart said. ""I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature."" If convicted, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? An autopsy of Scott showed that he ""sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,"" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: ""In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there."" When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced Slager's account of what happened was not true, he told CNN. ""There was not a struggle for the Taser,"" Anthony Scott said. ""I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway."" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was ""running for his life"" away from the officer. ""I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,"" Scott said. Family members have adamantly repeated that they don't want protests over Scott's slaying to become violent. And, so far, the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she feels ""forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son."" ""He was a loving son, a loving father,"" she said. ""He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son."" Who was Walter Scott?

"(CNN)Jon Reiter is no stranger to Mount Everest -- its world-record height, its prestige, its challenges. And its dangers. He learned that again shortly before noon Saturday, after a monster magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal. It not only rattled cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara, but caused avalanches at Everest and nearby peaks. Reiter was safe but shaken by the devastation. He told his wife, Susan, about his putting one dead person in a sleeping bag and zipping it up, seeing others killed by the falling ice and collapsing snow, and doing all he could to help others fighting for their lives. ""It's been a really rough day,"" Susan Reiter told CNN. ""Jon's been comforting injured people that he doesn't think will survive."" Jon Reiter told CNN on Sunday morning that 17 people had been killed on the mountain. The Indian Army's Everest Expedition evacuated the bodies of 13 mountaineers from a base camp who had been preparing to scale the mountain,  spokesman Col. Rohan Anand said Saturday. Separately, Dr. Nima Namgyal told CNN he has seen 14 bodies so far. Many of those killed came from other countries, according to Namagyal, something that's not surprising given Everest's lure for many hikers around the world. What may be as remarkable is all those who survived, a number that's likely in the hundreds. They are women and men like Alex Gavan, who tweeted about running for his life from his tent. ""Huge disaster,"" the mountaineer said hours later, warning that the death toll could skyrocket if helicopters didn't come quickly to evacuate those hurt. ""Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap."" Another hiker, Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, wrote on Facebook that ""a huge avalanche swept over basecamp"" that had almost 500 tents, saying he survived by hiding behind a stone structure. Afterward, the camp's dining tent was transformed into a makeshift hospital headed by the camp manager, who happens to be a doctor. And even hours after the biggest quake struck, the threat of more casualties -- and the challenge of finding out how high the toll actually is -- remained very real. ""On top of the whiteout after the avalanche it has been snowing since last night so it is difficult to see the following avalanches, and there are so many - maybe one every 5 min - that I have stopped counting,"" Pedersen wrote on Facebook. ""This also makes it more difficult to search for people."" Several companies specialize in bringing hikers to Everest. One of the biggest is Alpine Ascents International, based in Washington state. ""The Alpine Ascents International Mt. Everest climbing team was in the icefall and is now safe at Camp 1, avoiding the avalanche that hit Base Camp,"" the Seattle-based company reported on Facebook. ""Please keep those affected in your thoughts as we continue to receive updated reports on the damage and losses in Nepal."" But not every foreign company that brings climbers to Nepal was so lucky. Two reported the deaths of Americans on the mountain. That includes British-based Jagged Globe, which has offered mountaineering expeditions, courses, adventure skiing and other experiences for the past 20 years. The company reported Saturday that American Dan Fredinburg died in the Everest base camp avalanche, while two others suffered non-life-threatening injuries. A Google executive who made headlines for dating actress Sophia Bush, Fredinburg had been posting photos and updates of his adventures in Nepal on Instragram and Twitter, where he referred to himself as an ""adventurer, inventor, and energetic engineer."" His sister updated the account with a message, saying he suffered a major head injury. ""We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us. All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man. He was and is everything to us,"" his sister, Megan, wrote. The expedition company sent its condolences. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dan's family and friends,"" read a statement on Jagged Globe's website, ""whilst we pray too for all those who have lost their lives in one of the greatest tragedies ever to hit this Himalayan nation."" Eve Girawong, a base camp medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, also was killed, according to her family and employer. ""On behalf of my family, it is with deep sadness that I write that our beloved daughter, younger sister and best friend has been taken from us today.  Nong Eve Girawong was doing the thing she loved doing most -- helping others.  Words cannot describe the heartbreak and pain that we are currently suffering,"" a family member wrote on Facebook. She was working for Madison Mountaineering, a boutique mountain guide service based in Seattle. Kurt Hunter, one of the company's co-founders, confirmed her death. Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest back in 1963, is still a mentor to experienced climbers trying to follow in his footsteps. The 86-year-old confirmed that climbers he knows to currently be on Everest are safe. But some are trapped above the icefall, ""which is very dangerous anyway,"" Whittaker told CNN. Since the avalanches, ""the whole route would be different now than before the quake. They'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall ... They (the climbers) will have to cool it for a couple days, way until the route is reestablished ... they've got enough food and fuel for the stoves."" His son, Leif Whittaker, told CNN that he hasn't heard from everyone he knows to be on Everest. ""It's really tragic and I'm really saddened by the news,"" he said. ""I have a lot friends in the area and friends on Everest right now. It's hard to get news from base camp and the mountains because communication is difficult as it is. Many of my friends are safe, but I'm not sure if all of them are. ""It's been a bad few years on Everest,"" he said. ""My heart goes out to them, and I'm sending them my love and strength."" This tragedy struck just over a year after another deadly avalanche on the 29,035-foot peak that likewise sent everyone -- from seasoned Sherpas to foreign tourists -- running for their lives. At least 13 Nepalese locals and Sherpas were killed in that incident, which at the time was the deadliest incident ever around Everest. The highest single-day death toll before then came in May 1996, when eight climbers disappeared during a big storm -- an episode chronicled in Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, ""Into Thin Air."" Given the scale of the avalanches and fact they occurred near the start of the busy spring climbing season, it's possible this day could turn out to be the most deadly. Climbers traditionally arrive in April to get acclimated to the high altitude before trying to scale the summit. There's no guarantee they'll get the chance to go up this season. After last year's avalanches, the mountain was shut down. But whether it's their livelihood or their obsession, the people who tackle Everest will be back. ""This is our job,"" said Pasang Sherpa, who lost ""friends in brothers"" in the 2014 avalanche. ""So there is always a risk of death."" For many mountaineers, the draw of Everest has long been hard to resist. One of them is Reiter, who has scaled all of ""The Seven Summits"" -- the highest mountain on each of the seven continents -- except this one. This would be his third straight year trying. He turned back in 2013 ""because it didn't feel right"" and survived last year's avalanche, according to his wife Susan. Her husband phoned her multiple times since the latest avalanches, reassuring her that he's OK physically even as he struggles emotionally with the tragedy. But does that mean he won't go back to try to scale Everest again? ""You would think that he wouldn't because of this and because of last year,"" Susan Reiter said from her Northern California home. ""But knowing my husband I think he will. I hope not, but I don't want to hold him back."" Nepal rescue efforts come down to neighbors . CNN's Katia Hetter, Jessica King and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Family of American medic killed posts message on Facebook says she died while at base camp .

"(CNN)Whether a patient is in the hospital for an organ transplant, an appendectomy or to have a baby, one complaint is common: the gown. You know the one. It might as well have been stitched together with paper towels and duct tape, and it usually leaves the wearer's behind hanging out. ""You're at the hospital because something's wrong with you --  you're vulnerable -- then you get to wear the most vulnerable garment ever invented to make the whole experience that much worse,"" said Ted Streuli, who lives in Edmond, Okla., and has had to wear hospital gowns on multiple occasions. Put another way: ""They are horrible. They are demeaning. They are belittling. They are disempowering,"" said Camilla McRory of Olney, Md. Hospital gowns have gotten a face-lift after some help from fashion designers like these from Patient Style and the Henry Ford Innovation Institute. The gowns are among the most vexing parts of being in the hospital. But if efforts by some health systems are an indicator, the design may be on its way out of style. The Cleveland Clinic was an early trendsetter. In 2010, it introduced new gowns after being prompted by the CEO, who often heard patient complaints when he was a practicing heart surgeon. That feedback led to a search for something new, said Adrienne Boissy, chief experience officer at the hospital system. The prominent academic medical center ultimately sought the help of fashion icon Diane von Furstenberg, settling on a reversible gown with a front and back V-neck, complete derriere coverage, and features such as pockets, softer fabric and a new bolder print pattern. Patients ""loved the gowns,"" Boissy said. ""People felt much more comfortable in the new design, not just physically but emotionally."" In recent years, she added, ""hospitals are looking at everything they do and trying to evaluate whether or not it contributes to enhancing the patient experience."" It's all part of a trend among hospitals to improve the patient reviews and their own bottom lines -- fueled in part by the health law's focus on quality of care and other federal initiatives. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services increasingly factors patients' satisfaction into its quality measures, which are linked to the size of Medicare payments hospitals get. Sometimes the efforts involve large capital improvement projects. But they can also mean making waiting rooms more comfortable, improving the quality of food served to patients or, as in this case, updating hospital gowns. Ultimately, this focus leads to ""a better patient experience,"" said John Combes, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association. The Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System is in the process of updating its gowns, an initiative that began when the system's innovation institute challenged students at the city's College for Creative Studies to identify and offer a solution to one hospital problem. The students responded with the suggestion to redo the garment that has often been described by patients as flimsy, humiliating, indecent and itchy. The process took three years, but last fall, the institute unveiled a new and improved version. It's made of warmer fabric -- a cotton blend -- that wraps around a patient's body like a robe and comes in navy and light blue, the hospital's signature colors. Patient expectations are part of the calculus. They ""are demanding more privacy and more dignity,"" said Michael Forbes, a product designer at the Henry Ford Innovation Institute. When the institute tested his gown design, Forbes said, patient-satisfaction scores noticeably increased in a few days. The new gown ""was emblematic...of an attitude that was conveyed to me at the hospital -- that they cared about me as a whole human being, not just the part they were operating on,"" said Dale Milford, who received a liver transplant during the time the redesign was being tested. ""That was the subtext of that whole thing, was that they were caring about me as a person and what it meant for me to be comfortable."" But replacing the traditional design is no easy task. What patients wear needs to be comfortable yet allow health professionals proper access during exams, meaning it must open and close easily. The gowns also need to be easily mass-manufactured, as well as efficiently laundered and reused. New designs, though, can be expensive. After Valley Hospital of Ridgewood, N.J., switched to pajamas and gowns that provide extra coverage, costs went up $70,000 per year, said Leonard Guglielmo, the facility's chief supply chain officer, because the new garments cost more to buy and maintain. Beyond cost, more ingrained cultural expectations might also play a role in what hospitals think patients should wear, said Todd Lee, an assistant professor of medicine at McGill University, who co-authored a 2014 study in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, examining whether gowns were important and whether patients might be fine wearing their own or hospital-provided pants, instead of or along with gowns. Often, doctors reported that pants or undergarments beneath gowns would have been okay, but patients said they were never given those options. Traditional gowns make it easier to examine patients quickly, and several doctors Lee spoke to seemed shocked at the idea that patients might wear garments other than the open-backed gown during their stay. But the most common challenge isn't necessarily doctor expectations or costs. It's navigating hospital bureaucracies, said Dusty Eber, president of the California-based company PatientStyle, which designs and sells alternative gowns. In his company's experience, hospital decisions are often made by committees, not individuals. ""There's a lot of bureaucratic runaround,"" Eber said. Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit national health policy news service.","Hospital gowns have gotten a face-lift with help from fashion designers such as Diane von Furstenberg .

"Caledonia, Michigan (CNN)Ben and Shelby Offrink met in college. It wasn't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus-based physics -- but Ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating. ""I set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us,"" said Ben with a smile. ""He was sneaky,"" says Shelby. ""Yeah, I wanted to meet her,"" says Ben, ""and that was the best way I could figure out."" Fast-forward eight years to 2014. Ben, now 34, and Shelby, a newly minted 30-year-old, were married and raising little Maeve, 3, and baby Hazel, 3 months, in Caledonia, Michigan, when life suddenly turns upside down. ""I thought it was sciatica,"" Shelby says of the back pain and the ""odd"" feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital. ""But I couldn't get the doctors in the ER to pay attention. So I went back the next day and told them that I was incontinent, and they did an MRI and there it was."" ""It"" turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain. ""So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself,"" Ben explains. ""If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself."" Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs. Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor. Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to ""terminate"" them. ""You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'"" Ben says. ""Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor."" As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome. ""I thought it was never a concern again,"" Ben says. ""The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard."" Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond. ""As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat,"" he says. ""It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing."" Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children. ""Some days it does feel like a battle,"" Ben admits. ""The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others."" Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly. ""We'd had an amazing support group,"" Ben says. ""Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. "" ""Even outside of our community, people we don't even know,"" adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. ""We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot."" This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction? ""I'm not giving up,"" she says. ""Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it."" ""For me it's just something that you have to do,"" Ben says. ""You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option."" Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education. But that's not the focus of Ben and Shelby's fight. They want to get well. ""Yeah, we have two little ladies we have to take care of,"" Shelby says, ""and lots of family and friends that care about us."" ""She's not just doing it for herself, she's doing it for her whole family, especially her girls and her husband, Ben,"" said Jay Tomczak, Shelby's older brother. ""She's not going to ever give up. What we really need is hope."" The Offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting, as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in Michigan. ""We're going to get all of our information and would like to go to Harvard or Mayo (Clinic) or places where maybe they do have more experience, and act in a shorter time frame,"" Shelby says. ""If, right now, we can find two or three trials that maybe Shelby can get into, or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path I'm on right now, it could definitely benefit us,"" adds Ben. ""We just can't wait,"" Shelby says. Her prognosis is about six months, she says, and a year for her husband. ""Never give up, because there's no reason to. Just keep fighting,"" Shelby says. She breaks into tears: ""Especially when you have someone special to fight for and everyone has someone special to fight for -- there's no one who doesn't.""","UPDATE: Shelby Offrink lost her battle to cancer on June 28, 2015 .

"(CNN)Is there anything laser can't do? From cutting diamonds to preserving endangered sites, all the way to building terrifying weapons and turning your eyes from brown to blue, there is apparently no end to the list of applications for laser. Swiss physicist Jean-Pierre Wolf is working on yet another impressive addition to that list: using focused laser beams to affect the weather. It sounds like black magic, but it's actually a cleaner version of cloud seeding, a form of weather modification that has been used for several years -- most famously by China in preparation for the 2008 Olympics, when they launched rockets to seed the clouds and prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony. But it's hard to tell how effective cloud seeding actually is, and it involves the spraying of chemicals into the atmosphere, something which it surely doesn't need. Laser is therefore a completely clean alternative to traditional cloud seeding: it's light, and nothing but light. How does laser actually affect the weather? Just like cloud seeding, it can create new clouds where there are none, by inducing condensation: naturally occurring water vapor is condensed into droplets, and ice crystals form, mimicking the natural process that creates clouds. That way, rainfall can be triggered to ""empty"" the atmosphere and increase the potential of dry weather later on: ""We did it on a laboratory scale, we can already create clouds, but not on a macroscopic scale, so you don't see a big cloud coming out because the laser is not powerful enough and because of a lot of technical parameters that we can't yet control,"" Professor Wolf told CNN's Nick Glass. That is not to say that the laser he's tested isn't powerful: at one terawatt, it has the same energy produced by all the nuclear power plants on Earth: ""Of course, it doesn't last very long,"" Wolf said. The technology is still in its infancy then, but once it's perfected, it could help us modulate the weather in areas of high contrast, such as California or Chile, where flooding and droughts occur in extreme vicinity. Through lasers, those effects could be smoothed to have less rain in flooding-prone areas and more rain in drought-prone areas: ""You can transport the water to a different location,"" Wolf said. Laser seeding can make more than clouds: it can also trigger lightning. ""We also showed that it's possible to trigger lightning in clouds, within clouds, but not to the ground, yet."" Recent tests have shown promise: "" A few years ago, in New Mexico, we moved our big mobile terawatt laser to the top of a mountain and we shot it up into the atmosphere, trying to trigger lightning. We didn't, but we could see some small discharge, lightning, within the cloud. You know, 90 per cent of the lightning discharge are intra-cloud, not against the Earth. So, we are still working on that, but there is hope."" Controlling lightning, or facilitating its discharge in a desired location, would help reduce the costs associated with lightning damage -- they run into the billions of dollars each year, adding to thousands of people injured or killed by lightning strikes. Affecting the weather could also turn out to be one of our best bets at limiting the impact of climate change. Professor Wolf reckons lasers could be used to ""repair"" the weather, reducing the occurrence of hurricanes, thunderstorms, flooding, and drought. But his laser technology can look way beyond the clouds: ""There are potential applications in the biomedical field: by changing the color of the laser, we could identify and selectively kill cancer cells, with little or no collateral damage."" Yet another potential application to add to that list: ""Every time you think you have done everything you can with lasers, something new comes up: it's quite amazing.""","Swiss Professor Jean-Pierre Wolf is pioneering the use of lasers to affect the weather .
He suggests lasers could also be used to limit the impact of climate change ."
"(CNN)More than 22 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste. The semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27. Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began in January. On Wednesday, a Fall River, Massachusetts, jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former New England patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life without parole,  as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty. Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots. Friends and fans alike wondered: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder? Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. ""I don't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol,"" Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN. The young Hernandez was the ""golden boy,"" playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends. ""I saw a closeness with them that I'd never seen before,"" Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father. But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery. Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow. In just his first semester, a police report says, Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum. The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports linked Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot. Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel. At the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, ""I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting."" The case remains open, and no one has been charged. Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year. Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel. ""If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test,"" he wrote, according to the Boston Globe. Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him. By the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension. Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder. When Odin Lloyd pulled up in a black Chevrolet suburban, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd didn't own a car. Aaron Hernandez case: Who's who? Branch had his suspicions, but he couldn't get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night. ""He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money,"" Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night. Lloyd's friends say he wasn't a big partier. He was more passionate about football and family. Remembering Odin Lloyd . Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it. Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who's engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of his little girl. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez. Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later. The next day, Lloyd's body was found. Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with ""Nfl,"" adding, ""just so u know."" Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene. Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them. Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges. He pleaded not guilty. In April 2014, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd's slaying. They, too, pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd's murder. As the trial for the death of Lloyd neared, lawyers began arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some rulings were victories for the defense. The jury wouldn't see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with ""Nfl."" The judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hadn't proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger. Jurors also didn't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been. The judge agreed with defense lawyers that it's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to Lloyd's murder. Investigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink. District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became ""angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize."" Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide . Hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later. After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said. Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said. He then pulled up to the victims' car at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court. Hernandez allegedly said, ""Yo, what's up now,"" followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, Haggan said. Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said. Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty. Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd.

"(CNN)The attorney for a suburban New York cardiologist charged in what authorities say was a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed is calling the allegations against his client ""completely unsubstantiated."" Appearing Saturday morning on CNN's ""New Day,"" Randy Zelin defended his client, Dr. Anthony Moschetto, who faces criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island. ""None of anything in this case has any evidentiary value,"" Zelin told CNN's Christi Paul.  ""It doesn't matter what anyone says, he is presumed to be innocent."" Moschetto,54, pleaded not guilty to all charges Wednesday.  He was released after posting $2 million bond and surrendering his passport. Zelin said that his next move is to get Dr. Moshetto back to work. ""He's got patients to see. This man, while he was in a detention cell, the only thing that he cared about were his patients. And amazingly, his patients were flooding the office with calls, making sure that he was OK,"" Zelin said. Two other men -- identified as James Chmela, 43, and James Kalamaras, 41 -- were named as accomplices, according to prosecutors. They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities. Both were released on bail. A requests for comment from an attorney representing Chmela was not returned. It's unclear whether Kalamaras has retained an attorney. Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto's home, including hand grenades, high-capacity magazines and knives. Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors. The investigation began back in December, when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs, officials said. During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said. Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to ""blow up a building."" He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead. Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors. ""The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute,"" according to the statement from the district attorney's office. Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist, according to prosecutors. He also requested that the rival's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present, authorities said. ""He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months, and then he said he would pay $20,000 to have him killed,"" said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.","A lawyer for Dr. Anthony Moschetto says the charges against him are baseless .

"(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Most of those released were women and children .

"Washington (CNN)A year after ISIS became a household name in America, using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge al Qaeda and its affiliates for jihadist adherents, U.S. prosecutions of would-be recruits have exploded. The flurry of arrests -- at least 25 people have been detained since January -- is a sign that complicated, manpower-intensive investigations begun when ISIS started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed. But they also highlight the unique challenges that ISIS poses in comparison with al Qaeda, which has attracted fewer U.S.-based recruits. Like a new rock band storming the music charts, ISIS has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda, law enforcement officials said. The group quickly reached early recruits through videos that showcased the fear its adherents instilled in nonbelievers. At first, most of the recruits were self-starters -- people radicalized on their own from consuming ISIS propaganda from YouTube videos and other social media. Much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailer-style videos, some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who ISIS leaders decide doesn't comport with their medieval brand of Islam. But once those initial Western recruits arrived, living in the self-declared ISIS caliphate spanning parts of Syria and Iraq, they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them. In Minnesota, nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to American Abdi Nur, who turned up fighting with ISIS in Syria in 2014 and began to appeal to his friends to come to the Middle East. ""Each one of those folks who makes it over there has the capability to reach out back to their contacts back here,"" a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said. It's a phenomenon observed in Norway and other European nations, where clusters of young people have been lured to ISIS. And the ISIS recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than al Qaeda has had. A decade ago, that group's recruits faced formidable obstacles trying to get to training camps deep in hard-to-reach areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal region. Few Westerners went through the trouble. Minneapolis men allegedly trying to join ISIS highlight role of American recruiter . Today, ISIS occupies much more accessible territory, mostly reachable through Turkey. Istanbul's airport has easy connections to Western Europe and much of the rest of the world. From there, Turkey's modern infrastructure offers quick access to the border regions where smugglers can help jihadis get across to Syria. The informal recruitment networks and ease of travel have presented a difficult puzzle to intelligence and counterterrorism officials, who are used to tracking networks of facilitators and fundraisers that funnel recruits eastward. ""It's harder for us to pick up on,"" the U.S. counterterrorism official said of the peer-to-peer recruitment, which is well below the radar. How ISIS is luring Westerners . Before ISIS, investigators could often focus on radicalizing mosques and clerics to figure out those networks. Al Qaeda recruitment focused on attracting radicals who were motivated to join the fight to protect Islamic holy lands. Much of the recruitment occurred in countries with strong conservative Islamic histories, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen, U.S. officials said. In contrast, ISIS takes a somewhat secular approach, portraying how much better life purportedly is in the caliphate as compared to the corrupt West. And people attracted to ISIS' marketing run the gamut from rich to poor, educated to dropout, male to female, teenaged to middle-aged. There are signs Western recruits have risen to high levels in the ISIS organization, with their influence reflected in the latest propaganda, counterterrorism and intelligence officials said. The English is proper, with fewer grammatical and spelling mistakes. And while the large number of arrests show that law enforcement officials are succeeding in their disruption efforts, it also means that U.S. authorities don't see the lure of ISIS receding any time soon. ""We are opening cases quicker than we are closing them,"" the U.S. counterterrorism official said. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West?","The recruiting tactics used by ISIS differ from those traditionally employed by al Qaeda .
ISIS benefits from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda, officials say ."
"Baltimore, Maryland (CNN)Protesters angry over the death of Freddie Gray got into physical altercations with police Saturday night in downtown Baltimore near the city's famed baseball stadium. Some of the hundreds who confronted lines of  police officers got into shoving matches with helmeted cops while other demonstrators threw objects. At least five police cars were damaged by people who smashed windows and jumped on them. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she was profoundly disappointed by the violence, adding that 95% of the protesters were respectful but a ""small group of agitators intervened."" Twelve people were arrested, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said. ""We continue to have a few isolated pockets of individuals causing disturbances. We are deploying resources to keep everyone safe,"" the Baltimore Police Department tweeted. Fredericka Gray, the twin sister of Freddie Gray, made a statement: ""My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence? Freddie Gray would not want this.' Freddie's father and mother do not want any violence. Violence does not get justice."" Vandals broke and damaged storefront windows and trashed one 7-Eleven, police said. CNN crews observed a window damaged at a Michael Kors store and holes in one at a Subway restaurant. The skirmishes followed a planned demonstration over how police handled the arrest of Gray, a 25-year-old Baltimore man who suffered a spinal injury at some point after he was detained by police on April 12. He died a week later. The numbers of protesters dissipated substantially just before sunset, though some people were still walking in the streets near Oriole Park at Camden Yards, causing some traffic problems. Earlier, demonstrators had marched through the streets until they arrived at City Hall. Along the way, whenever it appeared the protest might get out of control, organizers reined the marchers back in. The event ended after speeches at Baltimore City Hall on Saturday evening, but many protesters continued to vent their anger by marching down to Inner Harbor. When demonstrators got to the stadium, tensions escalated and some people threw what appeared to be water bottles and other objects at the cops, who wore helmets and stood behind metal barricades. Fans who were arriving to watch the hometown Orioles play the Boston Red Sox were having trouble finding ways to the entrance gates. The Orioles won the game 5-4 in extra innings. For a time it appeared that fans would be held inside the ballpark until the demonstration quieted, but the gates were opened before the contest was over. Throughout the day, protesters yelled, ""No justice, no peace"" and ""All night, all day; we're gonna fight for Freddie Gray."" The police department used Twitter to update the public on the progress of the march. At City Hall, speakers demanded justice for the Gray family and an end to what they called police brutality against black suspects. At least one protest organizer had promised in advance that the event would be big enough to shut down the city, but while many people turned out and walked, the major disruption was only to traffic on a few streets. Gray died last Sunday. Protesters have marched since, outraged by the arrest, which was recorded on a bystander's cell phone and the nature of Gray's death. The witness said Gray was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing. At some point after he was detained, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. On Friday, police officials said that Gray should have received medical care at the site of his arrest and at other times as he was transported to a police station. The van carrying him stopped three times on its way to the station where he was to be booked, but when it arrived at the Western District officers called for an ambulance, which took him to a hospital. The questions investigators are looking into are: How and where did Gray suffer a severe spinal injury? And are police liable for his death? The preliminary work on his autopsy has been done, but the medical examiner's office is waiting on toxicology results and may invite spinal experts to look at the case, authorities said. A full report may take 30 to 45 days. Batts told reporters on Friday there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station. He also said officers should have given Gray timely medical care ""multiple times."" Those comments upset members of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police. ""We are disappointed in the comments made yesterday by Commissioner Anthony Batts, and various members of his command staff, relative to the actions of the officers directly involved in the Gray investigation,"" Gene Ryan, president of the organization said in a written statement. ""These comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioner's own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete."" Police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions, Batts said. A wake for Gray will be held Sunday, with a memorial service and funeral following on Monday. CNN's Miguel Marquez reported from Baltimore. Steve Almasy reported and wrote in Atlanta.

"(CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. ""Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,"" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. ""I was frustrated every time I wore it,"" Gordon explains. ""It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character."" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding ""to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit."" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He ""didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it"" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. ""It was a little surprising,"" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that ""everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection."" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it ""cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day."" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to ""squish and compress,"" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with ""polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,"" ¼"" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says ""it can take anything but a gunshot."" The cowl was more problematic, being ""nearly impossible"" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, ""working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape."" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a ""silicone jacket"" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, ""durable and functional"" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. ""People love the theatricality of it,"" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with ""fully adjustable"" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design ""in the next couple of weeks."" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received ""easily over 50 requests from people,"" and not just from the cosplay community.  ""They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit."" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits.

"(CNN)In the end, it played out like a movie. A tense, heartbreaking story, and then a surprise twist at the end. As eight of Mary Jane Veloso's fellow death row inmates -- mostly foreigners, like her -- were put to death by firing squad early Wednesday in a wooded grove on the Indonesian island of Nusa Kambangan, the Filipina maid and mother of two was spared, at least for now. Her family was returning from what they thought was their final visit to the prison on so-called ""execution island"" when a Philippine TV crew flagged their bus down to tell them of the decision to postpone her execution. Her ecstatic mother, Celia Veloso, told CNN: ""We are so happy, so happy. I thought I had lost my daughter already but God is so good. Thank you to everyone who helped us."" Supporters were ""overjoyed"" with the news. ""This is all because of the efforts of the Filipino people and the international community who have been with Mary Jane, her family and the Filipino people all throughout,"" a supporter said upon hearing of the eleventh-hour reprieve. Veloso was arrested in 2010 after a flight from Malaysia to Indonesia when $500,000 worth of heroin was discovered in the lining of her luggage. Supporters, including the Filipino advocacy group Migrante, and her lawyers claim the young mother was the victim of human trafficking. They say she was offered work in Malaysia, but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and wasn't aware the bag she'd been given for the return journey to Indonesia was filled with drugs. The Philippine Embassy in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, said Wednesday that it welcomed the reprieve and appreciated that the Indonesian government appeared to be reconsidering the case. ""While Mary Jane was convicted for a drug-related offense in 2010, the Philippines believes that due to her personal circumstances, she herself is a victim of heartless drug syndicates,"" embassy political secretary Jed Llona said. ""The alleged recruiters of Mary Jane are currently being investigated in the Philippines, and the embassy hopes that through this ongoing case, those truly responsible for drug trafficking in the region are brought to justice."" Questions about her detention and trial, including the competency of her translator, have also been raised. Veloso had been given the customary 72 hours' notice of execution, and her family had traveled to Nusa Kambangan to say their final goodbyes. However, developments in her home country appear to have changed  -- or at least delayed -- her fate. CNN Philippines reported that Veloso's alleged recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio, and her partner Julius Lacanilao surrendered to authorities in the Philippines Tuesday. Sergio faces charges of illegal recruitment, human trafficking, and fraud, but maintains her innocence. Sergio said that she had received anonymous death threats by phone, and further threatening messages from Veloso's family on social media. Veloso's lawyer, Edre Olalia, confirmed that developments in the case had prompted the stay. ""As far as Mary Jane is concerned, her life has been spared for the moment and the reason is that the legal proceedings in the Philippines must be respected first in view of the fact that the illegal recruiter is now in custody,"" he told CNN Philippines. Indonesian President Joko Widodo told reporters Wednesday that the decision was the result of the Indonesian government's desire to cooperate with the ongoing case in the Philippines. ""There was a letter from the Philippine government saying that there is a legal process related to human trafficking there. So we need to respect this legal process."" He stressed, however, that the execution was delayed, rather than canceled. Veloso's case has touched the public in her native Philippines, with the highest levels of government and celebrity calling for mercy. President Benigno Aquino met his Indonesian counterpart on the sidelines at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur last weekend and pressed for him to commute Veloso's sentence. Filipino boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao, who is primed to fight longtime foe Floyd Mayweather Saturday, made a televised appeal to President Widodo, also asking for mercy for Veloso. ""I am begging and knocking on your kind heart that Your Excellency will grant executive clemency to her,"" he said. Veloso's sons, Mark Daniel and Mark Darren, ages 6 and 12, issued a heartbreaking plea, aimed at Widodo's son, asking him to intervene. ""Please tell your father not to execute her,"" they asked. Ordinary people are also fighting for their compatriot, including Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong, who protested at the Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong Tuesday. Philippine Embassy officials said Veloso would be returned to Yogyakarta prison in Central Java later on Wednesday. Lawyers fighting to delay her execution previously said they'd given up their bid after her second legal review was rejected on Monday.","Indonesia executed eight drug smugglers Wednesday morning .

"(CNN)[Breaking news update, posted at 11:52 p.m. ET] . Denver police report nine arrests in Wednesday's demonstrations.  The charges include assault of a police officer, robbery, resisting police, disobedience to lawful orders, obstructing roadways, and interference. [Previous story, posted at 10:54 p.m. ET] . (CNN) -- In cities across the United States, marchers took to the streets to show support for protesters in Baltimore and to complain about police violence in their own towns. On Wednesday night, several hundred people streamed into Union Square for an ""NYC Rise Up & Shut It Down With Baltimore"" rally. Protesters headed west on 17th Street and were met by New York City Police officers who pushed them back. A small scuffle broke out between the two front lines and police placed at least 20 people in zip ties in the street. The NYPD also handed out fliers and used loudspeakers to tell protesters and pedestrians to stay on the sidewalk. One person was placed in ambulance and taken away. The crowd headed toward Times Square. A law enforcement source told CNN that more than 60 people were arrested during the demonstrations. The rally was organized through social media, much like protests over the killing of Eric Garner, who died while police held him in what appeared to be a chokehold. The demonstrators chanted ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Justice for Freddie Gray"" -- the Baltimore man whose death sparked street confrontations in Baltimore. CNN affiliate WCBS reported Mayor Bill de Blasio sent a message to the protesters: ""I'd say that if you want to make change, keep things peaceful."" A smaller rally was held Tuesday in New York. In Washington, about 500 protesters, mostly in their 20s, gathered in the middle of H Street and 7th and chanted, ""All night, all day, we're gonna fight for Freddie Gray."" The mood seemed more festive than confrontational, with songs by Public Enemy like ""Fight the Power"" playing and sign-language interpreters translating the music and chants. The protest moved to the White House where most of the crowd dispersed. It started after most office workers had headed home and didn't disrupt the Washington workforce badly. One of the groups involved in the protest is the DC Ferguson Movement. Organizer Eugene Puryear said the march was called to show solidarity with the residents in Baltimore and to highlight that police brutality is a national issue. Several hundred people gathered in Gold Medal Park in Minneapolis for a rally organized by the group of #BlackLivesMatter. The Minneapolis group  held similar events in the past in response to alleged police brutality across the country. Protests also were held in Boston and Houston. On Tuesday, violent protests took place in Ferguson, Missouri, where three people were shot, the city police reported. Police said they didn't do the shooting. A 20-year-old man was arrested and the three victims were in stable condition -- two with wounds to the neck, one in the leg, police said. Police said about 300 people marched, with protesters throwing rocks at police, damaging four police cars and setting trash and debris on fire near Northwinds Estates and West Florissant, police said. One business in Dellwood was damaged, police said. No officers were injured as police conducted anti-riot activities until 3 a.m. In Los Angeles, six people protesting against police brutality were arrested Monday night when they failed to disperse, reported CNN affiliate KABC. About 50 people marched, KABC said. On Tuesday, protesters gathered outside the Stapes Center, where the Los Angeles Clippers and the San Antonio Spurs were playing an NBA playoff game. They disrupted traffic and carried protest signs. In Chicago, hundreds of protesters marched Tuesday from police headquarters at 35th and Michigan through the Southside, CNN affiliate WGN reported. Police made one arrest, for reckless conduct. WGN said protesters spoke about police violence and the death of Rekia Boyd, who was killed by an off-duty officer in 2012. That officer was acquitted last week. The group plans to gather Wednesday night at the DePaul Law School. About 100 people marched Monday night in Oakland in support of Baltimore protesters, reported CNN affiliate KABC. A protest is planned for Thursday in Cincinnati, reported CNN affiliate WXIX.  Philly.com said a ""Philly is Baltimore"" protest will be held Thursday at Philadelphia City Hall.

"(CNN)Most kids want to go out and play when they finish their homework early. But Zuriel Oduwole isn't ""most kids."" When she gets ahead of her work, she packs her camera and microphones, jumps on a plane and interviews presidents instead. Born in California to a Nigerian father and a Mauritian mother, Oduwole is often described as ""the world's youngest filmmaker."" Aged 12, she already has four documentaries under her belt -- all of which focus on African issues. It all started three years ago when Oduwole decided to enter a school documentary-making competition with a film about the Ghana revolution. Jerry John Rawlings (Ghana) John Kufour (Ghana) Joyce Banda (Malawi) Jakaya Kikwete (Tanzania) Rajkeswur Purryag (Mauritius) Uhuru Kenyatta (Kenya) Goodluck Johnathan (Nigeria) Salva Kirr Mayardit (South Sudan) Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (Liberia) Jorge Fonseco (Cape Verde) Portia Simpson Miller (Jamaica) Thomas Thabane (Lesotho) Ralph Gonsalves (St Vincent & Grenadines) Denzil Douglas (St Kitts & Nevis) After this first foray into filmmaking, Oduwole was bitten by the director's bug and quickly wanted to make more movies. She turned to the web to find the tools she needed and got involved in the entire filmmaking process. ""As I edit, produce, set up and write the scripts for my documentaries, I have to learn a lot of things,"" says Oduwole, who is self-taught and uses online editing and voice software. Her second outing, ""Educating and Healing Africa Out of Poverty,"" looked at the creation of the African Union in 1963. She followed it up in 2014 with her movie ""Technology in Educational Development."" But it was her most recent project that catapulted her to international recognition. Released late last year, ""A Promising Africa"" (watch trailer below) is the first in an ongoing series which will profile five African nations, starting with her father's homeland of Nigeria. ""I've interviewed 14 heads of state and a few of those include the President of Tanzania, Liberia, Kenya, South Sudan, Nigeria and Cape Verde, to name a few,"" says Oduwole. ""I've also been able to interview business leaders like my friend Mr Aliko Dangote."" To date, ""A Promising Africa"" has received a limited-release on the big screen in five countries -- Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, UK and Japan. The young trailblazer, who was named by Business Insider as one of world's 100 most powerful individuals last year, delightedly recalls seeing her film on the big screen and walking the red carpet in Lagos. ""I'm hoping that when people see these documentaries they will see Africa is full of positive things -- not just the things that are on the news like war, famine, disease,"" she says. ""I want to show them there is a lot more to Africa than what we see on the news -- there's dancing, music, great culture and more."" Although she's just 12, Oduwole, who is home-schooled through an online Californian system, is already a 9th grader -- two years ahead of the rest of the kids her age. Her mother, Patricia, has a full-time job as a computer engineer, whilst her father, Ademola, has taken time off his work in the tourism sector to help organize a lot of what Zuriel and her three other siblings are doing. ""There really is a lot happening in our household but somehow we make it work,"" says Patricia Oduwole. In addition to her documentary work, Oduwole has also become something of an education advocate. She travels to different African countries and the diaspora on a regular basis to talk to students about the importance of education. So far, through her side project ""Dream Up, Speak Up, Stand Up"" she says she's had the opportunity to talk to 21,000 children in nine countries. ""Girl's education is important because on the African continent, where there are not as many resources, the boys are the first [to get an education],"" says Oduwole. ""The boys go to school and get an education while the girls stay at home. And those girls aren't educated and have fewer options in life when they get older.""

"(CNN)When ISIS overran their villages near Mosul in August 2014, a small group of Assyrians, a Middle Eastern minority with a history reaching back more than 4,000 years, picked up weapons and formed their own militia: Dwekh Nawsha -- ""The Sacrificers."" Assyrians belong to the rapidly dwindling Christian population of Iraq -- recent estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq put the number as low as 300,000 compared with 1.5 million 20 years ago -- and many among them see the fight with ISIS as a final battle for survival against the Islamists. ""'Ah, Assyrians -- I've read about them in the Bible,' is what many people say,"" says Marcus Naissan, a 25-year-old electrical technician and member of Dwekh Nawsha. ""But we are not just history, we are still alive, we are still here."" The exodus of Christians from Iraq started prior to ISIS -- and the civil war in the mid-2000s took an especially heavy toll. Today, most Iraqi Christians live in Kurdish areas in the north, which have been a relative haven of stability. And so far, the Kurds have been taking heavy losses to defend Christian and Yezidi minorities against ISIS. Every night, the fighters hear the rumbling sound of coalition airplanes in the sky over Baqufa where they have their safe house just a few miles from the frontline. Here they relax, patrol the empty streets of the village and try to hinder ISIS suicide commandos from entering the near city of Dohuk where UNHCR says almost 100,000 refugees -- many of them Christians -- have found a temporary place to stay. So far, the militia has only assembled and trained 40 fighters. But Rama Baito, manager of the digital media presence of the group, shows me his direct messages on Facebook -- dozens of ex-soldiers, diaspora Assyrians or Christian activists from all over the world contact him and offer monetary support or their own presence on the frontline. ""We have 200 people waiting right now, because we simply do not have enough weapons and training capacities,"" Baito says. Since they are still small and have no heavy weaponry, the Dwekh Nawsha fighters say they coordinate closely with local Kurdish Peshmerga commanders and share the same foxholes on the frontline. The fighters are a very mixed bunch. A young baker, carrying his large military dagger in an elegant sheath, says he brought his father when he enlisted. ""But now, we see each other only rarely because he is in another unit of our group,"" he says. ""When I go on vacation, he goes to the field and the other way around. So every time we swap units, I wait for him, give him a quick hug and then leave back home."" Right now, ISIS is focused on other fronts -- the yellow fields of the Niniveh plains are quite safe for the mostly young fighters. But none of them thinks victory over ISIS will be quick, nor that fighting will end immediately afterward. All they can do now is patrol the deserted alleys of Baqufa, making sure the wild dogs don't take over the town and hope one day their relatives will be able to return.","Assyrians are an ancient Middle Eastern minority -- they are part of the rapidly dwindling Christian population of Iraq .

"(CNN)A large storm system dubbed Typhoon Maysak is churning over the Pacific Ocean, days away from a possible direct hit on the Philippines. Maysak is moving west-northwest after skirting the Federated States of Micronesia, according to the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Its eye is projected to make landfall in the central or northern part of the Philippine island of Luzon on Sunday, though the country's residents could start feeling its effects days before. That could interrupt the Easter celebration for many in the predominantly Catholic nation, which may be socked by heavy rains and potent winds. The International Red Cross noted that ""many people are expected to throng coastal areas at this time."" Images of the typhoon as seen from the International Space Station were posted to Twitter, including a Vine video showing the swirling eye of the storm. The storm has weakened and is expected to lose more strength before it reaches the Philippines. Its maximum sustained winds on Wednesday were 150 mph, making it a super typhoon in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's definition. But by Thursday, the winds' strength had declined to around 132 mph -- no longer a super typhoon but still the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera told CNN that Maysak could weaken further to become a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Philippine coast. ""This will not be a catastrophic storm,"" Cabrera said. That said, it could still cause flooding and bring strong winds, he cautioned. The Philippines is frequently hit by typhoons. In December, for instance, Hagupit killed at least 18 people in the East Asian nation and injured hundreds more. But that devastation paled in comparison to the havoc wrought by Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, which killed more than 6,000 people and injured more than 27,000 others. That typhoon, considered to be among the strongest storms ever to make landfall, hit the eastern city of Tacloban especially hard. The irony of the upcoming storm is its timing: in April, just after the Philippines Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration officially declared the onset of the nation's dry, or summer, season. PAGASA meteorologist Shelley Ignacio predicts Maysak -- which is called Chedeng in the Philippines -- will bring heavy rains to Luzon starting on Friday, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. The country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council went on red alert on Wednesday because of the storm, the news agency reports. That alert means all relevant personnel are on standby and the public should be on guard for possible effects of the storm. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Maysak has sustained winds of more than 130 mph but is expected to weaken .

"(CNN)Lest we Americans forget that -- in the wellsprings of our nation -- France bore the torch of liberty alongside us, our old ally has launched a reminder from across the Atlantic's waves. L'Hermione, with three sail masts and bright royal blue and gold markings, is a painstaking replica of an 18th century French frigate that fought with the United States' founding fathers in the War of Independence. It set sail in France on Saturday for Virginia to retrace a journey through American history. In 1780, the original Hermione was assigned to a French nobleman, who fought as a general in George Washington's army against the British. His name: Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette carried prized cargo -- news from King Louis XVI that France was throwing men, guns and treasure behind the Colonies, according to a historical summary on L'Hermione's website.  Lafayette, who had been wounded in the Revolutionary War had gone back to his homeland to lobby on behalf of Washington, who was also one of his close friends. Lafayette rejoined the fight on the front lines in Virginia, while L'Hermione did sea battle with its 32 guns against the English farther north. Its coppered bottom was an innovation that made it cut faster through the waters. In Chesapeake Bay, it joined the blockade that led the British to surrender. After the war, Lafayette returned to live in France. More than 200 years later, in 1997, a group of people came up with the idea of reconstructing the frigate using the same building methods applied in the original. They claim the replica is the ""most authentically built Tall Ship in the last 150 years."" After a year of testing, it set sail Saturday to retrace Lafayette's journey, 235 years after the original, and France gave it a sendoff with the trappings of an act of state. ""L'Hermione is a luminous episode of our history. She is a champion of universal values, freedom, courage and of the friendship between France and the United States,"" French President Francois Hollande said in a speech. President Obama, in a letter to congratulate the launch, called France ""our Nation's oldest ally."" ""For more than two centuries, the United States and France have stood united in the freedom we owe to one another,"" he wrote. L'Hermione will ply across the Atlantic for 27 days en route to Yorktown, Virginia, where it plans to arrive in early June. After that, it will show itself off in 12 ports along the East Coast. It should be in New York City for the Fourth of July, possibly sharing Independence Day fireworks with the Statue of Liberty. Since 1886, that gift from France -- also a reminder of our common bond -- has been America's quintessential national symbol of freedom.","L'Hermione is a painstaking replica of an 18th century ship of the same name .

"(CNN)Editor's Note (July 8, 2015) -- Questions have arisen about the identity of the girl who Dr. Sanjay Gupta helped operate on during a week in Nepal in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. CNN is looking into those questions and will update our coverage as warranted. Gupta helped doctors at Bir Hospital in Kathmandu perform a craniotomy in a makeshift operating room on a young patient as described in this story; it is the identity of the patient that is in question. Original story (Published April 27, 2015): . Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- An ambulance arrives, and a young girl with a bandaged head and badly blackened eye is rushed into Kathmandu's Bir Hopital on a wheelchair amid much commotion. She is Selena Dohal, 8, and her skull was fractured when a massive earthquake shook her neighborhood, two and a half hours from the Nepalese capital, to the ground on Saturday. Blood has collected on top of her brain, in the right frontal area, and she urgently needs surgery to remove the clots. ""She went to get some water, and a house collapsed on her head,"" her grandfather Ram Prasad Duhal tells a doctor. Her grandfather has accompanied Selena to the capital from Panchhkal while her parents take care of her injured brother, who has fractures to both legs. The girl has received some treatment at another hospital but has been brought to Bir in the hopes her life can be saved. ""She was badly crushed. The roof of the house was on her. She was found after a few hours,"" neurosurgeon Bikesh Khambu says. She receives a craniotomy in a makeshift operating room. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon and CNN's chief medical correspondent, has scrubbed up at the request of a Nepalese medical team to help with the operation. The conditions are less than ideal. Gupta washes up using sterile water and iodine poured from a bottle rather than hot water from a scrub sink. Instead of electric drills, he relies on saws of the variety usually only used in war zones and natural disasters due to the lack of electricity. Despite the suboptimal conditions, the operation is a success, and her prognosis is good, Gupta says. It might not look it, but Selena is one of the lucky ones. Thousands were killed when a devastating earthquake rocked Nepal on Saturday. More thousands were injured, many of whom have flooded the capital's overstretched hospitals. ""I've seen a lot of situations around the world, and this is as bad as I've ever seen it,"" Gupta says. ""They need more resources, they need more personnel here right now, and they're expecting many more patients as these rescue operations go on. ""They're barely able to keep up right now. It's part of the reason they asked me (to help); I think they're asking anybody to try to pitch in."" How to help the earthquake victims . Bir Hospital, a government facility, is one of the busiest in Kathmandu. Its inpatient wing, now scarred with cracks, was abandoned after big aftershocks Sunday, and doctors have scrambled to accommodate the influx of victims. More than 4,300 were killed in Nepal by the 7.8-magnitude quake, the strongest to hit the region in more than 80 years. More than 8,000 were reported to have been injured, but officials fear that number will be much higher once information emerges from remote areas. Many of the wounded are now across the road from the hospital at the Nepal Army Pavilion, a huge open space in central Kathmandu, and tarps have been erected at the front of the hospital for people to have shelter. Patients are housed here alongside other local residents who have fled their homes, finding shelter under tents. ""You should have been here yesterday. The building was shaking, and we all had to run out across the road,"" neurosurgeon Paresh Mani Shrestha says. ""Everyone is scared to be there. We evacuated the patients; no one wants to go there to work."" Looking for missing loved ones in Nepal? CNN iReport wants to help . Bir Hospital is a chaotic scene Monday as ambulances race in discharging new admissions, patients wail on stretchers in the lobby and distraught family members mill about. ""We have about 150 patients, but more are pouring in because the rescue is just happening,"" Shrestha says. ""When it happened on Saturday, all we could do was go 'dead or alive' -- that was the only triage we could do."" He says they received about 80 patients from Dharahara, the historic nine-story tower destroyed in the quake. ""There was nothing coming in yesterday,"" Shrestha says. But now the rescue is underway, and patients are arriving at Bir from less-equipped satellite hospitals. Among them is a Western woman in a wheelchair, her arm in an improvised splint of branches. She comes from Langtang, north of Kathmandu, where reports are arriving of immense devastation. Doctors are seeing patients with head injuries, pelvic and lower and upper limb fractures, Shrestha says. Read earthquake stories from social media . Hospitals were running short on supplies despite international efforts to rush in aid. Numerous aid groups and at least 16 nations rushed aid and workers to Nepal, with more on the way. And although the surgeons at Bir Hospital were able to save the life of young Selena, international aid agencies have warned that other children may not be so lucky. UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, said Sunday that nearly 1 million Nepalese children urgently need assistance. But some aid flights were delayed over the weekend due to aftershocks, leading to fears that many more may die before they get the help they desperately need.","Patients flood hospitals in Nepalese capital after devastating earthquake .

"(CNN)It started with neighbors and local officials digging with their hands through the rubble. As soon as a deadly earthquake stopped rattling a swath of Nepal, before the scope of the damage was calculated, the digging began. The magnitude-7.8 earthquake has killed more than 1,800 people, and the death toll is expected to rise. One witness, Joe McEnness, captured a photo of police officers in Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, trying to dig survivors out of a collapsed building. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said its volunteers and staff were aiding rescue efforts and providing first aid to the injured. The Red Cross opened a blood bank in Kathmandu. Reports from Nepal indicated that hospitals were overflowing with patients and suffering from shortages. One doctor in the outskirts of Kathmandu put out a plea for engineers to come to his hospital to help back up the electricity supply. ""Victims will be dying if we don't have it,"" Dr. Subhash Acharya tweeted. At another hospital, CNN's Manesh Shrestha saw people being turned away as doctors focused on the most dire needs, he said. He saw people lying outside with broken bones and head injuries. With communication limited, many turned to social media to ask for help locating their loved ones. Google India launched a person finder website to work as a clearinghouse for information on those who are missing and those who have been found. As of Saturday night in Nepal, Google was tracking some 1,400 records. Facebook activated Safety Check, which alerts users of any friends who are in the disaster zone. Those in the affected area can use Facebook to alert their family and friends that they are OK. The U.S. government is providing $1 million in immediate assistance, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal said. American disaster response teams are also on their way to the country, the Embassy said via Twitter. Nepal's neighbor India deployed teams to Kathmandu almost immediately. Within hours of the quake, India had sent almost 300 personnel, along with search dogs and supplies. The equipment arrived in Nepal via a series of cargo and airlift planes, including a C-130 Super Hercules, one IL-76, and two C-17 Globemasters, according to India's Ministry of Defense. Two additional helicopters were deployed from India but turned back because of bad weather, the ministry said. India said Sunday that it would dispatch 10 more aid flights to Nepal, along with 10 helicopters to assist in search-and-rescue efforts. Disaster management and medical personnel as well as mobile hospitals, food, water, blankets and medicine will be on the aid flights, Ministry of Defense spokesman Sitanshu Kar said. Pakistan announced it is sending a medical team, a 30-bed hospital and search-and-rescue experts. The Pakistani search team is specialized for rescues in natural disasters, officials said, and comes equipped with ground-penetrating radar and concrete cutters. Pakistan is sending meals, water, medicine and other supplies. China, meanwhile, announced that it will send 40 rescuers and six search dogs. Israel's military was preparing to send a team to assess the damage from the quake ahead of a humanitarian mission, the Israel Defense Forces said.

"(CNN)There's a stampede of investigators in California. The FBI said Friday that it will investigate whether civil rights were violated during the videotaped beating of a suspect in San Bernardino. The suspect  allegedly fled by car, foot and horseback when law enforcement officers tried to arrest him. Earlier Friday, San Bernardino Sheriff John McMahon said criminal investigations have begun into the actions of deputies as well as the suspect. In addition, an internal investigation has been launched. Ten deputies identified as being involved in the case have been put on paid administrative leave, McMahon said Friday. In video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC, deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them. The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him. KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times, punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times. Pusok was later hospitalized, KNBC reported, citing authorities. ""The video surrounding this arrest is disturbing and I have ordered an internal investigation be conducted immediately,"" McMahon said in a statement. ""What I saw on the television was thugs beating up my client,"" said Jim Terrell, Pusok's family attorney, according to CNN affiliate KCAL. ""That's what I saw. And these questions about what was he doing? What did they do? This is far worse than Rodney King."" The ACLU of Southern California issued a statement Friday saying that it was ""deeply troubled"" by the images. ""While we applaud Sheriff John McMahon's prompt decision to investigate the disturbing actions of his deputies, we believe more is needed,"" the organization said. ""Too often the department has failed to address questions, including those raised by the ACLU SoCal, about use of force and Taser policies."" Coming soon: An app to report police brutality . The Thursday afternoon incident began when deputies tried to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Pusok fled in a vehicle, and deputies pursued him through the unincorporated area of Apple Valley, the town of Apple Valley and farther into the unincorporated area of Hesperia, the sheriff's office said in a news release. Pusok abandoned his vehicle and fled on foot into steep, rugged terrain, with deputies pursing with off-highway vehicles and helicopters, the sheriff's office said. ""Within minutes, deputies received information that the suspect came into contact with a group of people near the Deep Creek Hot Springs and stole a horse. He fled on horseback on dirt trails, through very rugged, steep terrain, causing numerous injuries to the horse,"" the sheriff's office said. A helicopter dropped deputies onto the ground, and as they approached Pusok to make the arrest, he was thrown from the horse, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office said a Taser was used on Pusok but was ineffective because of his loose clothing. A deputy was injured when the horse Pusok had been riding kicked him, the Sheriff's Department said. Two other deputies were treated for dehydration. The incident comes amid heightened scrutiny of police use of force after the 2014 deaths of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the recent shooting of Walter Scott in South Carolina. In the California case, the FBI said the results of its investigation will be forwarded to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California and Justice Department in Washington to determine whether prosecution is warranted.

"(CNN)Countries around the world have launched massive aid operations to help victims of the Nepal earthquake, but distribution of aid faces challenges as Nepal is still trying to come to terms with the scale of the disaster. With over 4,400 dead, 8,000 injured and 8 million people across Nepal affected, numerous aid groups and at least 16 nations have rushed to send supplies and workers to the stricken country. But now the Nepalese government and army who are leading the disaster response face another problem: How to effectively coordinate and organize the massive influx of humanitarian aid. Here are three major obstacles that are hampering efforts of distribution. Nepal relies on only one international airport to receive and deliver aid. Relief organizations say the tarmac at Tribhuvan International Airport remains jam-packed with a large number of cargo planes. Several aircraft carrying essential supplies have been turned away, or diverted to India and elsewhere. ""The airport is totally congested. Even the planes which have landed, goods haven't been offloaded,"" Jagan Chapagain, the Asia Pacific Director of the IFRC (International Federations of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies) told CNN. Flightradar24, a live air traffic monitor, shows that incoming flights have had to circle in the air several times before being able to land. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team who is on the ground coordinating international relief efforts says they are doing all they can to address the problem. ""There are lots of flights arriving from around the world for search and rescue, and that's the challenge we're trying to address by supporting the airport staff directly,"" said Marcus Werne, a UNDAC team leader. But Chapagain says that airport management is still chaotic, with staff and military not being able to clear runways and offload supplies effectively. According to a U.N. situation report, main roads in Kathmandu are open, but remote areas are largely inaccessible. ""Due to the mountainous geography, infrastructure damage, collapsed bridges and damaged roads, access to many of the affected areas is reported to be extremely limited,"" read the report. The Nepalese government has not been able to provide relief to all affected areas due to difficulties in transporting goods, a government official told CNN. ""The helicopters are small. They don't fly in windy and cloudy conditions. Given Nepal's geographical terrain we cannot use surface transport much but we are using it,"" said Sagar Mani Parajuli, the Joint Secretary for Nepal's Home Ministry. The situation has deteriorated to the point where relief workers are as good as stranded. Pirtha Raj Joshi, a disaster management officer for Nepal Red Cross, had to walk 10 hours to reach a office in one of the severely affected districts, said Chapagain. Initial reports from the IFRC say that over 36,000 houses have been totally destroyed, with the number expected to rise as teams arriving in severely affected areas continue to assess damages. Just two days after the earthquake struck, Nepalese authorities leading the response are still trying to fully understand which areas have been affected, how they are affected and what the priorities are. ""Typically what we see, also in other emergencies, is that it takes a few days for supply lines, distribution lines to stabilize,"" UNDAC's Werne told CNN. ""Right now we're working with a lot of secondary data, and working on some of the key vulnerable areas identified prior to the earthquake,"" he added. The operation to get aid to survivors in Nepal is still ""very ad hoc"" and it will be a few days before the distribution becomes organized because the government is still constrained by the scale of the disaster, says Chapagain. CNN's Manesh Shrestha in Kathmandu, and Bex Wright and Jethro Mullen in Hong Kong, contributed to this report.","Nepalese authorities struggle with trying to coordinate a massive influx of international aid .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Rescuers in Nepal have pulled a man from the wreckage of a building where he was stuck for a staggering 82 hours after the devastating earthquake that hit the country Saturday. His survival is unusual, as experts say it's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster. The man, Rishi Khanal, was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu, the capital, around noon Tuesday, said Pushparam K.C., a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal. The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life, he said. But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out, the spokesman said. A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal's location and then hauling him up through the hole. They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher. On Wednesday afternoon, Khanal, 27, had just undergone surgery and was resting, surrounded by family and friends. He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience. ""It seems he survived by sheer willpower,"" said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated Khanal, according to the Reuters news agency. Khanal's story of survival isn't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake, which has killed more than 5,000 people. A 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck, the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported. A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard, the newspaper said. The little boy, whose name is Sonit Awal, was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries, according to initial examinations. CNN hasn't independently confirmed Sonit's rescue, but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure. Tanka Maya Sitoula, a 40-year-old mother of four, was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city, bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment. She endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an Indian rescue team freed her. She escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble. ""I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued,"" she said, as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school. What did she do for 36 hours? ""I was just lying down,"" she said. ""There was no room to move here and there."" Sitoula's husband, Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in Kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake. Rescue workers flown in from Turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him. Encased in an orange stretcher, he was lifted to safety Tuesday. But he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down, shaking his head from side to side. One of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water. Keisi was injured and dehydrated, but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Kathmandu, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Moni Basu, Manesh Shrestha, Ivan Watson, Tim Hume and Pamela Boykoff contributed to this report.","A French rescue team finds Rishi Khanal more than three days after the quake .

"(CNN)Pope Francis risked Turkish anger on Sunday by using the word ""genocide"" to refer to the mass killings of Armenians a century ago under the Ottoman Empire. ""In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies,"" the Pope said at a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian massacres. ""The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people,"" he said, referencing a 2001 declaration by Pope John Paul II and the head of the Armenian church. His use of the term genocide -- even though he was quoting from the declaration -- upset Turkey. The nation recalled its ambassador to the Vatican for ""consultations"" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Earlier, Turkey summoned the ambassador from the Vatican for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported. Turkey's former ambassador to the Vatican, Kenan Gursoy, told CNN in a telephone interview that while it is the first time Turkey has summoned its ambassador home from the Vatican, ""This does not mean that our diplomatic ties with the Vatican are over."" ""Since this is a situation that we do not approve of, as a first reaction, (the ambassador) is summoned to get consultation,"" Gursoy said, adding that the Pope's use of the word ""genocide"" was ""a one-sided evaluation."" In a tweet Sunday on his official account, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word ""unacceptable"" and ""out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis."" ""Religious offices are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations,"" the tweet reads. This consternation over the use of the word 'genocide' occurs regularly. And Armenians are equally upset, when Turkey protests it. Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian rebuked Turkey. ""We are in a situation in which Turkey speaks a different language from the rest of the international community and it seems that it doesn't understand that it is speaking a different language,"" he said to Italian News Agency Adnkronos. ""During these past days there have been several international organizations that adopt resolutions or issue statements that recognize the Armenian genocide and that appeal to Turkey to make this step,"" he said. ""The Pope's statement are in this context of universal value. When Turkey is able to understand this, it will be able to understand what the International community and big personalities (or better translations 'leaders') are saying."" Armenian groups and many scholars say that Turks planned and carried out genocide, starting in 1915, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the final years of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, saying hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Turkish Muslims died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. The Armenian government and influential Armenian diaspora groups have urged countries around the world to formally label the 1915 events as genocide. Turkey has responded with pressure of its own against such moves. Pope Francis said Sunday that ""Catholic and Orthodox Syrians, Assyrians, Chaldeans and Greeks"" were also killed in the bloodshed a century ago. He said Nazism and Stalinism were responsible for the other two ""massive and unprecedented tragedies"" of the past century. CNN's Gul Tuysuz in Turkey, Nimet Kirac and Karen Smith in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Former Turkish ambassador to the Vatican calls use of the word ""genocide"" a ""one-sided evaluation""

"Tikrit, Iraq (CNN)Mass graves believed to hold Iraqi soldiers have been discovered in newly liberated Tikrit. Up to 1,700 bodies may be recovered. ISIS claimed to have executed that many soldiers captured in June outside Camp Speicher, a fortified Iraqi base near Tikrit. A total of 47 bodies have been exhumed from two of the 11 mass graves discovered in Tikrit, an Iraqi government official said Tuesday. Hundreds are believed to have been executed by ISIS in June 2014 . Grieving Iraqis, apparently not related to the soldiers, gathered to pray over the bodies. When the first three bodies were found, 10 Iraqi soldiers saluted the dead by firing seven shots into the air. The national anthem was played while soldiers wept. All the bodies were decomposed. Some had their hands bound, Damon said. The remains will be sent back to Baghdad for DNA tests to establish identify, said Ali Tahir, a director in the Iraqi morgue who was supervising the digging and extraction. Damon said there may be eight mass graves inside the presidential palace complex, which contains the residences of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and two other sites outside the city. The presidential palaces complex became ISIS headquarters after the militants occupied the city. Iraqi soldiers and Shiite militias retook Tikrit a few days ago after a fierce battle. Damon interviewed a soldier who said he survived the massacre by playing dead. The solider said ISIS captured the troops outside Camp Speicher and marched them to the presidential palace complex, telling them they would be safe until a prisoner swap was arranged. Once inside the compound, the soldiers were separated into smaller groups, executed and buried in mass graves, the survivor told Damon. He said he was tossed into a river and floated to an embankment. On Monday, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said revenge is not the way to deal with the discovery of the bodies. He said several people involved in the killings have been detained. Families of the missing soldiers had been demanding answers from the Iraqi government about what happened. As ISIS swept through northern Iraq in June, some military units were ordered to Camp Speicher. Their families claim the men received orders from their commanders to leave the base and move closer to Baghdad. They left unarmed and in civilian clothes, they say. Military commanders and the Iraqi Defense Ministry denied any such orders being issued and said the men deserted. ISIS released videos that showed what seemed to be an endless line of military recruits marched at gunpoint and later posted images showing cold-blooded mass killings. Damon said Iraqi officials told her it may take weeks or months to exhume all the bodies. Human Rights Watch described the ""Speicher Massacre"" -- as it has been dubbed in Iraq -- as the ""largest reported incident"" where ""ISIS captured more than 1,000 soldiers fleeing Camp Speicher ... then summarily executed at least 800 of them."" Based on satellite imagery and witness testimony, Human Rights Watch last year was able to identity a number of mass grave sites inside Tikrit and the presidential palace complex. The families gave DNA samples to the Iraqi Ministry of Health last year so authorities would be able to match them to unidentified bodies the government may find. CNN's Arwa Damon reported from Tikrit, and Ralph Ellis wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","A total of 47 bodies have been exhumed from two mass graves .

"Baltimore (CNN)The streets of Baltimore are calm once again. For the second night in a row, protesters peacefully dispersed Wednesday night after a 10 p.m. curfew meant to prevent riots that tore up the city two days earlier. Many wore T-shirts that said ""Black Lives Matter,"" demanding accountability for the death of Freddie Gray. While the Baltimore protesters remained calm, some of their counterparts across the country were not. More than 100 people were arrested in New York during a ""NYC Rise Up & Shut It Down With Baltimore"" rally Wednesday night, New York police said. And Denver police arrested 11 people for charges such as assaulting a police officer, robbery, resisting police, disobedience to lawful orders and obstructing roadways. All this comes as protesters demand to know what happened to Gray, who was arrested April 12 and suffered a severe spinal cord injury. He died one week later. Demonstrations are planned for Thursday in Cincinnati, CNN affiliate WXIX said. And a ""Philly is Baltimore"" protest will take place at Philadelphia City Hall, Philly.com said. Seattle, Portland, Oregon, and Oakland, California, are on tap for Friday, which is also May Day or International Workers Day -- often used to call attention to issues affecting the working class and minorities. More than 100 people arrested during the fracas in Baltimore this week were released Wednesday without charges, the state public defender's office said. Authorities either had to charge or release them within 48 hours of their arrests. ""We've come up on a time line,"" said Police Commissioner Anthony Batts. But, he added: ""We're not giving up on them. We're just going to follow up."" Enya Baez-Ferreras, a student at Johns Hopkins University, joined in the protests Wednesday. She said the violence that marred Baltimore this week is not reflective of the city. ""Baltimore is not violent. We have been under a lot of duress, and the violence that erupted the other day is only in reaction to the years and decades of oppression, of police brutality, of harassment that many of the Baltimore residents have been under,"" she said. President Barack Obama denounced the ""violence, looting, destruction that we saw from a handful of individuals in Baltimore."" ""There's no excuse for that,"" he said in an interview that aired Wednesday on ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show."" Obama said his ""heart goes out"" to injured officers, and he praised police who he said ""showed appropriate restraint."" But he also talked about the state of urban communities. ""If you send police officers into those situations where the drug trade is the primary economy and you say to them basically your job is to contain that and arrest kids and put them in jail, when those police officers know (it's not going to fix things), then it's not surprising you end up with a situation of enormous tension between those communities and those police officers,"" he said. Obama: Baltimore rioting 'hurts communities that are already suffering' The relative calm that took over Baltimore can be credited in part to peaceful protesters who formed human barricades between hot-tempered demonstrators and police, day and night. ""We show that we can police ourselves,"" said a man who stood for hours in what protesters called a ""unity line."" ""We're about positivity here in Baltimore. It starts with us. This long line of people came out here because what we seen on TV (Monday night), we didn't like it."" The city implemented a 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew for a one-week period that started Tuesday. Asked if she was considering lifting the curfew early, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Chris Cuomo she had not made a decision yet. ""We re-evaluate it on a daily basis,"" the mayor said Thursday morning. Many residents credited police for not overreacting after the curfew went into effect Tuesday night, setting the tone for peaceful dispersal . ""The police did a fantastic job tonight,"" one person commented on Twitter. ""Technically they could of arrested everyone at 10:01."" Some 2,000 National Guardsmen and more than 1,000 police officers from across Maryland and neighboring states were assigned to the streets of Baltimore on Tuesday night, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said. Opinion: In Baltimore riots, 'our hearts were broken' While there was no major damage Wednesday, the recovery from Monday's destruction is far from over. Many saw their homes and vehicles damaged, their livelihoods in shambles. So residents like Cindy Oxendine took to the streets to sweep up rocks, glass and more, despite her aching back. The governor's office has started a website for those wanting to help Baltimore recover from this week's riots. ""We have received an outpouring of support from Marylanders and people all around the country who want to help get our beloved Baltimore back on its feet in the wake of the violence and destruction,"" Hogan said in a statement. The website, governor.maryland.gov/mdunites/, allows visitors to volunteer for cleanup efforts, donate to charities helping affected residents and report new incidents to police. Some leaders slam 'thug' as the new n-word . CNN's Brian Todd reported from Baltimore; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN)Late one night on Facebook, a girl with cystic fibrosis messaged a boy with cystic fibrosis, and both their lives were changed forever. The girl, Katie Donovan, read that the boy, Dalton Prager, was very sick.  ""If you ever need a friend to talk to, you can reach out to me,"" she wrote. ""Sorry, but do I know you?"" he responded. No, you don't, Katie wrote back, and told Dalton a bit about herself. Like him, she was 18, and ""my breathing is pretty crappy and I see you are in the hospital. I'm sorry. I know it sucks!...But you just gotta stay strong."" Messages between the two flew back and forth. They realized they were falling in love. For most other couples, the next step would be to meet in person. But for Katie and Dalton, that was complicated -- and dangerous. Cystic fibrosis patients shouldn't be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs. Dr. Michael Anstead at the University of Kentucky, Katie's pulmonologist since she was a little girl, had lectured her many times that face-to-face meetings with other CF patients were a bad idea. In their online conversations, one of the first things Dalton told Katie about himself was that he had Burkholderia cepacia, a horribly dangerous infection for people with CF. ""I was like, 'Hi, I'm Dalton from Missouri and I have Burkholderia cepacia,' because it's such a big deal in the CF community,"" he remembers. ""I left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her."" Katie listened to her heart, even if it might hurt her lungs. She asked Dalton to come visit her in Flemingsburg, Kentucky. ""I told Dalton I'd rather be happy -- like really, really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years,"" Katie says. ""That was definitely something I had to think about, but when you have those feelings, you just know."" So on August 28, 2009, Dalton drove more than six hours from St. Charles, Missouri, to Katie's hometown in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, where they'd arranged to meet at the Dairy Queen. At 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- Katie got out of her car and saw Dalton leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses. ""My heart was racing, but I just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello,"" she remembers. ""I'm usually not that kind of girl, but it just felt so right."" Katie took Dalton and his mother, Renee, who'd made the trip with him, to have dinner with her and her parents, Debbie and John Donovan. Later the young couple drove around Flemingsburg, and Dalton gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday, which was two days before. Their health quickly deteriorated, and within months, the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time. Too ill to work, Dalton quit his job at his family's auto repair shop, and Katie quit hers as a store clerk. In August, 2014, the couple entered the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center together to wait for new lungs. Dalton's came first, and on November 17, he had his transplant. Despite his Burkholderia cepacia, which makes transplants more complicated, it was a success. ""I was so thrilled. I was so happy for him,"" Katie says. The month after Dalton's surgery, UPMC discharged Katie -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while. When she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital, but  UPMC informed her she'd used up her supply of Medicare days and wouldn't accept her. Medicare -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- wouldn't pay for another hospitalization until Katie had been out of the hospital for sixty days. But Katie was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days, much less sixty. So Katie relied on Medicaid, public insurance that was supplied by her home state of Kentucky. She was admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital, where she was cared for by Anstead, her beloved pulmonologist. But then, another hurdle. Anstead explained that most lung transplant centers, including the two in Kentucky, don't do transplants on patients with Burkholderia cepacia, referring them to larger centers like UPMC that have more experience with such complicated cases. Katie and Dalton, now 24 and 23, were desperate. Her doctors predicted she wouldn't live a year without new lungs. Going on her husband's private insurance wasn't an option, since Dalton is on his father's policy. In February, Anstead wrote a letter to Medicaid, pleading with them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care at UPMC, even though it was out of state. Kentucky Medicaid denied his plea, and that's when the squabbling began. In a statement to CNN, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services pointed the finger at UPMC, saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. ""Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,"" wrote the spokeswoman, Gwenda Bond. ""Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application."" UPMC counters that Kentucky Medicaid told them that if they want to care for Katie, they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients. While UPMC spokeswoman Wendy Zellner didn't elaborate, a hospital might be loathe to sign up for large-scale coverage of out-of-state Medicaid patients as payments under such programs are typically very low. Asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take Kentucky Medicaid is ""an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to single-case agreements that we have signed with other state Medicaid programs,"" Zellner wrote. ""UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation."" Today, Katie waits in limbo in her hospital bed, hoping that the three parties -- Medicare, Medicaid, and UPMC -- will work things out so she can get her new lungs. ""I feel like they're putting a dollar sign on my life,"" she says. ""I don't want to die because of money. That's stupid. Nobody should have to do that."" If Katie doesn't get her transplant, not only will she die, but she'll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection, which could be deadly for him as he's on drugs to suppress his immune system. As a result of inquiries from CNN, on Wednesday Aaron Albright, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services arranged for a caseworker to call Katie at the hospital. But it didn't go very well. Katie says the caller, who identified herself as Pat Pierorazio, was ""rude, mean, and angry."" ""She said someone had told her to call me, and she acted like it was just a pain to have to be talking to me,"" she says. Katie says the Medicare representative told her she would look into her situation. In a statement, Albright with CMS wrote to CNN: ""We are working quickly to fully understand this difficult and complex situation so that this patient can get the care she needs. CMS is reaching out to the state agency to find a solution as soon as  possible."" Caught in the middle between the hospital and insurance, Katie tries to stay strong, just as she advised her husband to do nearly six years ago in their first Facebook conversation. Skyping with Dalton helps, and raising money on their Facebook page keeps her mind busy. And she's always thinking about their ""after transplant bucket list,"" which they keep in a safe in their house so it won't be destroyed by fire or flood. On the list: Drive through every state. Learn another language and visit a country where they speak it. Write a book together about their love story. They have simpler dreams as well. Like going grocery shopping together, or sitting side by side on the couch to watch television. And this is their biggest goal: . ""I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug. That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary,"" she says. Wednesday afternoon, there were signs of hope. Zeller, the UPMC spokeswoman, sent an email to CNN. ""Ky Medicaid has reached out to us to talk. So stay tuned,"" she wrote. Katie and Dalton were glad to hear it. ""I don't care what I have to do to get her lungs,"" Dalton said. ""I will just keep trying until there's nothing left to try.""","Katie and Dalton met as patients dealing with cystic fibrosis .

"(CNN)Noelle Velentzas, 28, couldn't understand why U.S. citizens like herself were traveling overseas to wage jihad when they could simply ""make history"" at home by unleashing terrorist attacks, according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed Thursday. Velentzas and her former roommate, 31-year-old Asia Siddiqui, were arrested and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States, federal prosecutors said. Siddiqui is also a U.S. citizen. The complaint paints a picture of a disturbing trend in homegrown violent extremism. Siddiqui had repeated contact with members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, published jihad-themed poems in magazines affiliated with the terror group and possessed propane gas tanks along with instructions on turning them into explosive devices, the complaint said. One day, Velentzas pulled a knife from her bra and showed Siddiqui what do with it if attacked, according to the complaint. ""Why can't we be some real bad bitches?"" asked Velentzas, adding that people needed to refer to them as ""citizens of the Islamic State."" Velentzas and Siddiqui did not enter pleas when they appeared in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday. They were held without bond and ordered to appear on May 4. Thomas Dunn, attorney for Siddiqui, said outside court that his client intends to plead not guilty. ""She and I will address everything in court,"" he said. ""We're going to fight it out in court."" If convicted, the women face a maximum sentence of life in prison. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. ""Given how the terrorist threat to the world is evolving, how the potential terrorist threat to our nation is evolving, homeland security is becoming a matter of 'hometown security,'"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday. ""The terrorist threat is more decentralized, more diffuse, more complicated. It involves the potential lone wolf actor, it involves the effective use of social media, the Internet."" In December, Velentzas and an undercover agent discussed the shooting deaths of two New York City police officers who were ambushed in Brooklyn. The shootings demonstrated how easy it is to kill a cop, she said. ""Killing a police officer is easier than buying food,"" she is quoted as saying in the complaint, ""because sometimes one has to wait in line to buy food."" When the undercover agent later pointed out that more than 25,000 officers had gathered for the funeral of one of the cops, Officer Rafael Ramos, Velentzas complimented the agent for ""coming up with an attractive potential target"" for a terror attack, the complaint said. Velentzas and Siddiqui repeatedly expressed support for violent jihad, the complaint said. They praised successful and unsuccessful terror attempts against Americans. ""As alleged, the defendants in this case carefully studied how to construct an explosive device to launch an attack on the homeland,"" Loretta Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement. ""We remain firm in our resolve to hold accountable anyone who would seek to terrorize the American people, whether by traveling abroad to commit attacks overseas or by plotting here at home."" In 2009, Siddiqui wrote a poem in a magazine published by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula that urged readers to wage jihad. She declared there is no ""excuse to sit back and wait -- for the skies rain martyrdom."" Prosecutors said the women ""researched and acquired"" components for a car bomb such as the one used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, a fertilizer bomb such as the one used in the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City and a pressure cooker device such as the one used in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Velentzas described the late al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden as one of her heroes. She kept a photo of bin Laden holding an AK-47 as the background image on her cellphone, the complaint said. There were more opportunities of  ""pleasing Allah"" by engaging in jihad on American soil, she said. In February, Velentzas and the undercover agent drove past a Home Depot in Queens. Velentzas laughed about once having told a Home Depot employee that she was having a barbecue when she was looking for propane. ""Some women like to look at clothes,"" the complaint quotes her as saying. ""I like to look at electric equipment."" In a statement, Islamic Circle of North America said Velentzas was formerly homeless and provided shelter by the relief organization. ""She stayed for a short period of time between 2008 and 2009,"" the statement said. ""While she was staying in our shelter, our staff helped her get on her feet. During this time she successfully completed studies to become a home health care provider after which she became gainfully employed.  She left the facility when she married."" Velentzas appeared to have experienced hardship in her life but was ""working towards self-development and long-term stability,"" the statement said. ""She also appeared to be someone who had greatly benefited from the assistance ICNA Relief provides through our shelter system, so we asked her to speak about the experience of our shelter.

Hasan Edmonds, 22, was arrested last week at Chicago Midway International Airport while attempting to travel to Egypt to eventually join ISIS, according to Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin and other federal officials. His cousin, Jonas ""Yunus"" Edmonds, 29, was arrested at his home in Aurora, Illinois, in connection with an alleged plot to carry out an armed attack on an unspecified U.S. military facility in northern Illinois where Hasan Edmonds had been training. The two U.S. citizens were charged in criminal complaints filed in U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois with one count each of conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization. In February, three New York men were arrested and accused of a failed attempt to join ISIS in Syria, prosecutors said. Abror Habibov, 30, who operated kiosks at malls along the East Coast, was arrested along with Akhror Saidakhmetov, 19, and Abdurasul Juraboev, 24, in connection with an alleged failed attempt by the two younger men to join ISIS in Syria.","Noelle Velentzas and Asia Siddiqui are arrested in connection with a plot inspired by ISIS .

"(CNN)The stark video of a South Carolina officer gunning down an apparently unarmed black man as he ran away with his back to police has prompted an equally fast-moving reaction by officials and the public alike. The video is being dissected frame by frame by authorities and media outlets, all in an effort to reconstruct what exactly happened between North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager, a five-year employee of that force, and Walter Scott, 50. Slager, 33, was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder after firing eight shots at Scott, killing him. Slager is also now ""terminated"" from the force, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said Wednesday. Added police Chief Eddie Driggers on Wednesday: ""I watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw and I have not watched it since."" Both Scott and Slager had once served in the U.S. Coast Guard, with Scott's service occurring 1984-86 and Slager's 2003-09. Scott was a father of four. Slager is a father to two stepchildren, and his wife is eight months' pregnant. Here's what we know of the fatal shooting: . Slager pulled Scott over at 9:33 a.m. Saturday for a broken taillight, according to authorities. Chief Driggers described the incident as ""traffic stop of an individual who had a minor infraction on his vehicle, a brake light being out."" A foot chase then occurred, a police report said. The video, taken by a passer-by, doesn't show any vehicle. Rather, Slager and Scott are on a path or roadway in a parklike setting bordered partly by a chain-link fence. The video was shot over and through the fence. ""The officer said that Walter ran from the vehicle during the traffic stop,"" Scott family attorney L. Chris Stewart said. According to the police report, Scott did not comply with the officer's demands. Scott's brother, Anthony Scott, said his brother had trouble with child support and had an outstanding warrant against him, but that his sibling wasn't prone to violence. ""That very well could have been the reason (for running from police), not to be arrested for the warrant that was on him for child support,"" Anthony Scott said. The video begins by showing a second or two of an apparent struggle between the officer and suspect. The officer contended he used a Taser stun gun on Scott and that Scott tried to take that weapon, authorities said. But when Anthony Scott saw the video, he was convinced the officer lied, he told CNN. ""There was not a struggle for the Taser,"" Anthony Scott said. ""I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway."" The video shows Walter Scott running away, with his back to the officer. As he does so, two objects fall. One falls behind the officer. And the other falls between the two men. To Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was ""running for his life"" away from the officer to escape more of the Taser. ""I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot. No one would have thought that,"" Scott said. As Walter Scott runs away, the officer pulls his service pistol and fires eight times, the video shows. As the shots are being fired, Scott keeps running away from the officer, the video shows. Scott then falls. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's not clear whether it is the Taser. It's also unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser, or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Immediately after Scott was shot, according to the video, someone yells, ""Put your hands behind your back!"" Scott, motionless and face-down on the ground, is handcuffed. It was Slager who apparently called police dispatch. ""226 to dispatch, shots fired, subject is down. He grabbed my Taser,"" Slager told the dispatcher, according to a transcript provide by Broadcastify.com. The dispatcher notes that the subject is down at 9:38 a.m., according to the transcript. About 90 seconds after saying that Scott ""grabbed"" his Taser, the officer describes Scott as unresponsive and having wounds to the chest, right thigh and buttocks, according to the transcript. The location of the shooting is behind a pawn shop, the officer tells the dispatcher. A police report identified that shop as Mega Pawn. According to CNN affiliate WCIV-TV in Charleston, Slager initially said through his attorney, David Aylor, that he followed the appropriate policies and procedures. However, Aylor later told CNN that he was no longer representing the officer. ""Today, I withdrew my representation of Michael Slager. This is a terrible tragedy that has impacted our community,"" Aylor said in a statement. Later, Anthony Scott's mother calls him and says his brother was Tasered at a traffic stop. Anthony Scott goes to the scene and finds it curious to see police tape around his brother's vehicle and the officer's vehicle. He asks officers what happened. No one replies. Then Anthony Scott's nephew tells him that ""my brother is gone,"" Anthony Scott said. ""And at that, I lost it,"" Anthony Scott said. An officer also apprises him later of what happened. Anthony Scott is shown the video for the first time on Sunday. ""My reaction to it was that we have to get ahold of the video and that this was key evidence, key evidence in the case,"" Anthony Scott said. ""We had to get it. The country had to see this."" He felt ""a little bit of anger and happy at the same time,"" the brother said. ""Based on what the video was showing, it was discrediting what the officer had initially stated,"" Anthony Scott said. The nation did indeed see the video -- and was stunned by its revelations. Authorities saw it, too. Slager was denied bail at a bond hearing Tuesday night, WCIV reported. ""I have two stepchildren and one on the way,"" Slager told a magistrate through video conferencing. If found guilty of murder, Slager could face up to life in prison or death. The city of North Charleston will continue to cover the insurance for the pregnancy of Slager's wife, the mayor said. An autopsy on Scott, performed Sunday, ""revealed that Mr. Scott sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body and the manner of death was ruled 'Homicide,' "" Charleston County Coroner Rae H. Wooten said Wednesday. Anthony Scott said Wednesday that his brother was ""shot in the back four times."" The autopsy findings support family's claims that the police used excessive use -- even if the video never existed, Anthony Scott said. ""Eventually we would have gotten to this point, but not this fast,"" Anthony Scott said. ""There is absolutely no way to cover that up,"" he added about the gunshot wounds to the back. North Charleston police aren't involved in the investigation into the shooting and have turned the matter over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The FBI is also investigating. Anthony Scott and family attorney Stewart believe the object that Officer Slager relocated at the crime scene is the Taser, they said. Stewart also accused the officer of trying to plant evidence by moving the Taser and placing it close to Walter Scott's body. A slow-motion analysis of the tape, along with highlights of key moments, supports the family's step-by-step interpretation of the officer's actions, including the handling of the Taser, the attorney alleged. ""He drops the Taser, kills Mr. Scott, walks all the way back, picks something up off the ground from where he was taking the shots, comes back to the body, waits a second, drops it on the ground, and then pretends to be recovering it and putting it back on his holster,"" Stewart said, referring to the Taser. ""Why we believe that is because it fits in line with his initial report of what happened out there. I mean he just committed a murder. He needed something, a justifiable reason to use lethal force, and that's the only thing he could think of,"" Stewart said. Neither Officer Slager or his attorney could be reached for comment Wednesday. Authorities aren't commenting on the details of the case while it's under investigation. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Holly Yan, Ryan Scallan, Tristan Smith, Martin Savidge, Dana Ford, Sam Stringer, Randi Kaye, Chandler Friedman, Evan Perez, Don Lemon, Steve Brusk, John Newsome, Tony Marco and Christie Bear contributed to this report.","Victim's brother says he felt ""anger and happy at the same time"" upon seeing video .

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)Change has come to Ferguson. After months of turmoil and upheaval, months of frustration and anger, the beleaguered city has a new governing board. And it looks very different than the old one. Buoyed by a higher-than-normal 30% turnout, two African-American candidates won their wards Tuesday night to make the six-member City Council 50% black. Ferguson's population of about 21,000 is 70% black, but the City Council was predominantly white, as is the police force. Supporters of both candidates said that from the tragedy of a young black man's death, a new day dawned in Ferguson. Ella Jones screamed when her victory became official late Tuesday night. She won 49.76% of the vote. ""Thank you, Ward 1. I love you,"" an emotional Jones said at a party held at Drake's restaurant. She will become the first black woman ever to sit on the Ferguson council. But both Jones and Wesley Bell, who won the Ward 3 seat with nearly 67% of the vote, said they did not see their victories from a racial perspective. Jones, who resigned her job as a Mary Kay cosmetics sales director to run for office, said in her ward, she heard the same complaints from a 65-year-old black man as she did from his white peers. ""My job is to be that catalyst so we can put a new face on Ferguson,"" she said. Bell, a lawyer and criminal justice professor, said, ""I'm more interested in having quality on the council,"" when asked about the change in its racial makeup. He had made community policing his No. 1 priority and said he intends to be deeply involved with the hiring of a new police chief in this St. Louis suburb. The former chief, Tommy Jackson, resigned after a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report found systemic discrimination against African-Americans in law enforcement and the municipal court. Bell said he wants Ferguson's police officers to be judged by the number of people they know in the community, not by the number of tickets they issue. One other seat was up for grabs in Ferguson. That was won by Brian Fletcher, a former mayor who launched the ""I Love Ferguson"" campaign to raise money for mom-and-pop businesses that were hurt by the violence and vandalism during the protests last fall. Fletcher beat his opponent, Bob Hudgins, with 56.7% of the vote. Fletcher told voters he was best suited for a City Council job despite his critics' claims that he was too entrenched in the old guard. ""I understand that feeling, but those individuals don't know me,"" he said. Fletcher said he had contacts with elected officials from his almost three decades in politics. That would be an invaluable asset in getting Ferguson back on its feet, he said. The city is required to approve a new budget by the end of June, and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines. ""That amount will drop significantly,"" Fletcher said. Earlier in the day, the skies grew dark and the radio crackled with warnings of flash floods. Amid the rain, Ferguson opened its polls at 6 in the morning with concern that few would come out to vote in such a pivotal election. But Tuesday was different. It was the first city election since white police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August. There was dread, especially in the African-American community, that if the turnout was low, then all the protests, investigations and calls for change would have been in vain. The candidates who had run campaigns calling for change hoped a decent turnout would weigh in their favor. ""That is what our democracy about,"" Bell said. Bell ran against Lee Smith, a retired electrical plant employee, in Ward 3, which includes Canfield Drive, where Brown was killed, and the West Florissant Avenue business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism. Charred, heavily damaged buildings still stand as scars of Ferguson's despair and anger. ""You got your vote on?"" yelled Tommy Chatman Bey, a Bell supporter who was distributing campaign literature at Koch Elementary School, the precinct closest to where Brown lived. Some residents did have their vote on. They felt a duty to vote this year. One of them was Yvette Bailey, 41, who works as a planner for Coca-Cola. Yes, she voted in presidential elections, but she never paid much mind to local races. Until now. Even though she was aware of the problems around her, Brown's killing, she said, woke her up. ""It made me think of all the males in my family,"" said Bailey, who lives right off Canfield Drive. She was undecided about who to vote for until the last minute when she walked into the polling station with another voter and they discussed the race. Bailey decided to cast her vote for Bell simply because he was a young man. She thought he had energy and was more in sync with Ferguson's youth. ""I think he will be more open-minded,"" she said after voting. Changing the way Ferguson polices its people was No. 1 on many a voter's agenda. Even the candidates who take issue with the Department of Justice report on Ferguson agreed that the city needed change when it came to policing. ""We have to get out of this law enforcement for business,"" said candidate Doyle McClellan, coordinator of the computer network security program at Lewis and Clark Community College. McClellan referred to the DOJ's finding that Ferguson issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city. ""That's not a good thing,"" McClellan said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station, hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided. Ted Heidemann, a 67-year-old retired airline pilot, said he voted for Fletcher. If some residents saw Fletcher as part of the problem, Heidemann asked why no one complained when Fletcher was mayor. He said Brown's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light. ""We didn't realize the effect some of the institutional problems had on poor people,"" he said. ""Some things need to be changed, and we are aware of that."" By midafternoon, Fletcher said the numbers were looking good. At a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots, Fletcher predicted a 40%-50% turnout. When the rain let up for a few minutes, a stream of voters trickled into the First Presbyterian Church in downtown Ferguson to cast their votes. Ellory and Kathy Glenn both voted for Fletcher's opponent, Hudgins, a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines. Hudgins likes to talk about how he married a black woman and has a biracial teenage son. ""I wanted change,"" said Ellory Glenn, 60, who is black. His wife is white. He said the couple moved to Ferguson after he retired from the Marine Corps in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place. But now, after all the problems rose to the surface, it's time for fresh blood on the council, Glenn said. ""Quit using law enforcement as a revenue stream,"" Glenn said. ""That's like using the military to go into places and looting them. The police are supposed to keep order."" Angela Jackson came to vote with her husband and two little girls in tow. She voted for Jones, the former Mary Kay cosmetics sales director. Jackson echoed the thoughts of other Ferguson residents who experienced something new in this election: candidates coming to their door. Past elections have not seen the kind of canvassing activity that took place in the last few weeks. Nor have past municipal elections drawn so much media attention. ""One thing we really liked is (Jones) came to our door and talked to us about her desire to make change in our neighborhood,"" Jackson said. ""She's going to be hands on. She lives in the neighborhood as well and has for the past 36 years. We were kind of taken by that."" The rain began to fall again as the Glenns got in their car. It was expected to continue off and on through the day and night. But at about 5, just when many voters were leaving work, the sun shone brilliantly. Overheard at one precinct: Good weather brought out the worst in Ferguson last August. Maybe today, it would bring out the best.","For the first time ever, Ferguson's City Council will be half black .
The two winning black candidates vowed to bring reform .
The election was a critical test in this beleaguered city ."
"(CNN)Thousands of Palestinians are trapped in the devastated Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria, which has mostly been seized by groups including ISIS, activists report. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front took control of 90% of the camp in southern Damascus. Calling the lives of Yarmouk refugees ""profoundly threatened"" on Sunday, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency issued a statement urging humanitarian aid access.  ""Never has the hour been more desperate in the Palestine refugee camp of Yarmouk,"" the statement said. The UNRWA estimates 18,000 civilians remain trapped in the camp that has been engulfed in fighting between the government and rebel forces since December 2012. Syria's state-run SANA news agency reports up to 2,000 people have fled in the past two days as food, water and medical supplies remain scarce. ""All people are trying to leave the camp,"" says Syrian activist Abu Mohammed in Damascus who used to live in Yarmouk. ""There is no electricity,"" says Mohammed. ""ISIS controls the hospital so injured people have nowhere to go."" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports barrel bombs were dropped on the camp Sunday as clashes continued. The Palestine Liberation Organization called on international bodies to assist in the evacuation of people from the camp. ""Reports of kidnappings, beheadings and mass killings are coming out from Al- Yarmouk, which is under a brutal campaign of murder and occupation,"" Palestine Liberation Organization Executive Committee Member Dr. Saeb Erekat said Saturday. Yarmouk, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, was formed in 1957 to accommodate people fleeing the Arab-Israeli conflict. ""The levels of humanity that we have seen have now descended into further levels of inhumanity,"" said Chris Gunness, spokesman for the UNRWA.

"(CNN)Sabra Dipping Co. is recalling 30,000 cases of hummus due to possible contamination with Listeria, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. The nationwide recall is voluntary. So far, no illnesses caused by the hummus have been reported. The potential for contamination was discovered when a routine, random sample collected at a Michigan store on March 30 tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. The FDA issued a list of the products in the recall. Anyone who has purchased any of the items is urged to dispose of or return it to the store for a full refund. Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, the FDA says. Although some people may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.","A random sample from a Michigan store tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes .

"(CNN)The world learned his name after he was killed by a South Carolina police officer. But in his life, 50-year-old Walter Scott was also the father of four children and served in the Coast Guard before being honorably discharged. ""He was outgoing -- loved everybody, (was) very known in the community and got along with everybody,"" his brother Anthony Scott told CNN's Don Lemon. ""All the family loves him, and his kids loved him."" Until it all came crashing down Saturday morning, when North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over, reportedly for a faulty brake light. Dash cam video released Thursday shows the two talking, then shows Scott get out of his car and run. Why did he run? Justin Bamberg, a lawyer for Scott's family, speculated Thursday it could have been related to ""child support and a fear of maybe going back to (jail)."" At the time of his death, Scott owed over $18,000 in back payments for two children and hadn't made a payment since July 2012, according to Charleston County family court documents. Another family lawyer, Chris Stewart, acknowledged that Scott had been arrested previously for outstanding warrants for not paying child support, but Stewart said that had been Scott's lone issue with the law for the past 20 years. ""I know that it had nothing to do with anything violent,"" Bamberg said of Scott's legal history. ""He was not a dangerous person."" According to a police report, Scott did not comply with an officer's demands and tried to grab Slager's stun gun. Slager fired eight shots, five of which struck Scott. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Regardless of why Walter Scott ran, ""running from an officer doesn't result in the death penalty,"" Stewart said. Slager has been charged with murder, a charge that might not have come about if not for a bystander's video of the shooting. Anthony Scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead, footage that has traumatized the family. ""When I saw that video for the first time, my family was deeply hurt that someone would gun down a human being in that way,"" the brother said. ""We just couldn't believe it."" The last time the family got together with Walter Scott was when the siblings threw a surprise wedding anniversary party for their parents. ""It was a great celebration,"" Anthony Scott said. ""My dad and brothers planned it, and (my mother) was totally surprised. ""Now this happens,"" Scott said, referring to his brother's shooting. ""It's so tragic.""

"(CNN)Lane Bryant has come up with a devil of an idea to market its lingerie while poking fun at a competitor. The plus-size clothing retailer has launched an ad campaign for its Cacique line titled #ImNoAngel, seeking to ""redefine sexy."" In a commercial posted on You Tube, a group of plus-size models show off the bras and panties while saying things like ""How boring would it be if we were all the same?"" and ""It's all about how you feel."" The campaign is a not-so-subtle dig at Victoria's Secret and its very popular Angels line, which caters to smaller women. The lingerie giant was criticized last year for a campaign featuring the words ""Perfect Body"" over images of slender supermodels, and Business Insider reports that it is under increasing pressure from consumers to offer larger sizes. Lane Bryant's campaign is getting positive buzz in social media land, with the company being hailed for celebrating beauty of all shapes and sizes.

"(CNN)It was all set for a fairytale ending for record breaking jockey AP McCoy. In the end it was a different but familiar name who won the Grand National on Saturday. 25-1 outsider Many Clouds, who had shown little form going into the race, won by a length and a half, ridden by jockey Leighton Aspell. Aspell won last year's Grand National too, making him the first jockey since the 1950s to ride back-to-back winners on different horses. ""It feels wonderful, I asked big questions,"" Aspell said of Many Clouds, moments after his victory. ""Over the fences he was awesome. I was just hoping his batteries would last and they did,"" he added. No fairytale . Yet for much of the Grand National -- arguably the world's most famous and certainly the sport's most prestigious jump race -- it looked as if AP McCoy was about to write an ending befitting the career of a man who has dominated jump racing for two decades. His horse Shutthefrontdoor was in the leading group as it negotiated the likes for Becher's Brooke and The Chair, some of the toughest jumps in racing. Last week the 40-year-old Ulsterman, who has won an astonishing 4,356 races, announced he would retire if he won the Grand National for the second time in his career. Shutthefrontdoor was heavily backed by the betting public sensing a storybook conclusion to McCoy's career. UK and Irish betting firms even predicted they would lose as much as $73 million if McCoy won. He was well placed going into the final straight but just couldn't keep up after Many Clouds cut lose, and finished back in fifth. Third time winner . But for Trevor Hemmings, the owner of Many Clouds, it was his third victory in the Grand National. ""I always dreamed of winning my first National,"" a shocked Hemmings told Channel 4. ""Then along comes a second. That's special. And when a third comes along, it's such a wonderful, wonderful feeling."" Hemming went on to praise Aspell's performance. ""This morning talking we talked about the achievers,"" said Hemmings. ""They are quiet, confident and experienced. He has all of them."" McCoy's fifth placed finish means he will race again at least once more, in two weeks time at Sandown.","25-1 shot Many Clouds wins Grand National .

"Seoul (CNN)In the first few days after the Sewol disappeared beneath the Yellow Sea, divers pulled body after body from the watery wreckage, bringing the dead home. And throughout the following days, weeks and months, Park Eun-mi waited to see if one of them was her 16-year-old daughter, Huh Da-yun. The divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions, and the South Korean ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor. The Sewol sank on April 16, killing 304 people, mostly high school students who were on their way to a field trip to Jeju island, off South Korea's southern coast. ""We kept waiting with belief in finding our daughter. I thought once, 'Somebody will be the last person and what if it's Da-yun?'"" Park said. A year later, Park's life remains at a standstill. Nine have yet to be found. ""We, the families of the missing victims, are still living the day --  April 16, 2014,"" said Park, who is in poor health, but refusing treatment. ""I cannot think about anything except to find my daughter and other missing people."" Park's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the Sewol ferry sank. Dozens associated with the ferry disaster have been sent to jail on criminal charges. But families say the underlying problems that led to the sinking of the Sewol are far from resolved. On April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn. Passengers were told repeatedly by the crew members to stay where they were as rescuers would arrive soon. Many of them listened to the instructions and remained in place. As the ferry tilted sideways, water seeped in and objects in the ship toppled over, injuring people and blocking their way out. Anger over how the crew failed to evacuate the passengers intensified when video surfaced of the ferry's captain in his underwear leaping into the arms of the Korean Coast Guard while hundreds remained trapped in the vessel. Divers had to pluck the bodies from the water one-by-one, bringing the youngsters back to land in black body bags where they were met with the gut-wrenching cries of their families. On Thursday, the one year anniversary of the disaster, South Korea's President Park Geun-hye called for the salvage of the Sewol's wreck ""as soon as possible."" ""Recently, there was an announcement that it is technically possible to salvage Sewol ferry. I believe that it is now time to earnestly prepare to salvage,"" she said. A government study on raising the ferry released last week identified a crane and floating dock as the safest way to look for the missing. The Sewol ferry is over 20 years old and there are fears it could fall apart during the extraction, according to the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. The agency anticipates a complicated technical operation to remove the ferry, which would weigh about 10,200 tons above water. The process could take over a year and a half, and that it would cost the South Korean government anywhere from $91 million to $182 million. The victims' families have demanded that the ship be recovered in order to thoroughly investigate the accident. Since the days immediately after the disaster, families have criticized the government over its response. Communication over the rescue efforts were jumbled, paving way for rumors and hoaxes. Criticism swirled over the South Korean Coast Guard's effectiveness in carrying out the rescue operation. The captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the Sewol passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports. The recovery efforts have also taken a deadly toll with a total of six deaths -- a diver searching the Sewol died in May, and in July, five people died after a helicopter carrying emergency workers involved in the operation crashed. Park, the South Korean president, pledged major reforms, dismantled the coast guard and vowed an investigation into what went wrong. That promised investigation has been hampered by politics and disagreements between the families and the government over who should participate in the investigation. Earlier this month, several dozens of family members marched to Seoul from Ansan, the suburb where most of the students had resided. Some of the families shaved their heads to demand political action. Several laws have been passed to inspect cargo weight and increase oversight in the industry. In the case of Sewol, the ferry was found to be loaded with double its capacity. Its cargo wasn't secured properly, which threw the ship off balance as the containers tumbled and knocked the vessel off balance. An inexperienced crew and redesigns of the ship to handle more passengers and cargo were also cited as factors in the disaster. The sinking spurred a debate about the shortcomings of the government and what preventive measures should have been taken. ""The tragedy of Sewol was also virtually caused by accumulation of corruption, irregularity and going blind eyes,"" Park said on Thursday. ""Corruption and deep-rooted evil are issues that can lead to taking away people's lives. We take this very seriously."" In the immediate aftermath, South Korean prosecutors arrested the captain, crew members and business associates. Sewol's captain, Lee Joon-seok, who was widely derided for jumping to safety, was sentenced to 36 years in prison for abandonment causing death and injury, and violating sea laws. In July, the body of a billionaire Yoo Byung Eun, who was believed to have connections to the company that owned the ferry, was found decomposing in a plum field. But some families say that wider, systematic problems that allowed the disaster to occur haven't been addressed.  Whether the ferry will be raised and an independent investigation will be held remains to be seen. CNN's KJ Kwon and journalist Jungeun Kim contributed to this report in Seoul.","Sewol ferry sank a year ago off the coast of South Korea, killing 304 people .

"Garissa, Kenya (CNN)The sign painted onto the school entrance wall reads: ""Youth is a mistake, adulthood is a struggle, old age is a regret."" The black humor of the message provides some light relief for a school that lives in constant fear of a terrorist attack because of what is taught inside its walls. The students (aged 8 to 14) at the Ibnu-Siina school in northern Kenya are getting a so-called ""Western"" education, taking lessons in subjects like mathematics, science and English. But it's an education that Al-Shabaab -- the Somali-based terror group -- is trying to prevent the children from obtaining, according to the head of the school. ""These men, Al-Shabaab, want to make sure everything goes negative,"" headmaster James Ndonye told CNN. ""They want to make sure they terrify the teachers so they go to their homes -- so the kids in this area don't get what they deserve."" Al-Shabaab militants have launched a series of deadly attacks over the last few years in the region mostly targeting Christians. Many of the math and science teachers in this area are Christian. In early April, Al-Shabaab brutally massacred 147 people at Garissa University in northern Kenya. It was the group's deadliest attack to date. The gunmen would have driven down the road past the Ibnu-Siina school -- and its single unarmed guard -- to get to the university, only a few hundred meters away. Kenyan teachers and students alike are terrified. ""The University College of Garissa was the only and first university college in northern Kenya. We were happy when we got it a few years ago,"" explained Garissa Regional Governor Nadif Jama. ""Today it has been closed. That is Al-Shabaab's mission,"" Jama said. ""That is what they want. And that is nothing but destroying the fabric of our being a civilized society."" And it's not just in Kenya. Terrorist groups across the Sahel region are waging war on schools, teachers and students. In northeast Nigeria, the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has been waging war against the government -- and the civilian population -- for several years. Most notoriously, perhaps, was Boko Haram's kidnapping of around 270 girls from a boarding school in Chibok, Borno state, last April. But the group has also carried out numerous other attacks on schools, slaughtering young boys and girls as they sleep in their dormitories. Last year in Garissa, James Ndonye lost five of his 11 teachers amid rising fears of an Al-Shabaab attack on the school. He replaced them, but it wasn't easy. Yet despite the ever-present threat of terror, Ndonye has stayed to help the children. ""I risk my life because -- for this class, there's a target we have for last year ... and I love that class very much,"" Ndonye said.

"Washington (CNN)A shooting that prompted the lockdown of the U.S. Capitol for several hours Saturday was a suicide and does not have an apparent connection to terrorism, Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said in a news conference. An unidentified male walked through a public area on the west front of the Capitol early Saturday afternoon and shot himself, Dine told reporters. Witnesses told CNN dozens of shocked onlookers watched, including some young children. The unidentified shooter had a backpack and a rolling suitcase that authorities treated as treated suspicious packages, prompting the lockdown as they were investigated, Capitol police said. The male carried a sign with a message about ""social justice,"" authorities said. A witness, Robert Bishop, told CNN it also said something about taxing the ""1%."" Dine said there was ""no nexus to terrorism"" apparent so far in this incident. The building and the nearby Capitol Visitors Center were locked down, meaning tourists or any staff could not enter or leave the buildings. The Capitol area was crowded with tourists taking in the Cherry Blossom trees, which are in full bloom along the National Mall. Members of the Capitol police force, which responded to the scene, did not fire their weapons, Dine said. After the suspicious packages were examined, the lockdown was lifted about 3:50 p.m. ET and pedestrian traffic was allowed. Responding to the incident were the Metropolitan Police Department, which is investigating the death, as well as the FBI, Secret Service and Park Police. Many tourists at the scene were filming at the time and showed their photos and video to investigating law enforcement officers. CNN's Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Capitol police said a male shot himself as shocked onlookers watched .

"Marietta, Georgia  (CNN)The little-known star of this week's No. 1 car chase movie, ""Furious 7"" isn't a car. It's an airplane. Film producers hired a Lockheed C-130 Hercules to fly five cars 12,000 feet high, open a cargo door at the rear of the plane and parachute them out in a spectacular free-fall stunt. Geronimo! Happy 60th birthday to the Hercules -- the oldest continuously produced family of military planes in history. Lockheed has been making these airplanes longer than the legendary B-52 bomber and the famous U2 spy jet. Unlike those planes, the C-130 has never become a household name. The fact that ""Furious 7"" producers chose a plane that was designed in the 1950s tells you a little something about the success of the Hercules. The film makes it appear as if another plane -- a C-17 Globemaster III -- drops the cars. But in real life, it took a Hercules to pull it off. Shooting the scene posed unique logistical challenges, said stunt coordinator Jack Gill in a featurette video about the mission. ""You start throwing all those cars out together -- you've got to figure out spacing. And these things drop very fast,"" Gill said. Jeremiah Beaudin of International Air Response co-piloted the stunt. ""We have to be very precise in our headings and our altitudes,"" he says in the video. The Hercules is big. It's tough. It's versatile. It refuels helicopters in flight. It can fly a small military force and its heavy equipment around the world -- and land on short, unfinished airstrips. At Lockheed's Marietta, Georgia, factory in 1955, the governor of Georgia christened the first production C-130A by smashing a bottle of Chattahoochee River water across its nose. The plane then proceeded to take off from nearby Dobbins Air Force Base. On Tuesday, exactly 60 years later, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal recreated the ceremony -- christening a brand new Super Hercules during a birthday party of sorts for Lockheed executives and military dignitaries. ""I'm told that the 2,500th version of this aircraft is now on the (assembly) line inside this building,"" Deal said. ""It transports, it becomes a war airplane as necessary and it is recognized as the true workhorse."" Inside the plane's cockpit, Lockheed test pilot Steve Knoblock said he's done a lot of air-drop testing while flying C-130s. ""We've dropped some crazy things out,"" Knoblock said. ""Air dropping a car out of an airplane is easy. Whatever we can fit inside the (cargo) hold, we can drop."" Several factors come into play for a pilot making a drop, Knoblock said, including payload weight, wind speed and timing. ""We have to give time for the car to clear the airplane, let the parachutes deploy, and then actually open,"" he said. One tricky decision involves how high the plane drops its cargo. ""There's a trade off -- between dropping it low and being more accurate ... and dropping it high where you have a little more safety in how it will land."" Knoblock also explained how the C-130's robust landing gear helps the plane survive difficult landing conditions. ""The pilot gets to decide how hard the touchdown's going to be,"" he said. ""Sometimes to get his performance, he needs to really let it crunch on the ground. But the airplane can handle it."" Meanwhile, in the back of the plane, Lockheed loadmaster Lucky Madsen showed off the plane's new reversible deck, which makes it easier to switch the floor from a flat surface ... to a floor with rollers embedded in it. The rollers make it easier to move cargo around and launch it out the back of the airplane. The legacy surrounding the Hercules has been built by 60 years of successful missions, including: . In 1989, a flight crew aboard a Hercules named Teal 57 was credited with saving the crew of a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hurricane hunter airplane. While flying through Hurricane Hugo, the NOAA plane lost an engine and suffered damage to a second engine. Teal 57 happened to be nearby and located a safe place for the NOAA plane to escape the eye of the deadly Category 5 storm. Everyone returned safely to base. In 2012, Israeli Brig. Gen. Joshua Shani revealed how he flew a Hercules on a successful hostage rescue mission to Entebbe, Uganda. Four C-130s helped rescue passengers from a hijacked Air France flight in 1976. ""At some places that were particularly dangerous, we flew at an altitude of 35 feet,"" to evade radar. ""Trust me, this is scary!"" he told idfblog.com. During the military build up to 2003's U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a Hercules test dropped the biggest conventional weapon in the Pentagon's arsenal -- a so-called MOAB -- known in military circles as ""the mother of all bombs."" A C-130 ejected the 21,000-pound bomb out its rear cargo door high above Florida's Eglin Air Force Base. The bomb fell to earth and detonated in a spectacular fire ball. In the past, the Air Force attached small solid-fuel rocket engines to some C-130s. The added power allowed steep takeoffs on super short runways. The Hercules wasn't designed to land on aircraft carriers. They're too short. Nonetheless, a Hercules did it -- during a test in 1963. That's how amazing this plane is. But nothing lasts forever, and the C-130 is no different. The Air Force has been developing a so-called ""super short takeoff and landing aircraft"" that might replace the Hercules after 2020. The Air Force Research Laboratory calls it Speed Agile. The proposed four-engine aircraft would be able to transport super heavy loads across oceans and to arrive and depart on short, improvised airfields. Pentagon planners apparently are hoping to create a Hercules-inspired success story that will extend into the latter half of the 21st century.","The type of plane used for a jaw-dropping stunt in ""Furious 7"" is 60 years old .

"(CNN)This article contains language that may be offensive to some. Since the news broke last weekend that Hillary Clinton had declared her candidacy, notable among the blitz of news stories are the many that refer to her as the mononymous ""Hillary,"" as if she were a pop star in a pantsuit. The New York Post published an item titled ""Lena Dunham backs Hillary for President"" while gossip site TMZ refers to the former FLOTUS, U.S. senator, and secretary of state on a first-name basis throughout its news story on the announcement. Even The New Republic posted a piece about the run called ""There's Nothing Inevitable about Hillary."" She's famous enough by now to go by one name, but should she? While Clinton is arguably more widely known than any of her to-date opponents, she's also a former U.S. senator and secretary of state. She's not Beyoncé. And yet, despite her decorated career in government, we've long called Clinton by her first name, and her first name only, in a way we don't do with men who have held similar, or even vaguely similar, positions of power. According to a University of Utah study, Clinton was called by her first name four times more than her 2008 rival, Barack Obama, and so it goes this time around. After all, Rand's also running for president. So is Marco. When those guys declared, however, they got headlines that included their last names. There's a very good reason for that. Presidential candidates are not just professionals, but professionals declaring their candidacy for a position that many consider to be the most powerful in the world. A position that not only deserves formality and respect, but within a global context seems to require it. Being president of the United States is a serious job. Are there ""Ted for President"" signs in our future? Unlikely. Were we encouraged to ""Vote for Mitt""? Nope. The U.S. Army, meanwhile, is one of the most regimented organizations in the world, whose values put dignity and respect at top priority. Cadets don't call their commanding officers by their first names, even -- maybe especially -- if they're women. So why are we all referring to the possible next commander-in-chief as if we're part of her circle of close pals? Before you point to the fact that Clinton is not the first Clinton to cross this particular political threshold, the issue at hand is not one of practicality: The American public is smart enough to distinguish between this Clinton and that Clinton. George W. Bush wasn't the first in his family to run for office, and when he did, legitimate newspapers didn't go around noting the ""W"" (or even ""Dubya"") was up for the job. He was just Bush, as he should have been, just as Clinton is just Clinton, a woman who has done a very good job distinguishing herself from her husband without the need to be referred to by her first name in order to avoid a case of mistaken identity. Of course, the mononymity doesn't seem to be unwelcome: Sections of Clinton's website invite readers to ""Like Hillary on Facebook"" and read about ""Hillary's Story,"" while the campaign's official hashtag appears to be #Hillary2016. Her campaign chairman reportedly emailed potential campaign donors yesterday with the missive that ""It's official: Hillary's running for President."" Perhaps Clinton and her advisers believe the single name makes her more personable, and familiar. Maybe it's an effort to distance Clinton from the other gender-based stereotype slapped on her the last time around, when she was ""the bitch"" to Sarah Palin's ""ditz."" But while we should like our president -- if not desire to have her as a personal friend -- it's far more important to trust, and respect, her -- and that still requires a level of formality. It's important for the American public to be able to imagine electing a leader not despite the fact that she's a woman, or even because she's a woman, but who, very simply, happens to be a woman. Whether she endorses the idea or not, calling Clinton by her first name serves to, at best, reinforce gender and workplace stereotypes -- that women need to be ""approachable,"" not abrasive or aloof, in order to get the job done and be liked while doing it -- and at worst, infantilize and put her in her place. There's a reason, after all, that we address current and former presidents as Mr. President when we meet them, and not ""Hey, Jimmy!"" And if there's a reason Hillary Clinton will be elected as our next president, it's not because she let us call her Hillary.","Peggy Drexler:  Media, even candidate herself call Clinton just 'Hillary.'  This reinforces stereotypes about women needing to be approachable .
She says especially  in global context,  trust, respect important for the potential leader of free world, not familiarity. Just 'Hillary' not appropriate ."

"Washington (CNN)One former employee of the private Blackwater Worldwide security company was sentenced Monday to life in prison and three others to 30 years each behind bars for their roles in a 2007 mass shooting in Baghdad that left 17 people dead. A federal jury convicted the four in October after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against the security contractors. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashed ""powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children."" Senior U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackwater sniper Nicholas Slatten to a term of life in prison, mandatory for his first-degree murder conviction. Blackwater workers Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were sentenced to 30 year each, plus one day. Slough was convicted of 13 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 17 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. The jury convicted Liberty of eight counts of voluntary manslaughter, 12 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. Heard was found guilty of six counts of voluntary manslaughter, 11 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots. Survivors of shooting tell FBI their stories in 2007 . Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation. ""It was horror,"" said Hasan Jaber, an attorney who was driving to work when he was shot three times. ""People running out of their cars were being shot at. ... Anything that moved in Nusoor Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone."" Among the dead were two boys, 9 and 11, a doctor, a used car salesman, a truck driver, a businessman, an Iraqi soldier, a gardener, a taxi driver and an aspiring doctor taking his mother to an appointment, according to prosecutors. The parents and brothers of the 9-year-old victim were present in court during the sentencing hearing and spoke. Ali Razzaq's father looked at the defendants and yelled in broken English: ""If I kill anyone in his family, what he do?! Today, we will see who will win, the law or Blackwater,"" he said. ""Blackwater killed my son."" Dad in 2007: Blackwater blew up son's and wife's 'skulls' The defense presented character witnesses, family members and former colleagues who testified to the defendants' capacity to work under fire and willingness to help others. Each defendant also gave a closing statement. Slatten addressed the court last, taking the opportunity to declare his innocence. Lamberth rejected his argument. The judge said that the punishments reflected the seriousness of the crimes. He said that the U.S. government ""should be commended for finding and exposing the truth of what happened."" Blackwater incident witness in 2007: 'It was hell' A few gasps were heard in the courtroom, and some crying. The case was initially dismissed in 2008 after a judge found the Justice Department withheld key evidence and violated the rights of the contractors. A federal appeals court reversed the ruling, paving the way for the two-month trial that ended in convictions for the four. Another contractor, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter and testified for the government. He has not yet been sentenced. Blackwater lost its $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company's operating license. The company was later renamed and sold, and now operates as ACADEMI, providing protection services and training. 2007 congressional report: Blackwater most often shoots first .

"(CNN)A grand jury in Dallas County, Texas, has decided not to indict two officers in the fatal shooting of Jason Harrison, a schizophrenic man whose mother had called police for help getting him to the hospital. ""This particular case was reported out as a 'no bill,' from the grand jury,"" said Cristal Retana, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County District Attorney's Office. The grand jury's decision not to indict means Officers John Rogers and Andrew Hutchins won't face criminal prosecution in the case. But the officers are still facing a wrongful death lawsuit from Harrison's family. The incident occurred in June, and Harrison's family filed a lawsuit in November. The release of video from one of the officer's body cameras put the shooting back in the headlines last month. In it, Harrison's mother answers the door for police and nonchalantly walks outside. ""Oh, he's just off the chain,"" she says. ""You can hear him, talking about chopping up people."" It was a fairly routine occurrence for her to call the police for assistance with her son. An officer asks who she's talking about, and she replies, ""My son, bipolar, schizo,"" as Jason Harrison appears in the doorway behind her. He is twiddling a screwdriver between his fingers. One of the two officers called to the scene tells Harrison to drop the tool, a command the officers repeat at least four times as Harrison's mom screams, ""Jay! Jay! Jay!"" Within five seconds of that first command, the 39-year-old schizophrenic man is shot five times -- including twice in the back as he crashes headlong into the home's garage door, just a few feet from his mother. Video from one officer's body camera fades to black as Harrison's mother wails, ""Oh, they killed my son! Oh, they killed my son!"" The officers continue to tell Harrison to drop the weapon. The Harrison family's lawsuit against Rogers and Hutchins says they should have used nonlethal means of defusing the situation instead of choosing to engage ""in unlawful vicious attacks"" when they and the department were aware of Harrison's condition. The suit also claims the officers violated Harrison's civil rights. The officers, however, said in affidavits that they were forced to shoot an armed man who they deemed dangerous after he failed to comply with repeated orders to drop a screwdriver.

"(CNN)The Red Cross on Saturday called for an immediate 24-hour ceasefire in battle-torn Yemen, saying many more people recently wounded in airstrikes and ground fighting will die if not tended to soon. The call came just before the U.N. Security Council met late Saturday morning to discuss the situation in the Arabian Peninsula nation, where Shiite rebels are pitted against external Arab air forces and fighters loyal to Yemen's displaced Sunni president. A pause was needed especially in and near the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, where intense fighting has happened in the past two weeks, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Food, water, medical items and personnel need to get into these areas, the group said. ""Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days,"" Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East, said. Another Red Cross official said people are running out of food, water and fuel. ""Medical supplies need to be here yesterday. The situation is difficult,""said Marie-Claire Feghali, a spokeswoman for the ICRC who is in the capital, Sanaa. ""We need to save the lives that can be saved."" Meanwhile, residents of Sanaa, witnessed the fiercest Saudi strikes since the air assault started last week. Military facilities, including two bases, within the city limits have been targeted, three senior security officials in Sanaa said. At the Security Council, Russia submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes that a nine-country regional coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, has been conducting against the rebels in Yemen for more than a week. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. One diplomat said the draft was missing what the envoy called key elements. It doesn't call for the Houthis to stop fighting, and it does not call for political talks between the belligerents, the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen's northern neighbor, and other Arab nations to hit the rebels in Yemen with airstrikes. A Saudi source told CNN that special forces supplied weapons and communication equipment to Yemeni fighters in Aden loyal to Hadi. The Houthis were retreating from areas in the center of the city, including the presidential palace there, the source said. Saudi special forces help oppose Houthi rebels in Yemen, source says . The United Nations said Thursday that at least 519 people have been killed in Yemen in the past two weeks. An additional 1,700 have been wounded. Tens of thousands have fled to nearby Somalia and Djibouti. In Aden alone, fighting has killed 58 people and injured 200 more in the past two days, Yemeni security officials said. At least 24 of the dead were Houthis. Complicating matters in Yemen is that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or Hadi-loyal forces -- holds sway in the country's east. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization. Also late this week, photos circulating on social media purported to show senior al Qaeda leader Khaled Batarfi  -- whom Yemeni defense officials said militants busted out of jail on Thursday -- posing in a presidential residence in southern Yemen. Sunni Islamist fighters freed Batarfi with some 270 prisoners when they overran the town of al Mukallah. On Saturday, the French military evacuated 44 people, including some French nationals, from the eastern Yemeni port city of Balhaf. CNN's Don Melvin, Trey Haney, David Shortell and Richard Roth contributed to this report.","Saudi Arabia airstrikes on the capital increase as jets hit military facilities in Sanaa .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)As soon as the buses parked, the people scrambled onto the airport tarmac. They carried duffel bags, plastic bags full of clothes and small suitcases. They'd already abandoned larger bags in a mound. Only carry-on luggage was allowed on this Air India plane. The passengers were mostly Indian nationals, plus Yemenis and people from other countries who had been working in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. They sprinted or walked with deliberation to the airplanes. The stress of living in a war zone showed on the passengers' faces. Nobody wanted to be left behind. They climbed the steps to the airliner and were greeted by the Air India crew, all wearing pressed uniforms, the flight attendants fully made up. After takeoff, the flight attendants went up and down the aisle offering drinks to the 188 evacuees as if they were on a vacation flight. But some passengers were already fast asleep, exhausted by the push to get out of Yemen, site of some of the most chaotic fighting in the Mideast. This scene has been repeated in recent days as countries work to get their citizens out of Sanaa during a small window when Saudi planes are not bombing the city in an attempt to drive out the Houthis, a Shiite group that has taken over the capital. Air India is especially active because so many Indian nationals work in other nations. Over the last few days, India has evacuated some 2,500 people from Yemen, said Gen. Vijay Kumar Singh, the Indian deputy foreign minister who's overseeing the evacuation. The flights are going to Djibouti, the small African nation nearly 430 kilometers (267 miles) away. Some evacuees are fleeing on boats at port cities such as Aden. People are leaving behind much more than luggage. Damodar Thakur, a professor at Sanaa University, lived in the capital 34 years and built a life there. He loved living in Yemen. ""I never felt like a foreigner,"" he said. Like the others, he was exhausted and jangled by the shelling and lack of electricity for long stretches. ""At night, my goodness!"" he said. ""Gunshots being fired every minute. Sometimes the sky full of sparkling lights. Some women crying, children terrified. Really bad."" The Houthi rebels control Sanaa, including the airport. But the Saudis are bombing the city and thus control air access in a way, so getting people out requires coordination. The Saudi air force gave Air India a four-hour window to go to and from Sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing. As the plane approached the city, the crew could see the scars of the fighting. There were no cars on the roads. Dozens of buildings were destroyed. At the airport, the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by Saudi bombs, but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits. The loading of passengers was swift. They approached the planes carrying boarding passes -- another touch of normalcy in the otherwise abnormal event. They didn't  pay for the flight, though they had to purchase exit visas from the Houthis. Children sat on their parents' laps to maximize the number of people on the plane. Some passengers fell asleep as soon as they took their seats before takeoff. Everyone seemed to carry the weight of war, especially nurses who had tended the wounded. From Djibouti, the evacuees will most likely disperse to their home nations. ""Now I can only pray for Yemen and those we left behind,"" Thakur said.","Air India has evacuated 2,500 people in recent days from Yemen, Indian official says .

"Garissa, Kenya (CNN)Freshly laundered clothes still hang Friday in the dormitory at Garissa University College. Stuffed animals remain in one room. On the wall in another hangs a poster on proper preparation for Muslim prayer. These small reminders of college life at this Kenyan school belie the horror of what happened here: the slaughter of at least 147 people, many of them students who lived in this building. On Friday afternoon, more than 36 hours after the attack, investigators and Kenya Red Cross crews were finishing up the task of removing the bodies of dead students. The corpses of four Al-Shabaab attackers -- dressed head to toe in black and still clutching their AK-47s -- remained where they fell, their bodies shattered in a torrent of bullets.

The gunmen, from the Al-Shabaab terror group, first stormed a Christian prayer service, killing some students, taking others hostage. They rampaged across the campus, shooting non-Muslims, sparing Muslims, a witness said. One student, Hellen Titus, told CNN she hid inside a wardrobe for nearly an hour before the gunmen came for her. Come out, they told her, you won't be shot. ""They were lying,"" she said. The gunmen herded her and maybe three dozen other students into a community room where they'd usually hang out and watch television. They were told to lie down, lectured about how the Quran forbids killing women. And then the men, Titus said, were shot in the head. One of the gunmen egged on the others. ""Shoot them! Shoot them!"" he would say, according to Titus. More lecturing: the land, the gunmen said, didn't belong to nonbelievers. We, the gunmen said, have just two missions: to kill, and be killed. And then they started shooting the women. ""Anyone who is breathing, shoot them,"" Titus said the gunman in charge said. ""We just lay there hopelessly, because we know automatically we're going to be killed,"" Titus said. It was then she saw the blood of a fellow student coursing toward her on the floor. She smeared it onto her face and body to make it appear she, too, was dead. ""In the time of shooting, they skipped me,"" she said. She survived with only a hand wound. Many of the other students were shot in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. Others had been beheaded, according to people who had viewed bodies at the morgue in Chiromo. Even longtime relief workers such as Reuben Nyaora with the International Rescue Committee said they were shocked at what they saw.

"(CNN)They may not be ""Star Trek""-type extraterrestrials, but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life, a NASA scientist says. ""I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years,"" NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe. ""We know where to look. We know how to look,"" she said. ""In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think we're definitely on the road."" NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa. The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release. ""Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice,"" the agency noted. There are some caveats involved, of course. NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms. ""We are not talking about little green men,"" Stofan said at the panel. ""We are talking about little microbes."" Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well. ""I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star,"" he said. And, he added, who knows what that life will look like? ""Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low,"" he said. ""And I think that's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting.""","NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan believes we're close to finding alien life .

"Dongguan, China (CNN)For a decade, the New South China Mall -- the biggest shopping mall in the world -- has been an embarrassment for its owners and China. Opened to the public in 2005 in Dongguan in the south of the country, the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment, shops and eateries. Outside the mall, a giant Egyptian sphinx and a replica of the Arc de Triomphe were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with Venetian gondolas. It even boasted an indoor roller coaster. But despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came. Soon, it was classified by industry analysts as a ""dead mall"" and it became an unflattering symbol of China's runaway speculation on real estate projects. The mall spans five million square feet of shopping area, making it the largest in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of Mall of America, the biggest shopping center in the United States. When I visited two years ago, the mall was deserted. Most units were empty. Paint was coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements had faded. The air had a dry smell of dust and garbage was piled everywhere. The occupancy rate was less than 10%. It was a walk through a ghost mall. However, a visit in late March revealed a different picture. The mall was buzzing with activity. Large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Visitors could be seen browsing for luxury sunglasses and designer jeans, dining at the Korean, Italian or Chinese restaurants or enjoying the new entertainment facilities. Screams and laughter can be heard from merry-go-rounds. ""It's been a big change. It's a clear modernization,"" said David Carr, an English teacher from the United States who is living in Dongguan with his wife Danae, also a teacher. ""We come here at least once a month now."" Despite the signs of life, much of the mall is still vacant. But most of the unoccupied units, along with halls and walkways are under renovation. Even on a Saturday, it's full of construction workers and the constant sound of jack-hammering and sawing. Ms Shu, head of New South China Mall's marketing unit, told CNN that there are plans for a re-launch ceremony this spring, when all construction work will be completed and most shop and restaurant areas are leased to tenants. ""All construction that is currently going on at the mall is preparation for the opening in May,"" she said, declining to give her full name. ""We expect that from May, we will have almost full occupancy rate and no empty shops."" She said she couldn't offer any more details as she was not authorized to speak with media. Ms Ye, head of investments, confirmed that ""business is really great,"" but would not comment further. Dutch retail chain Spar, which has expanded its supermarket to two floors, explained on its website that it had re-launched last year during the mall's ""upgrading and retrofitting program."" There are also plenty of recruitment ads posted at the entrance of the mall. When I spoke to her, Huang Haiyan, a young Chinese woman, was just two days away from opening a little café called ""Miss & H"" in one of the passage ways being renovated. Sitting on the sidewalk outside the café, she and her partners were busy washing up cups, classes and plates ahead of the big day. ""I'm so excited!"" she said, showing the kind of enthusiasm that had been non-existent when I last visited the mall two years ago. ""You must come, my coffee is the best in China!"" The area around the previously run-down Arc de Triomphe is now a tranquil roofed boulevard with small coffee shops where youngsters play cards and mothers sip lattes. In January, a globe shaped IMAX-style cinema was launched at the outdoor square. One of the more eye-catching new sources of entertainment is a role-playing amusement center for children called Myrules World. Today, it no longer feels like a walk through a ghost mall. It's hard to believe how rapid the change has been. Economist Brian Jackson says the shift in focus towards restaurants and businesses that target China's middle, rather than, upper class, is a smart move on behalf of the developers. ""Many large malls (and residential construction) in China.... are all hoping to target one demographic -- the upper class,"" he said. ""What is needed to succeed is retail space that caters to (the much larger) bulk of middle-class Chinese."" And, he says, other developments that were once labeled ""ghost cities"" have gone on to thrive. ""One to three years is a blink of an eye in terms of city developments, so many of these cities still have time to fill and become functional,""Jackson said. Despite its retrofitting program, the problems that have dogged the mall since its start will not disappear instantly. Most of Dongguan's almost 10 million inhabitants are migrant workers struggling to make ends meet. The town is also facing difficulties as manufacturing moves elsewhere in China or to Southeast Asia where wages are lower. China is also haunted by serious problems in its real-estate market, with over investment and large vacancy rates. In March, prices of new homes fell for the twelfth consecutive month. What's more, the mall's latest re-launch is not its first. In 2007, the mall changed name from ""South China Mall"" to ""New South China Mall, Living City"" and a revitalization plan was drawn up by current owners the Founders Group, a conglomerate set up by Peking University, and its subsidiary PKU Founder. But the revamp failed and the mall remained empty. Now, the owners are hoping for third time lucky. PICTURES: Inside a Chinese ghost city .","For a decade, the New South China Mall has lain empty .

"(CNN)ISIS fighters seized several districts in the Iraqi city of Ramadi in an hours-long assault Friday that included suicide and car bombs, an Iraqi provincial official said. At least 10 Iraqi security forces were killed in the attacks, according to Faleh al-Essawi, the deputy head of Iraq's Anbar provincial council. And the head of the Iraqi military operation in Anbar province, Gen. Qassim al-Muhammadi, was wounded. The northern Ramadi districts of Albu Faraj, Albu Essa and Albu Risha were in the hands of ISIS by the time the day was done. Located about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of Baghdad, Ramadi has seen intense and persistent fighting for months. ISIS took over parts of that western Anbar city in the first half of 2014, and it's been part of a tug of war ever since. Iraqi security forces discovered tunnels in February that they say could have led opposition fighters to a central government compound in the city.  But they didn't find all of them: A few weeks later, ISIS detonated hundreds of homemade bombs from a tunnel underneath an army headquarters there, according to Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar provincial council. More than 40 Iraqi soldiers died in that explosion. Iraqi and allied forces have made inroads in recent weeks, beating back the group that calls itself the Islamic State, which took over vast swaths of Iraq and neighboring Syria last year. Their most high-profile victory, for instance, was the recapture of Tikrit. And U.S.-led airstrikes have already made a difference, according to officials in Washington and beyond. Still, ISIS remains a formidable force and, as the Ramadi assault shows, one that's still capable and willing to go on offense to take territory. That may be best illustrated by the case of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city and the site of one of its biggest embarrassments when Iraqi soldiers and police dropped their weapons and fled their posts as ISIS forces advanced last June. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqis troops were expected to return to the key northern Iraqi city in April or May. But, on Thursday, a senior official in U.S. President Barack Obama's administration appeared to back away from that timeline -- saying an Iraqi-led assault on Mosul ""might be some time from now (or) might be soon."" Calling for ""patience,"" an administration official said that winning Mosul is a complex endeavor. The same could be said for the entire effort to defeat ISIS. It will ""take a lot of capacity,"" the official said, ""and some time to build."" CNN's Kim Acosta contributed to this report.","Anbar provincial official: Suicide and car bombs were part of the ISIS assault .

"(CNN)Indonesia has a tough stance on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, President Joko Widodo has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes. That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called ""Bali Nine."" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group: . Scott Rush . Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj . Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen . Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman . The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, ""don't judge me too harshly.""  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence . The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  ""A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life."" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, ""The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options."" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the ""extensive rehabilitation"" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to ""use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.""","Two Australian drug smugglers, part of the Bali Nine, await word whether they'll face a firing squad .

"Easley, South Carolina (CNN)The cracker or the bite of ice cream -- Brynn Duncan still isn't sure which one sent her into anaphylactic shock that day. Her food allergies change so frequently, keeping track is almost pointless. It was just another day with another massive allergic reaction. She can always tell when one is coming on. ""I just get this overwhelming sense of -- they call it impending doom."" Her labradoodle, Moose, starts alerting, licking her hands frantically. ""I'll feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach, and then it gets hard to breathe and my throat and tongue start swelling. And we have to treat it really fast."" On that particular day in March, multiple EpiPens didn't slow the reaction. The paramedics who arrived to take Brynn to Greenville Memorial Hospital, or ""Hotel Greenville"" as she likes to call it, knew her well. When she asked for her security blanket, they knew to hand her her smartphone. ""New day, new crisis,"" Brynn quips as she tells the story, as if it's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong. It might as well be. When you're allergic to life, a near-death experience is no big deal. Less than a week after her trip to the hospital, Brynn, 21, is back at home in Easley, South Carolina. She lies on her back, her head near the foot of her bed, chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port. Melissa Duncan, a paralegal by day, dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that's connected to Brynn's jugular vein. The disinfectant burns, and Brynn's blood pressure hits 150/102. Her heart rate rockets to 128. ""The meds we have to give her to keep her alive, she reacts to,"" Melissa says, shaking her head. ""Never in a million years did I think I would be doing this. "" Brynn was seemingly a normal kid -- until she wasn't. Yes, she was a fussy baby. Yes, she got sick often as a child, Melissa muses out loud -- but what kid doesn't? Brynn was also incredibly energetic, always the center of attention. Her father, Barry, jokingly rues the day she learned to talk. She started taekwondo at the age of 9 and had her black belt by the time she was 11. That was the same year doctors diagnosed Brynn with IBS, or irritable bowel syndrome. ""She's always been --"" Melissa Duncan pauses. ""High maintenance!"" Brynn fills in with a laugh. It wasn't until shortly before her 16th birthday in 2010 that Brynn had her first serious allergic reaction. The next two years became a blur of sick days and doctors' appointments. Brynn saw specialist after specialist. The gastrointestinologist diagnosed her with gastroparesis, or partial paralysis of the stomach muscles. A cardiologist said she had POTS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome -- meaning that when she stood up for longer than a few minutes, her blood pressure dropped, leaving her light-headed and nauseated. A Wake Forest doctor diagnosed her with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that causes fragile skin and overly flexible joints. After doing hours of research, Melissa, Barry and Brynn came up with their own diagnosis: mast cell disease. They found a specialist online, Dr. Lawrence Afrin, who at the time was working in Charleston. They waited nearly nine months to see him, but hearing him confirm their suspicions was life-changing. Scientists don't know yet what causes mast cell disease. Researchers have found mutations in mast cells that may cause the abnormal behavior, but the mutations vary from one patient to the next. Because of this, scientists suspect the mutations are acquired early in life. But genetics may make some children more susceptible to developing the mutations. Mast cells are the regulators of your immune system. They're the ones that release histamine when a bug bites, or when you come into contact with an allergen. They basically sound the alarm that lets the rest of your immune system know something is wrong. Until recently, the only mast cell disease doctors had identified was mastocytosis, which is characterized by ""abnormal proliferation and activation"" of the body's mast cells -- meaning there are way too many and they act in strange ways. But in the last few years doctors such as Afrin have started to recognize that there are many different layers to mast cell disease. For instance, Brynn has mast cell activation syndrome, meaning her mast cells act strangely, but they're not growing in number. ""It's like I'm living in a 24/7 allergic reaction,"" Brynn explains simply. Fruit, vegetables, milk, soy, nuts, smoke, perfume, the sun -- you name it, Brynn is allergic to it. But it's not really about the specifics; the allergens change depending on how ""angry"" her mast cells are that day, she says. On good days, she can eat small amounts of plain meat or mashed potatoes. On bad days, even using her feeding tube causes her extreme pain. Not everyone with mast cell activation syndrome has it as bad as Brynn does. ""Oh God, no,"" Afrin says when asked. ""No, no, no, no."" But mast cells are located in your connective tissue, including your skin and the lining of your stomach and intestine. They can affect every system in the body, Afrin says, so the disease is capable of causing all the symptoms Brynn experiences. You have to ask yourself, he says: ""Is this poor patient so uniquely unlucky to have acquired so many different, independent problems? Or is it more likely that there is just one thing going on?"" Of course, having a diagnosis didn't make living with mast cell disease any easier. In 2012, Brynn was admitted to the hospital 30 times. She started having seizures and episodes of dystonia -- painful, violent muscle contractions that are ""scary to see and scary to experience."" On multiple occasions, doctors have had to put casts on her legs to prevent her joints from bending in the wrong direction.","Brynn Duncan has mast cell disease, which causes her to be allergic to almost everything .

"(CNN)The abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls a year ago this week captured global attention and inspired the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, but the horrors for Nigeria's children are widespread. ""Around 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes as a result of the conflict in northeast Nigeria between Boko Haram, military forces and civilian self-defense groups,"" UNICEF said Monday. The ""number of children running for their lives within Nigeria, or crossing over the border to Chad, Niger and Cameroon, has more than doubled in just less than a year."" UNICEF released a report on the crisis titled ""Missing Childhoods."" It also launched a social media campaign using the hashtag #bringbackourchildhood. The campaign has ""leading Snapchat artists"" sharing images based on drawings from children in Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon.  Artwork can also be seen on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. More than 1.5 million people have fled their homes due to the violence, UNICEF said. About 1.2 million are displaced internally, while others have crossed into Cameroon, Chad and Niger. ""The vast majority of the displaced -- more than 880,000 -- are staying with host communities with little access to humanitarian support, putting additional strains on already stretched health, education and social services,"" it said. The April 14, 2014, kidnappings at a girls school in Chibok by the Islamist group Boko Haram ""is only one of endless tragedies being replicated on an epic scale across Nigeria and the region,"" said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF regional director for West and Central Africa. ""Scores of girls and boys have gone missing in Nigeria -- abducted, recruited by armed groups, attacked, used as weapons, or forced to flee violence. They have the right to get their childhoods back."" Kids are being used by Boko Haram as combatants, cooks, and lookouts, UNICEF said.

"New York  (CNN)New York's iconic Statue of Liberty and Liberty Island will reopen to the public Saturday -- one day after a bomb threat that led to its evacuation was declared unfounded, officials said. The NYPD bomb squad on Friday examined a locker thought to contain a suspicious package and found it was empty, a law enforcement official said. Police declared the scene clear at 3:15 p.m. Other lockers checked as a precautionary measure, the law enforcement source said. Images posted on social media showed crowds of visitors walking on ramps to awaiting ferries. All civilians were evacuated and only emergency personnel remained on Liberty Island, according to police. The fire department had EMS units there as a precaution. Mike Burke, the head of Statue Cruises, which operates the ferry to the island, said: ""Our first priority is the safety and well being of all of our visitors."" Burke said about 2,700 people were safely transported from the island and offered full refunds. Service to Liberty Island is to resume at 8:30 a.m. Saturday. Shortly after 11 a.m., the National Park Service was informed that a 911 caller made a threat to blow up the Statue of Liberty -- which led to the evacuation, according to park service spokeswoman Mindi Rambo. A sweep by U.S. Park Police canine units ""alerted on an area of interest near the lockers at the base"" of the Statue of Liberty, Rambo said. Park police had notified the NYPD, which dispatched its bomb squad, officials said. It is not uncommon to get false positives from the bomb-sniffing dogs. ""Following their investigation, it was determined that there was not an explosive device,"" Rambo said. Approximately 3.5 million people visit the Statue of Liberty every year. Visitors must pass through security screening similar to airport security procedures, according to the National Park Service. Previously, the statue closed in November 2012 because of significant damage sustained from Superstorm Sandy. It reopened on July 4, 2013, with a ribbon cutting ceremony and long lines of tourists. The last time the island shut down to the public was in October 2013, when it closed for 12 days because of the a government shutdown. The statue was dedicated by President Grover Cleveland on October 28, 1886. It was a gift to the United States from the people of France to commemorate 100 years of Franco-American friendship as well as the centennial of America's independence.","Statue of Liberty to reopen Saturday .

"(CNN)At first blush, Brian Rogers and Caitlin McGuire seem like any other small business owners -- polite, hardworking and passionate about what they do. But there's the potential for things to get a little awkward when the conversation turns from ""hi""s to highs. ""There's always a moment of hesitation of 'when are they going to ask us what we do?' and 'how are they going to receive that when we tell them?'"" McGuire, 25, said. She and Rogers, 34, own the Breckenridge Cannabis Club, a recreational marijuana dispensary in the historic and scenic ski town of Breckenridge, Colorado. The couple started their business as a medical cannabis dispensary in 2010, but when Colorado became the first state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana, they saw a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity. Previously, they were only permitted to sell medical marijuana to the approximate 4,500 permanent residents of Breckenridge; when the new legislation took effect on January 1, 2014, they could then sell to any of the 30,000-plus tourists (21 years or older) who visited the town during peak season. By the end of the first day of ""recreational"" sales, they knew their lives had changed forever. The two said they brought in more than $47,000 in sales, roughly 30 times their normal daily sales of medical marijuana. The long lines and enthusiastic patrons also raised the ire of some of the residents who felt the shop detracted from the town's ""family-friendly"" atmosphere . Now, the pair's journey to build a legal marijuana empire is documented in the new CNN Original Series ""High Profits,"" which premieres Sunday, April 19, at 10 p.m. ET/PT. ""Somebody is going to become a mogul,"" Rogers said. In 2014, legal marijuana was a $700 million industry in Colorado and was billed as the fastest growing industry in the United States.  And, according to a a 2014 Gallup Poll, 51% of Americans favored legalizing marijuana, though that was down from the previous year's approval of 58%. It's a majority, but a slim majority -- and 23 states still prohibit marijuana outright. Here are the next states to legalize pot . ""We want to show people that it's not just a bunch of stoners selling pot over the counter,"" McGuire said. ""It's business-minded people -- hardworking Americans -- who are just like any other business and trying to make their dream work."" She and Rogers are simultaneously pragmatic and optimistic about the public's opinion. It's 2015: Is weed legal in your state? ""I think they often think we woke up and it was handed to us. Our job was created; we created our jobs through hard work and investment and risk,"" Rogers said. As pioneers in a newly legalized business, the risks Rogers and McGuire face go above and beyond those of your average small business. While the sale and private consumption of cannabis is legal in Colorado, the federal government still considers it a Schedule I controlled substance like heroin or LSD, a dangerous drug with ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" That classification makes it difficult for banks -- which are federally regulated -- to do business with marijuana retailers, even legal ones. Few even try. This is pot's $3 billion banking problem . And forget about paying for your pot with plastic. Like most Colorado cannabis stores, the Breckenridge Cannabis Club is a cash only business. Without access to banking, McGuire and Rogers are forced to pay their staff, their suppliers and even their taxes in cash. The two recognize that ""budtender"" might not be a career path any family expects their child to embark on, but for the most part, there has been surprising support: McGuire even got permission to use the remainder of her college fund to start Breckenridge Cannabis Club more than five years ago. ""For both of us, it was pretty easy to see this as a great opportunity to do something different,"" McGuire said. ""We were just working in the service industry so it's not like either of us had any full-fledged careers that we were afraid to leave behind or families that we were worried about risking or providing for."" What's worse -- pot or booze? Rogers' family used to tell his grandmother that he and McGuire ran a ski rental business. ""Then one day she was like, 'You don't rent skis, do you?'"" he laughs. McGuire had a similar experience with her grandma, until she came to the store for the first time and saw its legitimacy. ""She thought we were just your stereotypical drug dealers,"" she said. The couple says their grandmothers' attitude shift is what they're hoping for on a larger scale: While you may not agree with them, entrepreneurs in four states and the District of Columbia are out to prove that recreational cannabis and capitalism can coexist. ""We're cannabis consumers and we support that part of it, too. But that's not what this business is about,"" McGuire said. ""It's about having the opportunity to create a life for us and have a professional career that sustains us."" Will they succeed?

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is a strangely detached scene for the close of America's longest war: military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar, high security bases, on Black Hawks, miles from the front line. But it is how Washington wants this to be.

We are near Jalalabad, at a regional logistics hub for the Afghan police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms, ammunition, even fuel for vehicles. The intentions, first hatched in 2011 when the U.S. had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here, were large in scale. But the project has been handed between rotations of U.S. officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception. We are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks. Dozens of Afghan police gather there, and mill around, waiting for their commanders to arrive. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: Afghan forced to marry her rapist . Yet a few problems are immediately visible. There are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we're told they've been removed while a new master key is being sought. There seem to be few supplies in the actual hub. We ask the Afghan policemen how many of them get resupplied there, at this stage, four months since it opened, and they say: none. About 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base, but supplies often still come from where they did before -- Kabul. U.S. officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the Afghan army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need. But here, now, that seems far away. As does the base, incidentally. It's quite a rough drive from the main road, surrounded by hills, and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: ISIS recruits in Taliban territory . And it is far away in terms of its cost. Like so much in the most costly of wars, its price tag may have made sense in briefings on Capitol Hill, where effectiveness is gauged in millions, but here in dusty eastern Afghanistan, it seems exorbitant. This as-yet, partially functional resupply hub cost $21 million, a price that presumably includes new doorhandles. There are about fifty Afghan police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $400,000 to the US taxpayer. But this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the U.S. trainers here face: working, as they are, against a clock, with diminishing resources and public interest, in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where, when the Taliban aren't thriving, ISIS are waiting in the wings to fill the gap. With the clock ticking in the background, U.S. officer Colonel JB Vowell remains upbeat: ""It's going to be a challenge, to get all those little hubs and spokes -- logistics to maintenance, supplies, resupply. I'm optimistic though; much of this didn't exist in November."" On the outskirts of the base are the relics of the U.S.'s military involvement in a conflict that still continues to kill Afghan security forces at an accelerated  rate. SUVs, even old American Humvees -- now gifted to Afghan police to drive around -- lie disabled by mine strikes. The Americans were hoping the police could stack the vehicles here, assess their resupply needs, or cannibalize the damaged vehicles for spare parts. Throughout, the surreal changes in how this war was, and continues to be, fought are omnipresent. Years ago, the threat would have mostly been from insurgents taking potshots at an American base. Now we are far from the threat, but another has taken its place. Surrounding our crew at all times are ""Guardian Angels"" -- U.S. soldiers on guard duty, protecting their own from rogue Afghan police or soldiers, trying to prevent the newest and most serious scourge -- ""green on blue"" attacks, in which Afghan security forces turn their guns on Americans. It is a strange experience to be protected from those who America seeks to hand the country over to. But this is how the war ended. Not with ideological victories, or dramatic withdrawals, just the slow and deliberate stepping to one side.","Final troop pullout oddly detached as U.S. military operations die down in Afghanistan .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians are taking to the streets in protests across the country, lashing out against President Dilma Rousseff as she struggles with an economic downturn and a massive bribery scandal. The demonstrators have called for the President to be impeached. On the other side Rousseff's base is holding rallies in her support. There are a number of issues at play. One of the biggest: an investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme at the state-run oil company Petrobras. Petrobras was long considered the corporate jewel in Brazil's crown, one of the biggest companies in the world by market capitalization. But last year, investigators launched a sweeping investigation. According to suspects-turned-witnesses, construction companies paid bribes to executives at Petrobras as well as politicians to secure lucrative contracts. Most of the politicians accused in the investigation belong to the President's Workers Party and its allies. During many of the years that the alleged corruption took place, Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras. There hasn't been any evidence she was involved with the scheme, and her supporters say the position is merely a figurehead. Rousseff has defended Brazilians' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at Petrobras -- but denied any prior knowledge of it. But Brazilians are still outraged. Rousseff won re-election with just over 50% of valid votes in October, but her approval rating plummeted to 13% after the protests last month. Compounding the frustration is the economy, which is expected to contract this year. Inflation is stubbornly high, and the currency has lost more than 20% of its value against the dollar this year alone. Both sides are. The country was already sharply divided during presidential elections in October. Roughly half of the voting population didn't vote for Rousseff, and many of those same people joined protests immediately after elections. Rousseff's supporters like to characterize the protesters as Brazilian elite and right-wingers, and some small groups do carry signs calling for a military intervention to oust the President. But with the Petrobras scandal growing and the economy sinking, the protests have gotten bigger and broader, with many demonstrators saying they initially voted for Rousseff. Protesters say Rousseff should be impeached for failing to halt the corruption at Petrobras. On the other hand, labor unions, social activists and groups such as the Landless Workers Movement who support the government have organized their own marches. The demonstrations are meant as a show of force for democracy, with participants saying the President was democratically elected and cannot be impeached. But participation has not been consistently strong. The President has said Petrobras should be cleaned up. Has she done anything about it? She says she's given prosecutors and the Federal Police free rein to investigate the Petrobas scandal. Some of her allies who have been implicated in the investigation think Rousseff should do more to protect them. This scandal has been known publicly for at least a year, and during Rousseff's election campaign, she said she would root out corruption. The Brazilian economy was booming for the good part of a decade, bolstered by voracious demand for its commodities from China. But with China's economy cooling, Brazil has failed to find a successful alternative to promote growth and shore up investor confidence. Now, with the President's approval rating abysmally low, it will be difficult to implement the savings needed to get the economy back on track. Rousseff has appointed a market-friendly economy minister, Joaquim Levy, to try and fix the country's fiscal problems. But in the current political crisis, he hasn't been able to make much progress.","Protesters angry over bribery scandal involving state-run oil company Petrobras .

"Tikrit, Iraq (CNN)ISIS is gone, but the fear remains. As Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, took control Wednesday of the northern city of Tikrit, they found vehicles laden with explosives and buildings that might be booby-trapped. CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon, who was in Tikrit on Tuesday, saw a large mechanical digger packed with explosives that Iraqi forces had to disarm. The troops, she said, were cautious when they entered buildings in case they were wired to explode. Plumes of smoke rose from burning buildings in the background. Near former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces compound -- Tikrit is Hussein's birthplace -- the CNN team also saw a destroyed truck with a large machine gun mounted on the back. Iraqi forces said they had fired an RPG at the truck, killing three ISIS fighters. ISIS was ejected from the palaces compound in fierce fighting, they said, adding that there may still be booby traps. Federal police said they dismantled hundreds of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) Wednesday. CNN heard at least 16 explosions, some very loud, which police said were controlled. The potential booby traps were political as well as physical. Officials are concerned about the behavior of the conquerors, particularly the Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen who helped Iraqi troops. Officials fear the militiamen might take ""scorched earth"" reprisals for the reported massacre of Shiite air force cadets by ISIS fighters in Tikrit last year. Much of the population of Tikrit is, like ISIS, Sunni Muslim. And officials fear that reprisals by Shiite militias against the Sunni population could stoke local anger, jeopardizing the government's ability to hold onto Tikrit and pull the country together. Sectarian resentment helped fuel the rise of ISIS in the first place. 'Where are our sons?' demand families of soldiers captured by ISIS . Still, the liberation of Tikrit from the terrorist group, which is also known as ISIL and calls itself the Islamic State, represented a significant victory for the Iraqi government, which had tried -- and failed -- to retake the city many times before. Iraqi  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived Wednesday to claim the victory, which took place a year after the city was first attacked by ISIS. Al-Abadi, who is also Iraq's top military commander, had announced the previous evening on Iraqiya TV that the city was under the control of Iraqi forces. Iraqi forces continued to clean out pockets of resistance Wednesday, said Interior Minister Mohammed al-Ghabban, who was also in the city. But he said the Iraqi government would be in full control shortly. ""The enemy has been defeated, and it has lost all its capabilities,"" al-Ghabban said. ""In the coming hours, the battle will end."" Iraqi security said that the few ISIS militants left in the city are hiding inside houses hoping to escape in the dark. ISIS' nine-month dominion over Tikrit was marked by brutality. In addition to the reported massacre of the 1,500-plus air force cadets at Camp Speicher in June, ISIS is believed to have buried victims in mass graves and to have destroyed an Assyrian church that had graced Tikrit since the eighth century. The push into Tikrit came days after U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS bases around the city. Al-Abadi said those tactics would now be replicated in other areas. Brett McGurk, the U.S. deputy special presidential envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, tweeted that the coalition's airstrikes had destroyed numerous ISIS shelters. ""We will continue to support courageous Iraqi forces operating under Iraqi command as they work to reclaim their territory from #ISIL,"" McGurk tweeted. The key to victory in Tikrit this time, the Prime Minister said, was surprise. But help from the coalition of Shiite militiamen and volunteers also played a part. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first open participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines in Iraq. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize -- Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May in an effort to retake the city. Don Melvin wrote this report in London. Arwa Damon and Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Tikrit and Jomana Karadsheh from Baghdad.","Tikrit is under the control of Iraqi forces, Iraqi Prime Minister says .

"New York (CNN)A New York Police Department detective apologized Friday for an angry exchange with an Uber driver that was caught on video and landed him on modified assignment. ""I apologize. I sincerely apologize,"" Patrick Cherry told WNBC's Jonathan Dienst. Cherry, an NYPD detective assigned to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force with top-secret security clearance, faces suspension, reassignment or loss of his clearance after the video of the altercation went viral. ""I was just angry, at that moment, for that exchange."" Cherry said. ""If the conversation initially went differently, we probably would have shook hands at the end of that encounter."" The altercation began Monday when the Uber driver gestured to a detective in an unmarked car to use his blinker after he was allegedly attempting to park without using it, according to Sanjay Seth, a passenger in the car who uploaded the video to YouTube. The video picks up seconds after the detective began yelling at the driver and mocking his accent, and also shows the unmarked car with lights flashing pulled over behind the Uber car. In the video, the detective tells the driver he has committed ""three traffic and law violations""  and then becomes irate and uses expletives toward the comparably calm driver. A visibly upset Police Commissioner William Bratton on Wednesday said the detective was placed on modified assignment pending an investigation. ""No good cop can watch that without a wince,"" he told reporters. ""As all good cops know ... the officer made their jobs a little bit harder. That kind of anger like that is unacceptable in any encounter; discourtesy like that and language like that is unacceptable. That officer's behavior reflected poorly on everyone who wears our uniform."" Cherry also apologized to the police commissioner, saying ""he's doing a lot of good work to strengthen community relations in the city and I set that back. I would work, personally work to fix that."" ""You can't judge three minutes of a tape involving me and me alone as indication that that's the kind of practice of the New York City Police Department,"" he added. Bratton, who said the detective was on duty at the time, issued an apology to the driver and passengers. Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters at an unrelated news conference that he had not seen the video. ""There's just no place for any public servant to use discriminatory or negative language,"" he said. ""Obviously, our police play a particularly sensitive role and need to show respect for all people."" In a statement, Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, called the officer ""a person of good character and an excellent detective"" who ""should not be judged by one isolated incident."" ""I am not trying to minimize the significance of what occurred,"" Palladino said. ""I am simply pointing out that cops are just like everyone else. They have families, friends and other things going on in their lives, too, that may affect their behavior at times. There is no disputing that we are held to a higher standard, that is why this incident is so newsworthy."" In the video, after the detective steps back to his car, the Uber driver, who moved to America less than two years ago, turns to the passenger and thanks him for recording the video. ""That's crazy. That's really inappropriate,"" the passenger tells the driver. ""Listen, it's not your fault. He shouldn't be slamming your car door, throwing things around. He doesn't have a right to open your door."" When the detective comes back, he is irate and doesn't allow the driver to speak. ""I don't care what you have to say, people are allowed to park their cars on the side of the street without your interference,"" the detective tells the driver. ""I don't know where you're coming from, where you think it's appropriate in doing that. That's the way it works."" ""I've got news for you,"" the detective says, ""the only reason you're not in handcuffs and going to jail and getting summons in the precinct is because I have things to do. That's the only reason that's not happening. Because this isn't important enough for me. You're not important enough. Don't ever do that again."" The NYPD said the Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident. ""The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident. We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs,"" Uber said Tuesday. Seth met Wednesday with an investigator from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, according to board spokeswoman Linda Sachs. The investigator is attempting to interview the driver as well as the police officer. The findings will be presented to the board, which will make an official determination on whether misconduct was committed, Sachs said. The board will either refer the decision to the NYPD with a disciplinary recommendation, or decide to bring up the officer on administrative charges, with the decision presented to the police commissioner. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","Detective: ""I sincerely apologize"" for berating Uber driver .

"Tokyo (CNN)A bizarre and alarming discovery is raising concerns in Japan about the potential for terrorism involving drones. A drone carrying traces of a radioactive material was found on the rooftop of Japan's equivalent to the White House on Wednesday, police and government officials said. The discovery came on the same day a Japanese court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima prefecture, more than four years after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many Japanese, who view nuclear energy as too dangerous. A staff member spotted the drone Wednesday morning on the roof of Abe's residence, Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. Dozens of police investigators were dispatched to the roof to investigate the origin of the drone, which had four propeller and was 50 centimeters (20 inches) wide. Police say the drone was equipped with a small camera, smoke flares and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium, a common byproduct of nuclear reactors. Cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown. Investigators suspect the cesium was placed in the bottle. The amount inside is not immediately harmful to humans. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the discovery is raising concerns about terrorism. ""There might be terrorism attempts in the future at the Olympics and G7 Summit using drones,"" Suga said. ""So we need to examine and review continuously the way small unmanned vehicles like drones should be operated and how to cope with the threat of terrorism from drones. The government will do all that we can to prevent terrorism."" Japanese law restricts drone flights around airports to prevent problems with aircraft, but there are no flight restrictions for most of Tokyo, including the Prime Minister's residence and local and federal government buildings. Abe was not in his office at the time. He is in Indonesia, attending the Asian-African Conference. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Joshua Berlinger and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","The drone is sparking terrorism concerns, authorities say .

"(CNN)UltraHaptics is a young company with a big dream: changing the way we interact with electronic devices. Their technology creates tactile three-dimensional shapes literally out of thin air, using ultrasound. The company's tagline says it all: ""Feeling without touching."" Through an emission of sound waves, sensations are projected through the air and to the user. Changes in air pressure are perceived as suspended tactile surfaces, creating invisible -- but tangible -- interfaces. This already sounds quite intriguing, but paired with another rising technology it has the potential to become a game changer. The rising tide of virtual reality seems unstoppable: Facebook's Oculus Rift and Magic Leap are leading the pack, but several other companies are readying devices in a field that could shake the foundations of electronic entertainment. But even though it is incredibly convincing, virtual reality completely bypasses the sense of touch: applying UltraHaptics' technology to it would allow users to not just see the virtual world projected in front of their eyes, but to touch it as well. Tom Carter, UltraHaptics' CTO, sees potential in the merging of these technologies: ""The ability to put on your virtual reality goggles and not just explore visually and through your headphones, but also touch what you can see, is a really exciting possibility,"" he told CNN's Nick Glass. Creating buttons and shapes literally anywhere they're needed opens up a slew of possibilities for more traditional devices as well. ""Imagine the dashboard of a car having no buttons, no switches, no ugly controls: just a very nice, sleek dashboard. ""If you're driving and you want to have the music up for example, you don't have to take your eyes off the road, you just hold your hand out and the controls stick to your hand, so you can feel them."" Smartphones and other popular devices could also see benefits: controlling appliances in the kitchen, using TVs and computers in a style reminiscent of the movie ""Minority report"", or even snoozing the alarm in the morning would all become just a matter of waving your hands. (This probably wouldn't be the most virtuous application of the technology.) Several devices can already be controlled with gestures, but UltraHaptics add an extra layer of feedback, by generating the sensation of a force field: ""Haptics is more than just the sense of touch. It's really all of the information that you get from the sense of touch. What you're feeling, what sort of pressure, the tactile sensation given by an object or surface. You also know where your limbs are and how they're moving, all from the sense of touch. It's all this information that cues how you're interacting with the world,"" Carter said. To create their invisible buttons, UltraHaptics use a small collection of ultrasonic speakers, concentrating the sound waves to a specific point. Sound travels through air by creating a pressure differential, so by focusing several of these differentials to a target location, the result is a single localized spot of high pressure. ""If you put your hand in the way, it actually emits enough of a force on your hand to slightly displace your skin. ""We use that and control it to vibrate your skin, and give you this feeling. What you eventually get is a sensation of vibration on your hands,"" Carter explained. With the current prototype, the smallest point that can be created is 8.5 millimeters in diameter, but the shape can be morphed into a surface, creating different textures over a single ""object"" by differentiating the pressure levels. Other companies are working on similar projects, such as Elliptic Labs, and the interest around the technology already appears to be strong. UltraHaptics, who have already built several prototypes and have demoed the technology to the public at the last CES in Las Vegas, say they are working with 15 to 20 clients who are looking to incorporate tactile ultrasound into their products. ""We have everything from consumer electronics companies making things like speakers, radios, alarm clocks, through home appliance companies making cooker hoods, washing machines, to virtual reality in gaming companies. And we were very surprised at how keen the automotive industry is to work with us,"" Carter said. ""I'd like to believe that the first product featuring our technology will be on the shelves in a year, that's our aim."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"(CNN)In the beginning... there was the Bible, and it was a very Good Book. But this Catholic hadn't read it -- at least, not from cover to cover. So, in the middle of Holy Week, I decided to finally take the plunge. Let me explain. My name is Laura Bernardini and I'm a director of coverage at CNN, which means I manage our newsgathering and newsroom in Washington. I'm also a lifelong Catholic. At work this week, I was talking with some colleagues about Pope Francis' upcoming trip to the United States.  During the course of that conversation, I admitted something that has privately bothered me for a long time. I have never read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. This from someone who jokingly refers to herself as the highest-ranking Catholic in the bureau. My excuse always has been that Catholics have their Bible passages read to them at Mass every Sunday. And there are so many people that can so effortlessly quote long and beautiful passages. I love to read, there is no excuse. Still, it made me wonder: Why I had not read the Good Book cover to cover? I took a scriptures class in 9th grade of my Catholic high school, but we moved through that year with only selected passages to journal about. Later, when I graduated, my grandparents gave me a beautiful Bible that has traveled with me from Vermont to Montreal to Atlanta and finally to Washington. But in 24 years, I never so much as cracked the cover, other than to write the date I received the gift. In that newsroom conversation this week, Daniel Burke, the religion editor at CNN.com, suggested I read the Bible each day for a year and chronicle it weekly for Belief. I will admit to being pretty stunned and a little scared at the prospect. I figured that no one would care about my thoughts or my process. I am no scholar, no expert on scripture, as should be obvious. But the more we talked, the more the idea grew on me. I have committed to training regimens for 5Ks and countless diets, so why not try this? I have been looking for a form of meditation in my hectic life. This might just be it. My friends seem excited about this project, sending me some of their favorite passages, which I'm keeping a list of. One Catholic friend offered to join me, suggesting I get a blank journal to help me take notes. The colleague that I sit next to everyday has already sent me his Bar Mitzvah passage and wants to discuss it when I get there. Another friend's daughter is making her first Holy Communion in May, and  has also offered to connect us because her class is reading the Bible in school. So, in a way, I'm going back to first grade in Catholic school. Yay for me. Overall, my friends and family are mainly curious how this journey will end. I am, too. Will I make it all the way to Revelation come next spring? I start on Easter Sunday. I hope you'll join me.","Laura Bernardini is a lifelong Catholic but had never read the Bible from cover to cover .

"Washington (CNN)Rick Santorum says he'd hoped Indiana Gov. Mike Pence would veto the ""fix"" to his state's religious freedom law rather than limiting its scope. The law unleashed an intense backlash against Indiana, led by tech giants like Apple and Salesforce and sports organizations like the NCAA, amid concerns it would allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers. Santorum, the former Republican senator from Pennsylvania, who is likely to mount another presidential campaign in 2016, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that Pence's decision to sign a follow-up bill -- which made clear the law couldn't be used to refuse services based on sexual orientation -- led to a ""limited view"" of religious freedom. ""It doesn't really open the debate up on some of the more current issues,"" Santorum said -- a reference to gay rights issues. With the Supreme Court set to rule in June on whether same-sex marriage should be legalized nationwide, social conservatives like Santorum have asserted that Christian bakers, florists and wedding photographers shouldn't be forced to provide their services to same-sex weddings. The Indiana uproar drew nearly all of the GOP's 2016 contenders into the debate, with candidates like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz rushing to Pence's defense. ""Tolerance is a two-way street,"" Santorum said. ""If you're a print shop and you are a gay man, should you be forced to print 'God hates fags' for the Westboro Baptist Church because they hold those signs up?"" Santorum said. ""Should the government force you to do that?"" he said. ""And that's what these cases are all about. This is about the government coming in saying, 'No -- we're going to make you do this.' And this is where I think we just need some space to say, 'Let's have some tolerance -- have it be a two-way street.'"" Gay rights groups, meanwhile, have used the outrage over Indiana's law -- as well as a similar one that Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed into law -- and debate in at least 14 other states over similar measures this year to renew their calls for state laws that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation. Sarah Warbelow, the Human Rights Campaign's legal director, said the debate could shift to states like Texas and South Carolina, where similar bills have been introduced. She said tech companies like Facebook and Google are increasingly wading into the debate because they're recognizing that ""nondiscrimination protections are critical to every area of their employees' lives."" Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of the Catholic archdiocese in New York, said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that the debate over religious freedom calls for a ""delicate balance."" ""We've got to make sure that the rights of conscience and the ability to publicly exercise one's religion is also balanced with another good -- namely, the rights of people not to be discriminated against,"" he said. ""It's easier to ignore religious freedom than it is, today, the more popular issues,"" Dolan said. ""In a way, I appreciate the fact that we have political leaders like Gov. Pence that are saying, 'Whoa, wait a minute. Without questioning the rights of the gay community, we also have to make sure that the rights of the religious community are protected.'"" ""I just wish we could do that in a temperate, civil way, instead of screaming at each other,"" he said.","Rick Santorum says ""religious freedom"" debate is about government telling people what to do .

"(CNN)Mao Zedong's ""Little Red Book,"" a selection of the chairman's quotations, was required reading during China's Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 70s. China has now updated the practice for the digital age -- launching a smartphone app starring its current leader, President Xi Jinping, and featuring his latest speeches, statements and publications. Designed by the Central Party School, which trains Chinese Communist Party leaders, the app aims to ""arouse enthusiasm"" for socialist ideologies. ""With the help of Internet technology, we hope that the theories of socialism with Chinese characteristics will be presented in a way that appeals to web users,"" Chen Jiancai, the managing editor of the school's official web site, said, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency. The app features the latest news about Xi and allows users to access the traditional texts that Xi quotes from. It even has an interactive map that allows you to pinpoint exactly where he made the speeches. It's unclear how many people have downloaded the app, which is available on Apple's App Store. Willy Lam, a China politics scholar at the Chinese University of Hong Kong told CNN the app forms part of Xi's efforts to cultivate a very different image to his predecessors. Xi is keen to be portrayed as a strong leader and as a man of the people -- he's been photographed eating dumplings and has appeared in three animated cartoons. His down-to-earth behavior has drawn a huge number of fans, who address him as ""Xi Dada""--  Big Uncle Xi --  but it's also aroused concern among some China analysts, who believe that Xi is using the state propaganda apparatus to build a cult of personality. ""This is the 21st century's Little Red Book,"" Lam says. ""He wants to be the supreme authority and build his prestige. The personality cult campaign will only grow."" The app drew mixed reviews online and on social media. One headline on a technology news site read ""How can you call yourself Chinese if you don't download it?"" Some said the app, called Xuexi Zhongguo, which translates to ""study China,"" would be a handy study tool. ""Xuexi Zhongguo is an extremely useful app... for civil servants selection tests,"" says one Weibo user @afeixiaoxiaozhuai. But others said they would boycott it. ""If they introduce an Android version, I'll get an iPhone. And if it's in Apple Store, I'll say I can only afford an Android phone.

It hasn't been there as often in the last couple of weeks when state witnesses have included his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins and his former boss, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who testified Hernandez would usually greet him with a kiss and a hug. Always impeccably dressed in suit and tie brought in by his defense team, Hernandez quickly scans the courtroom, usually starting with the rows of seats directly behind him. The front row is reserved for his family. Some days, none of his relatives is there. But when his mother, fiancée, brother and other friends attend, he winks, nods, smiles, jokes, laughs, flirts with his fiancée and mouths greetings to them including ""'thanks for coming' and 'I love you.'"" Twice, he nodded his head and smiled at me. It's not unusual for his lawyers to slap him on his back and huddle before court begins, appearing at ease. They've been representing him since June 2013. There was an unfortunate moment. His mother once asked permission from a court officer to touch her son once the jury left the room. Given an OK, she reached over the bar to him, took one of his hands in hers and kissed it. Rules forbid contact. It did not go unnoticed by the family of victim Odin Lloyd. Hernandez does not avoid looking in their direction. He glances at Lloyd's relatives. Lloyd's mother Ursula Ward, who is in court daily, appears to look right back at Hernandez without expression from her usual seat on the end of a row. When one witness, a high school friend, testifies that Hernandez once allegedly talked about carrying a gun, Hernandez appears to glare at him. When his fiancée takes the stand and testifies Hernandez told her to ditch a box from their basement the day after Lloyd's slaying, his eyes are glued on her. She barely glances his way but does appear to say something as she passes the defense table on the way out. When Kraft is asked to officially point out Hernandez in court and describe what he was wearing, I watch Hernandez look down at his shirt and tie as Kraft detailed his outfit. When the team owner leaves the stand -- the same man who signed him to a $40 million bonus in 2012 -- Hernandez turns and watches him walk out of the courtroom. Would it be the last time he'd see him in person? On the last day of testimony when his defense rests its case, he smiles at relatives. But as he walks out the door this time, he doesn't look back.","Aaron Hernandez, even when on trial for murder, keeps that certain bounce in his step .

"(CNN)Last month's so-so jobs numbers confirm the challenges our economy still faces. Despite recent gains, only 126,000 jobs were added, the lowest since December 2013. Wages remain sluggish. And unemployment may still be at 5.5%, but there is wide concern among labor experts and economists that too much job growth is in part-time low-income work. Low-wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis, and low-wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy. Nearly 60% of the people in America's workforce are paid hourly and work part-time. Most part-time employees are doing low-wage work. Tackling this growing trend is complex. But there is a simple step we can take to improve the conditions of low-wage workers today. Congress should help low-wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules. Here is how this issue works: . America's major fast-food chains, retailers and department stores use ""just-in-time"" scheduling to maximize profit, which in turn creates unstable and stressful work environments for low-wage workers. This type of scheduling has increased dramatically because of sophisticated software that ties staffing to expected customer traffic. Algorithms, built on sales and economic data, provide real-time information for managers to make personnel adjustments. Not surprisingly, such haphazard scheduling wreaks havoc with low-wage workers. Hourly low-income workers endure significantly greater fluctuations in their hours and less predictability in how much they earn than full-time employees.  Many don't even know their weekly schedules until the last moment. A University of Chicago study found that 41% of early career hourly workers and 47% who work part-time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules. Imagine dealing with this as you are trying to earn a basic living, find reliable child care, get new vocational skills, or attend to medical needs. Women and workers of color most acutely struggle with this practice. Women comprise over two-thirds of the nearly 20 million workers in low-wage jobs like home health care, fast food work, and cash services. Similarly, a large proportion of minorities work low-wage jobs. Nearly 50% of African-Americans and Latinos receive their hours with a week or less notice. By comparison, almost 40%  of whites receive weekly notice. Minorities also have much less of an ability to control their hours. Only 10% of Latinos and 12% of black workers reported being able to set their hours within certain limits or freely. Within this same context, 18% of whites said they could. Child care is the primary casualty of just-in-time scheduling. Because of erratic shifts, child care centers often can't accommodate a working mother's schedule. Many must attend to informal arrangements, which by nature are unstable and unreliable. Traditional economic safeguards have offered little help to these workers. Unions, for example, have provided little protection against just-in-time scheduling because of their nascent role in the service economy. Real solutions exist. States and cities are enacting laws to address scheduling abuses. New York, Minnesota and Michigan previously introduced promising legislation. And in December, San Francisco became the first jurisdiction to pass a ""retail worker bill of rights."" This ordinance limits how chain stores can alter their employees' schedules. Still, there is no substitute for federal action. Too many people work in states with little protection. Washington ignores the problem because congressional Republicans have shown little interest in the plight of low-wage workers. Last summer, The Schedules that Work Act was introduced in Congress. According to the National Women's Law Center, the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules, receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes, and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss. Although the bill expired last session it will likely be reintroduced. And yet the bill will most likely not pass. Congressional Republicans have demonstrated they are more interested in unraveling worker protections under the guise of supporting economic growth. Conservatives should embrace this work-schedule legislation. The bill protects families and allows them to attend to their many obligations, not just work. Protecting shift workers is likewise good for business. Studies show that workers who exercise greater control over their hours are happier and more efficient. Conversely, just-in-time scheduling increases worker turnover and hurts worker satisfaction. While Washington stalls, it's everyday Americans who are hurt. It's the single mom in Chattanooga working as a Walmart cashier who's juggling work and childcare for her kids. It's the Arby's line cook in Fort Worth who needs reliable shifts to make her dialysis treatments. It's the stock man at an Amazon fulfillment center in Lehigh Valley who can't get his son to pre-algebra tutoring because of his erratic shifts. Our leaders have the unique responsibility to protect America and attend to the critical economic challenges of our time. Even with the weaker-than-expected jobs report we know our overall economy is improving, yet income-inequality is deepening. Congress must endorse a recovery that's inclusive, livable, and one that enables every family to balance competing obligations. They can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices.","Vijay Das: So-so jobs numbers contain truth that worries labor experts: Too much American job growth is in part-time low-income work.
He says erratic work schedules tied to customer traffic wreaks havoc with low-wage workers' lives. Congress can fix this ."
"Nairobi, Kenya  (CNN)They were sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, friends and fellow citizens. They were students and dreamers, pursuing their ambition for a better life. And on Tuesday night, Kenyans remembered them as innocent victims of a terrorist attack that stunned a nation and left communities heartbroken. The gathering started with quiet chatter among a crowd of hundreds before mourners went silent and moved toward one end of Nairobi's Uhuru Park. Organizers unloaded 147 crosses from a truck and quietly planted them in the ground. Mourners read names of some of the victims as candles flickered in the dark. The crowd then sang the national anthem. The attack at a university in Garissa on Thursday killed 147 people, mostly students. The Al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility. As the country mourned the victims, others took to social media to humanize them by sharing their stories. They talked about aspiring lawyers, doctors and teachers. ""I can't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying,"" said Mary Wambui, 32, who lives in Nakuru, hundreds of miles from Garissa. ""They were just children. They were trying to make a better life for themselves. Some were first to go to college in their communities. They died trying to get an education."" Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber, Kenyans used social media to talk about the lives of the victims. They shared pictures of beaming faces, full of life and energy, in happier days. They talked about parents too shocked to speak after identifying their children's bodies. ""We need to talk about the bright futures cut short,"" said Boniface Mwangi, who organized the vigil. ""Today's meeting will be a calling to say, 'We need to remember the 147; they are not just a number.' We are trying to avoid remembering these people as just a number."" Some students remain unaccounted for, and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the names of the victims. At Uhuru Park, right next to the crosses, a bulletin board featured 32 photos of the young students. ""With the previous attacks, there's been a sense of the victims just being numbers,""  Doreen Areri said. ""The idea behind this is to have faces behind the numbers. We need to hear their stories, their dreams."" Kellie Murungi said she got some solace from the vigil. ""In 2010, I was in a grenade attack in downtown Nairobi and every time there's a terrorist attack, it hits too close to home,"" Murungi said. "" It's not just happened to me, but many others."" The vigil was important for the healing process, she said, because ""we shouldn't have people walking around with scars."" It was the deadliest attack in the nation since al Qaeda killed more than 200 people at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998. In the Garissa attack, the terrorists separated Christians from Muslims, making some recite verses from the Quran. Those who couldn't quote the holy book tried to flee the gunfire, but whizzing bullets sent them to the ground. Others scampered into closets and stayed there for hours. Images from the scene showed heaps of students, faces down, lying in pools of blood. ""Those images will haunt us forever,"" said Martin Otieno, 29, who lives in Nairobi. ""As a nation, we should never let this happen. We just can't."" Kenya launched airstrikes Monday targeting Al-Shabaab's training camps in Somalia, according to a military source, adding that the strikes were not retribution for last week's massacre at the university. ""The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011. It is not a retaliation to the Garissa attack. The operation has been ongoing,"" the source said Monday. Kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre awaiting transport, a police source said Monday. It's unclear why the elite team was stuck in the Kenyan capital about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of the attack. Kenyan politicians and Nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did. Once the team entered the university complex, the hourslong siege was quickly defused. But a government spokesman defended the response time. ""With the benefit of hindsight, you can always say things could have been done better,"" said Manoah Esipisu, a spokesman for Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. However, he added, Kenyan authorities ""got the job done"" and saved lives. Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed echoed that sentiment in an interview with CNN on Monday. She denied reports that an elite rapid response team single-handedly ended the siege. ""We have a military garrison in Garissa, and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists. So the response was adequate,"" she said. ""We did everything that we could do."" Kenya's Interior Ministry named Mohamed Mohamud as the organizer of the attack. The  senior Al-Shabaab leader is also known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, it said. The ministry offered  a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, or about $215,000, for information on his whereabouts. He is in charge of external operations against Kenya, according to a government document, and commands the militia along the border. Another terrorist involved in the attacks is Abdirahim Abdullahi, a Kenyan-Somali  and the son of a  government chief in Mandera, authorities said. Mandera is in northern Kenya. Dorm becomes scene of a slaughter . Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, and its violence has spread to Kenya before.  In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, leaving 67 people dead. The terror group has intensified attacks in Kenya since the country sent troops to Somalia four years ago to help battle the militants. CNN's David McKenzie and Joseph Netto reported from Nairobi, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed from Los Angeles.","Kenyans gather in Nairobi to remember victims of a terrorist attack that stunned a nation .

"(CNN)Slamming world powers' framework nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday demanded that any final deal include a ""clear and unambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel's right to exist."" Netanyahu has been perhaps the most vocal critic of nuclear talks with Iran, insisting again and again it can't be trusted. He took his case to the U.S. Congress last month, at a time before negotiators had hammered out any sort of agreement, over the objections of President Barack Obama. There's never been any dispute about his take, but the Prime Minister has sharpened his rhetoric in recent days, saying the deal increases the risk of a ""horrific war."" Iranian President: We will stick to our promises on nuclear deal . Netanyahu has lobbied hard for a deal that dismantles and disassembles Iran's nuclear infrastructure -- rather than limiting its usage or repurposing Iran's facilities -- but such stipulations were not part of the framework agreement. He has also called for the removal of sanctions to be tied to the reduction of what he characterizes as Iran's aggression in the region, not just its moves on its nuclear program . In the absence of both elements, Netanyahu is calling the emerging deal a historic mistake. After an emergency Cabinet meeting Friday afternoon hours before the Jewish holiday of Passover, Netanyahu said the agreement ""would pose a grave danger to the region and to the world and would threaten the very survival of the state of Israel."" "" ... I want to make clear to all: The survival of Israel is non-negotiable,"" Netanyahu said. ""Israel will not accept an agreement which allows a country that vows to annihilate us to develop nuclear weapons, period."" Obama called Netanyahu after Thursday's announcement of the framework agreement to reassure him that Israel's security will remain a prime concern in the ensuing negotiations and the final deal, which faces a June 30 deadline. ""There is no daylight when it comes to our support for Israel's security,"" Obama said, reaffirming the American commitment to Israel's security. But Netanyahu said he isn't convinced Israel is safe from Iran. ""Just two days ago, Iran said that 'the destruction of Israel is non-negotiable.' And in these fateful days Iran is accelerating the arming of its terror proxies to attack Israel."" The Israeli leader added that ""this deal would legitimize Iran's nuclear program, bolster Iran's economy and increase Iran's aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond.""","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slams nuclear framework deal with Iran .

"(CNN)Build a wall the length of the border with Somalia. Recruit and train up thousands of new security officers. Give them better tactics and equipment. Kenya's politicians and public have struggled with these ideas over and over. But the blood of 147 people slaughtered and 79 more injured, when Al-Shabaab opened fire at a college campus in Garissa on Thursday, has them debating them with renewed vigor. Many Kenyans had believed that security improved enough since Al-Shabaab held Nairobi's Westgate Mall under siege for four days in September 2013, resulting in the deaths of 67 people. Had it not, the massacre at Garissa University College would have been far worse, some say. Two police officers were on duty. But the number of people killed in the attack is plaguing Kenyans with self-doubt. With the highest death toll since the 1998 al Qaeda bombing on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, many are saying security is still not tight enough. And days after the attack authorities revealed that rapid response forces arrived hours late, allowing the killings to drag on. So what should Kenya do? The answer is elusive. The battle with Al-Shabaab is not a new one, and every attempt at countering them has only helped stall the inevitable -- another attack, more deaths. Here are some of the problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts. The notion of building a wall is somewhat grandiose, since the border runs some 700 kilometers or 435 miles. Even with a wall, militants could arrive by sea to coastal towns in Kenya that have been Islamist strongholds. The border crosses through remote areas, and many Somalis have fled their country south to Kenya. Garissa, for example is populated by mainly ethnic Somalis. The border region has become so violent that many non-Muslims have fled it, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The students at the university, many of them Christians, hailed mostly from other parts of Kenya. But Kenyans also cross north into Somalia, some to fight for Al-Shabaab, then they return home to help whip up fervor with its Kenyan affiliate al Hijra, CFR has said. The security situation may have deteriorated in recent years after Kenya's incursion into Somalia to battle Al-Shabaab there, CNN's David McKenzie said. Kenya wiped out some of the group's key bases there in Operation Linda Nchi, which began in 2011. But it made the group more diffuse -- and more likely to pop up and hit soft targets in Kenya, said terrorism expert Sajjan Gohel. It's also simply very difficult to protect every single target from attacks -- especially in Kenya. ""It will be impossible to provide adequate security throughout the country,"" Gohel said. Kenya will need a lot more help from its neighbors and the international community, including the United States, to contain Al-Shabaab. ""Al-Shabaab is not just a local terrorist group, it's a transnational outfit,"" he said. ""It operates throughout a number of countries and recruits even people from the West."" McKenzie says Al-Shabaab is trying to maintain its relevance as other terror groups like Boko Haram, ISIS and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula vie for power and influence. It's also possible that Al-Shabaab may have abandoned aspirations of seizing a large chunk of territory after taking losses in Somalia, and decided instead to focus purely on terrorism. These attacks by small armed groups against civilians are cost-effective, Gohel said. ""If the group's infrastructure and resources remain intact in Kenya, we will see more attacks taking place. This is not a one-off incident."" Allegiances among groups can also play a role. In 2012, Al-Shabaab declared complete allegiance to al Qaeda. Previously, there had been a rift among the Somali terrorists over whether or not to pursue global jihad or just to concentrate on Somalia. Courts have snagged parts of Kenya's security plans over fears of government overreach. Kenya's government had recently passed a controversial law giving itself broad powers in the war on terror. But the High Court saw it as an affront to civil rights, and it struck down many of its details early this year, according to CFR. This included blocking the enrollment of 10,000 new police recruits. On Thursday, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta gave a directive to have them processed. He has already been accused of taking advantage of the public's fear of Al-Shabaab to widen police powers. Kenyatta's government, which is Christian dominated, has wielded an abusive hand against ethnic Somalis and other Muslims in Kenya, CFR and Human Rights Watch both have said. In April, security forces carried out raids in Nairobi and in regions with large Muslim populations, targeting ethnic Somalis. ""Security officers from multiple agencies raided homes, buildings, and shops, carting away money, cell phones, and other goods,"" HRW said. ""They harassed and detained thousands -- including journalists, refugees, Kenyan citizens and international aid workers -- without charge, and in appalling conditions for periods well beyond the 24-hour legal limit."" The draconian approach has helped create fertile ground for extremists looking to radicalize individuals. The United Kingdom included Garissa in a recent warning of an imminent attack. And last month, the U.S. Embassy warned of possible attacks ""throughout Kenya in the near-term"" after the reported death of a key al-Shabaab leader, Adan Garaar, who was accused in the Westgate attack. Some Kenyans are now asking why security forces did not react to those warnings in advance by putting security in place. CNN's Soni Methu reported from Nairobi, and Ben Brumfield wrote this story in Atlanta; CNN's Nick Thompson contributed to this report.","Kenya's security has been bogged down by concerns over civil rights .

"(CNN)Most climbers who try don't succeed in summiting the 29,035-foot-high Mount Everest, the world's tallest peak. But they do leave their trash. Thousands of pounds of it. That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today. The mountain is part of the Himalaya mountain range on the border between Nepal and the Tibet region. The 34-member team plans to depart for Kathmandu on Saturday and start the ascent in mid-May. The upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first Indian team to scale Mount Everest. ""Sadly, Mount Everest is now ... called the world's highest junkyard,"" Maj. Ranveer Singh Jamval, the team leader, told India Today. ""We will target the mountaineering waste from Camp 1 (19,695 feet) to the summit,"" said Jamval, who has scaled Mount Everest twice. ""There are old cylinders, tents, tins, packets, equipment and other mountaineering waste. Apart from our own haversacks weighing 10 kg each, we intend to bring in another 10 kg each on the trip."" More than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian expedition isn't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers. Among the cleanup efforts is the Eco Everest Expedition, an annual trip launched in 2008 that is all about climbing ""in an eco-sensitive manner,"" bringing old refuse, in addition to that generated during the trip, down for disposal, according to the Asian Trekking website. Last year, Nepalese tourism authorities started to require hikers to carry out an extra 18 pounds of garbage, in addition to their own trash and human waste, according to the New York Times.","Generations of Everest climbers have left tons of trash .

"(CNN)Iran's President on Friday hailed the proposed international deal on his country's nuclear program, vowing that Iran will stick to its promises and -- assuming other countries live up to their end of the bargain -- become a more active, engaged player in world affairs. ""Some think that we should either fight ... or we should surrender to other powers,"" President Hassan Rouhani said. ""However, we believe none of that. There is a third path. We can cooperate with the world."" Rouhani said his government kept its word to Iranians when negotiating the framework deal, which was agreed upon Thursday and sets parameters for talks that could lead to a comprehensive deal by a June 30 deadline. Chief among them is that Iran would keep at least some centrifuges and no longer face international sanctions. He thanked Iranians for their patience and for ""resisting"" by standing up for the country's rights. As to the rest of the world, the Iranian President said he thinks most now realize that Iran ""is pursuing peaceful objectives."" That means trying to develop nuclear energy, not nuclear weapons, as many feared. That fear, combined with distrust of Iran's leaders, spurred the sanctions and the Middle Eastern nation's isolation. ""We do not lie,"" Rouhani said, vowing that Iran will be true to its word, ""provided the other parties will implement their own promises."" What Iranians think of the deal . Those promises include reducing Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98% for 15 years and significantly scaling back its number of installed centrifuges. Still, while it will be shrunken and centralized, Iran's nuclear program won't go away. What should happen -- assuming there's a common view that Tehran is doing as required -- is that countries will end their sanctions. That was non-negotiable for Iran, with Rouhani saying the deal shows his government's commitment to removing a major ""obstacle ... for business"" by addressing the world's worries about its nuclear program. ""We need economic productivity, employment for the youth and development of non-oil products,"" he said. ""Thus our people can witness better things for their welfare."" It won't be easy, of course, to get Iran and the P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- on the same page regarding the nitty-gritty details of any final agreement, if there is one. After all, it took two extra days past a self-imposed deadline for the parties to reach a framework deal. What's in the deal? 7 key points . That agreement followed about a decade of often failed negotiations and deep-rooted acrimony, particularly between Iran and the United States. Those tensions haven't disappeared, nor is there any guarantee that talks won't fall apart again over the next three months. Even as he applauded what he called a ""good deal,"" President Barack Obama pointed out Thursday that ""if Iran cheats, the world will know it."" His government is also being pressed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who blasted the agreement Friday as posing a ""grave danger"" by legitimizing Iran's nuclear program and making it easier for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. On the Iranian side, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has acknowledged that ""mutual mistrust"" has long plagued talks. He notes Iran still has ""serious differences with the United States,"" even after Thursday's agreement. Still, Rouhani expressed hopes Friday the nuclear negotiations will change that by further opening up Iran to the rest of world, including long-standing adversaries. ""We do shake hands with them. ... Even those countries we have tensions with, we would like an end to the animosity,"" he said. ""Cooperation and interaction would be in the interest of everyone.""

"(CNN)Every week in the heart of Nima, a slum in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, families congregate at a local mosque. When the time comes, young girls say goodbye to their loved ones and part ways, filing up concrete steps leading up to the floor above. There, inside a large room dotted with brown tables, rows of flashing computer screens await for them. ""When the parents are praying [downstairs], we are teaching the girls upstairs,"" explains tech entrepreneur Regina Agyare, who comes here every week to teach local teens how to code. Agyare's first visit to see the girls -- students at education project Achievers Ghana -- was in January 2014. This was supposed to be a one-off seminar as part of her mentorship initiative ""Tech Needs Girls"" -- however, the students proved quite a draw. ""I fell in love with them, so I decided to set up a coding club and started having regular sessions,"" says Agyare, founder of software development company Soronko Solutions. More importantly, continues Agyare, it offered the opportunity to show ""the community the value of educating girls."" A predominantly Muslim area in a largely Christian nation, Nima has one of the densest populations in Accra. Agyare says life is often challenging for many  local girls, with some growing up without ever leaving the community. ""Girls were being forced to marry early; [denied] their right to go to school. Most of their dreams and aspirations were limited to just what was around them. ""I was shocked... I thought we had progressed as a nation. I thought we had gone past that."" This, in part, was why Agyare lent her support to Achievers Ghana. Set up by local Amadu Mohammad, the non-profit organization supports 250 girls between the age of six and 18, priming them for formal education through extracurricular classes in reading, math, poetry and information technology. Its goal is to break through social barriers and provide Nima with a generation of female role models, and so the group provides school funding to help the girls shape their own future. The project was bequeathed its classroom above the mosque it shares a building with, and Agyare says the two work closely together. Achievers Ghana met initial resistance from local conservatives, but when the mosque's chief imam Sheik Hussein Abdul Rahman championed Mohammad's vision, few maintained their reservations. Now, with parents paying a nominal fee towards the running of the organization, it is in everyone's interest that the girls succeed. Fourteen months after her first visit, Agyare's coding class is well established. She has set up a mentor scheme as part of ""Tech Needs Girls,"" recruiting and training women at university to act as role models for her younger students in Nima. In each class, around 50 girls are taught HTML and run a blog called ""Slum Voices"". ""I definitely feel [technology] has given them more of a voice,"" Agyare says. ""I feel like it's allowed them to express themselves and interact with others... for them, it's important to be heard."" Some girls had never used a computer before the classes began, but Agyare's even-handed approach has brought all her students up to the same standard. Agyare insists that ""we don't leave anyone behind."" To that end, a few young male faces have found their way into her classroom. This was an accidental revelation, according to Agyare. She details the story of one affronted boy. ""He wrote that he didn't like it when he saw girls learning about computers... it was difficult [for him] to see girls being empowered; he wasn't used to that."" Agyare realized that by integrating genders in her classroom she could begin to confront gender expectations. For many boys the role of a girl is ""to be their wife,"" Agyare explains, ""and she needs to be taken care of."" However, by running mixed classes boys from an early age ""can learn to see a woman as a contributing person [within society]."" Now the hope is that many of the young students will be able to go to university -- and Achievers Ghana is working on a scholarship program to make the prospect attainable. Agyare says the goal is not to turn every girl into software developers but to enable them to ""use technology in whatever field they find themselves."" She adds: ""It would be great if we had some girls that decided to go on and study computer science, but really it's about helping them reach their full potential ... and bring change to the community.""

"(CNN)""It really depends what you want. Boy? Girl? Young? Old?"" The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader. After a week of back and forth phone calls, his initial caginess had given way to greed. He'd heard my foreign accent and clearly decided I would pay more than the domestic rate. ""We can get,"" he said. We'd been put in touch with the man through a contact on the ground. We were told he was one of the men running this ""unofficial"" displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of Yola as the influx of people fleeing Boko Haram has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps. It had all been heartbreakingly simple. We'd asked who had children available to ""foster"" -- a catch-all code word designed to conceal the true intent of those offering up the orphaned children. The man on the phone was the end result of those inquiries. When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take. One, two maybe? He escaped by saying he needed to check with his ""madam"" -- me. I called. The man picked up and began referring to me as ""sister."" I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to ""foster"" the children. He told me, ""Sister, Jesus will reward me,"" so the ""fostering"" was free, he said. No need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children, if I chose to take them, would ""live in my heart."" If I could also then find it ""in my heart"" to donate to those still in the camp, then that would be ""God's work."" In spite of the harsh measures the Nigerian government has put in place to punish human traffickers, by the government's own admission, 8 million children are currently engaged in forced labor. The Global Slavery Index says Nigeria has the highest number of people in modern slavery of any sub-Saharan country. Paradoxically, the group also rates Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency, Naptip, as one of the strongest government responses on the continent -- but it's clearly overwhelmed by the realities of working in what is now a zone of military operations, Nigeria's north. As the insecurity in the region has spiraled, the worry is that more and more children are falling through the cracks. And as Boko Haram increases its reliance on child suicide bombers, concerns are growing that orphaned children could end up in the hands of the terror group. At the camp where we finally met the man face to face, there was no attempt at subterfuge. We spoke in normal tones in full view of the children playing. I could have had one of them, I was told, but because I'd specified a younger child, they'd only identified one so far -- a 3-year-old. Did I want to consider an older girl? A 12-year-old maybe? She could look after the 3-year-old, and cook and clean. Either way, two girls would be ready tomorrow, he said. I could see them then. Our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate ""donation"" would be in exchange for the children. He couldn't, he said, bargain for it. He then proceeded to do just that, laughing down the phone at my first tentative guess of $200. Laughing again at $300. We finally found a figure he didn't find funny -- $500. I put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show Naptip what we'd found.","CNN team finds a man at ""unofficial"" displaced camp willing to provide children to be ""fostered""

"Garissa, Kenya (CNN)First came the gunshots. Then the footsteps, as Al-Shabaab militants followed her into her dorm room. Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds, until the gunmen called them out. ""(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,"" Cheroitich told CNN. ""And then, if you know, you go to the other side."" The 19-year-old student at Kenya's Garissa University College didn't see what happened next, but she heard more than enough. ""They were shooting everywhere,"" she said. ""I didn't want to open my eyes."" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. ""I was scared so much,"" she recalled. Cheroitich's survival story, which she recounted to CNN on Saturday, is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in Garissa, a town about 90 miles from the Somali border, and throughout Kenya. It is all due to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but hasn't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised ""another bloodbath"" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nadif Jama, the governor of Garissa county. ""The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,"" Jama said. ""They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business."" Jama said the militants were ""bent on nothing but destruction"" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. ""But that is something we need to fight,"" Jama said. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. ""These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,"" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as any those who supported them. Five arrested in Kenya attack . In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism ""has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people."" Kenyatta condemned ""corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab."" ""There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,"" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an ""existential threat to our republic,"" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to ""tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state."" ""That fight will never change,"" he added. ""Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.""

"(CNN)A Florida judge denied a motion by two women to join a lawsuit against Prince Andrew and a prominent U.S. lawyer that alleged  underage sex crimes. Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- ""Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4"" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the ""lurid details"" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. ""The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim ... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken."" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: ""I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them."" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. ""He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week. Further details will be announced in due course,"" the palace said in a statement. Roberts' attorneys were not immediately available for comment. The federal court filing alleged that ""Doe 3"" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media, and Buckingham Palace included it in a statement. Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in January, including the one described as Jane Doe 3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a ""sex slave"" and made ""her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people."" Those big names allegedly included Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. According to the filing, ""Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands."" The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case ""is all about money"" and ""completely made up."" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said ""lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably."" ""Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,"" he said. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. ""Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,"" he stated, ""that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.""

"Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)The bad news? The deadline to agree on what will be the parameters for an endgame pact on Iran's nuclear program has come and gone with no deal. The good news? The sides are still talking. Whether your glass is half-full or half-empty, it doesn't change the fact that it's not easy to reach resolutions on complex issues involving nuclear physics and international relations. Nor does it change the fact that Tuesday's self-imposed deadline didn't really matter anyway: The date that really counts is June 30, when the parties must figure out a comprehensive deal -- with all the technical details and diplomatic impasses fully worked out -- or else everything falls apart. The whole point of what's happening in Lausanne, Switzerland, is to get everyone on the same page about what kinds of things will be discussed as part of a potential conclusive agreement. For those hoping that will eventually happen, it's good that Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and senior European Union diplomat Helga Schmid held talks early Thursday morning in Lausanne. But it doesn't mean there will be a final deal. ""We have made significant progress over the last few days, but it has been slow going,"" British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told reporters Wednesday. ""I'm optimistic that we will make further progress ... but it does mean the Iranians being willing to meet us where there are still issues to deal with. ""Fingers crossed, and we'll hope to get there during the course of the day."" But by Thursday morning, there was still no deal. Zarif told reporters that Iran has shown ""its readiness to engage with dignity, and it's time for our negotiating partners to seize the moment and use this opportunity, which may not be repeated."" ""I've always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together. They are mutually exclusive,"" the Iranian minister said. ""So our friends need to decide whether they want to be with Iran based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure. They have tested the other one. It is high time to test this one."" U.S. State Department official Marie Harf said on Twitter that talks between Kerry and Zarif ran deep into the early hours of Thursday morning. ""That was truly an all-nighter,"" she tweeted around 6 a.m. local time (12 a.m. ET), saying the negotiations had broken up and would resume again in a few hours. ‎Another U.S. official had said earlier that ""some serious issues remain unresolved."" ""It is still totally unclear when this might happen, if it happens at all."" There's one thing that most everyone does agree on: The sides have made progress in recent days. In fact, Zarif called it ""very good"" progress that led to solutions on most issues, according to IRNA, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. As long as ""the conversations continue to be productive,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said, U.S. officials will keep on talking. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov -- whose country has been taking part in the talks, along with Germany, France, Britain and the European Union -- went so far as to say ""with a large degree of confidence"" that ""framework agreements have been reached on all the key aspects of this issue at the ministerial level."" ""We hope that these agreements will be put on paper in the next few hours or a day at the most,"" Lavrov said before leaving the talks along with his counterparts from China and France. ""The agreement stipulates a comprehensive approach to settling this issue, including IAEA verification of the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program and detailed provisions on lifting the sanctions."" But it doesn't matter if Russia or Germany is comfortable with the details; the key is getting the United States and Iran on the same page, something that's hard given the decades of contempt and distrust.  According to an IRNA report, Zarif said only that he hopes a framework agreement will be drafted Wednesday. ""I think it's a matter of political will. It's not just about technical details anymore,"" said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle East studies at the London School of Economics. ""You're talking here about an institutionalized relationship of hostility between the United States and Iran."" Even then, Gerges on Wednesday gave the sides a 60% to 70% chance of coming to some sort of preliminary agreement soon. His reasoning: ""I think there is a convergence of interests between Obama's administration and the Iranian leadership, and that's why both camps have a vested interest in signing an agreement, as opposed to walking away."" For Iran, which insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, a deal would mean relief from punishing economic sanctions. For the West, it would offer hope of improved relations with Tehran without the destabilizing threat of an Iranian nuclear bomb in the pipeline. The sides have oftentimes talked past each other for nine years. That's why Iran is facing crippling sanctions in the first place: because many world powers felt they could not trust Tehran, given its dealings with nuclear inspectors and in talks. The tone changed with the 2013 election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who campaigned on a platform of reducing international tensions. And there has been some movement, including in recent days, out of Iran. Still, it's too early to say that everyone will meet in the middle on everything. Mohammad Marandi, a professor of North American studies at Tehran University, told CNN that Iranian officials feel they've already compromised a lot in the talks. ""They feel that they've gone as far as they possibly can and that it's for the Americans right now to make a move,"" he said. 21 questions on Iranian nuclear talks . The main sticking points at the moment are believed to be the pace at which U.N. sanctions on Iran will be lifted, how much nuclear research and development Iran will be able to maintain and whether Iran will ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of the country for reprocessing into a safer form. Even if those points are resolved to the satisfaction of all sides, any agreement is expected to come under attack on multiple fronts. Obama is likely to face a stern challenge selling any deal to Congress, while hardliners in Iran will probably denounce it for being too harsh. The leader of Israel, a key U.S. ally that considers Iran to be an existential threat, on Tuesday said ""the agreement that is being formed in Lausanne is paving the road to that result."" And on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu obliquely suggested that the United States could be threatened as well. ""The Middle East is plagued by anti-Western, anti-democratic and anti-American extremism. ... Despots lead their people in chants of 'Death to America' while building intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach America. In this violent and unstable region, where states are exploding,"" said Netanyahu, referring to some Iranian leaders and reports that Iran could develop intercontinental missiles. Iran's power rises, with or without deal . Obama administration officials say that any agreement would involve heavy monitoring of Iran's nuclear activities. They insist no deal would be better than signing a bad deal. But if no agreement is reached and the talks fall apart, the potential consequences are deeply unsettling. Further sanctions on Iran would most likely follow. Israel argues that could eventually force Tehran back to the negotiating table to settle for a tougher deal. But Obama administration officials say they fear Iran will redouble efforts to advance its nuclear program without any meaningful international inspections. Iranian progress toward a nuclear weapon could spark an arms race in the Middle East and talk of military strikes from the United States or Israel. ""The military option will remain on the table,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told NBC's ""Today"" show on Tuesday. ""If there is a good agreement to have, obviously it's worth waiting for and completing the negotiations."" CNN's Elise Labott reported from Lausanne, and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Jim Sciutto, Steve Almasy, Nimet Kirac and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Talks run until early Thursday morning; expected to resume hours later .

"Washington  (CNN)The flight voice recorder aboard Germanwings Flight 9525 reportedly captured blaring cockpit alarms, warning co-pilot Andreas Lubitz to ""pull up"" and that ""terrain"" was ahead. But that was not enough to stop the aircraft from slamming into the French Alps. With reports that Lubitz apparently ignored those warnings, there are new calls from aviation experts to develop and deploy enhanced crash avoidance software that could take control of an aircraft away from a pilot and steer the plane to a safe altitude. The technology would work in a fashion similar to crash avoidance technology already used in automobiles. If a pilot is incapacitated or ignores audible warnings, the plane's flight guidance software could take over and plot a course to a safe altitude‎. In cars, these avoidance systems sometimes deploy brakes or slow a car down to a safer speed, and help maintain safe distances from other vehicles. The idea is not new. In fact, more than 10 years ago, following 9/11, Airbus, the manufacturer of the doomed aircraft, was working to d‎evelop aircraft crash avoidance software with tech giant Honeywell -- in part to prevent jetliners from being flown into large buildings or mountains. But the project was ultimately scrapped. A spokesperson for Honeywell says the company has no plans to revive the project unless federal regulators demand it be put into cockpits or airlines ask for it. So far that has not happened. CNN also asked Airbus about the project, but the company had no comment. Former Department of Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo says pilots, regulators and the traveling public have, so far, not bought into claims that computers can do it better. ""For any situation where you are relieving the pilot's control of their plane, there has been pushback not only from the pilots, but from airlines. There are some sectors that believe that ultimately the pilot must maintain overall control of the plane and that that is your best bet for a safe flight."" However, she adds, in the case of the Germanwings crash, ""this technology, I believe, would have saved the flight. Not only would it have saved this flight and the Germanwings passengers, it would also save lives in situations where it is not a suicidal, homicidal pilot. It has implications literally for safer flight across the industry."" Pilots' groups point to numerous instances where a pilot's training and perhaps unconventional thinking actually saved lives. For example, in 2009 Capt. C.B. Sullenberger crash-landed U.S. Airways flight 1549 into the Hudson River in New York, after a flock of geese was sucked into both of its engines and the A320 lost all thrust. The formal National Transportation Safety Board report on the crash said the main thing that contributed to the survivability of the accident was ""the decision-making of the flight crewmembers and their crew resource management during the accident sequence."" In other words, when Sullenberger decided to ditch the plane in the Hudson, he saved the 150 passengers and five crew members on board. Pilots say if a computer had taken over after it sensed the plane was headed for water, the outcome could have been very different. Commercial airline pilot John Barton says there are other considerations to take into account as well. ""In systems like this ... the control cannot be taken back from the aircraft. Or, indiscriminately the aircraft could be taken over on just a normal flight and they (cockpit crew) wouldn't be able to get control back. I think it is going to take a long time to operationally test this kind of technology before it is foolproof."" He also worries that the autopilot software could be vulnerable to hackers. ""More and more people will come to know the technology. They will work on the technology and therefore there will be bad people that will be able to exploit that technology. That's not a good thing."" But in an incident like the Germanwings tragedy, where a pilot is being blamed for the crash, Schiavo says there must be additional safeguards and that this technology would be a start. ""Most of the major commercial jetliner crashes in the last two or three years could have been saved with an override."" Barton says there are already plenty of safeguards in place in the United States. For example, he says, the Federal Aviation Administration rule that two people must always be in the cockpit during a flight might also have saved the Germanwings flight. That is a practice that several overseas carriers -- including Germanwings and its parent company, Lufthansa -- have now adopted. ""The solution to the problem simply is for the rest of the world globally to adhere to the standards that the United States has used forever, and that is sound hiring practices, safety and training and security practices.""  Barton says.","Autopilot could have taken control of Germanwings flight and flown plane to safe altitude .
But some experts say taking control away from humans could lead to other dangers .
Another concern: Autopilot might be vulnerable to hackers ."
"(CNN)At least 54 people have died and 15 others are missing after a Russian fishing vessel sank off the Kamchatka Peninsula, according to Russia's state-run Tass news agency. More than 60 people were rescued Thursday from the chilly waters in Russia's Far East. The Dalniy Vostok freezer trawler -- a commercial fishing vessel -- was carrying 132 people, the ministry said. Of the people on board, 78 were Russians. The 54 others were foreign nationals from Myanmar, Ukraine, Lithuania and Vanuatu, according to the news agency, with the majority coming from Myanmar. More than 20 fishing vessels are searching for the 15 people still thought to be missing, Tass said. The shipwreck was swift, with the trawler going down in the Sea of Okhotsk within 15 minutes of getting into difficulties, the news agency reported. The most likely cause of the shipwreck was collision with an obstacle which damaged the hull, the official spokesman of Russia's Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, is quoted as saying. The trawler is also thought to have keeled over as a result of hauling some 80 tons of fish on to the deck, the chairman of the emergencies commission in the Kamchatka region, Sergey Khabarov, told Tass.","Fishing vessels are searching for 15 people still thought to be missing .

""He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,"" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a ""guerilla satirist.""

He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit ""Cry,"" which Freberg rendered as ""Try."" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including ""St. George and the Dragonet,"" a 1953 send-up of the series ""Dragnet."" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, ""That's Rich."" Three years later, he presented ""The Stan Freberg Show"" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: ""Mad Men's"" return . He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for ""The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows."" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy ""Time for Beany,"" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an ""office"" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show ""Toast of the Town."" Hollywood Reporter: ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" -- the untold story . Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as ""Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,"" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in ""Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was ""More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,"" and he even had a corporate motto: ""Ars Gratia Pecuniae"" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon ""What's Brewin', Bruin,"" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's ""Three Little Bops."" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955).

"(CNN)Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately. After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov. Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the state will ""fix"" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians. Pence is making the right call. Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one. Not all people who dislike the law hate religion, and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the LGBT community. If people of good will come together, liberty and equality can both be saved. The unbelievably easy way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one small amendment, one easy line codifying that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm. In general, it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations. As Americans, we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion. Sometimes, a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects, but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few. In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption. Shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves; it simply sends the message that religion is important, and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why, people should be allowed to practice as they need. These are the reasons why the federal RFRA was passed in 1993, and why it had bipartisan support. These are wholesome American values that everyone can get behind. The problem is that we no longer live in 1993, 10 years before Lawrence v. Texas, and 20 before U.S. v. Windsor. In 1993, our sensibilities were different; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the LGBT community. Timing matters because society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened we cannot just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago, before we realized its negative potential. Even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination, we still have to take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' claim about unintended consequences. To put it simply, you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with. The concern is real. Because Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief. Public perceptions matter. Whether or not lawmakers think so, it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in Baskin v. Bogans that Indiana's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Writing for the Seventh Circuit panel in 2014, Judge Richard Posner's rationale in the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the RFRA deficiency without changing what it is that it defends. Courts have long held that a religious exemption cannot be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party, and -- as Posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful. RFRAs are not inherently evil. The message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected. The principles of RFRA can remain unchanged; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves. A few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation, send an important message about the value of equality, and make Indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation: the real ""crossroads of America."" Doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work.","Gov. Mike Pence is making the right call to fix Indiana's religious freedom law, which can be used for discrimination .

"(CNN)Universal's ""Furious 7"" is about to make history.""Furious 7"" — the final film from the late Paul Walker — is expected to gross $115 million or more when opening at the North American box office this weekend, the top showing ever for an April title, not accounting for inflation.Domestically, it is getting the widest release in Universal's history with a theater count of roughly 4,003 (including Imax locations), eclipsing ""Despicable Me 2"" (3,956). Anything north of 4,000 is usually reserved for summer tentpoles and year-end titles. Overseas, the movie is also poised to do massive business, putting its global debut north of $250 million. ""Furious 7"" is opening day-and-date around the world on 10,500 screens in 63 territories, save for a few major markets including China, Russia and Japan. THR: 'Furious 7' scores Thailand release despite Tony Jaa contract dispute . The current record-holder for top April opening domestically is ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" which debuted to $95 million from 3,928 theaters last year. ""Furious 7"" is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date. And if it beats the $121.9 million launch of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1"" in November 2014, it will mark the largest three-day opening since ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" ($158 million) in November 2013. The movie enjoys massive awareness and interest, due to both the popularity of the street-racing series and Walker's death. The last film,"" Fast & Furious 6,"" debuted to a franchise-best $117 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2012, including $97.4 million for the three days, on its way to grossing $788.7 million worldwide. Universal intended to open ""Furious 7"" on July 11, 2014, but production was halted in November 2013 when Walker died in a car crash during the Thanksgiving hiatus. After director James Wan, writer Chris Morgan and Universal pored over existing footage and tweaked the script, production resumed in April 2014. THR: Studio profitability report - Who's up and who's down . CGI and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring Walker's detective character, Brian O'Conner, with Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody, used as stand-ins. ""Furious 7"" pits Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and crew (which includes Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson, among others, as well as Walker) against Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw, out for revenge after the death of his brother. ""Furious 7"" is expected to usher in a string of mega-openings at the box office this year. Disney and Marvel's ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" set to open May 1, hasn't come on tracking yet, but some forecasters are already suggesting it could score the top opening of all time domestically, eclipsing the record-breaking start of ""The Avengers"" ($207 million) in 2012.
