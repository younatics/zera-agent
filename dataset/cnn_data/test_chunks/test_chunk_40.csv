"President Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop to the Bob Marley museum in Jamaica last night while on a visit to the country for a meeting with Caribbean leaders. The first president to visit Jamaica in three decades, Obama arrived in Kingston yesterday evening and was met by Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller, U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica Luis Moreno and a dozen other dignitaries. Obama promptly embraced the local color  by making an unscheduled late night visit to the museum dedicated to the island's most famous son. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Bob Marley museum while on an official visit to Jamaica . The U.S. President walks around the museum with tour guide Natasha Clark during his unannounced visit . On a tour of the house where the reggae legend lived until his death in 1981, Obama, looking relaxed in shirtsleeves, was shown a trophy room where Marley's Grammys and platinum records were on display. At the same time Marley's hit song 'One Love' played over the loudspeaker. The musician's family transformed the rambling property into a museum complete with a well-equipped 80-seat theatre, a photographic gallery, and a gift shop selling T-shirts, posters and CDs and other Bob Marley memorabilia. One of the rooms Obama explored held the late reggae star's platinum records and a Grammy award. Thee president looks at selection of Bob Marley's gold records at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston . The building was home to Marley until his death in 1981 and was converted into a museum by his family . 'What a wonderful tour,' the president told museum guide Natasha Clark. 'I still have all the albums.' Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc. The visit is part of an official Caribbean summit seeking to reassert U.S. leadership in the region at a time when oil-producing Venezuela's economic clout may be receding. The Caribbean region collectively cheered when Obama was first elected president in 2008. Calypso and reggae songs were written in his honor, the French Caribbean island of Martinique named a road after him, and Antigua's highest mountain officially became 'Mount Obama' as the small country saluted him as a symbol of black achievement. Obama thanked the guide for a wonderful tour and told her he still owns all of Bob Marley's albums . Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc to discuss energy and security . As the first U.S. president to visit Kingston since Ronald Reagan in 1982, Obama faces the challenge of convincing Caribbean island leaders that Washington is genuinely re-engaging after a long period of perceived neglect of its smaller, poorer neighbors. The visit is expected to be dominated by discussions on energy, security and trade with the 15-member Caribbean Community, or Caricom. Some analysts say a key reason why Washington is suddenly paying attention to the Caribbean Basin is that it wants to wean the islands off dependence on cut-rate Venezuelan oil that Caracas has long used to wield influence in the region. From Jamaica, Obama will travel to Panama to attend a Western Hemisphere summit, where Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has made clear he will confront Obama over new U.S. sanctions. Obama will also cross paths at the Summit of the Americas with Cuban President Raul Castro for the first time since the two announced a historic opening between their countries in December.","President Barack Obama in Jamaica for a meeting with Caribbean leaders .

The singer Pink hit back at those who criticised her weight at an event recently, saying that she was happy with her body . In a message posted to her Twitter account Pink jokingly referred to herself as 'cheesecake' and said that she felt beautiful in her dress . She continued: 'She was given the Duke Award for her tireless efforts and stellar contributions to the eradication of cancer. But unfortunately, my weight seems much more important to some of you. 'While I admit that the dress didn’t photograph as well as it did in my kitchen, I will also admit that I felt very pretty. In fact, I feel beautiful.

In 2012 Girls star and producer Lena Dunham hit back after she was criticised for wearing a pair of short shorts on the red carpet. In 2012 Lena Dunham recieved harsh criticism for this outfit. She said she didn't think a thinner woman would have been criticised in the same way . Lena told her critics: 'I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' She said at the time: 'Last week I wore something to an event...a big top and little shorts, and a bunch of [blog posts] came out that I had been out without pants [trousers],' 'I actually saw it...'Love it or hate it: The no-pants look.' My mom...thought it was so funny. 'My boyfriend was like, 'People seem to be worked up about you going out without pants.' But I didn't go out without pants! I had shorts on.' Lena continued: 'If Olivia Wilde had gone to a party in...little shorts, she might have been on a 'weird dressed list' or been told her outfit was cute. 'I don't think a girl with tiny thighs would have received such no-pants attention. I think what it really was...'Why did you all make us look at your thighs?' 'My response is, get used to it because I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.'

"Nearly 11 months after travelling to Syria and joining Islamic State, British fighter Hamza Parvez, 22, still hasn't found a wife and has been living with a group of unmarried fighters. Known as Abu Hamza al-Britani, the loveless British Pakistani fighter recently moved back to the Islamic State de-facto capital city of Raqqa in Syria, in search of love. He is now living in a house with a group of English speaking fighters, originally as far as Belgium, Finland and Australia. Hamza Parvez (left) standing next to Belgian fighter and close friend Abu Mariya al-Belgiki have been living together in a house in Raqqa, Syria. Over six months since he travelled to Syria, Hamza's friend Abu Mariya al-Belgiki remains a frustrated bachelor. Like Hamza, all his friends appear to be struggling with life as a bachelor, with several of them taking to social media to voice their annoyance at being unable to escape their lonely life in Syria. One of Parvez's best friends, a Belgian fighter known as Abu Mariya al-Belgiki, recently wrote: 'Urgh another brother got married... The pain... LOL I'm happy for him but still... The pain...' The hapless Belgian wrote: 'But marriage for the mujahideen especially for us, who come from Europe, is a big problem here...There is no mujahiras.' 'Whenever you are going to marry someone... Their (sic) is always that guy who's better than you... U stand no chance... life reality...' Abu Hamza (left) wearing the traditional hat of the Pashtuns, and a dark robe. He is eating ice cream with his close friend Abu Hamza as-Somali in the IS held city of Mosul . Along with his best friend Mohammed Nasser, Hamza Parvez travelled to Syria in May 2014, telling his parent that he was going to Germany. Possibly on the advice of Parvez, al-Belgiki recently bought himself a pet, possibly to help him with his loneliness. The Belgian fighter proudly showed off his 'babies', a pair of green budgerigars, perched in a big cage next to a prompted back AK 47 rifle. Abu Mariya reportedly travelled to Syria last October, along with a group of up to 10 British nationals. He recently claimed that he met British fighter Siddhartha Dhar, known as Abu Rumaysah al-Britani, who travelled to Syria whilst he was on bail. The Belgian fighter proudly shows off his 'babies', a pair of green budgerigars, perched in a big cage next to a prompted back AK 47 rifle. Whilst living in Mosul, Hamza Parvez owned a kitten called Anbar. He wrote of his heartbreak at leaving behind his 'princess.' Another of Hamza's friends, Abu Ibrahim al-Finlandi, was mocked on social media after revealed his devastation in discovering his dream jihadi bride had already got engaged. According to the Finn, his wannabe bride had already got engaged to another fighter before she had even travelled to Syria. The Finnish fighter later revealed: 'Gotten so desperate that I lift my requirements. Yes my wife can be a bit older and taller than me, and ethnicity won't matter.' A FInnish fighter, whose account was recently suspended, wrote about his frustration in the process of trying to find a wife. The Finnish fighter was mocked on social media after publicly revealing his dissatisfaction at the marriage process in Islamic State territory. He went to moan about having to wait six months before he was allowed to apply to get married and 'hope a sister picks out you from hundreds of other applicants.' Parvez has also previously expressed on on his Ask.FM account that wanted to get married and have 'two or three children.' Nicknamed 'Hungry Hamza', the portly jihadi is forever posting pictures of his dinner and even claims in his profile biography that he is most likely to be found in the Islamic State kitchen. Parvez  previously said on on his Ask.FM account that he wanted to get married and have 'two or three children.' Hamza is frequently mocked for his love of junk food, possibly a major turn off for many of his potential brides. It is possible his insatiable appetite might be due to comfort eating as Hamza's family have reportedly not spoken to him for months. After studying at Holland Park School,  Parvez worked as a waiter at a hotel in Shephard's Bush, West London. Along with his best friend Mohammed Nasser, a Roehampton University business graduate, Parvez travelled to Syria in May 2014, telling his parent that he was going to Germany. He has lived in both Iraq and Syria, spending a considerable amount of time in the Iraqi city of Mosul.","Hamza Parvez left his home in West London and travelled to Syria nearly 11 months ago .

"The Australian navy is allegedly in the process of returning up to 50 Vietnamese asylum seekers to their home country, transporting the detainees in secret via a supply ship currently on stand-by off the coast of Vietnam. The HMAS Choules, which has previously been used to provide offshore accommodation to Manus Island detainees, has been employed by the navy to hand the Vietnamese nationals back to their Communist government in an operation which could cost $2.8 million of tax payers money. It is understood that the asylum seekers were intercepted earlier in April, and are being returned through the port of Vung Tau, south of Ho Chi Minh City. The Australian Navy has allegedly returned up to 50 asylum seekers to Vietnam in a secret operation . Fairfax Media reported that a Department of Defence source revealed the HMAS Choules, a navy landing ship, was expected to arrive at Vung Tau on Friday evening or in the early hours of Saturday. According to Defence figures released in 2012, the $100 million vessel has an average running cost of $201,621 each day, making the two-week return journey to Vietnam a costly voyage of $2.8 million. While the Abbott government's border protection policy keeps operating figures secret from the public eye, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said in January that 15 asylum boats and 429 asylum seekers had been prevented from entering Australian waters since the launch of Operation Sovereign Borders policy. Operation Sovereign Borders commenced on the 18th of September in 2013, and soon after the operation was introduced, Mr Abbott claimed that the amount of boats arriving to Australia had decreased by 90%.

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said in January that 15 asylum boats and 429 asylum seekers had been prevented from entering Australian waters . Mr Abbott said the amount of boats arriving had decreased by 90% under Operation Sovereign Borders . Australian Customers and Border Protection Services maintain that involuntarily returning illegal maritime arrival detainees is consistent with Australia's obligations. In keeping with this, the Federal government made efforts last year to return 157 Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seekers to their home country after the nationals set sail from a refugee camp in Southern India. The Indian government refused to accept the Tamil's after they had been detained for a month aboard the customs vessel Ocean Protector. The asylum seekers were eventually transferred to Nauru after spending a short amount of time in Australia. In March, local Indonesian media reported that an orange lifeboat consistent with the style used by the Australian Navy and Customs to send asylum seekers back to their boats had been located on a beach in Java, reported The West Australian.

"Disgraced former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell made his final written plea to a federal appeals court Wednesday, arguing that the favors he did for a wealthy businessman were routine courtesies and not part of a bribery scheme. The onetime rising Republican star made the argument in a 54-page brief in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel of the court will conduct a hearing on his appeal of his public corruption convictions on May 12. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell fought back tears outside a federal court building after he was sentenced for selling the influence of his office to the CEO of a dietary supplements company . McDonnell was sentenced to two years in federal prison for public corruption . McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted in a joint trial in September of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his company's nutritional supplements. Bob McDonnell was sentenced to two years in prison and his wife to one year and one day, but they remain free while they pursue separate appeals. 'Governor McDonnell never promised anything and never did anything besides extend to Williams the sorts of routine courtesies elected officials throughout the country extend to donors and benefactors every day,' McDonnell's lawyers wrote in the latest filing. They were responding to the government's brief urging the court to uphold the criminal convictions. Former first lady Maureen McDonnell, left, was sentenced to a year and a day . Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams testified under an immunity deal, admitting that he paid the governor with lavish perks in exchange for helping him secure university backing for his 'miracle cure' Anatabloc product . Prosecutors had written in a 93-page submission to the court that McDonnell's actions fit the definition of 'official acts' even better than those taken by former Louisiana Rep. William Jefferson, who is serving 13 years in prison for taking bribes in exchange for using his influence to broker business deals with government leaders in Africa. Jefferson was famously caught with $100,000 in bribe money hidden in his freezer. 'Here, defendant directed his action toward subordinate state employees within the branch of government that he controlled as governor,' they wrote, while in the Jefferson case 'a congressman took action through meetings, letters, and the like directed at other government agencies or foreign governments.' One of McDonnell's chief claims on appeal is that the favors he did for Williams did not amount to 'official acts' covered by federal bribery law. In the new filing, he argues that a meeting McDonnell arranged for Williams with an administration official was 'innocuous' and that there was nothing special about an event at the Executive Mansion to launch Star's signature product, the anti-inflammatory Anatabloc. 'Governor McDonnell arrived late, made neutral comments, and left. He never asked anyone to do anything for Williams,' the brief says. Star Scientific, the maker of Anatabloc, the anti-inflammatory supplement at the center of the McDonnell trial, halted sales of the product in August 2014 . Worse than the freezer bribes? Prosecutors argue McDonnell's behavior was a better fit with bribery laws than that of convicted former congressman William Jefferson, who his $100,000 of his bribe cash in his freezer . McDonnell argues that in addition to mischaracterizing such events as 'official acts,' the government incorrectly suggested that McDonnell kept his staff in the dark about most of Williams' gifts. Among the gifts were almost $20,000 worth of designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell, vacations, golf outings and $15,000 for a daughter's wedding. The former governor also renewed claims that the judge improperly denied separate trials for Bob and Maureen McDonnell and that he failed to adequately question jurors about pretrial news coverage. Williams, who was seeking state-financed research on Anatabloc while lavishing the McDonnells with gifts and loans, testified under immunity for the prosecution.","Bob McDonnell used his office to benefit a nutritional supplement company whose president lavished gifts on him and his wife .

"Police arrested 53 people as pro-cannabis protestors gathered to get high and call for the drug to be legalised in London's Hyde Park today. Dramatic images captured the moment four officers took down and restrained a tracksuit-wearing man near the entrance to the park - just yards from a prominent police sign which read: 'Possession of cannabis is illegal'. The crowds met this afternoon as part of the annual '420' event - a global celebration of cannabis which calls for reform to drug laws. Scroll down for video . Taking him down: The four police officers were seen rushing towards the man at the entrance to Hyde Park . Restrained: The pro-cannabis protestor is pushed down to the ground just yards from a police sign reading: 'Possession of cannabis is illegal' Thousands of campaigners were seen sitting on the grass openly smoking marijuana, comparing the size of their joints and listening to speakers while dozens of police officers hovered nearby. Many protestors handed out cannabis leaf-shaped fliers and carried signs, with one reading: 'Ed Miliband wouldn't want his own children criminalised for cannabis possession.' Of the 53 who were arrested in London, 16 were taken into custody, while 21 were released on street bail and asked to return to a station at a later date. A Met Police spokesman said: 'Anyone seen by an officer openly smoking cannabis in Hyde Park or in the Westminster area could be issued with a warning or face arrest.'

Last year, Greg de Hoedt, president of UKCSC, told the Guardian last year: 'The cannabis community is crying out for legalization and regulation. 'We encourage growers to register with UKCSC because we want data we can present to authorities and say: this many people grow cannabis, this many people are growing for medicinal purposes; and we can also establish which strains work with which illnesses.'

"Anti-Islam protests in Australia against Sharia law and halal tax turned violent after demonstrators clashed with anti-racism activists who burned the country's flag. Police were forced to separate the Reclaim Australia supporters and opponents of the group in Melbourne, after clashes turned ugly and several people had to be treated by paramedics. The protests came as companies seeking to label their foods halal - must pay fees to Islamic organisations for inspection and certification. Scroll down for video . Anti-Islam protesters clashed the anti-racism activists during a rally in Federation Sqaure in Melbourne yesterday . Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd . Several were injured during the violent rally that saw hundreds of people protest for anti-racism . Two people were arrested in Melbourne after they attempted to break through a police barricade that separated the groups . Recent figures show the halal sector could be worth $1.5 trillion worldwide by 2050. Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up! Australia Party NSW President Norm Bishop. There was a strong police presence throughout the protest, which included riot police. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally. One took the microphone and told the crowd they should be 'ashamed'. In Melbourne, protesters clashed with anti-racism activists in Federation Square. Two people were arrested after they attempted to break through a police barricade that separated the different groups. A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne . More than 100 police officers, eleven mounted on horses were used to form the separation wall . Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters . Anti-racism supporters burn Australian flag at in retaliation to the Reclaim Australia protest in Melbourne . Protesters clashed with anti-racist activists in Melbourne as tensions rose . Several more were injured in the combative protests, according to reports. The protests came as the Pauline Hanson, leader of One Nation, far right Australian political party, defended the anti-Islam protests and said imposing halal certification on Australians was wrong. On Sunday morning's Today show she was asked for her views on businesses 'going to the wall' if halal certification of food products was scrapped. 'It's a profit, money-making racket and has been connected with the Muslim Brotherhood in France. Why can't we have an investigation into where the money actually goes?' she claimed. When told by the interviewer that there was no basis to any of these claims Ms Hanson replied: 'Why do Australians have to pay tax for halal certification? It is a money making racket. Why do Australians have to pay extra when they buy this product?' Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics . Two people were taken away by police officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . Ms Hanson added that an investigation was needed into halal certification in Australia. 'It's extortion that has been put onto businesses that you must pay this money,' she said. 'A Muslim does not have to have halal certification, they can say a prayer over their food. Then it's OK. 'We don't need this, we're being hoodwinked. It's a racket, a money-making racket.' Ms Hanson, who narrowly lost her fight for a seat in the 2015 Queensland election, joined hundreds of protesters in King George Square in Brisbane on Saturday. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson denied that there was any violence or confrontations at the Brisbane rally . Speaking earlier on the Today programme Mrs Hanson defended the anti-Islam protests and said imposing halal certification on Australians was wrong . Many were draped in the Australian flag and carried signs denouncing sharia law and halal certification for Australian products. She denied that there was any violence or vitriol at the rally. 'There was no violence at the Brisbane rally whatsoever. Islam is not a race so therefore we're not talking about racism here whatsoever. Criticism is not racism. We have a right to have a say and have an opinion,' she said. 'We don't like Islam and we're in fear about what Islam can do to our country, our culture and our way of life. Australians have a right to say this is not going to work. We want a peaceful cohesive society.' The violent scenes came after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests being held around Australia. Hundreds of people attended the 'Reclaim Australia' rally which was held in Martin Place, Sydney . Protesters in the crowd carried flags and chanted  “Aussie, Aussie, Aussie - Oi, Oi, Oi” and many carried banners denouncing Islam . It was originally thought Reclaim Australia had handed over the reigns to one of their supporters to control their feed throughout the protests. 'Whats wrong with muslims anyway? I dun get it,' one tweet from the account read. 'In the car reading stuff - wots xenophobia? help me out,' another said. However, 'Jeremy' began to tweet a number of joke comments shortly after the Sydney protest got underway. 'Man f**k this noise I'm gonna get stoned in the park peace out.' Once the tweets began to get attention, a 'statement' was released that explained its account was misused and it then said other events around the country would be cancelled. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . Protesters cheered as speakers said Australians had to be aware and alert to the threat of Islam and sharia law . However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Twitter users quickly began to poke fun at the group after doubts over the page emerged. 'Maybe before you you practice on something small like reclaiming your Twitter account. Work up to the big stuff slowly,' one said.","Protesters clashed with anti-racism activists at rallies across Australia .

Wardens at Windsor Castle say they are expected to carry out extra duties, including giving guided tours to visitors, for no extra money. Union chiefs claim workers earn as little as £14,700 despite working the ‘country’s richest family’. Wardens at Windsor Castle (pictured here collecting flowers laid by well-wishers following the death of The Queen Mother) have voted for industrial action in a dispute over pay . Their main role includes meeting and greeting visitors, conducting security searches, telling people about the history of the Castle, and handing out free audio guides. But The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said staff are also asked to perform extra duties for free, such as leading paid-for tours, carrying out first aid and speaking foreign languages to overseas visitors. Now, staff have voted ‘overwhelmingly’ in favour of industrial action after complaining they have suffered ‘years of pay restraint’. The PCS said 76 wardens out of 180 at the Castle will now refuse to host tours of the Great Kitchen and the Tower and will instead ‘work to rule – meaning they rigidly stick to their contractual obligations. The Public and Commercial Services Union said the Queen and Royal Family (pictured at the Castle) should not 'abuse the (workers') goodwill by not properly rewarding them' Wardens are also considering causing ‘disruption’ and ‘long queues’ by conducting more thorough security searches than usual and ‘observing every single check they are supposed to do’ – slowing down visitors’ entry to the Castle. The wardens work for the Royal Collection Trust, a charity which presides over one of the world’s largest and most important works of art, jewels and artefacts. It is held in trust by the sovereign on behalf of the nation, so they are technically employees of the Royal Household. A spokesman for the PCS said: ‘The dispute here is not with the Queen and the Royal Family but the managers who run the Castle on their behalf. ‘The wardens who work at Windsor Castle are very loyal and want to work for the Royal Family. ‘We believe our requests are modest and reasonable and, by not resolving this dispute, the Royal Collection is dragging the Queen’s name into this. That is not what staff want.’ Staff claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties such as guiding visitors around Windsor Castle for no additional money . The union has proposed that wardens receive an extra £150 a year for speaking a foreign language to visitors and an allowance for every day they conduct tours. They claimed that at nearby Hampton Court Palace, owned by a separate charity, wardens received an extra £10 to £15 a day for leading guided tours and that Windsor Castle staff should also receive ‘fair recompense’. The union said they narrowly accepted a poor pay offer last year on the understanding that additional allowances for tours and other skills would be considered this year. But following failed negotiations, non-strike industrial action could now start from the end of April. A Royal Collection Trust spokesman said: ‘Following the union ballot, we have been informed that some PCS-affiliated wardens at Windsor Castle will no longer participate in various activities undertaken during their working day, including using their language and first-aid skills, and conducting tours of specific areas of the castle during August and September. A spokesman for the Royal Collection Trust, which employee the wardens at one of the official residences of the Queen said they were 'disappointed' with the result of the ballot . ‘These activities have never been compulsory. It has always been the choice of the individual as to whether they take part. ‘While the outcome of the ballot is disappointing, it will have no effect on services to visitors to the castle.’ The Royal Collection said that only nine wardens were required to conduct tours every day out of an average of 85 wardens in work, and that the industrial action should have ‘no impact’ on visitors. Asked about the threat of slower security searches, a spokeswoman said: ‘Security searches at Windsor Castle are rigorous and we would expect staff to carry out their usual duties.’ Staff’s wages were raised to the new ‘living wage’, which is above the National minimum wage, earlier this month. This increased wardens’ pay from £7.70 an hour (£14,400 a year) to £7.85 an hour (£14,700). But the PCS complained that the living wage officially rose last November and that this wage hike should therefore be back-dated – a condition the Royal Collection has now agreed to.","Members of the royal household have voted for work to rule in pay row .

"Police are considering manslaughter charges after a man who was violently shaken as a baby died as a result - two decades later. Liam Dawe, 21, was born a healthy child but suffered serious and on-going health complications ever since he was assaulted as a four week old. He died at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon in March last year from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault. Liam Dawe died at Derriford Hospital (pictured) in Plymouth, Devon, in March last year from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault . At an inquest into his death in Plymouth, coroner Ian Arrow said: 'On the balance of probability, Mr Dawe's health was compromised (by the assault) and he died earlier than expected.' A senior officer attended the hearing and said the law changed in 1996 that meant an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if it happened more than a year before. But Det Con Insp David Elliott said as Mr Dawe's injuries were caused in 1993 before the rules came into force, fresh manslaughter charges could still be brought. The inquest heard that Liam, of Tavistock, Devon, was born an otherwise 'normal, healthy baby with no concerns' in 1993, but was shaken at just four weeks old. Police are considering manslaughter charges after Liam Dawe died two decades after being assaulted as a four week old . As a result of an injury to the brain, Mr Dawe developed severe cerebral palsy, epilepsy and visual impairment as well as learning, feeding and respiratory difficulties. He was admitted to Derriford Hospital on March 4 of last year with jaundice and later died on March 25 after his condition deteriorated following a laparotomy to treat an intra-abdominal sepsis. His GP Dr Jo Coldron said: 'There was no health concern at birth, but at four-weeks-old, Liam suffered from a non-accidental injury that led to learning difficulties, cerebral palsy muscle spasms, scoliosis, epilepsy, an unprotected airway and respiratory difficulties. 'On March 4, Liam was admitted to Derriford Hospital. He was slightly jaundiced but otherwise seemed well. 'He was later admitted to ICU, but there was no clear source for his abdominal sepsis. The 'year and a day rule' stated that an act was presumed not to have caused a person to die if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death. The ancient rule, which applied to death and suicide, was abolished under the Law Reform Act 1996 amid medical advances. However, the permission of the Attorney General is still required for any prosecution where it is claimed that the death occurred more than three years after the act, or when the offender has previously been convicted of an offence in connection with the death. 'On March 12, he was discharged by ICU onto the ward where his condition deteriorated before he died on March 25.' DCI Elliott attended the inquest to assess the assault Mr Dawe sustained as a baby to determine its significance in his death. He said: 'The question asked of us was if somebody would be prosecuted for manslaughter. 'The adult who assaulted Liam when he was four weeks old was convicted and sent to prison for 12 months imprisonment. 'Liam was shaken at four weeks old and his injuries resulted in ongoing health problems. 'The assault was a deliberate act and, at the time, the question was whether the adult intended to cause grievous bodily harm. 'In June 1996, there was a law change to the ""Year and a Day"" rule which stated an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death. 'However, as the injuries were sustained in January 1993, the rule still stands.' Coroner Ian Arrow concluded the cause of Liam's death was 'intra-abdominal sepsis in an individual with severe cerebral palsy.'","Liam Dawe was born healthy but suffered on-going health complications .

"Ralph Lauren's daughter Dylan and her husband Paul Arrouet have welcomed fraternal twins. The 40-year-old's son Cooper Blue and daughter Kingsley Rainbow were born on Monday via a surrogate, with Dylan and her Paul, 44, confirming to People on Wednesday afternoon that they 'are celebrating the birth of their twins'. A spokesperson for the couple added to the outlet that 'her parents, fashion icons Ralph and Ricky Lauren, are overjoyed to welcome their first grandchildren and witness their daughter usher in the next generation'. Scroll down for video . Baby news: Dylan Lauren and her husband Paul Arrouet (pictured) welcomed fraternal twins into the world on Monday via a surrogate . Working mother: The new mom, who was photographed at a party thrown by the Hollywood Reporter earlier this month, named her son Cooper Blue and her daughter Kingsley Rainbow . Dylan, who is the founder and CEO of popular confectionery chain Dylan's Candy Bar, revealed in this week's issue of the magazine that she chose a surrogate because it's a 'wonderful option' and it was the way she and her husband always 'wanted to start a family'. During the interview, which took place shortly before the birth of their twins, Dylan noted that she had already come up with a few adorable nicknames picked out for her son and daughter. 'I’ve been calling them the Twinkies, the M&M’s and the Doublemint Twins,’ she said. 'Good things come in twos.' She also revealed that the twins’ nursery was decorated and ready for their arrival well in advance in case her babies were born before their due date - which they were. Family ties: Dylan posed with her older brother Andrew and their parents Ralph and Ricky Lauren in 2006 . Stylish siblings: Dylan and her brother David donned their dad's designs to a party in 2010 . Cooper and Kingsley's new room is covered in pastels, bunnies and complimentary blue and pink gingham, and it's not difficult to figure out where Dylan found her inspiration. 'My favorite holiday is Easter and my favorite animal is the rabbit,' she told Fox News earlier this month. Dylan married Paul, the co-founder of Marblegate Asset Management, in June 2011 at her family's Bedford Estate. The confectionery entrepreneur wore wore a handmade duchesse satin, silk tulle, georgette embroidered dress with a tiered train designed by her father. The 75-year-old designer admitted in an interview with Oprah that year that creating the gown was an emotional experience. 'I had to do something that was better than ever before. When you do something for your family or your daughter, I mean it's the only daughter I have - beautiful girl,' he said.","The 40-year-old's son Cooper Blue and daughter Kingsley Rainbow were born on Monday .

"This is the moment a college athlete's victory turned to ashes in his hands after he slowed down to celebrate his win and got overtaken. Tanguy Pepiot, a steeplechase runner for the University of Oregon, had a clear lead on his rival Meron Simon, who competes for the University of Washington. But at a track meet Saturday in Eugene, Oregon, a crowd of more than 3,000 people saw the distance evaporate after Pepiot raised his hands in pre-emptive joy, with less than 100m to go. Vanishing lead: Tanguy Pepiot, a runner for the University of Oregon, is pictured left celebrating his victory - and right after he has lost it all to the University of Washington's Meron Simon . Big gains: Pepiot, right, is pictured from track level raising his hands to excite the crowd - as Simon tears toward him from behind . The gesture seemed to sap some of his momentum, opening the way for Simon to speed towards the finish line, and beat him by a tenth of a second. The home crowd roared as Simon powered ahead - seemingly in an attempt to warn French-born Pepiot. But the warning came too late, and Simon flashed past, leaving Pepiot, who is in his senior year, to collapse, defeated. Simon's time, 8:57.86, exceeded his personal record by around 15 seconds. Speaking to the Eugene Register-Guard after the contest, a newly-victorious Simon said: 'I thought he had me. Moment of truth: Simon is shown here edging ahead of Pepiot, whom he beat by a tenth of a second . Reconciliation: After celebrating his triumph, Simon headed back to help Pepiot up after he collapsed to the ground in defeat . 'I thought he was just so far ahead. Then I heard the crowd get crazy, and he started throwing his hands up. 'I was like, ""I don’t think he knows I’m coming"". I just went to the line and just raced.' After a justified victory celebration of his own, Simon doubled back to console his rival. Not long after, a defeated Pepiot told columnist Austin Meek: 'I think it was the first time it happened to me. I'll make sure it's the last time.'

The new tragedy emerged as statistics showed the number of migrants dying in the Mediterranean has increased ten-fold this year. At least 480 migrants lost their lives during crossings in the first three months of this year, compared with fewer than 50 fatalities during the same period last year, according to the International Organization for Migration. On Sunday alone, the coast guard coordinated the rescue of migrants from 22 different vessels. Four coast guard ships and aircraft, nine merchant ships and a naval ship took part in the rescues as well as an Icelandic patrol vessel and two Italian Coast Guard vessels participating in the Triton.

"Britain bucked the trend of Western nations by increasing spending on foreign aid last year while others imposed savage cuts. More than half the members of a group of 28 industrialised nations reduced their aid budget between 2013 and 2014, a report found. Britain's failure to follow suit – thanks to a target imposed by David Cameron – means that its overseas aid spending of 0.7 per cent of national income is double the average level of the other nations in the group known as the Development Assistance Committee. A target set by David Cameron (pictured at a rally this week) has left Britain unable to follow other countries in reducing their aid budget between 2013 and 2014 . Out of every £100 spent by these Western nations on overseas aid, no less than £14 now comes from the UK. Overall across these 28 countries aid budgets fell by 0.5 per cent in real terms, according to the report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Despite this, the UK increased its spend by 1.2 per cent to £11.7billion in 2014. It comes on top of even larger increases in previous years. France slashed its aid budget by 9.2 per cent to £6.2billion, the fourth successive decrease. Japan's was cut by 15.3 per cent to £5.5billion. Australia cut its foreign aid by 7.2 per cent to £2.5billion, while cash-strapped Spain cut its funding by 20.3 per cent to £1.1billion. The UK's aid budget is now nearly double France's and ten times the level in Spain. In total, 15 members of the DAC cut foreign aid, including Belgium, Italy, Norway, Poland and Portugal. Britain was one of 13 countries which increased its budget despite the straitened times. These included Germany, the US and New Zealand. Trade, not aid: Conservative MP Peter Bone . Surprisingly, Greece, which is dependent on bailouts from the EU and the IMF, put up its aid budget by 6.8 per cent. Last night Tory Peter Bone, who is standing for re-election as MP for Wellingborough, said: 'When we have seen cuts at home, people find it very strange that we can give away so many billions of pounds a year, half of which we don't even control who it goes to. 'People are telling me on the doorstep during this campaign that we should cut the amount we spend on overseas aid, and increase opportunities for poorer countries to trade with the EU – trade, not aid, is what we need. What this report shows is that other governments recognise the fact that we have got to look after our own country first, and ensure aid is better targeted.' Britain's aid budget may need to rise by at least £500million in future years, because changes in EU accounting rules make it harder to meet the 0.7 per cent target. The Development Assistance Committee was set up by the OECD which represents richer countries. The OECD report, 2014 Global Outlook on Aid, shows that Britain is one of only five members of the DAC to meet the target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid along with Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway and Denmark. The average OECD member spends just 0.39 per cent. In monetary terms, the UK now has the second highest aid budget in the world behind the US which spends £19.6billion. But that is just 0.19 per cent of its national income. France spends 0.36 per cent, and Germany 0.41 per cent. The 28 DAC members spent a total of £81billion on aid last year – a record figure, but down in real terms. It means the UK's budget of £11.7billion is a seventh of the entire total for the Western world. Max Lawson, of Oxfam, praised Britain and criticised countries which have cut their aid budgets. 'Aid saves lives,' he said. 'What we're seeing is shameful indifference on the part of many of the world's richest nations. 'Their leaders are breaking with impunity the solemn promise they made to help Make Poverty History.'","More than half of members of group of industrial nations reduced aid .

"Coachella fans who attend the California-based music festival typically go for good music and a good time — but they may end up bringing home something much worse than a hangover and some sunburn. Cosmopolitan.com reports that Coachella is a verifiable hotbed of various viruses and bacterial infections, especially due to the widespread use of public restrooms that are heavily trafficked, but might not be frequently cleaned. In fact, according to medical experts, festival-goers actually run the risk of picking up illnesses like the flu, Norovirus, Salmonella, and even hepatitis A. Sick concert: Festival-goers who attend outdoor concerts like Coachella are at risk to contract diseases like influenza and Norovirus . While this is the first year that Coachella has installed permanent restrooms, instead of setting up notoriously dirty portable toilets, the festival's 324 new private stalls could still be harboring germs; even spending time around  so many people outside of the restrooms has health risks. 'Outdoor music festivals and concerts where thousands of people are clustered together in close quarters can be a breeding ground for infections and other health problems,' Dr. Kevin Campbell tells DailyMail.com. He advises that festival attendees should take steps to avoid catching diseases like Norovirus and Salmonella, which can cause gastrointestinal distress, as well as conditions like hepatitis A, influenza, and Shigellosis. Close quarters: At Coachella, thousands of people are packed into tight spaces, which creates conditions for bacteria and viruses to spread quickly . Toilet upgrade: New permanent restrooms on the festival grounds include 324 private stalls, but even nicer-looking facilities can spread germs . 'In general, it is essential to wash your hands before eating and drinking,' Dr. Campbell adds. 'Using hand sanitizer is an important, portable way to eliminate many bacteria from your skin before introducing food into your mouth.' Experts also warn that people at Coachella should also take precaution to touch as few surfaces as possible while in public restrooms. Some ways to avoid contact with germs and bacteria include using paper towels to turn off sink faucets after washing hands and not touching door handles. Celebrities beware: Even stars like Justin Bieber and Kendall Jenner, pictured here at Coachella, are not immune from the risk of contracting hepatitis A and Shigellosis . But bacteria and viruses aren't the only things at outdoor concerts that can lead to illness. '[These events] often involve drinking alcohol and some recreational drug use,' explains Dr. Campbell. 'It is essential to be careful to avoid dehydration — the combination of the sun and heat with alcohol can be quite dangerous. 'Take precautions by limiting alcohol intake and drink plenty of water during outdoor events,' he adds. 'Wear sunscreen to avoid sunburn, and a wide brimmed sun hat is also an important tool to ward off sunburns that can lead to skin cancers.'","Large crowds, close quarters and heavily-trafficked public restrooms allow for illnesses to spread .

"The number of immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean has been increasing in recent years and they now account for almost ten per cent of the overall black population in the United States. Foreign-born blacks made up just 3.1 per cent of the black population in 1980, but they accounted for 8.7 per cent of that group in 2013, according to a report from the Pew Research Center. With 3.8 million foreign-born blacks already living in the United States, the center estimates 16.5 per cent of the US black population will be comprised of immigrants by 2060. The nearly 586,000 Haitians (above) in the US account for about 15 per cent of the black immigrant population . Foreign-born blacks were 3.1 per cent of the black population in 1980, but made up 8.7 per cent of group in 2013 . About 50 per cent of the black immigrant population hail from the Caribbean and 36 per cent come from Africa . Immigrants from Jamaica and Haiti make up approximately a third of the foreign-born black population, while immigrants from Ethiopia, Nigeria and Ghana make up about 15 per cent of the population, according to the Pew Center. Most of the immigrants are from Jamaica and Haiti . Overall about 50 per cent of the black immigrant population hail from the Caribbean, while 36 per cent come from Africa. Immigrants from Central and South America account for most of the remaining population. The immigrant increase is especially notable in cities with large black populations. In the Miami metro area, about 34 per cent of blacks are foreign-born compared to 28 per cent in New York City and 15 per cent in Washington, DC. The majority of the 40 million US-born African Americans trace their heritage to African ancestors brought to America as slaves. The shift is causing the black population in the US to become less homogenous, the Washington Post reported. Black immigrants tend to be older, more likely to have a college degree and less likely to live in poverty than the US-born population, according to the Pew report. Foreign-born blacks are also more likely to be married and have a higher income. Demographer William Frey said: 'Just because they’re new immigrants, they have different needs and patterns, probably in terms of language in many cases, in terms of assimilation. 'And so they probably shouldn’t be confused with native-born blacks in lots of ways, who have their own needs to be addressed.” The Ethiopian New Year Celebration in Washington in 2012.

"Google Wallet says it has changed its policy when storing users' funds as they will now be federally-insured (file photo) For those who use Google Wallet, their money just became safer with federal-level insurance. Google confirmed to Yahoo Finance in a statement that its current policy changed - meaning the company will store the balances for users of the mobile transfer service (similar to PayPal and Venmo) in multiple federally-insured banking institutions. This is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their Wallet Balance because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures funds for banking institutions up to $250,000. Currently, Google's user agreement says funds are not protected by the FDIC. However, a Google spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that the current policy has changed. The policy states that 'funds held by Google Payment Corp. or its service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of Payment Transactions are not deposit obligations of Buyer, and are not insured for the benefit of Buyer by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency', according to 9to5. As a non-banking institution, Google Wallet, along with PayPal and Venmo, is not legally required to be federally insured. But with the new change to its policy, funds in Wallet Balance are protected if anything were to happen to the company like bankruptcy. For example, for those who use mobile payment services where funds are not FDIC insured, if a company files for bankruptcy, the user would become their creditor and would be required to go through bankruptcy court to get their money back. But for users with FDIC insurance, they would receive their money from the government in a matter of days, according to Yahoo Finance. Details on when Google Wallet's user agreement will be updated were not provided. How Google Wallet works: . Google Wallet, launched in 2011, stores credit and debit card information, and lets shoppers pay for goods by tapping their phones against special terminals at store checkout counters. It works with any debit or credit card, on every mobile carrier. The service allows users to send money to anyone in the US with a Gmail address, or request money on-the-go, directly from their bank account, debit card or Wallet Balance. Users can spend received money through the service in stores or withdraw cash from ATMs with the Google Wallet Card, as well as transfer the funds directly to their bank account. It comes with 24/7 fraud monitoring, and users can disable their Wallet app or card from their Google Wallet account if they're ever lost or stolen. Source: Google Wallet . Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected Google Inc's request to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the technology company of invading the privacy of users of its Google Wallet electronic payment service by sharing their personal information with outside app developers. The judge said Google must face claims it breached users' contracts, violated the federal Stored Communications Act which limits disclosure of electronic records, and violated a California consumer protection law. Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California said Google Wallet users may try to show that Google 'frustrated' the purpose of its own privacy policy by allowing 'blanket, universal disclosure' of their personal information to app developers whenever they bought apps in Google's Play Store. The lead plaintiff is Alice Svenson, an Illinois resident who said Google sent unnecessary personal information about her to YCDroid when she paid that developer $1.77 for an email app. She said Google raised the risk of identity theft by routinely sending information about Google Wallet users such as addresses and zip codes, phone numbers and email addresses to app developers. Svenson said the Mountain View, California-based company ceased the practice soon after the lawsuit was filed in September 2013. Her lawsuit seeks class-action status, damages of $1,000 per violation, punitive damages and other remedies.","Google spokesperson confirmed current policy changed meaning funds will be protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .

"Iraqi forensic teams have described how they wept as they began to excavate 12 graves, believed to be the final resting place of as many as 1,700 soldiers killed in cold blood by ISIS last summer. The teams began the gruesome task of uncovering the bodies of the young army recruits of Camp Speicher, slaughtered by the Sunni ISIS militants as they surged across northern Iraq for the 'crime' of being Shi'ite. The deaths showed Iraqis that Islamic State fighters, who have also attacked ethnic and religious minorities as well as fellow Sunni Muslims opposing them, were a threatening new kind of foe. Scroll down for videos . Distraught: A soldier prays at the site where hundreds of his fellow fighters are thought to have been buried . Discovery: The graves were found last Wednesday on the late Saddam Hussein's presidential compound . Heartbreaking: The highest estimate for the number of recruits killed in the Speicher massacre is about 1,700 . For almost 10 months, their devastated families have been left wondering what became of their sons and brothers who had been marched through Tikrit, once Saddam Hussein's stronghold of support. The only clues they had were videos posted by the jihadists on social media sites, showing them being machine gunned down in their hundreds. But now it seems their final resting place may have at last been discovered, after 'dozens' of ID cards belonging to the army cadets were found at the late dictator's presidential compound last Wednesday. Today, the first of the 12 mass graves on the banks of the Tigris River began to give up their terrible secrets, days after Islamic State's fighters were driven from the city by Iraqi forces and Shi'ite paramilitaries. Those who began digging up the corpses today described the scene as 'heartbreaking'. Khalid al-Atbi, an Iraqi health official working with the forensic team sent to Tikrit, said: 'It was a heartbreaking scene. We couldn't prevent ourselves from breaking down in tears. 'What savage barbarian could kill 1,700 persons in cold blood?' Horror: Images like this one of the soldiers being led through Tikrit shocked Iraq and the world . Mourning: A soldier prays where the blood of Iraqi soldiers fell at Camp Speicher . Final resting place: Initial investigations reveal these are the bodies of the young cadets, a worker has said . Closure: Some of the people who lost loved ones in the massacre have expressed relief at the discovery . Mr al-Atbi added: 'We dug up the first mass grave site today. 'Until now we found at least 20 bodies. Initial indications show indisputably that they were from the Speicher victims.' But despite the horrifying scenes uncovered in the compound, families - who often grow angry at Iraq's political class for failing to provide them proper answers - have expressed releif their loved ones have been found. 'The only positive thing is the victory in Tikrit,' said Ali Hamad, whose cousin Kamal went missing at Speicher. 'We are happy. At least the families will soon know the fate of their sons and cousins,' he said. Anger: Families have often grow angry at Iraq's political class for failing to provide them proper answers.

"A British-born businessman has been placed on the FBI's Most Wanted list over claims he conducted a multi-million pound luxury car scam. Afzal Khan is accused of conning a string of customers and financial firms at a motor dealership he ran in the US. Federal agents hunting the 32-year-old, originally from Edinburgh, fear he may have fled the country and have offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Afzal Khan (pictured) is accused of conning a string of customers and financial firms at a motor dealership he ran in the US . Federal agents hunting the 32-year-old, originally from Edinburgh, fear he may have fled the country and have offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to his arrest . Khan is accused of obtaining loans from a bank for cars that he never delivered, but for which the purchaser was still responsible . Flamboyant Khan, known to his clients as 'Bobby', opened the Emporio Motor Group in New Jersey in 2013 and maintained a high profile. He appeared on US reality series The Real Housewives Of New Jersey and counted members of the show's cast among his clients. He has now been accused of a massive fraud involving super cars including Lamborghinis, Bentleys and Rolls Royces. He is accused of obtaining loans from a bank for cars that he never delivered, but for which the purchaser was still responsible. He also obtained loans for cars that were delivered, but for which neither he nor Emporio had title documents. As a result, the purchasers of these cars were liable for the loan, but could not register the vehicles. Khan also offered to sell cars for customers, and then neither returned the cars nor provided any money from car sales. Flamboyant Khan, known to his clients as 'Bobby', opened the Emporio Motor Group in New Jersey in 2013 and maintained a high profile . One financial institution is said to have lost $1.6million from its dealings with Khan and 75 customers have come forward to make complaints against him. If convicted, he could face a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a multi-million dollar fine. Khan was born in Edinburgh to Pakistani parents and moved to America more than 20 years ago. Police and the FBI attempted to arrest him at his New Jersey home at the end of October but could not locate him. He has now been placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted 'white collar criminals' list. In an interview he gave when he opened his car dealership in 2013, Khan boasted that he had been selling luxury cars since he was 18 . He said: 'There's a waiting list for any car like this, because you can't find it, but the number of millionaires and billionaires grows every day. 'Everybody wants the next toy. This is a boutique dealership. It's like walking into a Gucci or a Fendi store.' The FBI wanted poster for Khan says he has ties to the United Arab Emirates, Canada, the UK and Pakistan, and may be found in those countries. He is described as 5 feet 10 inches and 180 pounds, with a scar on his right arm. Last week, Khan's brother Anil Iqbal was arrested by police in New Jersey investigating the alleged scam. Iqbal, 36, who was an employee at the dealership, has been charged with conspiracy to commit theft, theft by extortion, theft by deception and fencing. An FBI spokesman said: 'Afzal Khan is wanted for allegedly defrauding customers and financial institutions while he was the owner of Emporio Motor Group, a car dealership in Ramsey, New Jersey. 'From approximately December 2013 to September 2014, Khan allegedly obtained loans for vehicles that were never delivered, obtained loans for vehicles without proper title, and issued insufficient funds checks. 'Khan also allegedly offered to sell vehicles on consignment and then neither returned the vehicles nor provided any funds for the vehicle sales. 'A federal arrest warrant was issued for Khan on October 21, 2014, by the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey, after he was charged with wire fraud. 'The FBI is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to the arrest of Afzal Khan.'","Afzal Khan accused of conning customers and financial firms in US .

"A  teenager with a deadly brain tumour has  raised the majority of $80,000 needed to fund his life-saving surgery. With less than a day left to go before he is due to be operated on, 18-year-old Jackson Byrnes from  Northern New South Wales has accumulated close to the target on hisGoFundMe page. Three weeks ago Mr Byrnes was told by doctors that he had a stage four brain tumour that was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jackson Byrnes (pictured) is less than a day away from accumulating enough money to pay for life-saving brain surgery . Refusing to accept the dismal diagnosis, his family took matters into their own hands and found the only Australian neurosurgeon to perform the risky operation. After nine days of desperate campaigning through Facebook and the crowd funding page GoFundMe, the Casino teenager is just under $4,000 away from raising enough money to save his life. Taking to his Facebook fundraising page - Jackson Byrnes Brain Tumor Surgery Fund - friends of Jackson thanked the thousands of people who have made donations to the page.

'Jackson we're not far from achieving the 80k) an admin person on the page wrote. 'We couldn't have done this without the support of you all' they said. According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, Mr Byrnes' girlfriend, Jahnae Jackson, noticed he had developed a limp a mere three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI. He was rushed to the Gold Coast for a biopsy which found a stage four tumour buried deep in the teenager's brain. Mr Byrnes was told they would not operate due to how deep the cancer was, but instead suggested chemotherapy and radiation treatment. A teenager with a deadly brain tumour must raise $80,000 by Tuesday night in order to pay for his surgery . After a week of campaigning online, the Casino teenager is nearly there with less than a day to go . Knowing that this was not enough, Mr Byrnes and his family searched for a specialist who would perform the dangerous procedure. They found neurosurgeon Charlie Teo who would operate on Wednesday as long as he received an upfront payment of $80,000 by Tuesday evening. The family then turned to social media and crowd sourcing in a desperate plea for donations. 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads. Messages of support and promotion of the cause have flooded social media for the Casino teenager . The donations have been coming in thick and fast since the GoFundMe page was created .

"An 81-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly stabbing to death his granddaughter's ex-boyfriend after the young couple started arguing following their daughter's first birthday party. Nicolas Diaz reportedly intervened after his granddaughter, Amber Diaz, and her former partner, Kevin Rivera, 21, got into a dispute at their home in Brooklyn, New York, in the early hours of Sunday. The recently separated couple, who have a baby daughter, Aeralye, together, had just returned to the apartment after celebrating the infant's first birthday. Diaz wanted to break up the fight, relatives said. He allegedly stabbed Mr Rivera, an unemployed musician, with a knife, before fleeing the scene.

'Manslaughter': Nicolas Diaz (Ieft), 81, allegedly stabbed to death his granddaughter's ex-boyfriend, Kevin Rivera, (right), after the couple started arguing following their daughter's first birthday party on Sunday . Scene: Diaz reportedly intervened after his granddaughter, Amber Diaz, and 21-year-old Mr Rivera got into a dispute at their home in this apartment bock at 1225 Broadway (pictured) in Bushwick in Brooklyn, New York . He was rushed to Woodhull Medical Center, but despite medics' best efforts, was later pronounced dead, according to the New York Times. Police immediately launched a manhunt for Diaz. On Monday morning, the suspect turned himself into police, NBC reported. He has since been charged with manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon in relation to the killing. Miss Diaz and Mr Rivera had apparently been dating for around three years before they split. Relatives told the Times their relationship had started to break down following Aeralye's birth last year. 'They were always fighting. Girlfriend and boyfriend stuff,' said Jose Rivera, the victim’s grandfather, adding he had adopted his grandson, along with his twin brother and sister, after their father had died.

"European human rights judges have delivered a boost to Home Secretary Theresa May’s campaign to kick illegal immigrants and foreign criminals out of the country. In a landmark ruling, they undermined the idea that no foreigner should be thrown out of a country if it will interfere with their right to a family life. Eight judges of the European Court of Human Rights found that Russia was justified in deporting a 45-year-old man for breaking immigration laws even though he went to live there more than 20 years ago and has a Russian wife and son. Scroll down for video . Landmark: The European Court of Human Rights (pictured, with former president Sir Nicolas Dusan Bratza) has ruled Russia did not breach a father's right to a family life when he was deported in 2011 . Robert Muradeli had never committed a crime or any other offence more serious than traffic violations. But the Strasbourg court said that the Russian authorities had not breached any human rights rules when they deported him in 2011. It follows years of Tory frustration over the ease with which illegal immigrants and foreign criminals can dodge deportation or delay it for years by claiming that it would breach their right to a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. A number of the 760 foreign criminals on the run in Britain have used the clause to block their deportation, and British judges have repeatedly upheld even the most spurious claim to a family life. MPs voted for new guidelines in 2012 which said that any foreign criminal sentenced to more than four years in jail should not be able to plead family rights as a reason to stay in Britain. Mrs May has also introduced a system under which foreign criminals are deported and only then allowed to appeal to the courts against removal. She has promised the system will be extended to illegal immigrants if the Tories win the election. Boost: Mrs May is hoping to be able to stop illegal immigrants and foreign criminals dodging deportation or delaying it by claiming their right to a family life . The European judges – whose rulings are supposed to be followed by 47 countries including Russia – heard that Georgian-born Muradeli had gone to Russia in 1992, had married in the city of Penza in 1994 and had a son in 1995. However, he failed to keep his permits up to date. Muradeli told the judges that his son needed a father, that his wife needed his financial support to pay back a property loan, and that his family had no links to Georgia. Lawyers for Russia argued that it was necessary to deport him to ensure immigration laws were obeyed. The Strasbourg ruling said that by breaking immigration rules Muradeli had ‘demonstrated consistent disregard of the laws, regulations and public order of the host country’. It added that he had been deported to Russian-speaking Belarus.","European Court of Human Rights find Russia justified in deporting father .

"A six-year-old girl has been sexually assaulted by a boy of the same age in the classroom and playground of her school. But officers are powerless to act over the allegations, at a school in Blackburn, Lancashire, because the age of criminal responsibility in England is ten, so charges cannot be brought against the boy. The girl's mother has also blasted school authorities after officials refused to remove the boy from her daughter's class, saying they have made the girl feel 'like she was in the wrong'. According to the girl's mother school officials refused to remove the boy from her daughter's class, and she says she has now had to move the girl to a new school (posed by model) The mother said she has now been forced to move her daughter, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, to another school. She said: 'I informed the school and social services straight away, and rang the police. I had to keep her off school because the school said it was appropriate for the boy to remain in classes. 'They said they needed to speak to the boy's parents and find out his side of the story. 'My daughter didn't really understand how bad it was. It has left her feeling very vulnerable. The way the school has acted makes her feel like she was in the wrong.' The girl's mother is also asking for a change to the law after police said they were powerless to act because the age of criminal responsibility in England is ten, and the boy is just six (posed by model) The woman added that there needs to be a change in the law as children are becoming 'sexualised' at a younger age, and said cases should be thoroughly investigated. Lancashire Police confirmed they received a report of the issue but that any action was the responsibility of the school and social services. Blackburn with Darwen Council said it was working to support those involved after the allegations.","Girl, six, assaulted by boy of the same age at primary school in Blackburn .

"A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house has been spared jail. He was sentenced by Judge Noel Lucas (above) at Guildford Crown Court . A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house while her live-in carer was out has been spared jail. Timothy Norris-Jones, who had previously attacked his mother on two occasions, left her with bruises on her face and a cut on her right wrist that needed stitches, a court heard. The 59-year-old told police the injuries were caused when she fell and said he had accidentally 'caught her face' when he went to catch her in November last year. He was arrested after the victim's carer returned home and called the police. His mother later told detectives: 'He just blew up. 'He was pushing my face and holding my wrists. I can remember I said: ""Stop this Tim, don't do it"".' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. A forensic psychologist told the court that emotionally damaged Norris-Jones looked to his mother for support and 'lost his rag' when she could not provide it. Judge Noel Lucas, sentencing, branded the attack 'horrific' and added: 'It is pretty unforgivable to strike an elderly lady.' He said: 'You gave your mother a systematic beating. 'If I had taken the view that your actions were anything other than those of an ill and weak man, I would now be sending you to prison for a substantial amount of time.'

Nick Tucker, defending, said: 'It's clear from her statement that [the victim] loves her son and she's concerned for him, despite what she's suffered. 'One of the reasons this is not only sad, but a difficult case, is that we can't confidently say why this happened. 'The defendant is unable to explain what triggered this or the previous assaults.'

"A drugs charity has called on footballer Raheem Sterling to apologise to fans after he was filmed apparently inhaling legal high 'hippy crack'. Footage emerged today which appears to show the Liverpool and England winger breathing in the gas nitrous oxide before  passing out as giggling friends look on. Drugs charity Re-Solv has called on the 'role model' player to condemn the use of the drug to deter young supporters from taking risks with their health. Footballer Raheem Sterling has been filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - also known as 'hippy crack' The video shows him smiling and breathing in gas from a balloon before apparently passing out . The anti-drugs organisation's spokesman, Stephen Ream, told MailOnline: 'It's very disappointing from our point of view. He is a big role model and we hate to see this kind of stuff from someone of his status. 'Players in similar situations in the past have come out and apologised and we hope he does the same. 'Nitrous Oxide is not the most dangerous drug out there but there are deaths attached to it. There are risks and we would urge anyone tempted to take it not to do so.' Sterling's boyhood coach, Paul Lawrence, told the Evening Standard: 'He has got to be a lot more careful with what he is doing out in public... Maybe he has got to sit down and think he is a role model and in the public eye.' The video emerged  just days after the England regular, 20, was pictured puffing on a shisha pipe said to be as strong as 200 cigarettes. In footage obtained by The Sun, Sterling is seen sucking on an orange balloon then laughing and giggling. When the camera pans back to him, he is either unconscious or has fallen asleep. It is claimed that the video was taken at his home in Southport. Sterling is not the first player to have been accused of using the drug. Tottenham's Kyle Walker and West Bromwich Albion's Saido Berahino have also appeared inhaling gas from balloons. Both later apologised for their actions and discouraged fans from using the drug. Drugs experts have warned revellers against inhaling nitrous oxide from balloons because it starves the brain of oxygen. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has issued a warning to the forward, who scored in Liverpool's 2-0 win over Newcastle last night. It comes amid rumours the star is unsettled at Liverpool and recently turned down a £100,000-a-week deal. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) has said he'll talk to the star . Rodgers said: 'For me it is something that when you are a professional sportsperson at the top level of the game, I don't think it is something you should be doing. It is as simple as that. 'But I will speak to him on it, to see what he says on it. As you can imagine, I have only seen this today.' In 2013, England right-back Kyle Walker issued a grovelling apology after he was pictured inhaling the gas during an night out in Sheffield. He later said: 'I have now been made aware of the health risks associated with the practice and accept that my actions were of poor judgement.' In the same year, a photo was published showing then-Newcastle striker Nile Ranger inhaling from a balloon at the wheel of his car. The picture appeared on Instagram days before he was involved in a car accident. Last year, West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino was also pictured apparently inhaling the gas in his car, before reportedly driving from Birmingham to London. In a statement, Berahino later said: ‘This was very poor judgement on my part and not the right example to be setting. Rodgers added: 'We want players here who are super-professional and focused on their football. I know he is. He very much is focused on his football and improving as a player. 'As I have said before, young players make mistakes. As long as they learn from them, that is what is important.' The matter adds to the controversy currently surrounding Sterling amid a wrangle over a new contract. He risked the wrath of supporters a fortnight ago by admitting he had rejected a £100,000-per-week deal in an interview that was not sanctioned by the club recently. Another newspaper also published pictures of him allegedly smoking a shisha pipe over the weekend. Rodgers said any repercussions following the latest matter would be dealt with internally. He added that he did not feel the matter was a distraction. He said: 'I will speak to Raheem. Until then, it is something we will deal with internally.' Former Liverpool player Jamie Carragher last night said the young star needs to learn from his mistakes and mature. He told Sky Sports: 'You make mistakes at that age, I did, we all do. It's just important that we learn from them. Raheem Sterling needs to be on the back pages, not the front pages.' The video emerged on the same night Sterling scored a stunning goal in his team's 2-0 win over Newcastle . The video emerged days after the Liverpool and England star was pictured puffing on a shisha pipe . The episode threatens to further disrupt Liverpool's preparation for their key FA cup semi-final clash with Aston Villa at Wembley stadium on Sunday. Sterling was born in Jamaica but moved to London with his mother, Nadine, when he was five. He was removed from his primary school because of behavioural problems and spent three years at a special school, where he was told prophetically by a teacher: ‘If you carry on the way you’re going, by the time you’re 17 you’ll either be in prison or playing for England.’ He joined QPR aged 11 before transferring to Liverpool’s youth academy when he was 15, meaning he had to leave his home in Wembley and his mother behind. He became a father to his daughter, Melody Rose, at the age of 17. A Liverpool FC spokesman said: ' We are aware of the story and intend to speak to the player.' Nitrous oxide has become popular with revellers in recent years, but experts warn it is dangerous . Nitrous oxide is a gas that can make people feel relaxed, euphoric and giggly, leading to its nickname 'laughing gas'. It is not illegal to be in possession of the substance, sometimes also known as 'hippy crack', although it is prohibited from being sold in England and Wales to under-18s if there is a risk they will inhale it. Abusing nitrous oxide can lead to oxygen deprivation resulting in loss of blood pressure, fainting and even heart attacks. While the gas can be legitimately used for pain relief in dental procedures, in engines to make them perform better, and in aerosol cans to prevent food going off, there have been concerns at its use as a so-called legal high. A Home Office campaign last year on the risks of legal highs showed that laughing gas was the second most popular drug among young adults in 2013/14 after cannabis, being more widely used than powdered cocaine and ecstasy. Research by the Local Government Association also described as 'deeply disturbing' the notion that many young people view nitrous oxide as safe, despite it being linked to a number of deaths. Seventeen-year-old Joseph Benett suffered a cardiac arrest after taking the popular party drug in 2012. The promising art student fell into a coma but later died. In September last year three revellers became ill at a nightclub in Bolton after suffering a suspected bad reaction to laughing gas. Police were called to Royal Bolton Hospital amid reports the patients were suffering from the effects of drug ingestion. It was thought they may have inhaled nitrous oxide, but they were said at the time to be recovering well. Nitrous oxide has led to 16 deaths in the last five years as users can asphyxiate as they inhale the drug .","Young star is seen in video inhaling gas before laughing and passing out .

"A hard-hitting Scientology documentary slammed by John Travolta is unlikely to be aired in the UK because of fears that the broadcaster could be exposed to libel claims. Lawyers have warned that the differences in defamation law in Northern Ireland mean controversial US expose HBO's 'Going Clear' might not be broadcast by Sky Atlantic. The Alex Gibney-directed film, which alleges abusive practices at the religion's US headquarters, was due to premiere in the UK earlier this month to coincide with its American release. But the fact that Northern Ireland is not subject to the 2013 Defamation Act means Sky is set to postpone or cancel the show entirely, according to the Observer. Scroll down for video . A hard-hitting Scientology documentary slammed by John Travolta (pictured at a gala for the church in 2013) is unlikely to be aired in the UK because of fears that the broadcaster could be exposed to libel claims . This is because it could expose the broadcaster to libel claims from David Miscavige, the leader of the church, and other prominent scientologists. It mirrors the decision taken by British publishers Transworld to cancel their release of Lawrence Wright's Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief, on which the film is based. Hollywood star John Travolta slammed the film and said his decades of personal experience at the church have been positive. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times he said: 'I've been so happy with my experience in the last 40 years...that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative.' The documentary claims to have revealed secrets about the church of Scientology, pictured is headquarters . Lawyers have warned that the show could expose the broadcaster to libel claims from David Miscavige, the leader of the church, and other prominent scientologists such as Tom Cruise, pictured at a conference . The programme would be shielded by libel laws in Britain which state that people or organisations must now show 'serious harm' to reputation. But the same documentary would be exposed to pre-reform libel laws in Northern Ireland because Sky is unable to differentiate its signal between regions for technical reasons. Sky has maintained the decision is a delay rather than a cancellation. A spokesman said: 'At present, Sky's transmission date for Going Clear has not been confirmed.' The church has condemned the film as a 'one-sided, bigoted propaganda built on falsehoods' and informed by former members –whom it calls 'misfits'. It is understood to have instructed solicitors in the UK to warn Sky it faces legal action if Going Clear is broadcast. The church said in a statement: 'The Church of Scientology will be entitled to seek the protection of both UK and Irish libel laws in the event that any false or defamatory content in this film is broadcast within these jurisdictions.' Going Clear examines the Church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, the church's finances and its relationships with celebrities such as Tom Cruise and  Travolta. Libel lawyer Paul Tweed, who was involved in previous discussion with UK publisher Transworld, which dropped Going Clear, said a decision to broadcast would be based on commercial reasons. The church is understood to have instructed solicitors in the UK to warn Sky it faces legal action if Going Clear is broadcast, pictured is leader David Miscavige . Alex Gibney (left) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members including Paul Haggis (right) 'Any client of mine, whether a journalist or a high-profile personality, is entitled to protect their reputation against false allegations,' he said. 'In terms of Sky's decision … they have to make absolutely certain that what they are broadcasting is not defamatory or untrue. If they have right on their side, they have nothing to fear.' Going Clear has been seen by more than 5.5 million people in the US and is likely to become second only to a film about Beyoncé as HBO’s most-watched documentary of the past decade. In a comment piece in the Los Angeles Times last week director Mr Gibney said: 'In the past, critics of the church have called for its tax exemption to be revoked because it is not a 'real religion'. I agree that tax-exemption isn't merited, but not for that reason. 'The Church of Scientology has a distinct belief system which, despite its somewhat strange cosmology – mocked by the TV show South Park and many others – is not essentially more strange than, say, the idea of a virgin birth. 'Scientologists are entitled to believe what they want to believe. And the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] website makes it clear anyone is entitled to start a religion without seeking IRS permission. To maintain the right to be tax-exempt, however, religions must fulfil certain requirements for charitable organisations. For example, they may not 'serve the private interests of any individual' and/or 'the organisation's purposes and activities may not be illegal or violate fundamental public policy'.'","Scientology exposé has been halted over differences in UK libel law .

"Court bill of £500: Kim Copeland, 52, was walking home from her local Sainsbury’s store in Coventry when she threw the used cigarette on the ground . A grandmother of four told of her fury today after being fined more than £500 for dropping a cigarette butt. Kim Copeland, 52, was walking home from her local Sainsbury’s store in Coventry when she threw the used cigarette on the ground - before two council officers came ‘sprinting’ towards her to say she had committed a criminal offence. Miss Copeland was then issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice following the incident in October last year, but refused to pay it within ten days in protest at how she was treated. However, after failing to pay, she eventually received a letter ordering her to appear at Nuneaton Magistrates’ Court on March 17. She was then fined £304 by magistrates who also ordered her to pay £200 court costs. Miss Copeland was unable to attend the hearing because she had to look after her son Chez, 17, who has autism, and has now criticised the city council for taking her to court. She said: ‘I was doing some shopping and was walking back home and cut through a couple of car parks. I heard these tyres screeching behind me and all of a sudden two women got out and started sprinting towards me. ‘I didn’t know whether to drop my shopping and put my hands in the air or walk towards them. I realised they had council uniforms on and they starting asking me if I was aware I had committed a criminal offence. ‘The first thing I thought was something hadn’t gone through the till properly at Sainsbury’s. I hadn’t even realised I had a cigarette. It is just automatic. 'I must have lit one up when I came out of the shop. My generation just discard the butts on the floor. If I had dumped a three-piece suite, then fair enough - but it was just a cigarette end.' Miss Copeland added: ‘They were just so stern and officious. The way they spoke to me was horrible. It is the whole manner, they acted as if I had murdered somebody.’ The grandmother, who also has three grown-up daughters, is now considering whether to pay the fine by the deadline - which is tomorrow. If she refuses she could be taken back to court. Hearing: After failing to pay Miss Copeland was told to appear at Nuneaton Magistrates' Court (pictured) Miss Copeland said: ‘I’ve been treated like I have committed a major criminal offence. I didn’t pay because of how they were towards me but also the principle. ‘I’ve always been led to believe the punishment should fit the crime and in this case it doesn’t. I find it shocking. They are now saying I will face imprisonment if I don’t pay the fine. 'I don’t want to pay it because I won’t sleep at night if I do, but I might have to. I thought they were bluffing and it was scaremongering - I can’t believe they took someone to court over something this little.’ A Coventry City Council spokesman said the authority had a ‘zero tolerance’ policy towards litter. Andrew Walster, who oversees the council’s streets policy, added: ‘It costs us about £2.5million a year to clean the streets in Coventry. There are plenty of litter bins within the city.’","Two council officers came 'sprinting' towards Kim Copeland in Coventry .

"The battle of the batteries is hotting up. Reports claim Google is the latest firm to set up a team dedicated to boosting how long our phones, tablets and even electric cars can run for. And sources said the four-man team spends its days devising and testing different technologies from the flexible to the wearable. Reports claim Google is the latest firm to set up a team dedicated to boosting how long our phones, tablets and even electric cars (pictured) can run for. Sources told the Wall Street Journal that the four-man team spends its days devising and testing different technologies from the flexible to the wearable . The reports were made by Alistair Barr in the Wall Street Journal. Google has been working on similar projects since 2012 when former Apple battery expert Dr Ramesh Bhardwaj began leading a testing team. Mr Barr explained that Dr. Bhardwaj recently described how 'solid-state, thin-film batteries could be used in smartphones and other mobile devices that are thinner, bendable, wearable and even implantable in the human body.' He also referenced a video for Project Loon that revealed how Google has been working with experts at AllCell Technologies to develop batteries that function at subfreezing temperatures. This is vital for Google's Project Loon balloons designed to float near the stratosphere and provide internet to wider areas.

In a video for Project Loon (pictured), Google revealed it has been working with experts at AllCell Technologies to develop batteries that function at subfreezing temperatures . Fan site AppleInsider recently spotted nine job listings on Apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries. These include one for an iOS battery life software engineer (pictured left) and another for iOS software power systems engineer (pictured right) The AllCell technology uses wax and a graphite material, for example, to help lithium-ion batteries absorb heat and spread it across the power pack. Last week, a team of Stanford University chemists unveiled an aluminium battery that can recharge in less than 60 seconds. Apple defines the Apple Watch battery on its Watch product page. It says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use. All-day battery life: This includes 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music. Audio playback: The battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music. Talk time: Apple said the Watch can be used for up to three hours for calls. Workout: During this test the Watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on. Watch: When used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour. Power reserve: When the Apple Watch's battery  gets low it switches into Power Reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour. Charging time: The company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the Watch to 80% and 2.5 hours for a full charge. Apple's tests were carried out in March 2015 with a pre-production Apple Watch and software paired with an iPhone using pre-production software. Apple said battery life varies with environmental factors, use, configuration, and 'many other factors' so actual results will vary . It is said to be the first high-performance aluminium battery which is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive' and is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries. It also can't catch fire like lithium-ion technology. At present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity, the highest achieved yet with aluminium,'  but the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of existing technology. And Google isn't the only tech giant working on such plans. Last month, Apple began recruiting for experts to help boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops. At least nine job listings were discovered by fan site AppleInsider and include listings for an iOS battery life software engineer, a software power systems engineer, battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer. In particular, the iOS software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate 'will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues, modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system, and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends.' Atmel also recently announced its latest microcontrollers (MCUs) that can be fitted to a variety of gadgets and are so low power they can harvest energy from a person's body. The  SAM L microcontrollers are part of Atmel's 32-bit ARM-based MCU range and are powered by chip maker ARM's Cortex M0+ 32-bit processors. A number of Apple devices, including the iPhone 5S and iPad Air are powered by chips based around ARM technology. A team of Stanford University chemists recently unveiled an aluminium battery that can fully recharge in less than 60 seconds. It is said to be the first high-performance aluminium battery which is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive' and is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries . Last month, Atmel released its latest microcontrollers (MCUs) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person's body. Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices' Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms, healthcare, medical, wearable, and devices placed in rural, agriculture, offshore and other remote areas.' They use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made. The microcontrollers run on the firm's picoPower technology and Atmel's Event System that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks. By effectively 'sharing' energy, the whole device uses less power and, subsequently, less battery. It can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible. Plus, the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature. During a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year's CES, Andreas Eieland, Atmel's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel. This panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .","Reports claim Google is latest firm to test alternative battery options .

"It has been linked to deaths across the country and left others critically ill. Now New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has issued a state health alert that the synthetic marijuana product known as 'Spice' is sweeping the city, and that 160 people have been hospitalized in nine days after using the drug. Over 120 of those people were admitted to Emergency Rooms in the same week. The cannabinoid, also commonly called 'K2' or 'Mojo', is predominantly abused by teenagers and typically sold over-the-counter as incense or potpourri. State health alert: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Friday  that 'Spice', also known as 'K2' or 'Mojo', is sweeping the city, with 160 people admitted to hospital in the nine days from April 8, 120 of them in one week . 'Synthetic drugs are anything but harmless, and this rash of severe health emergencies across the state is direct proof,' Governor Cuomo said, according to The Hudson Valley News Network. 'We banned synthetic marijuana, bath salts and similar substances to avoid the disastrous results that occur – and as law enforcement and health officials continue to crack down on the use and sale of these drugs in New York, we are today issuing a health alert as a warning amidst this surge in hospitalizations.' Symptoms can range from confusion, drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate, seizures and loss of consciousness, according to the New York State Department of Health. 'Young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging, but they are not made for human consumption,' New York Alcohol and Substance Abuse Service s Commissioner Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez told KOCO. 'They are dangerous and can have significant, long-term effects on the brain.' But the same problem is occurring all over the U.S. Critically ill: This photo shows Jeff Stallings, who was placed in medically-induced coma alongside his older brother, Joey, after taking synthetic marijuana on APril 6 in his hometown of McComb, Mississippi . On life support: The siblings, both in their twenties, fell seriously ill earlier this month after smoking the drug, a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana. Above, Joey . Dangerous: The cannabinoid, also commonly called 'K2' or 'Mojo', is predominantly abused by teenagers and typically sold over the counter as incense or potpourri . Alabama Department of Public Health issued a statement last week acknowledging a rise in Spcie usage and said there had been 98 overdoses in the previous month. Synthetic marijuana a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to traditional marijuana. It is nicknamed Spice, Mojo, K2, Yucatan Fire, Solar Flare and Bliss, among other things. The drug is typically smoked by users. It does not give positive results in tests for cannabis. Because the herbs and chemicals in synthetic marijuana vary, it is impossible for users to know what they are smoking. They also cannot tell what concentrations they are taking - which can lead to fatal overdoses. Unlike pot, Spice can cause a huge range of symptoms, many of which can be severe. These include tremors, paranoia, seizures, vomiting, hallucinations, chest pain, cardiac problems, kidney damage and brain damage. Meanwhile in Mississippi, there were 97 cases over eight days in April, according to CNN. Two of these Mississippi cases were Jeff and Joey Stallings, brothers who were hospitalized April 6 after smoking Spice. The siblings, both in their twenties, fell seriously ill  after smoking the drug, which is a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana. They were hospitalized within hours of each other, when they collapsed after suffering from hallucinations, vomiting, night sweats and violent shaking. They had to be put on life support. Fortunately both were able to fight for their lives and were allowed home on April 13. Jeff Stallings, however, has suffered permanent kidney damage. Last year, California teenager Connor Eckhardt died after smoking one hit of synthetic marijuana. Connor, 19, fell asleep after taking the drug. His brain, deprived of oxygen, began to swell and he slipped into a coma. He was declared brain dead at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach hours later. A deadly case: Last year, California teen Connor Eckhardt died after smoking one hit of synthetic marijuana. Above, Connor is pictured brain dead, surrounded by his family, shortly before his organs were donated . 'He gave into (peer pressure) - thinking that it was okay, it was somehow safe - and one hit later, he goes to sleep and never wakes up,' Connor’s father, Devin Eckhardt told KTLA at the time. Doctors were unable to detect spice in Connor's system - there is no way to trace its everchanging components. However, they knew he had taken it after finding the package of the drug in his pocket. Connor's family donated his organs after his death, in accordance with the teenager's wishes. They later created a Facebook page to warn others about the perils of synthetic marijuana. 'Connor Eckhardt died after taking ONE HIT of synthetic marijuana (SPICE, K2, POTpourri). This dangerous substance is legal.

"A recent survey has revealed that more than half of UK children don't have any veg, and 44 per cent have no fruit on a daily basis. With childhood obesity on the rise in the UK, these new figures are incredibly alarming. For more than two decades, I've been in the business of helping children get their daily fill of fruit and veg. So I wanted to share some of my feeding wisdom to help encourage healthier, happier children. It's easy to become locked in a battle of wills when it comes to dishing up healthy, nutritious food. Annabel Karmel has shred her tips on how to make children love eating vegetables . My son was a very fussy eater, so I had to think of ingenious ways to ensure he was getting a wholesome balanced diet whilst enjoying what he was eating. Truth be told, ninety percent of children go through at least one lengthy stage of fussy eating. It's so easy to feel frustrated and powerless when your child simply refuses to eat certain foods. But the key is not to give in or give up. Day in, day out, I persisted with new healthy foods, new recipes and creative ways to hide the good bits my son didn't like. In fact, it was coming up with these new and novel recipes that inspired me to create my very first book – Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner. While it can be frustrating when a child rejects the food we give them, it's actually the way that we deal with the situation that impact on their eating habits. It's not ideal to let your child get away with not eating certain foods in order to keep the peace. Giving your children a limited number of foods will only escalate their fussiness, and deprive them of the essential nutrients they need to grow and develop. If I am honest, hiding the good bits in a meal didn't always get past my children, but I found it really important to hide my frustrations. Instead, I gave them lots of praise when they ate well or tried something new. Remember, you are not alone! Keep trying out new ideas and eventually you will see positive results. Don't be afraid to quiz other mums on how they get their children eating healthy food. I used to share my recipes at my son's nursery and it felt so good to be able to help other mums in my position. Annabel says that parents should keep trying out new ideas with their children and eventually they will see positive results when it comes to a healthy diet . Tips for helping kids towards their five-a-day . 1. Try making your own healthy junk food using good quality lean meat for burgers, English muffins for pizza bases and a good way to coat homemade fish fingers is to dip them in seasoned flour, beaten egg and crushed cornflakes. For dessert it's easy to make fresh fruit ice lollies from fruit juice and pureed fruits. 2. Some kids can spot a hidden mushroom a mile off, so sometimes the best thing is to be up front about fruit and vegetables, tell them where they come from and why they are so good for you. Giving them facts could make them more interested about what they are eating. I used to offer a starter - a little teacup or saucer of something new that they could try that would be in addition to their main meal. 3. If your child refuses to eat anything other than junk food, don't worry. They will soon find there's not much point making a fuss if you don't react. 4. Without going to unnecessary lengths, try to make sure your child's food not only tastes good but looks good too. Make mini portions in ramekins, make chicken skewers or thread bite sized pieces of fruit onto a straw. 5. Avoid empty calorie snacks like crisps or soft drinks and keep a supply of healthy snacks on hand – maybe have a low shelf in the fridge with cut up fresh fruit and other healthy foods. When children are hungry, they won't wait. 6. Children like to assemble their own food, so you could lay ingredients out in bowls and let your child fill and fold their own wraps or choose their favourite toppings for their home made pizzas. 7. Most children adore cooking and tasks like squeezing fresh orange juice or cracking eggs are well within the capabilities of a young child. It's amazing how being involved in the planning and preparation of a meal can stimulate a child's appetite. 8. My chilled toddler meals are great for packing in the veggies – especially on those busy days. Based on my favourite cookbook recipes, they taste just like homemade and offer up to three of a child's five-a-day . Mini vegetable balls .

"The furious backlash against the UK’s top prosecutor intensified last night over her decision to spare Lord Janner from the dock. The position of Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders looked increasingly fragile as she faced growing calls to stand down. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs accused her of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an Establishment cover-up that lingers over the case. And even her one of her predecessors said the horrific allegations should have been resolved in the ‘full public glare of a courtroom’ rather than her London office. Scroll down for video . Campaigners, police and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of Public Prosecutions, of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear speculation of a cover-up over her decision to spare Lord Janner . Mrs Saunders fought back saying it is her job as the head of the Crown Prosecution Service to make ‘very difficult decisions’ which are not necessarily popular. But the row showed no sign of abating as further details of the claims levelled against the 86-year-old Labour life Peer were made public. The decision not to charge Lord Janner last week despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims was justified because Mrs Saunders said experts agreed that the former Leicester West MP was in such poor health due to advanced Alzheimer’s Disease. But she also ruled that he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. The top QC blamed police and prosecutors and launched in independent review, but her comments stoked fears that Lord Janner is the beneficiary of a wholesale cover-up. Yesterday, calls were growing for a judicial review of her decision, something which Leicestershire Police has said it is already considering. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who exposed Cyril Smith, said the weight of criticism against Mrs Saunders suggested something has ‘clearly gone very badly wrong’. Ms Saunders ruled not to charge Lord Janner (pictured) despite evidence of 22 offences because of his poor health due to Alzheimer’s Disease . He said: ‘Mrs Saunders is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it’s hard to see how her position remains tenable.’ Criticism of Mrs Saunders began with comments from the Home Secretary, who has already been lobbied by senior police chiefs, when she said is ‘very concerned’. Theresa May said: ‘I have been very clear in everything I have said so far about the child sex abuse issue – I expect to see justice done.’ She was joined by former Director of Public Prosecutions Lord Macdonald who said a ‘trial of the facts’ should have been considered. This would have enabled a jury to decide the facts without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed – offering a chance for victims to be heard. Lord Macdonald said: ‘It might have been wiser for the CPS to say ‘we’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the DPP.’ Further questions also emerged about the true state of Lord Janner’s health as it was revealed he wrote to the House of Lords just a fortnight ago to extend his role. The politician, who has claimed tens of thousands of pounds in expenses in recent years, took a formal leave of absence last October. When asked if he would consider retiring when the election was called, he responded in a personally signed letter received on April 9 asking to continue in office. Experts said victims may now be denied the opportunity to sue Lord Janner because none of the claims have been proven. Richard Kovalevsky QC said: ‘A finding that the acts took place may have consequences for the defendant, particularly one who has the benefit of an honour from the Queen.’ Mrs Saunders has also come under fire over other high-profile cases, including the first disastrous attempt for a conviction for female genital mutilation and the pursuit of journalists.","Alison Saunders, director of Public Prosecutions, facing furious backlash .

"A radical change in the law to protect a generation of children from the tide of internet sleaze will be introduced if the Conservatives win the election. Culture and Media Secretary Sajid Javid is setting out plans to shield youngsters from easy access to hardcore online pornography amid fears that it is corroding childhood. He promised legislation to force distributors to put effective age verification technology in place that would apply to those based in the UK as well as abroad. Scroll down for video . Easy access: The rising tide of online pornography is corroding children - but the Tories have now pledged to a radical change in the law to protect a generation of children from the tide of internet sleaze . If porn websites fail to comply, they will be blocked by a powerful new regulator which will be able to issue financial penalties. Mr Javid's pledge is a victory for the Daily Mail's long-running Block Online Porn campaign. Ministers have already persuaded internet service providers to start contacting all 19million UK households connected to the web and making them choose whether to apply family-friendly filters that block all porn sites. In addition, for any new broadband users, a block on pornographic websites is automatically applied by default. Customers now have to specifically ask for this filter to be removed – or to 'opt in' – in order to able to access adult material. But Mr Javid said a more radical crackdown was necessary to prevent children freely accessing pornography. 'Even the most attentive and engaged parents cannot know for sure which websites our children are visiting and what images they're seeing,' the minister told the Mail. 'In 2015 anyone, regardless of their age, is only ever two clicks away from the kind of material that would be kept well away from young eyes in the high street. 'Imagine a 12-year-old-boy being allowed to walk into a sex shop and leave with a DVD showing graphic, violent sexual intercourse and the subjugation of women,' he said. 'Yet each and every day children right across our country are being exposed to such images – it's happening online.' Mr Javid, who is increasingly tipped as a potential future Conservative leader, cited evidence that viewing hardcore porn can lead to children 'pressuring each other to try out things they've seen, and sharing inappropriate sexual pictures and videos'. 'It is because of these types of concerns that we have long restricted and regulated adult content in the offline world – magazines, TV, DVDs or video-on-demand content. 'Such protections are taken for granted, and, as the Daily Mail has argued for years, it's time our approach to the online world caught up.' Mr Javid said if the Tories win next month 'we will legislate to put online hardcore pornography behind effective age verification controls'. 'If websites showing adult content don't have proper age controls in place – ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material – they should and will be blocked altogether,' he added. An independent regulator will oversee the new system and determine how age verification controls will work. These are likely to involve similar software in place on gambling websites, which use credit card details or software to check passport details or driving licences to confirm users are over 18. Mr Javid's pledge is a victory for the Daily Mail's Block Online Porn campaign . The regulator will also be given the power to require UK service providers to block specific websites identified as distributing hardcore pornography without effective age verification controls in place. It will have the power to issue targeted sanctions, including financial penalties. Mr Javid added: 'It is right that we have the same rules applying online as we do offline. If we fail to take action, there is every chance the sort of things children see on these websites will be considered 'normal' by the next generation. That is not the sort of society I want to see and certainly not the sort of society I want my children to live in.' Sarah Green, of the End Violence against Women Coalition, said the group 'warmly welcomed' the proposals. Peter Wanless, of the NSPCC, said: 'We don't want children to learn about sex and relationships through the warped lens of adult pornography. 'This week we warned that ten per cent of children aged 12 and 13 were addicted to porn and one in eight had taken part in a sexually explicit video. Any action that makes it more difficult for young people to find this material is to be welcomed.' It's time to protect children  online . By SAJID JAVID, Culture & Media Secretary, writing exclusively for MailOnline . Imagine a 12-year-old-boy being allowed to walk into a sex shop and leave with a DVD showing graphic, violent sexual intercourse and the subjugation of women. You would, quite rightly, ask whether society should allow such a young mind to view hard-core pornography. I’m sure we’d all agree that the answer would be an emphatic “no”. Yet each and every day children right across our country are being exposed to such images. And it’s happening online. The internet has been an amazing force for good in so many ways. But it also brings new threats and challenges for us to contend with. I’m a father of four young children and I know all too well that the online world can be a worrying place for mums and dads. After all, even the most attentive and engaged parents cannot know for sure which websites our children are visiting and what images they’re seeing. Culture and Media Secretary Sajid Javid is setting out plans to shield youngsters from easy access to hardcore online pornography . In 2015 anyone, regardless of their age, is only ever two clicks away from the kind of material that would be kept well away from young eyes in the high street. And allowing young people to access pornography carries alarming consequences both for individuals and for society. It can lead to children pressuring each other to try out things they’ve seen online, and sharing inappropriate sexual pictures and videos. And it can lead to children having unhealthy attitudes towards sex AND relationships. It is because of these types of concerns that we have long restricted and regulated adult content in the offline world – whether that is magazines, TV programmes, DVDs or video-on-demand content. Such protections are taken for granted, and, as the Daily Mail has argued for years, it’s time our approach to the online world caught up. So today we are announcing that, if the Conservatives win the next general election, we will legislate to put online hard-core pornography behind effective age verification controls. Of course adults should be perfectly free to look at these sites. But if websites showing adult content don’t have proper age controls in place – ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material – they should and will be blocked altogether. No sex shop on the high street would be allowed to remain open if it knowingly sold pornography to underage customers, and there is no reason why the internet should be any different. An independent regulator will oversee this new system. It will determine, in conjunction with websites, how age verification controls will work and how websites that do not put them in place will be blocked. One thing is absolutely clear: the Conservative Party’s commitment to child safety online. For the past five years we have been working with industry on A voluntary basis, an approach that led to the creation of default-on family filters. But filtering is just one way in which we can keep our children safe online. Now we can – and must – go further to give our children the best start in life. There will be some who say that this exercise is futile, that websites and children alike will find ways to get around this law. And I agree that there are always people who try to avoid legal restrictions. But we must not let the best be the enemy of the good. It is right that we act now and do what we can to restrict this content. It is right that we have the same rules applying online as we do offline. And it is right that we do everything we can to protect our children. If we fail to take action, there is every chance that the sort of things children see on these websites will be considered ‘normal’ by the next generation. That is not the sort of society I want to see and it’s certainly not the sort of society I want my children to live in. Over time Britain’s laws have evolved to reflect our most deeply held values and beliefs, and the protection of children has long been a sacrosanct principle at the heart of that. I don’t believe that we should abandon such an important principle simply because the latest threat to our young people comes from a technology that also brings incredible benefits. There is a choice at this election, and it is between a party which backs families wants to give children the best start in life, and a chaotic Labour Party with no plan. We are clear: adults should and will be free to view legal content, but we would never stand by and allow that 12-year-old boy to buy hardcore pornography from a sex shop. It’s time to make sure our children are just as well protected online as they are on the high street.","Radical change in the law to protect a generation of children will be introduced if the Conservatives win the election .

"An artist has carved out a unique genre for herself with her colourful portraits of celebrity bottoms. Spanish artist Catalina Viejo, 31, who is based in New York, paints miniature pictures from candid paparazzi shots rather than using glossy magazine images, and has worked her magic on stars including Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Beyoncé. In total she has completed 42 tiny pictures, which are the size of a postage stamp and don't feature any faces, and cost around $90 (£60). Scroll down for video . Artist Catalina Viejo paints miniature pictures of famous bottoms, including Kim Kardashian's, from candid paparazzi shots . Amber Rose is Catalina's favourite portrait of the 42 miniatures, as hers was the biggest bottom on the smallest canvas . The bite-sized series is aptly titled 'A View of the End' and is currently on display at the SHAG Gallery in Brooklyn, New York. Catalina explained that she wanted to paint her celebrity subjects while they were relaxed or on holiday - not as they are seen in glamorous campaigns which have been polished and airbrushed. In keeping with this approach, Catalina named each work with just the celebrity's first name, making each piece more personal. Miley Cyrus: In total, the 31-year-old artist has completed 42 miniature works, which cost up to $90 (£60) each . Cameron Diaz: The bite-sized series is titled 'A View of the End' and is currently on display at the SHAG Gallery in Brooklyn, New York . Katy Perry: Catalina explains that she wanted to paint her celebrity subjects while they were relaxed or on holiday - not as they are seen in glamorous campaigns . As well as the current exhibit, 30 of the artist's works are also available in a book under the same title. Speaking about the series, Catalina said: 'The fact these butts belong to celebrities increases the viewer's curiosity. 'Partly because you feel as if you're looking at intimate images of people you're familiar with, but also because of the contradiction created in the context of celebrity. Britney Spears: Catalina named each work with just the celebrity's first name, making each piece more personal . Penelope Cruz: As well as the current exhibit, 30 of the artist's works are also available in a book under the same title . Gisele Bundchen with her baby: Speaking about the series, Catalina said, 'The fact these butts belong to celebrities increases the viewer's curiosity. Partly because you feel as if you're looking at intimate images of people you're familiar with.' Catalina added: 'The most powerful marketing tool a celebrity has is his or her public identity, and the face represents that identity. 'Even when we see a famous rear in a magazine, it's accompanied by the celebrity's face. 'My miniature paintings include no faces and some would be very difficult to recognise without the title forcing people to become their own paparazzi. 'People tell me they feel as though they are looking literally at the 'back of fame' which is fun to think about. 'I enjoyed painting each one for different reasons, but I really liked painting Amber's bum (one of the largest bums) at the smallest scale. The painting of her bum is the smallest in the exhibition, about the size of my thumbnail!' Rihanna: Catalina said 'My miniature paintings include no faces and some would be very difficult to recognise without the title forcing people to become their own paparazzi.'

"Outspoken British comedian Russell Brand has appealed to this fans to sign up to the mercy campaign to save condemned Bali Nine duo from facing death row. In true non-nonsense style, Brand lables Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's efforts to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Indonesia as 'daft' as he urges his nine million Twitter followers to sign up to the petition in a desperate bid to spare their lives. While the pair await their fate on what is infamously dubbed as 'Execution Island' in Java, Brand posted that the Australians have already done a decade behind bars and did not deserve to face a firing squad. Scroll down for video . Outspoken British comedian Russell Brand has appealed to this fans to sign up to the mercy campaign to save condemned Bali Nine duo who from facing death row . Brand labels the pair's efforts to import 8kg of heroin as into Australia as 'daft drug smuggling' Andrew Chan (left) and Myruan Sukumaran (right) await their fate on what is infamously dubbed as 'Execution Island' 'These Aussie blokes are going to be killed soon for a bit of daft drug smuggling (they've done 10 yrs already) HELP!' Brand tweeted. Brand also encouraged his fans to attend an exhibition of Sukumaran's work organised by his cousin who lives in London to be held at Amnesty International's London headquarters today - April 13. 'Come to this exhibition in East London next week - the artist is going to be executed in Indonesia in a month,' he tweeted. Sukumaran is  a talented artist who was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty -who has also lead the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives. Painting has proven a great sense of solace for Sukumaran over the past decade that he has spent in Kerobokan jail in Bali and has even run art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan. His cousin, Niranjela Karunatilake,  last visited her cousin on death row in February. Sukumaran will turn 34 on Friday which is also exactly ten years since their arrest as a ringleader in the Bali Nine drug smuggling operation. Niranjela said it was: ' just too sad to think that could be his last birthday'. 'The death penalty is never the answer and I don't believe it deters crime, but in Myu's case, when he has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short,' she said. 'We are not asking for Myu to be freed, all we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life and continues his positive impact on the Indonesian prison system and other inmates.' Brand said the Australians have already done a decade behind bars and did not deserve to face a firing squad .

Sukumaran is a talented artist, who was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty, and ran art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan in Kerobokan . After losing a bid to challenge their clemency rejections in the state administrative court last Monday and as Jakarta waits on the legal efforts of a few other prisoners before setting an execution date, the pair's Australian's lawyers sought a constitutional court review to make clear the president's obligations on considering clemency on Thursday - a process that could take several months. They also intend to challenge the barrier preventing foreign citizens from constitutional court appeals. However, Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has dismissed the challenge as delaying tactics and says he won't recognise it. Indonesian lawyer for the death row pair, Inneke Kusuma, told reporters the effort was not aimed at delaying the executions, but clarifying a prisoner's rights.","Russell Brand urges fans to sign up to mercy campaign for Bali Nine duo .

"Girl power was the definite winner at yesterday’s historic Boat Race as women rowed on the same course and same day as the men for the first time. Oxford University women’s rowing team beat Cambridge – inspiring their male colleagues to win for the third time running in the 161st race. The women’s race has been held since 1927 further up river at Henley, but after years of campaigning for equal billing, they were finally given equality with the men. Scroll down for video . Water babes: Oxford's women's team made history and competed alongside the men for the first time . Joy: Oxford, who entered the race as favourites, took an early lead and finished more than six lengths ahead . Oxford, who entered the race as favourites, took the lead within the first few minutes and never looked like losing it. They finished six-and-a-half lengths and 19 seconds ahead. The team’s performance was undoubtedly boosted by American Olympic Gold medallist and world champion Caryn Davies, who was the most experienced rower – male or female – on the river. She said winning had been tougher than the Olympics. ‘It hurts a lot,’ she added. Cox Jennifer Ehr had told her colleagues before the start of the race: ‘Let’s do this for everyone who made it happen. Let’s make history today.’ There were scenes of tears and jubilation when the victorious women were helped out of their boat. Team captain Anastasia Chitty said it had been ‘humbling’ to win on the same course as the men. ‘It’s just amazing. It’s a really special moment,’ she said. Oxford’s preparations had been far from smooth. Ten days ago, the crew had to be rescued by the RNLI when their boat sank during a training session. Huge crowds watched yesterday’s event, which will transform perceptions of the women’s race, meaning that its days as the poor relation are well and truly over.

"A black man has come out in support of police body cameras after he was gunned down by a white officer during a traffic stop and writhed in agony on the ground saying: 'Why did you shoot me sir?' Levar Jones, 36, who has no criminal record and was on his way home from his job at a Subway café, said the horror of his own shooting was brought home by the death of Walter Scott last week. He told Daily Mail Online he wanted to see non-lethal methods introduced for police, new training in them, and supported bodycams for officers. Mr Jones was confronted by a police officer opening fire at him as he followed instructions to produce his driver's license and was hit in the stomach. The horrifying incident was captured on the officer's dash cam and has led to the policeman Sean Groubert, 31, being fired and charged with a felony assault. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Aim: This is the moment South Carolina state trooper Sean Groubert opened fire on Levar Jones, who was unarmed and had his back to the officer. He had stopped him over a suspected seatbelt violation . Victim and accused: Levar Jones has no criminal record and was unarmed when he was pulled over. Sean Groubert has been sacked as a state trooper, and charged with felony assault over the shooting . The victim said the shooting on last September has led to serious psychological problems which had left him unable to work since and needing to see a counselor regularly to help him through the trauma. He told Daily Mail Online: 'I was just an innocent person pulling up at a gas station. 'The officer asked for my license and I tried not to look as a threat at any minute. 'I made it obvious that I was going for my wallet and as I was going to reach for it. He started shouting at me and opened fire.' Mr Jones said he had gone to the Shell gas station in Columbia, South Carolina, the same state where Mr Scott was killed this month, to buy cigarettes while on his way home from work. The dash cam recorded the shooting and Mr Jones writhing in agony, calling the officer 'Sir' and pleading to know why he had been shot. Groubert is seen in the video pulling out of the station and then suddenly putting his vehicle into reverse, turning back and driving towards Mr Jones' white pick up truck which has just pulled in. The clip shows Mr. Jones getting out of his vehicle and on hearing the officer's instructions to produce his license, turn and reach into his vehicle to retrieve it. Groubert shouts, 'Get out of the car!' When Mr Jones complies and starts to back away from the vehicle with his hands raised, Groubert opens fire. Four shots can be heard with the victim being hit in the hip and reeling backwards and falling to the ground as demanded by the shooter. The audio then reveals Mr Jones screaming and saying: 'I was just getting my license. I am sorry…Sir, why was I shot? All I did was reach for my license. I'm coming from work.' Groubert tries to explain himself and responds: 'Well, you dove head-first back into your car. Then you jumped back out. I'm telling you to get out of your car.' The policeman is heard accusing the catering worker of a seat belt violation, but even amid his pain, he can be heard saying: 'I just pulled it off right there at the corner to pull in the gas station.' The officer was charged with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, a felony which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in jail. Deadly: The moment Walter Scott was shot repeatedly as he ran away from North Charleston police officer Michael Slager . Dashcam: The last moments of Walter Scott were only fully captured on camera because Feidin Santana, a passerby, used his cellphone to capture the shooting. This was the limted view from the officer's dash-cam . Mourning: Walter Scott's mother Judy arrives for his funeral, escorted to the left by a member of the US Coastguard, which her son had served in . Protest: Rev Al Sharpton led a tribute at the spot where Walter Scott died and called for fundamental change to policing to stop more deaths . The complaint states that Groubert 'did without justification unlawfully shoot Levar Jones which produced great bodily injury or was likely to cause great bodily injury. 'Audio and visual recordings, as well as written statements, obtained are further evidence to indicate the shooting incident was without justification.' Mr Jones added:'I could have been killed too. I was shot for nothing and even as I was on the ground wounded the officer asked for my id. 'At the hospital they chained me with both arms to a bed for five hours and released me on my own and I had to use cotton wool to tend the wounds. 'It was an awful experience. I am lucky to be alive. I didn't do anything but go for my license as I told him. He just shot at me. 'But this police brutality has to be stopped. I am not surprised that Walter Scott got shot. This type of incident has been going on for too long and there could be others.. 'I have come to Charleston to pay my own respects and to support the campaign for body cams. 'I am here to support and help other victims of police brutality because I am the survivor.' South Carolina police chiefs, in the light of Walter Scott's death, have announced that all patrol officers will be fitted with body cameras and Mr Jones called for the same policy to be followed around the US. 'These would lead to a better relationship between police and communities as inter action would be on record. 'Dash cams can't record everything because sometimes things happens out of the view of the vehicle like in the case of Walter Scott. Luckily Mr Santana was there with his mobile phone. 'The police in the US are too trigger happy. I am told ,they practice shooting around 3 or 5 times a week and that makes them reach for their guns too easily. 'When they are at an incident, their minds and their hands are already thinking about the gun on their belts. Facing life: Michael Slager, with his wife Jamie, who is eight and a half months pregnant. He faces a life sentence if found guilty of murder and has been sacked from his force . 'They are trained to use deadly force and that is wrong sometimes. There needs to be better training and practices. 'I have done my research and I spoke to friends in London who say the police largely don't have guns but when they do they rarely shoot and get target shooting maybe once a week. 'The body cams on officers in London must be a great help to both the police and the public. That would be the same here. 'Body cameras go hand in hand with the dash cams which are very useful in high speed pursuits. But once the officer exits that frame, it is no longer useful. Body cams are vital. 'But I would say officers must use Tazers first or pepper sprays. But there is a training problem in this country. Our officers are trained to shoot to kill.' He said there was a misconception that only black males were targets and had researched cases where white unarmed men had been shot by police too. 'We just need big changes in America and that time is right now. Please show everybody the video of me being shot because that is the reality of what is going on in America today. 'I can't watch it myself though. It is too painful for me. But that video plays in my head all the time.' The officer who shot him is on bail until the case against him concludes in the summer. Mr. Jones added: 'I await my day in court because the details are yet to come out over what Officer Groper did. 'The officer went too far on me. But I can't be judge and jury against him. 'I feel sorry for the Scott family, because they will also have more questions than answers right now.'","Levar Jones was shot and wounded by police officer in Columbia, South Carolina, when he was stopped and told to produce a license .

"A 27-year-old mother has been charged with child neglect and had her twins taken into care after her three-month-old daughter was found dead. The baby was found on the floor of the roach infested apartment with bites on her legs and head. Brittany Cherokee Dawn Bell of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, appeared in Washington County District Court via video monitor from jail on Monday. The charge of child neglect was pursued by authorities over homicide as the Medical Examiner's Office could not determine the cause of death. Police were called to Bell's home on January 8 after she reported the death of the infant. Brittany Cherokee Dawn Bell of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, was charged with child neglect after the death of her three-month-old daughter, whose body was found with roach bites on her legs and head . While Bell slept on the couch, baby Alice somehow suffocated on the floor nearby. It is unclear how this happened and for how long she lay there . Her initial story was that she had put the baby, Alice, in a crib and then found her dead later on. She then changed her story and admitted to laying the baby on the floor. Bell said that the baby might have been smothered by her 18-month-old twins out of jealousy after she had fallen asleep while watching a movie with them. She said she was afraid one of them had killed Alice by sitting on her, which was why she initially said the child was in the crib. An autopsy listed the cause of death as sudden unexplained infant death with the manner of death undetermined. The medical examiner found abrasions on Alice's legs and head caused by roaches that infested the apartment. In an affidavit, investigator Jim Warring said: 'I can conclude that she laid the baby on the floor and fell asleep without waking during which time Alice may have been suffocated by one or both of her twins or became distressed due to the surface of the floor and suffocated.' 'Also enough time passed that roaches were able to start feeding on both the baby's legs and head,' he added. 'All of this took place less than 10 feet from the couch where Bell was reportedly sleeping.' Bell's initial story was that she had put baby Alice in a crib and found her dead later on. She then changed her story, telling authorities that she was worried one of her twins had smothered the baby . The charge of child neglect relates to a previous incident, on December 31, when a neighbor called police concerned that the children had been left alone and were crying. Bell returned to the apartment approximately five minutes after officers arrived and claimed not to have been away for very long, and acted like it was not a big deal. Neighbors told police that the children had been left alone on other occasions. The twins were taken away from Bell after the death of Alice. Tulsa World reported that Bell has other children but they are not in her care. The affidavit stated: 'Enough evidence and probable cause exists to determine that the defendant has acted in a reckless and neglectful manner that has been dangerous and possibly fatal to the children in her care and custody.' Associate District Judge Russell Vaclaw set her bond at $10,000, and scheduled a May 8 hearing.","Three-month old baby Alice died of unknown causes and was found with roach bites on her legs and head .

"Lib Dem Danny Alexander could be given a peerage in a bid to keep him in his Treasury post in a second Coalition, it emerged today. The high-flyer and close ally of Nick Clegg, who has won praise as George Osborne’s second-in-command, is on course to lose his seat to the Scottish nationalists. He would be one of the highest-profile casualties of the SNP surge which is set to take the seats of many of Scotland 40 Labour and 11 Lib Dem MPs on May 7. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem Danny Alexander could be given a peerage in a bid to keep him in his Treasury post in a second Coalition . But one plan said to be under consideration by the party, is to keep the 42-year-old MP Inverness MP as Chief Secretary to the Treasury by giving him a lifetime sinecure in the House of Lords. Other party stalwarts likely to be ennobled after the election are former leaders Charles Kennedy who may lose his seat of Ross, Skye and Lochaber, and Sir Menzies Campbell who is standing down. The Lib Dems believe in ultimately tearing up the current House of Lords and making it a fully elected chamber. Their interim plan is to cut the number of peers to 450. However while they wait for support from other parties for Lords reform, they are likely to continue adding to the ranks of their 99 appointed and four hereditary Lib Dem peers. Nick Clegg, pictured in Portsmouth today,  has claimed the Lib Dems would serve as the ‘heart’ of a Tory-led government, opposing welfare cuts, or the ‘brains’ of a Labour one – reining in borrowing . If made a peer, Mr Alexander could serve as a minister in a second coalition particularly with the Tories who he has worked closely with as a member of the ‘quad’ which approved coalition policy. According to party rules, a coalition with either the Tories or Labour would have to be voted on by Lib Dem members, who may oppose it, in the belief that the party needs a spell in opposition. But schools minister David Laws made clear last week that many of the frontbench are keen for another term, saying the party still have an ‘appetite for power’. A spokesman for Mr Alexander refused to rule out that he would ever take a peerage, but said no such plans were under consideration and that he believed he would retain his seat. The Treasury chief, who is said to have ambitions for the party leadership, is likely to have no difficulty finding a role in the City or a global financial institution. If a second coalition were formed, Nick Clegg has claimed the Lib Dems would serve as the ‘heart’ of a Tory-led government, opposing welfare cuts, or the ‘brains’ of a Labour one – reining in borrowing. Mr Clegg has appeared in public several times in recent weeks to make economic announcement with David Laws, who held the Treasury job before Mr Alexander . Mr Alexander has attacked the Conservatives’ plans to slash £12billion from the welfare bill as a ‘dangerous deceit’, and accused them of trying to ‘balance the books on the backs of the working poor.’ He said last week: ‘We said we will talk first to whichever party has strongest mandate from the electorate. It is for the electorate to decide who has the strongest mandate, who has the most seats in parliament. That is who we talk to first.’ A spokesman for Mr Alexander said the plan for a peerage was ‘complete, total, utter nonsense’. He said: ‘Danny is focused on one thing which is retaining his seat and he’s working very hard to do that. It’s obviously a fight but he will do miles better than these wretched polls suggest.’ A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘This is not on our radar. Charles Kennedy is not going to lose his seat and Danny Alexander is not going to lose his seat, we’ve seen the figures. They are fighting to get back into Parliament and we believe they will be successful so this is not relevant.’","Plan hatched for Chief Secretary to the Treasury to go to House of Lords .

"Need to have a difficult conversation with your other half or your boss? It might be a good idea to take them out to dinner. We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.","Dutch and Canadian study looked at 100 men and women .

"Ten deputies have been placed on leave after a shocking video emerged showing them punching and kicking an alleged horse thief for two minutes following a chase through the California desert. In the video, captured by an NBC helicopter, Francis Pusok, 30, is seen falling off the horse he was suspected of stealing after being pursued several miles by the San Bernardino County officers. Seconds later, two deputies catch up to Pusok and stun him with their Tasers. They then stun him again, and again, as lies splayed face-down on the ground, with his arms placed behind his back. As the camera keeps rolling, the officers apparently kick the suspect in the head and crotch, before other deputies arrive on the scene. One clearly draws back his leg and swings it at Pusok's head.

Now, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon has placed 10 deputies on paid administrative leave for their alleged roles in the graphic footage, which he said had 'disturbed and troubled him'. McMahon said the video, captured on Thursday, appeared to show an excessive use of force. He added that he was launching an internal investigation into the actions of the unidentified officers. 'I'm not sure if there was a struggle with the suspect,' he told NBC. 'It appears there was in the early parts of the video. What happens afterwards, I'm not sure of, but we will investigate it thoroughly.' In a tweet via the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office, McMahon said: 'We have identified 10 deputies involved in the use of force during the arrest & they have been placed on paid admin leave.' Earlier on Thursday, Pusok had allegedly fled by car after deputies had tried to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation. He later dumped the vehicle in the Hesperia area, it is said.

Paid leave: In a tweet via the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office (pictured), McMahon said: 'We have identified 10 deputies involved in the use of force during the arrest & they have been placed on paid admin leave' Couple: Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner (left), said her boyfriend (right) has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted he is a great father, and said she 'couldn't believe' the filmed attack . The suspect, dressed in bright red clothing, then reportedly stole a horse and made his way across the desert near the town of Apple Valley, east of LA, before being tracked down by deputies. In the video, Pusok can be seen falling from the horse as a deputy runs up and uses a stun gun on him. McMahon said the stun gun was believed to be ineffective because of the man's loose clothing. The suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back. The video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch. As more officers join in, the men huddle in a pack over Pusok, continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head. Meanwhile, one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle. Following the incident, two deputies were taken to a nearby hospital for injuries, including abrasions, a twisted knee and a back injury from being struck by the horse, the sheriff's office said. Chase: The suspect, dressed in bright red clothing,  reportedly stole a horse and made his way across the desert near the town of Apple Valley, east of LA, on Thursday, before being tracked down by deputies . Apprehended: In the video, Pusok can be seen falling from the horse as a deputy runs up and uses a stun gun on him. McMahon said the stun gun was believed to be ineffective because of the man's loose clothing . Pusok was treated at the hospital for abrasions and bruising. He was then released to be booked on suspicion of felony evading, theft of a horse, possession of stolen property and reckless driving. After the video was broadcast by NBC, it sparked outrage on the Internet, with many users noting that Pusok was lying on the ground in a 'surrender' position when he was beaten by the officers. On Friday, Mr Terrell told KABC that the attack seemed never-ending. 'This is as bad, if not worse, than what they did to Rodney King. This was terrible. It kept going and going and going,' he said. Rodney King, who died in 2012, rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers following a high-speed car chase in March 1991. Although four officers were charged with assault with a deadly weapon and use of excessive force, they were later acquitted in a series of verdicts that are thought to have caused the 1992 LA riots. 'Surrendering': The suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back. The video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch . Huddled around: As more officers join in, the men huddle in a pack over Pusok, continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head. Meanwhile, one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle. Also Friday, McMahon said an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions in the arrest of Pusok. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. 'I'm asking for some patience while we complete a thorough and fair investigation,' McMahon said. 'I am disturbed and troubled by what I see in the video. It does not appear to be in line with our policies and procedures. Hospitalized: Pusok (pictured) was treated at a nearby hospital for abrasions and bruising . 'I assure you, if there is criminal doing on the part of any of our deputy sheriffs or any policy violations we will take action.' The deputies were wearing audio recorders, but McMahon said he had not listened to them and the recordings will be part of the investigation. Attorneys for Pusok told KNBC-TV Friday as they left the jail that their client has a badly swollen eye, marks from the beating over his face and body, and is in pain. 'He remembers being beat, and he remembers that he wasn't resisting, that he laid still, he complied immediately. He says that he didn't even move a muscle because he didn't want to be continuously beat, yet it still happened,' said attorney Sharon Brunner. Ken Cooper, a use of force expert, said the deputies were clearly frustrated and appeared to take that out on the suspect. One, he said, appeared to be striking Pusok with the Taser. 'It doesn't look good. It looks like his hands are behind his back even when they're doing the blows,' Cooper said. 'The justification for using force is to gain compliance from the suspect, and the suspect seems to be complying. So what this looks like is those blows are not justified, they're not necessary and they're not professional.' Cooper said the officers should be disciplined, retrained to deal with stress especially, and the video should be used for department-wide training. He said the officers allowed their emotions and adrenaline to overtake their professionalism. But training helps 'inoculate' officers from responding improperly during high-stress situations. 'When chasing a fleeing suspect, in high stress, you have to control that. It's your obligation as a professional. You can lose it sometimes,' Cooper said. McMahon said deputies had previously been called to Pusok's home in Apple Valley, where he had allegedly made threats to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of family members. 'We were very familiar with his aggressive nature,' McMahon said. Comparison: On Friday, Pusok's attorney, Jim Terrell, told KABC that the attack was 'as bad, if not worse, than what they did to Rodney King'. King (left, after his beating) rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers (right) following a high-speed car chase in March 1991 . Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder. Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, said her long-term boyfriend has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted that he is a great father who did not deserve the brutal beating. 'I'm not going to stand here and say that he's perfect, because who is?' she  said. 'I couldn't believe it,' Bindner said after seeing the video. 'The first thing I said was 'they cannot do that.'' The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation.","Deputies filmed chasing 'horse thief' Francis Pusok in the California desert .

"A counterfeit drug gang has been jailed after raking in £10million by selling fake Viagra while pretending to be a fishing tackle business. Judge Charles Wide QC described it as a 'highly organised, large-scale criminal enterprise' which risked the health of members of the public, as he sentenced the gang at the Old Bailey. The UK-wide conspiracy offered cheap erectile dysfunction pills to online and face-to-face customers around the world. This was a 'sophisticated and carefully planned' scam which had bases in north-east Lincolnshire and Sussex, the judge said. A counterfeit drug gang has been jailed after raking in £10million by selling fake Viagra. Neil Gilbert (pictured left) was jailed for six years and Catherine Laverick (right) was sentenced to three years and 10 months . He said the 'the real mischief is the catastrophic damage that could be caused' to the public, noting that genuine drug companies had pointed out that acid, brick dust and road paint had been found in fake Viagra. One group based in southern England was headed by Neil Gilbert, 42, who made up to £60,000 a week selling unlicensed and counterfeit drugs to unsuspecting customers. The northern branch was led by Thailand-based Stephen Laverick, but his ex-wife Catherine Laverick, 47, was in charge of day-to-day operations in the UK. And their family members and friends were recruited to assist with the massive criminal enterprise. The court heard the conspiracy lasted eight years from 2004 and continued even after the gang were arrested in September 2011 following an investigation by the drugs regulatory body, MHRA. They had used a series of 'front' companies claiming to sell jewellery, fishing tackle and cosmetics to accept the electronic payments. Proceeds were then laundered through more than 100 bank accounts both in the UK and abroad. The gang offered fake Viagra pills to unsuspecting customers around the world. File photo . Huge sums of money were transferred between the conspirators, sent offshore or, were withdrawn in cash in the UK or abroad. The money laundered or obtained through fraud by all of the defendants totalled £8,444,896. Prosecutor Gillian Jones said: 'This case is not about wanting to distribute good medicines cheaply, but rather the motivation was greed, with an utter disregard for patient safety. 'The medicines that were seized which were purported to be Viagra and Valium in fact turned out to be counterfeit,' the prosecutor said. 'This was big business. The proceeds of the supply of these medicines via websites which have been traced to various merchant facilities is in excess of £10 million - that is not the real figure. 'Not all bank accounts have been identified. Some are abroad and haven't been traced properly and some medicines were paid for in cash.' An audit kept by Gilbert revealed that the gang received £60,000 a week from the sale of unlicensed medicines during 2011 alone - a turnover of more than £3million. The money was transferred into bank accounts held by members of the conspiracy or their relatives before being withdrawn in cash or used to sustain the business, the court heard. Miss Jones added: 'There is no doubt a conspiracy to sell these unlicensed medicines existed. They had to set up and maintain websites through which medicines were sold, rent storage units and packing centres. 'Offices were rented, stationary and packaging purchased, mail boxes rented to which customers posted cash and merchant banking facilities to allow payments by cards. 'They purported to be trading fishing tackle, cosmetics or jewellery but they were just a front to hide the real merchandise which was unlicensed medicines. Seth Pennington (pictured outside the Old Bailey) who was described as Gilbert's right-hand man and carried out the day-to-day operations under the directions of his boss, was jailed for five years . Kristina Sofoulakis (left) was jailed for two-and-a-half years and Mark Bristow (right) was jailed for four years . 'As demand for the products grew the customer database widened to countries in Europe including Sweden, France and Germany.' When banks started raising concerns about the nature of the business, the gang opened accounts offshore in Belize and Panama where fewer questions were asked. Gilbert, of Ovingdean, Brighton pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply unlicensed medicines, two counts of money laundering, possession of counterfeit Valium and possession of counterfeit Viagra. He was jailed for a total of six years at the Old Bailey. His partner Kristina Sofoulakis, also of Ovingdean, Brighton, admitted conspiracy to supply medicines and money laundering in the UK and offshore. She was jailed for two-and-a-half years. She had worked as a book keeper, monitoring orders and payments. Sarah Laverick (pictured) was handed a 16-month jail term, suspended for two years and was ordered to carry out 200 hours' unpaid work . Catherine Laverick, of Ulceby, South Humberside, admitted conspiracy to supply unlicensed medicines and money laundering in the UK and abroad. She was jailed for three years and 10 months. Her son, Thomas Laverick, was spared jail after being given a 14-month sentence, suspended for two years. He set up the fake company 'Shore Catch' to buy medicines and launder money. His sister Sarah Laverick was handed a 16-month jail term, which was also suspended for two years. She was ordered to carry out 200 hours' unpaid work. She pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering. The 26-year-old set up the fake fishing tackle company to help with buying medicines and laundered money through numerous bank accounts. Hugh Adair (left) was given a 12-month jail term, suspended for two years and Donna Denton (right) was sentenced to eight months, suspended for 18 months . Catherine Laverick's former partner Hugh Adair was given a 12-month jail term, suspended for two years and ordered to carry out 200 hours' unpaid work. Adair, 37, of Brighton, helped with the day-to-day running as well as facilitating payment for the purchase of medicines. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply unlicensed medicines and fraud. Seth Pennington, 42, who was described as Gilbert's right-hand man and carried out the day-to-day operations under the directions of his boss, was jailed for five years. Pennington, of Brighton, admitted conspiracy to sell or supply unlicensed medicines, selling or distributing counterfeit goods (Viagra), two counts of money laundering, one of possession of counterfeit goods purporting to be Valium and one count of possession of a medicinal product (Kamagra) without marketing authorisation. Daniel Nilsen (left) was sentenced to four months imprisonment, suspended for a year and Lee Pettit (right) was sentenced to 22 weeks, suspended for a year . Mark Bristow, 45, acted as the middle man between the northern and southern parts of the enterprise, liasing directly with Catherine Laverick and Gilbert. Bristow pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply unlicensed medicines, selling or distributing counterfeit Viagra and money laundering. He was jailed for four years. Darrell Jacob, 38, provided banking facilities to receive customer payments for unlicensed medicines through front companies DJ Cosmetics and DJ Casuals. Donna Denton, 40, of Grimsby, set up a Cardnet facility, which she falsely claimed was for the sale of jewellery. She pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months and given a three-month curfew requiring her to stay at home between 7pm and 6am. Daniel Nilsen, 26, set up a Cardnet facility, which he falsely claimed was for the sale of fishing tackle by mail-order. Nilsen, of Grimsby, pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to four months imprisonment, suspended for a year. Lee Pettit, 36, of Brighton, was not directly involved in the sale of pills, but was involved in opening bank accounts and money laundering. Darrell Jacob (pictured left with Lee Pettit) will be sentenced on May 29 after admitting two counts of conspiracy to supply unlicensed medicines and money laundering . He pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to supply and two counts of fraud and was sentenced to 22 weeks, suspended for a year. Darrell Jacob, of East Sussex, admitted two counts of conspiracy to supply unlicensed medicines and money laundering. He will be sentenced at a hearing on May 29. Judge Charles Wide QC, sentencing, said: 'This case concerns a highly organised, large scale criminal enterprise to sell unlicensed and counterfeit medicines and to launder the illegal profits of that enterprise. 'The regulatory regime concerning the products sold during this criminal enterprise exists for the whole purpose of protecting the public.' The judge said the use of counterfeit Viagra and Valium could cause 'serious harm' if taken by unwitting customers. A statement, read out in court, from Viagra manufacturer Pfizer said counterfeit pills have been found to contain toxic material including brick. Judge Wide added: 'There is no direct evidence of such harm, but that is no thanks to any great care taken in its execution. 'Each of you was involved to line your own pockets or help others line their pockets with an absolute disregard for public safety.'","UK-wide conspiracy offered cheap erectile dysfunction pills to customers .

"For the 160,000 people crammed into Churchill Downs on Derby Day, picture-taking can run neck-and-neck with betting and sipping mint juleps amid a winning field of photo opportunities: sleek racehorses, daring fashion statements, celebrities and the twin spires. But this year, they'd better not use selfie sticks. Joining a growing list of museums, music festivals and sports venues around the world, the iconic Louisville track hosting the 141st running of the Kentucky Derby on May 2 has banned the pole-like contraptions that grasp cellphones and allow people a longer reach to snap their self-portraits. Churchill Downs, which hosts the annual Kentucky Derby on May 1st and 2nd, has banned the use of selfie sticks by attendees. Above, a woman poses for a normal selfie at last year's race . Selfie sticks' increasing popularity has left cultural institutions and sporting events with decisions about balancing patrons desire to photograph themselves with safety concerns (File photo, Jan. 2015) Other events such as the Coachella and Lollapalooza music festivals also have banned the photo aids. Prominent museums including the Smithsonian and the National Gallery of Art in Washington prohibit their use. Selfie sticks aren't allowed inside Yankee Stadium. Some English Premier League soccer teams make the devices off-limits, and the Australian Open tennis tournament discourages fans from using them court-side. Churchill Downs encourages selfies and the avalanche of social media attention they can generate. But banishing selfie sticks is a safety measure to protect the horses and the massive crowd on Derby Day, track spokesman John Asher said. 'I don't think it's a huge sacrifice for anybody who loves to take a selfie,' Asher said. 'You'll still be able to take a selfie. You just won't be able to take one of yourself as if your arms were nine feet long.' The popularity of self sticks has spread wildly over the past several years, sending elf-photographers armed with smartphones into the world looking to catch themselves in just the right light. Now cultural institutions and public spaces with large numbers of people have been faced with the choice of allowing the technological toys or sticking to plans that keep patrons and facilities safe. Several big name organizations have already quashed the dreams of amateur photographers looking to snap themselves with priceless art or a Premier League match, though less gadget-savvy attendees probably thank them for it. The list of places where the devices are banned already includes dozens of venues and is growing, according to Yahoo. Below are ten prominent entries. Churchill Downs in Kentucky . Coachella Music Festival in southern California . The Getty Center in Los Angeles . The Hermitage in Amsterdam . Lollapalooza Music Festival in Chicago . Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York . Museum of Modern Art in New York . The National Gallery in London . Premier League stadiums including those for Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham . Nineteen different Smithsonian museums in Washington DC . Yankee Stadium in New York . A spokesman for Churchill Downs said that the selfie stick ban was designed to protect horses and spectators. Above, a woman snaps a picture of her elaborate hat last year . Churchill Downs (pictured) has banned selfie sticks beyond its most popular event, Derby Day, and will not allow the devices whenever there are races . The selfie stick ban will extend beyond Derby Day to apply whenever there is live racing at Churchill, he said. Chris Scherf, executive vice president of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, said he hasn't heard of any other US horse tracks banning the devices. But he said he wouldn't be surprised if other big tracks follow Churchill's lead. 'Actually I would expect a lot of sports to have concerns about their potential misuse,' he said in an email. At Belmont Park in New York, a review of security policies for the June 6 Belmont Stakes will include selfie sticks, said track spokeswoman Jenny Kellner. Meanwhile, the NFL is evaluating whether to allow the devices into stadiums next season, said league spokesman Brian McCarthy. Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm, who took out a selfie stick patent a decade ago, said he had no problem with Churchill's policy. A racing association official said that he wouldn't be surprised if more racetracks banned selfie sticks. Above, racegoers mingle in the courtyard near the stables at Churchill Downs last year . 'You'll still be able to take a selfie. You just won't be able to take one of yourself as if your arms were nine feet long,' a Churchill Downs spokesman said. Above, Kentucky Derby attendees sip cocktails at the event . 'It's prudent to limit its use because, even inadvertently, it could cause a problem,' he said. 'We have to roll with the punches.' Mr Fromm said he doubts such policies will hurt sales for his Quik Pod devices. 'It's like saying if you can't use your camera at a concert, does that mean people aren't going to buy cameras anymore?' he said. Another selfie-stick entrepreneur, Jacqueline Verdier, CEO of Selfie on a Stick, said banning the device from events like the Derby is a disservice to fans. 'There would have been some amazing photo opportunities that unfortunately are not going to be there,' she said. Ms Verdier downplayed safety concerns with the devices: 'Like so many other things in life, people just have to be respectful of others around them.' Natasha Jensen, a University of Louisville student planning to attend this year's Derby with friends, said she sees the track's ban as a good safety precaution, especially in the seemingly anything-goes infield. Sporting events and museums are drawn by the amount of social media attention that selfie sticks help bring, though are wary about their dangers or nuisance to other patrons. Above, a group poses in Washington DC . 'It goes get loud and rowdy,' she said. Ms Jensen, a 21-year-old criminal justice major, said she expects to spend more time taking selfies than betting at the Derby: 'I have such bad luck, I don't bet on horses very much.' She doesn't think the selfie stick ban will generate much reaction. 'I don't think it will be that big of a deal this year because they're still an up-and-coming product,' she said. Asher predicted that Derby Day will still produce plenty of creative selfies, even without selfie sticks. Churchill Downs officials worried that a selfie stick along the rail could become a distraction for horses, Asher said. And it's a day when the alcohol flows during the long racing card. 'Somebody might think it's a light saber after a little while,' Asher said, tongue-in-cheek. 'You never know.'","Racing grounds bans selfie sticks for May 2nd Derby Day and all live races .

"Elena Udrea, pictured, is accused of taking bribes and abusing her position in government . A glamorous Romanian politician who finished fourth in the country's presidential election has been charged with accepting bribes and abusing her power while a government minister by anti-corruption police. Elena Udrea, 41, was investigated over claims during her time as the country's tourism minister that she had accepted bribes worth an estimated £1.3 million. She was indicted along with seven other people, including the country's former economy minister Ion Ariton, who was charged with abuse of power. Prosecutors in Bucharest revealed details of the investigation. Romania is regarded as one of the most corrupt countries in the European Union. Udrea, who is a lawyer, has strenuously denied the claims against her. She is a close ally of former president Traian Basescu. Prosecutors allege that Udrea and a number of her associates sought money from private firms in exchange for guarantees that they would be paid promptly for public projects. The centrist politician is accused of accepting cash in Romanian leu as well as euros worth an estimated £1.3 million. She claims the charges against her are politically motivated and accuses the anti-corruption prosecution agency of being linked to the secret service. Recent corruption cases have shown mayors, city councillors as well as other politicians requiring a kick-back to secure lucrative contracts. Prosecutors claim that Udrea used some of the cash to finance the political party she was involved with. It is also claimed that Udrea used 8.1 million leu, worth £1.3 million of money belonging to a regional development ministry to fund a private boxing event under the pretext of buying tourism advertising for Romania. Ariton, who is now a senator, is accused of convincing ten state-owned companies to sponsor the private event for 1.7 million leu, worth £276,000. Under Romanian law, state-owned industries are not allowed to sponsor private events. Ariton also denies any wrongdoing. Udrea was the minister of tourism between 2008 and 2009 and also the minister of regional development and tourism between 2009 and 2012. In her last position, she administered a yearly budget of £2.37 billion. One-time Romanian presidential candidate Elena Udrea, pictured, is accused of taking bribes .

"Face wipes have long been a lazy part of our beauty routine to cleanse skin and shift make-up. But a new generation of wipes — known as radiance pads — promises not only to remove eyeliner and mascara, but also to retexturise and brighten skin and, in some cases, even do away with fine lines and age spots. Scroll down for video . Face wipes have been part of our beauty regime for years now but there are a new range of wipes now that promise to not only to remove eyeliner and mascara, but also retexturise and brighten skin (stock image) Infused with exfoliating glycolic and fruit acids, as well as skin-soothers such as mango extract and liquorice, these new pads are beauty game-changers, offering all the benefits of a professional facial in a simple at-home swipe. With the expertise of top Harley Street dermatologist Dr Nick Lowe, Lauren Libbert puts some of these latest new-generation wipes to the test . . . SKIN-BRIGHTENER . Origins Modern Friction Instant Brightening Pads, £31 for 40, boots.com . THEY CLAIM: A quick sweep of these fruit acid-infused pads is like a professional 30 per cent glycolic peel, and you’ll see results in under a minute. Use twice-weekly. THE TEST: These have a strong, antiseptic-type smell and are a bit abrasive, leaving tingling that lasts a minute or so. Skin feels squeaky-clean and looks instantly shiny and smoother. EXPERT VERDICT: ‘Definitely not for sensitive skin and should only be used twice-weekly, as advised. The fruit acid strips off dead cells and works to make skin brighter and smoother. ‘But the harsh ingredients do open the skin to moisture loss, so follow with a moisturiser with a high SPF to protect skin.’ GENTLY GLOWING . First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads, £22 for 60, feelunique.com . THEY CLAIM: Cucumber and Indian gooseberry tone the skin, while lemon and liquorice root leave it glowing. The pads reduce visible pores, improve clarity and diminish appearance of fine lines. Use once or twice daily. THE TEST: These circular pads are moist and gentle. They leave skin feeling damp and soft, with an instant, youthful glow. EXPERT VERDICT: ‘A good starter pad. Skin-soothing cucumber counteracts the harsh glycolic and lactic acids. Liquorice is a known skin-brightener and fruit berries are good antioxidants. ‘Start slowly with these — once a week — to avoid irritation, and build up to daily use.’ SENSITIVE SKIN . Simple Kind To Skin Radiance Wipes, £3.29 for 25, amazon.co.uk . THEY CLAIM: Ideal for sensitive skin, these help cleanse, exfoliate and remove impurities. Added moisturiser hydrates skin. THE TEST: These look like old-school wipes: big, rectangular, damp tissues that remove make-up easily and effectively. My skin feels soft and plump afterwards, but I’m not left with a radiant glow. EXPERT VERDICT: ‘Ideal for most skin types, with a combination of clever skin-soothing and moisturising ingredients. Mango extract and bisabolol (an extract of chamomile) soothe, while glycerin is an ultra-efficient moisturiser. ‘A step up from regular wipes and good for twice-a-day use.’ ONE-MINUTE FACIAL . Nip+Fab Glycolic Fix Exfoliating Facial Pads, £12.95 for 60, superdrug.com . THEY CLAIM: Pads are soaked in glycolic acid, which retextures and resurfaces skin, while witch hazel helps to tone. Moisturiser with hyaluronic acid and soothing blue daisy leads to brighter, smoother skin. THE TEST: These have a strong perfume smell and a quick swipe leaves the skin tingling. My face instantly feels brighter, smoother and refreshed — like a facial, only a hell of a lot quicker. EXPERT VERDICT: ‘The glycolic acid lifts dead cells, leaving skin refreshed and renewed, while hyaluronic acid traps moisture. The retexturising and resurfacing are likely more subtle than claimed, but this works well as a weekly brightening boost.’ INSTANT PEEL . Cane & Austin Retexturising Treatment Pads, £18 for 25, beautybay.com . THEY CLAIM: A one-step, at-home glycolic treatment that gently exfoliates, while helping to rebuild collagen. Reveals a clearer, more radiant complexion. For sensitive skin only. THE TEST: Each small, square pad comes folded in its own neat little wrapper. Cool and wet, it cuts through dirt and impurities and leaves a slight stinging sensation, like after a facial. Skin is left instantly youthful and has more of a glow. EXPERT VERDICT: ‘A very logical approach to skincare. After the high-grade glycolic acid strips away dead, dull skin cells, the vitamin A — a retinoid — helps to stimulate new cell growth. ‘This is a highly efficient wipe, but should only be used at night, as vitamin A is damaged by visible light. Best to use once or twice a week at first, then build up to nightly use.’ DEEP CLEANSE . Nivea 3-in-1 Daily Exfoliating Wipes, £3 for 20, tesco.com . THEY CLAIM: The textured side exfoliates dirt and impurities, while the soft side cleanses and removes make-up. The magnolia extract refines and improves the skin. THE TEST: The wipe feels abrasive as you sweep it across, but the collection of dirt is impressive! My face feels clean afterwards, but a bit dry and dull. EXPERT VERDICT: ‘More of a mechanical exfoliant. The act of dragging it across the skin will remove dull cells and stimulate growth of newer, efficient ones. ‘But don’t overdo it, or you will remove too much of the skin’s protective layer. Once or twice a week is enough.’","Face wipes have long been a lazy part of our daily beauty regimes .

"Robert De Niro has said Hillary Clinton should be president, insisting she has 'earned the right' to be elected. The Hollywood legend, 71, who has been a long-time supporter of the Democratic Party, said if the former Secretary of State is voted into the White House there will be 'no surprises'. In an interview with the Daily Beast, the Goodfellas star said she had paid her dues, adding: 'It’s that simple. And she’s a woman, which is very important because her take on things may be what we need right now.' Robert De Niro, 71, (pictured with Hillary Clinton at a New York benefit in 2013), said if the former Secretary of State is voted into the White House there will be 'no surprises' He was joined by American producer and Tribeca Film Festival co-founder Jane Rosenthal. She also gave her backing to the ex-First Lady, saying: 'She’s smart, has run things before, and knows how government works and how to get things done. 'She’s watched it from the sidelines, and the frontlines.' De Niro joined Clinton last December was they were both honored at the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights annual gala. His political punditry however is not something new. In 2006, while promoting The Good Shepherd, he appeared on Hardball opposite Matt Damon at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. Host Chris Matthews asked De Niro who he would like to be president in the future. The veteran actor replied: 'Well, I think of two people: Hillary Clinton and Obama.'

"From 'here's you a piece of pizza' to 'this glass needs washed', every state has its own set of phrases that can seem bizarre to the rest of the English-speaking world. In New York, for instance, there's a tendency to use the word 'so' for drama, such as 'I'm so totally over this.' Some people in San Jose think nothing of saying 'didn't nobody help him', while Florida residents can be heard using the phrase, 'I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em.'

I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em - Florida . You are so in the Doghouse for that on - New York . Twitter can be a professional job anymore - Nebraska . Now researchers at Yale University have revealed these patterns by documenting the subtle differences in sentence structure across the US. Their interactive map allows you to click on a location and see common phrases for a region, as well as its source. While the map focuses on the US, it also has a small amount of data for the UK, with sentences such as 'yer lugs needs washed' used in Scotland and 'Ne mon nule don hum no good', in Aylesbury. 'Unlike variation in phonology (often referred to as accent) and in the lexicon (different words), variation in grammatical systems within English has for the most part not been systematically investigated,' says Larry Horn, professor of linguistics and philosophy at Yale University. 'This variation may be found among speakers who live in a certain geographical region, or who belong to a certain age group, or to a particular social or ethnic group,' he adds. During the past year, members of the project have been conducting nationwide surveys using an online crowdsourcing platform asking for people's judgment on sentences. The researchers were not interested in what is considered to be correct  grammar, but in what people do naturally. As well as the map, the team has also created a comprehensive guide that lists the different types of sentence structures used. One of the most interesting discoveries  are presentative sentences like 'Here's you a water bottle.' 'That sentence just floored me,' says postdoctoral associate Jim Wood, a Yale University lecturer in linguistics. 'It seemed very alien and different to me.' The overall pattern was clear; In the South people found that sentence to be completely normal, while in the North, it was almost unheard of. From 'here's you a piece of pizza' to 'this glass needs washed', every state has its own phrases that can seem odd to the rest of the world . 'It's a reason didn't nobody help him', is a common sentence structure used in San Jose, claims the study authors at Yale University . While the map focuses on the US, it also has a small amount of data for the UK, with sentences such as 'yer lugs needs washed' used in Scotland (left) and 'Ne mon nule don hum no good', in Aylesbury. And New York isn't the only region that uses 'so' to add emphasis to a sentence. Londoners also appear to have picked up the habit (right) 'It was pretty stunning, and it turns out you can do it with ""where"" as well. ""Where's me a screwdriver?"" or ""Where's me a place to eat around here?""' he added. Other notable examples include ‘Don’t none of y’all work as hard as I do’ in Virginia; ‘we all use night-crawlers anymore’ in Iowa; and ‘I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em’ in Florida. Meanwhile, people in New Haven sometimes use 'so don't I', such as in the sentence, 'he plays guitar, but so don't I'. Linguistics Professor Raffaella Zanuttini explained that there is also a social implication to this research. 'Often people are convinced that there is a right way of speaking a language and a wrong way of speaking that language. 'From the point of view of a linguist, that is really off the mark for many reasons,' she says. 'We linguists can see through this, because we have a more scientific approach to language,' says Zanuttini. 'We believe that creating an awareness of what we consider to be basic facts about language can have a positive social effect, by making people aware that they are expressing a negative evaluation of others.'

"Murdered preacher Abdul Hadi Arwani (above) was killed by a hitman who climbed into the back of his car, it emerged last night . Murdered preacher Abdul Hadi Arwani was killed by a hitman who climbed into the back of his car, it emerged last night. The Syrian-born 48-year-old was lured to an upmarket street in London on the pretence of providing a quote for some building work. But when the imam arrived, the killer got into the rear seat of his Volkswagen Passat and shot him several times. The murder at 11.15am on Tuesday bears all the hallmarks of a professional assassination because the gunman was thought to have used a silencer and it took place away from CCTV cameras. Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officers are investigating whether Mr Arwani, a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, was murdered on the orders of the regime. They suspect the part-time builder was tricked into driving to Wembley to quote for a job – but the killer was put off when the imam took his teenage son along and claimed he could not find the keys to the house. He is thought to have been executed when the mystery client – described as having an African accent – asked Mr Arwani to return a second time alone. Shortly after the shooting Mr Arwani's car was discovered 'perfectly parked' on the side of the road with the engine still running and with one of the windows wound down. The father-of-six from Acton, west London, had links to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group outlawed in Syria and other countries in the Middle East. He is understood to have been a member of the organisation until about seven years ago, but retained ties to some of the group's senior figures. The Syrian-born 48-year-old was lured to an upmarket street in London on the pretence of providing a quote for some building work. Above, two men stand outside the An Noor mosque in Acton, west London, which is near to where Mr Arwani was shot dead on Tuesday . Police cordoned off the murder scene. It is thought that when the imam arrived, the killer got into his Volkswagen Passat . Mr Arwani was a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who is pictured above in September 2013 . Mr Arwani fled Syria in 1982 after a massacre in his home city of Hama carried out on the orders of Assad's father, Hafez. The imam, who moved to Britain in the mid-1990s after studying Islamic law in Jordan, claimed he was sentenced to death in his absence by the Syrian regime. He was involved in violent anti-Assad demonstrations outside the Syrian Embassy in London three years ago. Police were forced to use riot shields to beat back protesters after they broke through barriers, and six people were arrested. Mr Arwani told reporters during the demonstration: 'This building belongs to the Syrian people, not a regime killing people every single day for ten months.' Detectives are also considering whether the father of six was killed by someone associated with the notorious An Noor mosque in Acton where he was imam from 2005 to 2011.","Abdul Hadi Arwani found dead in his 'perfectly parked' car on Tuesday .

"Of all the people to be wary of getting caught on camera doing something incredulous, you would think a TV news reporter would know better. But Britt McHenry, a Washington D.C.-based sports reporter for ESPN, has been suspended from her position after an ugly and offensive rant she unleashed on a hapless tow truck company employee surfaced online this week. The 28-year-old, who hails from New Jersey, had her car towed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Arlington, Virginia, and the verbal attack was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office. 'I’m in the news, sweetheart, I will f-----g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying in the video. Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry has been suspended for one week and could face further punishment after video surfaced of her berating an Advanced Towing employee in Arlington, Virginia . Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Glamorous: Originally from New Jersey, McHenry is a sideline reporter for ESPN based in Washington D.C. Pictured is Gina Michelle, the clerk abused by McHenry and told she needed to lose some weight . The incident occurred on April 6. The parking attendant can be heard in the video warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. 'That’s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this,' McHenry responds. 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' The parking attendant patiently replies: 'Well lets get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money…with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' She's outta there: ESPN immediately responded by suspending McHenry, but only for one week . After a few more comments, including telling the woman she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos' I'm on television and you're in a f-----g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping the bird to the cameras . 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?': McHenry, who has impeccable grooming when on-camera, berated the woman for her appearance and her job . Video of the shocking scene was obtained by Live Leak. As the video spread online, ESPN were forced to react. A spokesman confirmed McHenry had been suspended, however only for one week. It is unclear whether a more serious punishment will be handed down. Right after the incident took place, McHenry took her Twitter account to rant about how Adanced Towing is 'corrupt'. Not surprisingly, she has since deleted the tweet. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . Do as I say, not as I do: McHenry's words of wisdom earlier this year . On Thursday, she turned to social media again to apologize for her actions, saying it was an 'intense and stressful moment' for her. She posted online:  'In an intense and stressful moment, I allowed my emotions to get the best of me and said some insulting and regrettable things. As frustrated as I was, I should always choose to be respectful and take the high road. I am so sorry for my actions and will learn from this mistake.' According to The Big Lead, McHenry was eating Hunan Chinese restaurant on Wilson Boulevard in Arlington when her car was towed. Advanced Towing are yet to comment on the incident.

"It has been a key part school chemistry lessons for more than a century, but now the periodic table may need to be redrawn after scientists found a rare element may be very different from originally thought. Researchers have for the first time been able to test how much energy is required to strip an electron from an atom of the radioactive element lawrencium. The rare metal currently sits at the very bottom of the periodic table at the end of a group of elements known as the actinides, which sit in a separate block from the main table. But the results of new research suggest the element may have properties similar to sodium and potassium, which may fuel arguments that it would be better placed in the main body the periodic table. Lawrencium, marked as Lr on the periodic table above, currently sits in a separate block from the main table . If it is redraw, it means that chemistry students could have to relearn the order of how the elements appear. Lawrencium, which was first discovered in 1961 by the nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence, is notoriously difficult to make and only  exists for a few seconds at a time. This has made the element, which can only be generated in particle accelerators, extremely difficult to study. There are several newly discovered atoms that currently do not appear on the periodic table. Two years ago scientists claimed to have discovered the existence of a new atom with an atomic number of 115. This makes it one of the heaviest chemical elements detected to date and does not occur naturally. Instead scientists had to synthesis it in the laboratory by bombarding a film of another heavy element known as americium with calcium ions. The resulting element lasted for just a fraction of a second before it decaying into more commonly found elements. Although still to be officially named, it has been given the temporary name of ununpentium. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry has also recently announced that nineteen elements have had their atomic weights reassessed. Among those to have had their standard atomic weights adjusted are elements like aluminium, fluorine, arsenic, caesium, cadmium and selenium. While some of the atoms were found to have an average weight that was a tiny fraction greater than previously calculated, others decreased. Overall the total atomic weight displayed on the periodic table increased by 0.003640021 as a result of the changes. But now researchers at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency have been able to create enough to measured the ionisation potential of lawrencium for the first time. Speaking to Chemistry world, Yuichiro Nagame, a researcher at the Japan Atomic Engery Agency who took part in the study, said: ‘[Lutetium and lawrencium] – the last column of lanthanides and actinides – could be put into the group III column of the periodic table, under scandium and yttrium.’ The current structure of the periodic table was drawn up in 1945 after the Nobel-prize winning chemist Glenn Seaborg suggested the actinides - rare radioactive elements - belonged in a separate part of the table which is known as 'f-block'. However, some chemists have argued that placing lawrencium at the end of this block was incorrect and they should be put in the 'd-block' of the main table. Dr William Jensen, a chemist at the University of Cincinnati, argues that along with lutetium, lawrencium is misplaced in the f-block. In a paper published in the journal Foundations of Chemistry last month, he said: 'Though there are many misconceptions concerning the nature and function of the periodic law and table, perhaps the most prevalent among modern chemists is the belief that the periodic table is nothing more than an electron configuration table. 'While there is certainly a significant correlation between electron configurations and chemical periodicity, the correlation is far from perfect. 'Lutetium and lawrencium, rather than Lanthanum and Actinium, should be assigned to the d-block as the heavier analogs of Scandium and Yttrium, whereas Lanthanum and Actinium should be considered as the first members of the f-block with irregular configurations.' Lawrencium, represented by the diagram left, was discovered by nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence (right) Lawrencium was first generated by Ernest Lawrence by bombarding californium atoms with boron atoms to create the new superheavy element. However, scientists have only ever been able to produce minuscule amounts of the substance and it has a half life of 27 seconds. The new study, which is published in the journal Nature, used the same approach as Lawrence to create the element that bears his name but captured it in a helium and cadmium iodide gas. This was passed through a heated tantalum surface giving the short-lived lawrencium enough energy to shed its outer electron - the ionisation potential. The researchers found this matched a recent prediction of 4.96eV - giving it the lowest ionisation potential of all elements in the f-block. This representation of the periodic table shows the ionisation potential of elements following the new results . However, in a statement, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency said it did not feel it affected the structure of the periodic table. They said: 'Since the introduction of the 'actinide concept' as the most dramatic modern revision of the Periodic Table of the Elements by Glenn Seaborg in the 1940s, the element with atomic number 103, lawrencium (Lr), played a crucial role as the last element in the actinide series. 'We show that removing the outermost electron requires least energy in Lr among all actinides, as was expected. T . 'This validates the position of Lr as the last actinide element and confirms the architecture of the Periodic Table.' However, Dr Eric Scerri, a chemist and historian at the University of California Los Angeles, said the results supported the push to move lawrencium into the min part of the table. He said: 'If the periodic table is presented in the more correct 32-column or long-format, and if one maintains the order of increasing atomic numbers throughout the table, one is inevitably led to the conclusion that Lu and Lr belong to group 3 and that La and Ac should be placed at the start of the f-block elements.' Despite the debate the result is likely to now generate, Professor Andreas Türler, a chemist at the Albert Einstein Centre for Fundamental Physics at the University of Bern, Switzerland, described the experiment as 'spectacular'. The researchers were able to study lawrencium for the first time using an ionizer cavity (left) which revealed that the element has one of the lowest ionisation potentials of any of the atoms in the f-block (right)","The Japan Atomic Energy Agency has studied lawrencium for the first time .

"A top-secret security operation was launched to protect Prince Charles from a feared terror attack by Welsh nationalists at his investiture ceremony, newly released official papers reveal. The eyes of the nation were on the heir to the throne for the historic event on July 1, 1969, but behind the scenes, Prime Minister Harold Wilson was convinced terrorists campaigning for Welsh independence would target Charles – then 20 – at the Caernarfon Castle ceremony. Classified documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday under Freedom of Information laws show that the Government sent Metropolitan Police officers to Wales in the lead-up to the ceremony to join the fight against extremists who had already set off a series of bombs. Threat: The Queen invests the Prince at Caernarfon Castle in 1969 after secret police were sent to Wales in fear of an attack on the monarchy . The targets of the operation were members of the nationalist groups Movement for the Defence of Wales (MAC) and the Free Wales Army (FWA). The files show Wilson’s government approved plans to send officers from the Met to Wales to run a secret unit that would spy on the extremists. The files do not include any details about the methods employed by the officers, but there are several references to ‘intelligence gathering’ and the ‘dissemination of information’. On August 8, 1968, the Home Office wrote to all Chief Constables in Wales informing them of the new police unit that would be headed by two senior Met officers. The letter stated: ‘The Home Secretary thinks it necessary to adopt exceptional means of keeping himself informed about the criminal activities of extremists in Wales and the action being taken to deal with them.’ It added: ‘Officers from Scotland Yard will have the particular assistance of an intelligence unit which will be created from (and detached from) the regional crime squad.’ Wilson later voiced his fears in a letter to James Callaghan, his then Home Secretary, on February 4, 1969. He wrote: ‘The security position, as I understand it, still gives cause for concern; and we must be as sure as we can that all possible precautions are taken. 'I want to feel confident that, if necessary, I can advise The Queen that in the Government’s opinion the whole programme between now and July can go forward without significant risk of any untoward interruption.’ In previously classified documents Wilson told his then Home Secretary he wanted to be able to tell the Queen the programme would be able to proceed . He added: ‘I should be grateful, therefore, if you would let me have a note describing the current and prospective security situation regards Wales, together with the arrangements which are in train for protecting the Prince of Wales.’ In April that year, Wilson also considered cancelling plans for the Prince, who was then a Cambridge undergraduate, to spend a term at the University of Aberystwyth prior to the ceremony after being alarmed by the fact extremists had exploded a bomb at Cardiff police HQ that month. He asked Callaghan: ‘Would the Home Secretary please reconsider in the light of the latest outrage in the police headquarters in Cardiff. Might we be wiser to cancel Aberystwyth?’ But the increased surveillance did not stop the groups’ activities. On the evening before the investiture, two members of MAC, Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, were killed when a bomb they had been placing near government offices exploded prematurely. John Jenkins, the MAC leader who was later sentenced to ten years in jail for his role in the movement, last night insisted he had never intended to harm the Prince of Wales. He said: ‘We did what we did because we wanted to change the nature of the investiture. We didn’t want it to be an occasion for dancing around the maypole and I think we achieved that.’ Buckingham Palace, the Home Office and the Met Police declined to comment.

"An amazing map revealed by Nasa has shown where lightning occurs most on Earth. The map reveals average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometre from 1995 to 2013. And the results show that the highest amounts of lightning flashes occur in the far eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and Lake Maracaibo in northwestern Venezuela. Scroll down for video . The map above shows the average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometer from 1995 to 2013. Areas with the fewest number of flashes each year are grey and purple; areas with the largest number of lightning flashes - as many as 150 per year per square kilometer (0.4 square miles) - are bright pink. The Democratic Republic of Congo was found to have the most over the period . The map was created using data from Nasa’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, and the Orbview-1/Microlab satellite. In the map, the areas with the largest number of flashes - up to 150 per year per square kilometre (0.4 square miles) - are shown in bright pink. The areas with the least are grey and purple. According to the satellite observations, lightning occurs more often over land than it does over oceans. And it also seems to happen more often closer to the equator. The higher frequency over land is because solid earth absorbs sunlight and heats up faster than water, so there is greater atmospheric instability - leading to the formation of storms. And Nasa’s Dr Daniel Cecil, a member of the Global Hydrology and Climate Centre’s lightning team, said the data also shows interesting trends. According to the satellite observations, lightning occurs more often over land than it does over oceans. Shown here is a passing storm over the African countryside with forked lightning on 10 October 2013 . The higher frequency over land is because solid earth absorbs sunlight and heats up faster than water, so there is greater atmospheric instability - leading to the formation of storms. Shown is a storm hitting the city of Tripoli in Libya . Researchers have found that regardless of where you are in the world, lightning bolts are at their most powerful at 8am. This is because there are fewer particles in the atmosphere overnight, so it takes a more powerful charge to overcome the extra distance between these particles and release the bolt of power. For example, a large number of flashes were seen during the month of May in the Brahmaputra Valley of far eastern India. The heating and weather patterns are unstable and changeable at that time-just before the onset of the monsoon, which brings plenty of rain but much less lightning. In contrast, locations in Central Africa and Northwestern South America have large amounts of lightning throughout the entire year. Dr Cecil noted that more years of data has not necessarily brought notable big-picture differences when compared to earlier maps. ‘The longer record allows us to more confidently identify some of these finer details,' he said. 'We can examine seasonality, and variability through the day and year-to-year.’ This comparable Nasa map shows global lightning strikes from January 1998 to 2013 from the NASA/MSFC Lightning Imaging Sensor .","A Nasa map has revealed which parts of the world experience the most flashes of lightning ever year .

"Ryan Skivington who admitted killing a girl's guinea pigs by squeezing the life out of them . A professional boxer killed a nine-year-old girl's guinea pigs in front of her by slowly squeezing the life out them before throwing them out of her window. Ryan Skivington from Staining near Blackpool took the pets, called Ant and Dec, out of their cage during a row with the girl's mother. The 26-year-old lightweight, who appeared at Blackpool Magistrates Court, today admitted criminal damage to the guinea pigs. He also admitted assaulting his former partner Bobbi Jo Houston at her home in Blackpool during the attack on February 12 this year. In addition he also damaged a TV and iPad worth £740 during the attack. Jim Mowbray, prosecuting, said: 'This was a sustained domestic violence incident which took place in the home of the victim. 'The guinea pigs were killed as a result of this man's actions. 'The nine-year-old daughter witnessed him taking her pets from their cage after he went into her bedroom where they were kept. 'He gripped them and then threw them out of the window resulting in their demise.' Mitch Serangi, defending, said that Skivington had no previous convictions for violence. The nine-year-old girl witnesses Skivington squeeze the guinea pigs after taking them out of their cage in her bedroom (file picture) He added: 'His former partner did not make a statement at first but she has now done so hence his change of plea to guilty. Magistrates bailed Skivington so that pre-sentence reports can be prepared. He also must keep to a curfew and away from his former partner's address as terms of his bail.","Ryan Skivington took the pets from cage during a row with girl's mother .

In Madagascar, lemurs are one of the most at risk species, as are shrew tenrecs. There are 105 recognised species of lemur, of which 24 are critically endangered, 49 are endangered, 20 are vulnerable and three are near-threatened. In Mexico, the loss of habitat as a result of agriculture and fishing has already driven many species close to extinction. For example, vaquita is the world’s rarest marine mammal. The small porpoise wasn't discovered until 1958 but there are now said to be fewer than 100 in the wild. In Brazil there are 82 endangered mammals. Experts from Lancaster University recently surveyed households in the cities of Borba and Novo Aripuanã to find out which animals they hunt and eat from the rainforest. The UK has five endangered mammals, but these are almost exclusively marine mammals such as seals and whales that have come under threat from over fishing, including the blue whale, the fin whale, the sei whale and the North Atlantic right whale .

They found that virtually all of the 153 households - 99 per cent - eat fish found in the jungle at least once a month, while 79 per cent eat bushmeat made up of both mammals and birds. Nearly half of the households surveyed - 48 per cent - said they eat turtles and tortoises, with 28 per cent feasting on caimans. And some of the species being eaten are classed as endangered, vulnerable and threatened. Madagascar is second on the list with 114 endangered mammals, with threats particularly facing lemurs and the region's shrew tenrecs. This compares to 38 in Cameroon and 24 in South Africa . There are 105 recognised species of lemur (ruffed lemur pictured), of which 24 are critically endangered, 49 are endangered, 20 are vulnerable and three are near-threatened . These include a type of forest pig called the white-lipped peccary, which despite being ‘near threatened’ was eaten by 19 per cent of those surveyed.

"A Philadelphia woman lost her leg and her home went up in flames, all because a neighbor believed she was trying to steal her boyfriend and ran her down in her SUV, family members say. Precious Richardson Coleman, 29, turned herself in to police Saturday and awaits two charges of attempted murder after running down 24-year-old Beatrice 'Dee Dee' Spence and her uncle in her 2004 white Dodge Durango. WPVI reports that Coleman had shown up on Spence's block in the Nicetown neighborhood of Philadelphia, before Spence went out to confront her. Struck down: 'Dee Dee' Spence, 24, lost her leg in an intentional hit and run by 29-year-old Precious Richardson Coleman, who believed Spence was trying to steal her boyfriend, according to family members . That's when Coleman sped forward, hopping the curb and striking both Spence and her uncle, 37-year-old Damon Watson, who was standing alongside his niece. 'She jumped up on the pavement,' Watson told the Daily News. 'I turned, and the car threw me. She hit me on the side. I bounced off the car.' 'I turned and saw Dee Dee. Her whole leg was flying off,' Watson continued. 'It was hanging off. She was screaming in pain.' Family members said the SUV briefly pinned Spence against the porch, before Coleman reversed and sped away. Paramedics arrived and transported Spence to Temple University Hospital in critical condition, where she had to have her right leg amputated below the knee. Spence's mother, Danika, had been frying chicken and cooking macaroni and cheese, but left the kitchen in a rush to help her daughter. Charged: Coleman turned herself in to police Saturday morning and is held on $750,000 for attempted murder and related charges . Hit and run: A security camera caught Coleman's SUV speeding away from the scene. The vehicle was later found by police with significant damage to the front bumper . Double tragedy: Spence's mother, Danika, ran out of the house to help her daughter, leaving unattended food cooking on the stove, which triggered a housefire . The unattended stove went up in flames, causing a housefire that consumed both the Spences' home and a neighbor's, before firefighters extinguished the blaze. The hit and run was the climax of a simmering feud between the two women over Coleman's current boyfriend, whom Spence had reportedly dated in the past. 'She thought Dee Dee was with him,' Spence's sister Alissa, 14, told the Daily News. 'She wasn't at all. That was her ex. They weren't seeing each other anymore. She had moved on.' At 5 a.m. on the morning of the incident, relatives say, Coleman showed up at the front of the home that Spence shared with her mother and two younger sisters. 'It's Precious,' Ameria Spence, 9, recalled hearing Coleman saying. 'Tell your daughter to stop f****** blocking me on Instagram!' 'Then she picked up a brick and threw it through the window,' Ameria added. Danika Spence filed a police report, family members said, but Coleman phoned Dee Dee Spence a few hours later to say she was going to return. Police found Spence's SUV with significant damage to the front bumper Saturday morning. Coleman is currently being held on $750,000 bail at Riverside Correctional Facility on attempted murder and related charges. For now, the Spence family is trying to recover from the traumatic incident, staying at the home of Spence's grandmother next door to the house that went up in flames. 'My mom, she's just so hurt. She's devastated,' Spence's 14-year-old sister said. 'She just wants Dee Dee home and safe.' 'My sister says she's trying not to be depressed. She's strong. But this is a lot.'","Precious Richard Coleman turned herself in to police Saturday after running down Beatrice 'Dee Dee' Spence and her uncle .

"A Saudi Arabian man has been arrested at the Mexican border after attempting to flee the country to avoid facing rape charges in Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February . Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state – let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah – especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later. Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest. When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege. Police did not offer details about the royal connection, besides saying that federal officials reported Alshammari is related to royalty and has family connections to the Saudi Arabian government.","Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego .

"THE SECOND I SAW YOU . by Lorna C. Beckett . (British Library £16.99) During his Easter sermon of 1915, the Dean of St Paul’s read out Rupert Brooke’s poem The Soldier, which begins: ‘If I should die, think only this of me: / That there’s some corner of a foreign field / That is forever England.’ Rupert Brooke's (pictured) poem The Soldier made him famous outside of literary circles . Before then, Brooke was known only in literary circles. But when the newspapers reprinted The Soldier the following day, he became properly famous for the rest of his life — which, as it turned out, lasted just over a fortnight. Brooke’s death at 27 from blood poisoning en route to Gallipoli duly cemented his image as the poster-boy of heroic self-sacrifice. Yet, as The Second I Saw You richly confirms, he was a lot more interesting than that. The love story it tells was unknown until 2000, when a British Library curator made a thrilling discovery: more than 100 letters exchanged between Brooke and an art student called Phyllis Gardner, together with her secret memoir of their relationship, written in 1918. Now Lorna C. Beckett, chair of the Rupert Brooke Society, has turned them into a chronological narrative, adding the background information we need, plus her own comments. At times, admittedly, those comments do smack of chick- lit clichés (including Brooke’s unwillingness ‘to commit’ and Phyllis’s need to ‘move on’.) But then again so does the story itself. The 21-year-old Phyllis first saw Brooke on the London to Cambridge train in November 1911. Like everyone else who ever set eyes on him, it seems, she was overwhelmed by his beauty and spent the journey sketching him with her handy chalks. S he then carried the sketch around Cambridge, showing it to anyone who might be able to identify him. Luckily, the two moved in similar circles, with Brooke studying at King’s College and Phyllis’s father an archaeology professor. Eventually, having tracked him down, she got her parents to invite him to lunch where, according to her memoir, the effect of his arrival was ‘as though the sun had suddenly risen’. Not all his chat-up lines would work today, though: ‘Your palms sweat,’ he once told her. ‘The Elizabethans said that was a sign of a passionate disposition.’ Nonetheless, Phyllis was smitten, not least after, while on a walk together, the two took off their clothes to wade through a river and she dried him afterwards with her hair. ‘Who was I,’ she wondered, ‘that God should give me such piercing joy?’ The trouble was that Brooke appeared to have accepted such adoration as essentially his due — and not just from Phyllis. (During their time together, the only time he didn’t have one other woman on the go was when he had two). Nor was he entirely satisfied by being dried with hair. In 2000, love letters between Rupert Brooke and Phyllis Gardner were discovered as well as her secret memoir of their relationship which was written in 1918 . When, after a few months, he proposed sex, Phyllis was delighted, on the heart-breaking grounds that ‘I thought of myself as the happy mother of his child’ — until he made it clear they’d be using contraception. Though badly hurt, Phyllis naturally sought to excuse Brooke’s behaviour, somehow managing to see him as a ‘poor, lost angel’ led astray by his racy friends. Even so, she stuck to her guns. ‘As I don’t consider you to be there only for my pleasure,’ she wrote in one letter, ‘so I expect you not to consider me only there for yours’ — adding a little forlornly, ‘Why don’t you want me enough to do so much as consider the possibility of marrying me?’ By comparison, Brooke’s self-justifications seem both faintly irritated and distinctly patronising, especially given that he addresses a woman less than three years his junior as ‘child’. Still, it’s hard to disagree with his final verdict, however brutally expressed: ‘You are meant for love and marriage. I’m a wanderer.’ And that, as far as the relationship went, was largely that. In May 1913, Brooke headed off to the South Seas, where the women, happily, proved more compliant. He continued, though, to write to Phyllis as a friend, returning to Britain just in time for the war. B y retrieving Brooke’s flawed — but wholly recognisable — humanity (let’s face it) from beneath the myth, The Second I Saw You would certainly have met with Virginia Woolf’s approval. ‘Anyone,’ she wrote at the height of Brooke-mania in 1917, ‘who helps us to remember that volatile, irreverent and extremely vivacious spirit before the romantic public took possession of his fame has the right to our gratitude.’ But the book also does full justice to Phyllis herself, who died, unmarried, in 1939 at 48. After being lost to history for so long, she emerges as a hugely likeable and spirited woman who, for all her wilfully over-generous misreading of Brooke’s motives, was never a pushover.","Rupert Brooke's poem The Soldier made him famous throughout England .

"A mother whose baby nearly died after he was born severely premature has urged other women to be aware of the infection that triggered her early labour. Amanda Butler, 42, had enjoyed a totally normal pregnancy until her waters broke at 25 weeks. Her son Callum was born weighing just 1lb 9oz and with translucent skin - and both she and doctors feared he would not survive. In the weeks and months that followed, he underwent heart surgery, a lumbar puncture, laser eye surgery and 10 blood transfusions. Mrs Butler, a marketing consultant from Milton Keynes, later discovered her premature labour had been triggered by a common infection called bacterial vaginosis (BV). Scroll down for video . Callum Butler was born at just 25 weeks into his mother's pregnancy. His mother Amanda was later told an infection she had, called bacterial vaginosis, was to blame. The condition can also cause miscarriage . BV affects one in three women, making it twice as common as thrush. It occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted, leading to an unpleasant odour. If untreated, it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting STIs such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Pregnant women with the condition are six times more likely to miscarry and twice as likely to give birth prematurely. One of the biggest problems is that BV often goes undiagnosed - or women wrongly assume they are suffering from another similar ailment, such as thrush. Misdiagnosis often occurs as 38 per cent of women only feel comfortable getting intimate health advice from online forums because while 19 per cent are too embarrassed to talk to their GP, research has shown. Many other women, such as Mrs Butler, have simply never heard of the condition. She said: 'I was angry when I found out that BV had caused Callum’s premature birth because it was the first I had heard of it. 'No-one ever told me the condition could lead to complications like this. 'It wasn't in any of the pregnancy books and was certainly never mentioned by midwives or doctors prior to it happening.' She said she noticed a discharge at around 24 weeks - but didn’t pay it any attention. 'Pregnancy itself can cause that to happen, and it certainly didn’t concern my midwife,' she recalled. 'The discharge didn’t have the characteristic odour that is associated with BV.' After the trauma of the premature labour and birth, Mrs Butler was initially told it had occurred because she had an 'incompetent cervix'. This is a condition that occurs when weak cervical tissue causes the cervix to open too soon - causing premature birth or the loss of an otherwise healthy pregnancy. It was only during a consultation with a specialist two years later that she was horrified to be told an infection must have caused Callum's early arrival. 'I feel like it could have been totally avoided had I been given the right information,' she said. Like many women, Mrs Butler had never heard of the condition. Callum's frail state when he was born meant doctors feared he may not live. 'I feel like it could have been totally avoided had I been given the right information,' his mother said . 'Callum’s experience was awful, and it was incredibly difficult for my husband and I to have to watch him suffer. 'As a new mum, it was heartbreaking not to be able to cuddle my son for weeks after he was born.' She added: 'Today, Callum is a happy, healthy little boy, but I am definitely one of the lucky ones.' She has decided to share her story to raise awareness and prevent other mothers going through the same terrible ordeal. 'I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what Callum endured,' she said. 'I would urge anyone in the early stages of pregnancy who thinks they may have the symptoms of BV to speak to their midwives as soon as possible to ensure this terrible experience doesn’t happen to them.' Around 54,000 babies are born prematurely in UK every year, one of the highest rates in Europe. BV affects one in three women, making it twice as common as thrush. It occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted, leading to an unpleasant odour. If untreated, it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting STIs such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Pregnant women with the condition are six times more likely to miscarry and twice as likely to give birth prematurely. One of the biggest problems is that BV often goes undiagnosed - or women wrongly assume they are suffering from another similar ailment, such as thrush. Misdiagnosis often occurs as 38 per cent of women only feel comfortable getting intimate health advice from online forums because while 19 per cent are too embarrassed to talk to their GP, research has shown. Symptoms include: . * a strong smell, particularly after sexual intercourse . * discharge that becomes a white or grey colour, or becomes thin and watery . Babies born before 37 weeks are classed as premature and as many of their vital organs will not have had a chance to fully develop causing both short terms problems, such as breathing and digestive difficulties, and potential longer term health implications, such as severe disabilities or cerebral palsy. Her story follows research at the University of California, Los Angeles, which found women who use shower gels and soaps in intimate areas are putting themselves at higher risk of developing BV. Study leader Joelle Brown said there is ‘mounting evidence’ that using these products internally can also increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis. Dr Brown's team recruited 141 women in Los Angeles who agreed to answer questionnaires about their product use and undergo lab tests for vaginal infections. The researchers found that 66 per cent of the women reported using lubricants and cleansers internally. The most commonly used products were sexual lubricants - 70 per cent of the product-using group used commercial lubricants, while 17 per cent reported using petroleum jelly and 13 per cent used oils. Test results showed that the women who used products not intended for internal use, such as oils and Vaseline, were more likely to have yeast and bacterial infections. For instance, 40 per cent of the women who used petroleum jelly as a lubricant had bacterial vaginosis - an infection that can be caused by a number of common bacterial species - compared to 18 per cent of women who did not insert petroleum jelly. Mrs Butler was speaking out for National BV Day, held in association with Balance Activ.

"A woman who worked briefly for the president of a Maine college has filed a discrimination lawsuit against the school, alleging she was expected to play tennis, jog and watch 'chick flicks' with her female boss. Sarah Hulbert, of Auburn, wrote in her complaint that she was treated differently from her male co-workers during her time as an executive assistant at Bates College in Lewiston and was fired for having 'no pizzazz.' The Sun Journal reports that the 59-year-old Hulbert worked for Bates President A. Clayton Spencer for a little longer than a month in the summer of 2012. Bates president: The ex-assistant to Bates College president Clayton A. Spencer (pictured) claims that the president fired her because she wouldn't job with her or watch chick flicks . In the suit, Hulbert wrote: 'Plaintiff's supervisor, the president of Bates College, (A. Clayton Spencer) expected plaintiff, as a condition of her employment, to engage in activities with the president, such as running, tennis lessons and watching 'chick flicks,' which the president did not require of similarly situated male employees.' Hulbert claimed she has suffered a financial loss and a human loss due to 'gender discrimination' and seeks compensatory damages at a jury trial. Hulbert alleges that she was mislead when she was for the job at Spencer's home in Winchester, Mass. 'During that interview, Ms. Spencer assured me that she highly valued the personal time that employees should have and wouldn't ... intrude upon that personal time,' Hulbert wrote in her complaint. Hulbert says when she began employment that Spencer expected her to jog with her at 5:30 a.m. but that she could not because she had surgery on her right foot in the past. When Hulbert offered to find Spencer a different running partner, 'she reluctantly suggested that I try, but left me feeling pressured to run with her if I wished to continue working for her,' Hulbert said. Hulbert claims that Spencer asked her to participate in tennis lessons but again she said she would 'reluctantly' try because of the injury to her foot. The university: Ex-assistant Sarah Hulbert, 59, worked for Bates President A. Clayton Spencer for a little longer than a month in the summer of 2012 . 'Although I indicated a willingness to try playing tennis with Ms. Spencer, her reaction at all points was significant disappointment that I was not going to be running and possibly not playing tennis with her,' Hulbert wrote in her complaint to the agency. Spencer allegedly fired Hulbert on July 10 because she 'did not have pizzazz,' Hulbert claims. Hulbert was allegedly informed that that if Spencer had 'discarded' her, then 'no one else will wish to take you' for other positions at the college. Hulbert claims that Bates had 'ratified the gender and disability-based discrimination of its president in refusing to consider me for any other open position with the college.' The Sun Journal reports that before her brief time at Bates, she worked for the law firm Berman and Simmons in Lewiston and before that was employed at Hebron Academy as the director of research and development. A Bates spokesman said in a statement that 'the college strongly disagrees with the allegations' and will defend itself in court. According to the Bates website, from September 2005 until she joined Bates in 2011, Spencer served as Harvard’s Vice President for Policy.","Sarah Hulbert claims she was treated differently from her male co-workers during her time as an executive assistant at Bates College in Lewiston .

"Kim Rose, 57, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, was questioned over allegations of bribing voters but will face no further action . A Ukip candidate accused of bribing voters with sausage rolls will face no further action - but he could be arrested if he tries it again. Kim Rose, 57, was alleged to have bribed voters in Southampton by putting on a spread at a party event, which included the pastry snacks and sandwiches. Although he was never arrested or charged, Mr Rose was questioned by police over an alleged criminal offence of 'treating'. He has now criticised the 'absolutely ridiculous' police investigation - and says he believes the furore could help him win his seat. Mr Rose, who is standing in a key marginal seat in Southampton Itchen, said: 'The officers told me today that I have now entered the political world and I must no longer hand out sausage rolls. 'They told me I have got to watch anything I do. So I'm going to stay away from bakeries from now on - if I see one I'm going to run a mile.' Mr Rose, a jeweller, was questioned at Romsey Police station, Hampshire. He poked fun at the accusations by taking in boxes of Jaffa Cakes for the officers. It came after he laughed off the initial allegations by saying: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes.' However, when he emerged 30 minutes later, he revealed that officers had refused to accept the treats, saying that would also constitute a bribe. Mr Rose, who had been backed by party leader Nigel Farage, maintained that there was no 'corrupt' intent behind his food giveaway. He also accused rival parties of underhand tactics, adding: 'The support has been tremendous and it's backfired on the major parties in Southampton big time and I now believe I can win my seat. 'I could be the first politician to win a seat in parliament based on sausage rolls and Jaffa Cakes. Scroll down for video . 'This story went all over the world. I have friends in Costa Rica who saw me come up on their TV and they nearly fell off their stools.' The alleged incident took place at a community centre in the Weston area of the city on February 21 where his friend, veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, played pool with children. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event. He said he was oblivious that he had done anything potentially illegal until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Although he was never arrested or charged, Mr Rose was questioned at Romsey Police Station (pictured) over the alleged crime - and took in a packet of Jaffa Cakes to poke fun at the investigation . Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' At the time, he said: 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, ""it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence"". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' He added: 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, calling the investigation 'utter nonsense'. Mr Rose, pictured handing out sausage rolls in Southampton last week, was backed by party leader Nigel Farage. He maintained that there was no 'corrupt' intent behind his food giveaway . Technically Mr Rose could have been fined and jailed for one year if he was ever found guilty of 'treating' He said: 'There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by election candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes. Technically Mr Rose could have been fined and jailed for one year if he was ever found guilty of 'treating'. As set out in the Representation of the People Act (1983), any voter convicted of 'corruptly accepting or taking' any meat, drink, entertainment or provision could also be fined up to £5,000. In a statement, Hampshire Police said: 'Following our meeting with Mr Rose yesterday on Monday April 13, we can confirm that no further action will be taken.' Mr Rose is standing in the seat for the fourth time. It is a key Labour-held battleground in the run up to next month's election. In 1997, Mr Rose stood in the general election as a candidate for the Socialist Labour Party which was launched by former mine workers leader Arthur Scargill. In 2001 and 2005, the flamboyant businessman stood for UKIP in the Southampton Itchen seat, polling 1,623 votes in the second. The current Southampton Itchen MP is Labour's John Denham, who won by just 192 votes last time. He will stand down after the election on May 7. The other candidates are Royston Smith (Conservative); Rowenna Davis (Labour); Eleanor Bell (Liberal Democrats); John Spottiswoode (Green Party) and Sue Atkins (TUSC).","Kim Rose was questioned after handing out sausage rolls at party event .

"Two strange, bright flashes on the surface of dwarf planet Ceres may have different origins, according to new infrared images released by Nasa. The images, captured by the Dawn probe from 28,000 miles (45,000km) away, show that a pair of mysterious spots on the dwarf planet have different thermal properties. The images were revealed as part of the first colour map of Ceres, showing variations in surface materials, and revealing the diverse processes that helped shape it. Scroll down for video . Ceres may appear to be a drab, grey world, but new infrared images suggest there is more to the dwarf planet than first thought. The latest images are the closest taken yet, and suggest that the icy body was likely once fully active. Images taken using blue (440 nanometers), green (550 nanometers) and infrared (920 nanometers) spectral filters were combined to create the map . 'This dwarf planet was not just an inert rock throughout its history. It was active, with processes that resulted in different materials in different regions,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles. The 'alien' spots on the surface, named feature 1 and feature 5, show up in visible light images as bright flashes in comparison to the rest of Ceres's surface. In infrared, region 1 is cooler than rest of surface, but 5 is located in a region that is similar in temperature to surroundings. Last month, scientists said this pair of mysterious bright spots could be towering 'water volcanoes', but they said they need to take a closer look to confirm this. Federico Tosi, who works on Dawn's Visible and Infrared Spectrometer, presented infrared images of the two spots, measuring their thermal properties. 'What we have found is that bright spot number one corresponds to a dark spot in the thermal image,' he said at a press conference today . Captured by the Dawn probe from 28,000 miles (45,000km) away, the images reveal that two mysterious bright flashes on the surface have different thermal properties. The upper trio is Region 1 at visible, infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths. At thermal infrared, the spot is dark - meaning it is colder than its surroundings. The lower trio represent Region 5. In thermal infrared, the spot disappears . Dawn observed Ceres completing one full rotation, which lasted about nine hours. The images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at Ceres' surface: from shallow, flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers . Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. The Dawn spacecraft pulled into orbit last  month around the Ceres in the asteroid belt. The probe is currently on the dark side of Ceres and won't emerge until April. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice. But feature five, which appears as two separate bright spots next to each other in visible images, didn't show up in the infrared images. 'Spot number five shows no distinct thermal behaviour,' he said. Dawn is currently too far from its target to find out why this is the case, the scientists added. It may be due to having a different structure, or being made from different material. More detail will emerge after the spacecraft begins its first intensive science phase on April 23, from a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) from the surface, said Martin Hoffmann, investigator on the Dawn camera team. The origins of Ceres' bright spots, which have captivated the attention of scientists and the public alike, remain unknown. 'The bright spots continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' Russell said. Recent images from the Dawn spacecraft reveal feature 5 at various angles as the asteroid rotates. The glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of Ceres, suggesting that they must be high above the surface rather than at the bottom of an impact crater, as previously believed. 'What is amazing is that you can see the feature while the rim is still in the line of sight,' said Andreas Nathues, a planetary scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany. Ceres rotates in this sped-up movie comprised of images taken by Nasa's Dawn mission during its approach to the dwarf planet. The glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of Ceres, suggesting that are on a high elevation in relation to the rest of the surface . The 'alien' mark can be clearly seen in images the icy world as the Dawn probe hurtled its way towards a rendezvous on March 6 . He noted that at dawn on Ceres, the spots shine brightly, but fade as dusk draws in. According to Nature, this could mean sunlight plays an important role in the formation of the features by, for instance, heating up ice just beneath the surface and causing it blast of in a plume. Scientists have speculated that the interior of Ceres is rocky with a layer of water and ice. The leading theory now for the alien spots is that the ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that at times forms into huge 'cryovolcanoes' due to internal pressure in the asteroid. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. 'Now, finally, we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious, alien world,' Dawn mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said. 'Soon it will reveal myriad secrets Ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system.' Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset image at lower left . Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter. One scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early Earth and Moon - delivering organic molecules and water to Earth. Ceres is twice the size of Saturn's geyser-spouting moon Enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Since launching in 2007, Dawn has already visited Vesta, a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles (168 million km) away from Ceres. The distance between Vesta and Ceres is greater than the distance between the Earth and the sun. During its 14 months in orbit around Vesta, the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights, including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface .","Images from Dawn reveal the mysterious spots on the surface, named feature one and feature five, in infrared .

"As every celebrity and fashionista knows, no look is complete without a statement bag. But for many stars, such as Madonna who's been showing off her mock croc 'dealer' purse, that statement is becoming increasingly controversial, with clutches and handbags emblazoned with unsavoury slogans and pictures. And bad taste bags now seem to be everywhere, with designers incorporating weapons, naked women and even abandoned babies into their ranges. FEMAIL takes a look at the worst offenders in the luggage department. Madonna's new handbag has caused a stir for its seemingly drug related slogan, after the pop legend shared a picture of her new luggage with her fans on Instagram on Sunday . Madonna's new black crocodile handbag has caused a stir for its seemingly drug-related slogan, the word 'dealer' spelled out in bling diamond lettering. Sharing the snap of her new bag on Instagram on Sunday, the pop legend wrote, 'Dealers Choice! My favorite new handbag by Mawi!', which she followed by dice, gun and love heart emoticons, plus the hash tag #rebelheart. Known for pushing the boundaries, Madonna's latest luggage comes from East London designer Mawi Keivom, who specialises in bejeweled luxury accessories. Though the bag appears to be a Hermes Kelly, the customisation is bound to be seen as inappropriate by many and follows closely on Madonna's other opinion-splitting move - kissing Drake live on stage . Never far from a controversial fashion trend, Rihanna carried not one, but two gun themed bags while out for dinner in Santa Monica last autumn. The singer also has a gun tattoo on her torso. Rihanna is a woman after Madonna's heart and last autumn was spotted carrying not one but two gun-themed bags while out for dinner in Santa Monica. She carried a black leather Saint Laurent clutch with white line drawings of various weapons, while her black leather cross-body bag was in the shape of a gun holster. The singer seems to have a thing for the deadly weapon and even has a revolver tattoo under her right armpit. However, Rihanna doesn't draw the line at just guns and in 2013, she was spotted carrying two clutches embroidered with cannabis leaves. She has also rocked a Vivienne Westwood bag decorated with appliqued neon mock crock leather cut in the shape of a penis. The singer doesn't draw the line at just guns either. In 2013 Rihanna was spotted carrying a black clutch bag decorated with a cannabis leaf . Rihanna saw the humour in the clutch bag gifted to her by British designer Vivienne Westwood in 2013 (left); and the Barbardos singer has never made any effort to hide her love of cannabis (right) Rumer Willis, meanwhile, has previously jumped on the gun-bag bandwagon with a black leather 'Guardian Angel' bag by Vlieger and Vandam. The tote is decorated with a full moulded outline of a handgun, intended to give the impression that the accessory contains the deadly weapon. The brand also has a knife version of the same style of bag, and a slightly less aggressive handcuff design. Daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, Rumer Willis has also landed herself at the centre of the handbag controversy, with this 'Guardian Angel' bag by designer label Vlieger and Vandam. The brand also has a knife version of the same style of bag, and a slightly less aggressive handcuff design . But when it comes to eyebrow-raising accessories, Rihanna and Madonna are mere amateurs compared with artist Grayson Perry, who designed his own brown leather bag in the shape of a scrotal sac on one side, and a bottom on the other. In December 2013 Channel 4's Liberty of London behind-the-scenes documentary focused on the item, which was conceived by the artist and realised by leather craftsman Andy Bates. The one-of-a-kind bag also includes a leather 'appendage' which is completed by a small gold bell supplied by Perry himself. Bates said: 'It took months to construct the bag. 'Firstly I had to carve a wooden former and then soak hand-dyed, bark-tanned calfskin in water so that it became malleable and could be moulded around the oaken testicles, a technique which is centuries old. 'Upholstery nails had been driven in so that the details of the ""pimples"" could be brought out. 'The two halves of the bag were shaped then hand-stitched together using waxed, linen thread. 'Finally, a bell, which had been supplied by Grayson himself, was added to the end of the appendage and given a ceremonial and celebratory jingle of completion.' Grayson Perry's scrotal sack handbag is designed to look exactly like it's real-life inspiration. The fully functioning handbag even has a carefully placed 'flower' on the reverse, to symbolise another key body area . US designer James Piatt has made his name by making controversial accessories, including his Peacemaker design, made with a knuckleduster handle. Priced from $89 to $169, the website reads: 'In an age when it is difficult to avoid terror take charge of the streets and look fashionable with a PeaceKeeper handbag.' Piatt's collection also features the Foundling bag, up to $539, which features a stylised representation of a crying baby kicking arms and legs in the air, was inspired by 'an infant that has been deserted'. A variety of charms are available to buy for the bag, including an airplane, a pack of cigarettes and an open window, in a reference to the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh's baby and Michael Jackson's dangling of his son Prince outside a Berlin window. 'In an age when it is difficult to avoid terror take charge of the streets and look fashionable with a PeaceKeeper™ handbag,' says American designer James Piatt . Piatt's collection also features the Foundling bag, inspired by 'an infant that has been deserted,' and for which you can buy various charms including an airplane, a pack of cigarettes and an open window . Yet on of the most  outrageous mistakes came from high street brand Zara, which sold a canvas hold-all with images of flowers, animals - and a swastika. While in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism the symbol signifies auspiciousness and well-being, this meaning was not apparent to customers who couldn't overlook its strong association with Nazi Germany. Zara was quick to retract the bag, releasing a statement saying that it had been designed by an external supplier, and that nobody had noticed the finer details of its decoration. In 2007 Spanish fashion chain Zara was forced to retract this handbag design which featured swastika details . Chanel's Dubai audience branded this handbag as rude, offensive and gimmicky, claiming that Karl Lagerfeld was wrong to showcase the petrol can shaped bag in his collection inspired by the emirate . Meanwhile, though Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld often courts controversy, he was caught unawares by the negative reactions to his oil can handbag. Designed for his Cruise 2014/15 Chanel show in Dubai, and said to be inspired by the culture of the emirates, many criticised his offering as rude, offensive and gimmicky. While some saw past the cliche stereotyping, others were quick to note how disappointed they were that Lagerfeld had chosen to represent their identity in such a way. But he's not the first person to give a classic bag a controversial twist. In December 2013, Kanye West commissioned an artist to paint a  bizarre scene featuring nude women and mane in monster masks an iconic Hermes Birkin bag. Though deemed an eyesore by many, opinion had softened by time Kim debuted her second defaced Hermes bag, this time handpainted by daughter North West last November. Iconic handbag collectors were appalled to see Kanye West's 2013 Christmas gift to Kim Kardashian - a Hermes Birkin bag 'defaced' with a painting Kanye commissioned from an artist . Kim also owns a second hand painted Hermes handbag which was met with softer opinion, after it was revealed the bag was decorated by Kim's daughter North West . Another bag that has gone down in the controversial hall of shame is a canvas tote bag sold by DoeClothes on Amazon that says 'Mommy drinks because you are bad.' Luggage designers are the only ones getting in on the act - label companies are too. A luggage sticker created by two male designers from Vancouver caused uproar when it was released, displaying a traumatised woman bound and gagged, seemingly in your suitcase. Sold on thecheeky.com, the $7.50 stickers were all meant to look as though the suitcase had been torn open to reveal illicit contents such as stacks of cash, bags of cocaine or sex toys. The Canadian government was unimpressed, however, and the stickers were made unavailable to Canadian consumers.

"A bereaved mother stopped her ex-husband from attending their son's funeral by lying and arranging it in secret, a court heard. Cathleen Hackney allegedly told two different funeral directors that there were no objections, including from her former spouse, to her son being cremated after his death. As a result no-one attended the early morning cremation of Paul Moreland in December 2010 after it  happened without his father's knowledge, jurors heard. Hackney, 56, is said to have deliberately 'pressed ahead' with her plans, despite knowing her ex, Paul Barber, would have objected. Cathleen Hackney, 56, is on trial at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, pictured, in relation to the cremation of her son . Deborah Gould, prosecuting, opened the case against Hackney for jurors on the first day of her trial at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. 'This is an unusual and very sad case which involves the Cremations Act 1902,' she said. 'In a nutshell, the Crown's case is that the defendant told two different funeral directors, at two different times, that there were no objections from anyone, including Mr Barber, to her son being cremated and also signed two forms to the same effect. 'The Crown says that the first time she did this she simply didn't know whether Mr Barber objected to the cremation or not, as she hadn't bothered to ask.' Ms Gould alleged that by the time Hackney signed a second form she knew Mr Barber objected to any funeral which would involve the disposal of their son's body, unless he knew the details of where and when it was to take place. But, the court heard, the defendant  went ahead with the cremation despite Mr Barber's disapproval being made clear to her by his solicitors. Hackney, 56, denies one offence of making a false representation to procure the burning of human remains, and two counts of signing false certificates ahead of her son's funeral. Jurors were told that Mr Moreland was just 32-years-old when he died in hospital on November 11, 2010, from a long-standing health condition. His parents went through an 'acrimonious' divorce in 1983, but subsequent contact relating to their son was described in court as being marred by dispute and conflict. Hackney, who registered her son's death, is alleged to have instructed an undertaker on November 12, that Mr Barber was to have no involvement with any of the funeral arrangements. By November 15, the defendant is said to have been adamant that she did not want Mr Barber to attend the funeral, which was originally set for November 24. At one point amid mediation involving lawyers, Hackney, the Crown claims, met an undertaker and signed a form stating that no near relatives were unaware of the proposed cremation. But an undertaker then became 'troubled' and told Hackney he could not continue with the arrangements, leading her to dispense with his services. It is alleged she then went to another funeral firm and signed the second form on December 15, booking a cremation for her son's remains on December 20. During her opening speech, Miss Gould said of Mr Moreland's cremation: 'He was 'slotted in' early in the morning when people with no relatives are burnt. 'Mr Barber was not present at his son's funeral or cremation despite every effort to do so.' Mr Barber told the court he found out the cremation had taken place in a phone message left for him by a solicitor. Cathleen Hackney is alleged to have told Harry Dawson Funeral Directors in Normacot, pictured, that there were no objections to the cremation . Giving evidence from the witness box, he told jurors he learned of the cremation at 1pm on December 20. Mr Barber was then advised by a lawyer that he could seek a court order to stop his son's ashes being disposed of in his absence. 'He (the solicitor) applied for it but didn't get it through quickly enough,' Mr Barber told the court. Mr Barber contacted police shortly afterwards but Hackney was not interviewed until last December, when she asserted that he knew she intended to cremate her son and had not objected. Funeral director Wayne Packman also gave evidence to the trial. He said he had suggested the possible solution of having two separate services on different days for Hackney and Mr Barber in Stafford and Stoke-on-Trent respectively. But Hackney of Stoke-on-Trent then emailed the Co-operative funeral service's contact centre saying she did not want her ex-husband to attend the cremation or to have a separate service. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Cathleen Hackney accused of lying to undertakers ahead of cremation .

Whilst her dad Terry, 34, was on the phone desperately trying to arrange for a lift to hospital Trinity calmly collected towels and reassured her mum everything would be okay. Within minutes she had helped deliver her baby sister, Jasmin Elizabeth-Rose, who arrived in the family's front room weighing 7lb 1oz. Mrs Culley said: 'My waters had broken and my husband was on the phone to get his mum to take us to hospital. 'But by the time she got here, the baby had already been born. 'When it all started happening, Trinity turned to me and said: ""It's OK mum, I have seen One Born Every Minute. I'll go get the towels."" 'She was just amazing. Words can't express how proud I am of her. I think a lot girls of her age would not have been so calm and known what to do.' The 10-year-old  used the knowledge she gained from watching One Born Every Minute to deliver her baby sister (pictured together) Mrs Culley said she has since given her daughter a ticking off for secretly watching 'One Born Every Minute', the series set on a hospital's labour ward. She added: 'Trinity just turned and said to me: ""But mum, if I hadn't, I wouldn't have known what to do"".' Mrs Culley, who now has four children, described how her husband was on the phone to the 999 operator as she gave birth. She added: 'They asked him: ""How far along is she?"" and I could hear him saying: ""She's got two weeks left"". 'Then he was saying: ""I can see a face, oh and there's a body"". An ambulance arrived between five and ten minutes later, but we had pretty much done everything for them.' She and her newborn baby were checked over, but neither needed treatment. The couple have four children - Trinity, Jade, 2, Samuel, 1, and their new arrival Jasmin Elizabeth Rose, who was born on March 31. Trinity calmly collected towels and reassured her mother that everything would be okay after Mrs Culley's waters broke two weeks ahead of schedule .

"A 17-year-old teen is so allergic to water that even sweating can cause a potentially deadly burning rash. Alexandra Allen,  from Utah suffers with the condition aquagenic urticaria, which is so rare it affects just 35 people in the whole world. Showers have to be quick and cold - long soaks in the bath are out of the question because they trigger burning inflammation. Alexandra Allen, 17, from Utah suffers with the condition aquagenic urticaria.  Showers have to be quick and cold - long soaks in the bath are out of the question because they trigger burning inflammation . The symptoms can last from a few hours to a week after exposure, reports Deseret News. Alexandra first realized she had the condition when she developed hives after spending time in a hot tub while on vacation. A person with Aquagenic Urticaria is essentially allergic to water. After coming into contact with water - or blood, sweat and tears - the sufferer develops painful, itchy hives that spread over the affected area. These can last anywhere between 10 minutes to an hour-and-a-half. Some sufferers have to lie down to let the pain subside. Investigators believe the hives are not caused by a histamine release but are the result of extreme skin sensitivity to additives in water such as chlorine. The condition is extremely rare and is thought to affect around 35 known people in the world. There is no proven treatment, but dermatologists recommend staying out of the water as much as possible. Sufferers should also take short showers, stay cool and avoid rain. Dermatologists say those with the condition can ease the burn of the hives with certain antihistamines. Then she was admitted to hospital with internal bleeding and painful joints, and unable to breathe after a trip to Flaming Gorge which has water activities. It took a while for her diagnosis to be made. When Elizabeth was about 15 she came across a medical site that discussed aquagenic urticaria - when she suggested it to her dermatologist he agreed that it was her condition. She now avoids water as much as she can. 'It's not worth it anymore,' Alexandra said to Deseret News. 'It's both emotionally strenuous and physically painful. I can't let myself go there.' Although sweat is dangerous, she now works against it by exercising only in cooler temperatures to keep her body from producing too much oil, sweat. It also helps as less sweating means she won't have to shower as she is only allowed three a week. 'It feels like your skin has been sandpapered down until there's only one layer left and it itches, but you can't itch it or it will break and burn and bleed,' she said. 'You just feel like you've been dipped in a vat of acid, not for long, but for long enough to tear off a layer of skin.' The condition, which can in some people trigger potentially a deadly anaphylactic shock, usually gets worse as sufferers get older.

"Together they wrote a string of chart-topping hits for some of the world's biggest stars and created the memorable theme tune of Australian television soap Neighbours. Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent, who were married for more than three decades, were dubbed 'Mr and Mrs Music' after composing for artists including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Scott Walker, Shirley Bassey and Petula Clark. So when Trent died last month aged 74 after a long battle with cancer, Hatch was expected to be at her funeral to say a final goodbye. True, their marriage had ended in divorce, but they had a daughter together and one of the most successful creative unions in showbusiness. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Hatch was banned from the funeral by Trent's second husband, Colin Gregory, who today accuses the composer of breaking his wife's heart. Scroll down for video . Tony Hatch (left) and his former wife Jackie Trent (right) wrote a chart-topping hits for the world's biggest stars but he was banned from her funeral last month . He says that not only did she never forgive Hatch for the infidelity that ended their marriage, but she believed to her dying day that he had denied her the credit she was due for some of their compositions. Although they were responsible for about 400 songs together, they had been mired in a long-running feud over seven that Trent claimed she co-wrote. After years of pressure, says Gregory, Hatch agreed to acknowledge Trent's part and her name now appears against some of the songs on the Tony Hatch website. But on other songs, Hatch is the only composer credited. Gregory told The Mail on Sunday: 'Yes, I banned Hatch from attending Jackie's cremation.' The 71-year-old former policeman, who married Trent in 2005, said: 'It might seem petty and churlish of me because, whatever anybody says, Hatch and Trent are welded at the hip for all the wonderful work they did together. 'I would never contest that. Jackie never contested that. But her firm words to me were, ""I hate him for what he did to me and for what he's still doing to me."" 'I couldn't and wouldn't contact Tony Hatch myself. It would be inappropriate because we're in litigation.' Instead, he passed the message to Trent's son from her first marriage, Darren, who Hatch had adopted when they married. Gregory said: 'Darren rang, giving it the smooth patter of, ""Oh, they had such a lovely warm life together"", which they did not. And when he said he wanted to invite Hatch to the cremation, I said quite firmly, ""No. If he turns up, I shall call the police."" 'Suffice it to say that Jackie would not want Tony Hatch anywhere near her final moments on this earth. He and his wife were specifically banned from attending her funeral, or anything in connection with it. 'Jackie always told me, ""No service – just you.""' The cremation was held on the Spanish island of Menorca, where Trent lived with Gregory. It is also home to Hatch and his wife. Hatch, 75, clearly got the message, writing on his Facebook page on the day of the funeral: 'Today was final departure day for her soul but I was BANNED by her husband Colin Gregory from attending the crematorium.' Gregory now plans to bring Trent's ashes home to Britain for a memorial service in May at her local parish church in Chesterton, Staffordshire. Much of Trent's wealth, he said, had recently been eroded – not least by the legal battle with her former husband over the songs, which Gregory claimed has cost about £20,000. It's a far cry from 1965 when Hatch and Trent met and fell in love. Hatch was already married and the couple embarked on an affair before marrying the next year and going on to become one of the most successful teams in music, earning millions of pounds. But if Hatch, the son of a pianist, who grew up in Pinner, North West London, and Trent, the daughter of a miner from Newcastle-under-Lyme, made a fortune, they seemed to have trouble holding on to it. The couple moved to Ireland at one point because of its tax benefits for artists. Hatch wrote the theme tune to Crossroads and is still remembered by many as the 'Mr Nasty' judge on 1970s TV talent show New Faces. In 1982, the pair moved to Australia and were later asked to write the theme song for Neighbours. Their marriage ended abruptly and abrasively back in Britain at Trent's 55th birthday party in 1995, when Hatch confessed that for years he had been in love with one of his wife's friends. Trent was devastated. Gregory plans to persevere with Trent's legal battle over the disputed songs: 'not for financial gain – Jackie was getting her share [of songwriting royalties] – but because it was her dying wish that he finally admitted she co-wrote those songs.' Hatch declined to comment.","Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent wrote chart-topping hits for musical superstars .

"Most people would sensibly keep their distance from a pool full of alligators - but this astonishing footage shows one adrenaline junkie precariously navigating a slackline over more than 50 of the hungry reptiles. Jason McDonald, 34, from Aurora, Colorado, walked the thin rope line over a pool containing more the alligators - some which measure up to ten feet in length - at the Colorado Gator Farm. Crematory manager Mr McDonald, who volunteers at the farm, has been involved with alligators for over ten years and has taken handling classes, said he thought this would be an interesting new way of interacting with the fearsome creatures. Scroll down for video . Jason McDonald walked the thin slackline rope over a pool containing more than 50 hungry alligators . 'I got the idea after watching my friend Josh Beaudoin, who likes to walk slacklines several hundred feet up in the air,' he said. 'I knew I wasn't at that level yet but that I could put my own spin on it and walk over gators. 'The gators are surprisingly ok with the slackline. 'The first time we set it up they approached but didn't get very close. This time it didn't seem to bother them at all.' Mr McDonald said that while his parents have reservations about his daring antics, he has plans to take his hobby further. Mr McDonald mounts the slackrope above the alligators pond where more than 50 of the reptiles live . Two of the pond's inhabitants appeared to be particularly intrigued by the development overhead . Mr McDonald took this shot which shows the disconcertingly narrow slackrope - and watching alligator . Mr McDonald said he thought this would be an interesting new way of interacting with the fearsome creatures . 'My mother wants me to be careful and remember I'm a father but she also knows I'm good at working with the gators - and although it can be dangerous I do it as safely as possible,' he said. 'Going forward we want to walk over Elvis or Morris, our two biggest gators on the farm. 'I also think it would be cool to walk over the top of our albino gators since that would be hard to recreate since we have four, and not many people even have one albino.' Mr McDonald, who has been volunteering at the farm for 10 years, had never been bitten before last month - when an 8ft alligator clamped down on his hand for more than 10 minutes. Mr McDonald, who treats and cares for the rescued animals,  performs tricks for visitors to the farm in his spare time. He became involved with Colorado Gators when he signed up for a wrestling class.

"A monkey that was thought to have died out more than 50 years ago has been discovered alive in the remote rain forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Primatologists working in Ntokou-Pikounda National Park have captured the first ever picture of the Bouvier's red colobus monkey. Their discovery proves that the primate - which was first discovered in 1887 and is only known from three specimens - is not extinct. Scroll down for video . This is the first ever photograph of the Bouvier's red colobus monkey, which was thought to have been extinct . The image captured by researchers Lieven Devreese and Gaël Elie Gnondo Gobolo appears to show a mother with her young. Researchers now hope to study the monkey in an attempt to learn more about it. A new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis. The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. Mr Devreese said: 'Our photos are the world's first and confirm that the species is not extinct. 'No one knows anything about them. They live in an area where scientists rarely go, along the banks of a river a in a very inaccessible area.' Mr Devreese spent three months, after setting off in February, searching the jungles of Congo in an attempt to find the Bouvier red colobus monkeys, or Piliocolobus bouvieri. Together with his Congelese colleagues, he visited remote villages to ask locals if they had seen them and traced the locations of unconfirmed reports of sightings. A group of the monkeys were discovered living in the forests that sit along the Bokiba River in the Ntokou-Pikounda National Park. However, they found that the creatures appear to be extremely vulnerable to hunters involved in the commercial bushmeat trade in the area. Red colobus monkeys are among the largest primates in the forests of Congo and are prized by hunters. The animals are also poor at recognising threats, often believing they are safe in the trees. Rather than fleeing, red colobus monkeys tend to look down at humans from the trees. The last unconfirmed sighting of a Bouvier's red colobus monkey was in the 1970s and they are mentioned in a book from 1949 as living in swamp forests aong the Likouala and Sangha rivers. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. A video is shown above . The Bouvier's red colobus monkey lives in stretches of jungle alongside rivers in the Congo (pictured above) The only previous examples of them had been collected more than 100 years ago. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. Dr Fiona Maisels, from the Wildlife Conservation Society, said: 'We’re very pleased indeed that Lieven and Gaël were able to achieve their objective of not only confirming that Bouvier’s red colobus still exists, but also managing to get a very clear close-up picture of a mother and infant. 'Thankfully, many of these colobus monkeys live in the recently gazetted national park and are protected from threats such as logging, agriculture, and roads, all of which can lead to increased hunting.' James Deutsch, vice president for conservation strategy at the WCS, added: 'Confirmation that Bouvier’s red colobus still thrives in the this area reminds us that there remain substantially intact wild places on Earth, and should re-energize all of us to save them before it is too late.'","Bouvier's red colobus monkeys was last sighted in the Congo during 1970s .

However, should you care to stay in, The Bar's signature cocktail, Secrets of the Unicorn, is a mulled wine-based beverage served in a smoked wood glass and peppered with chai spices. It's also home to an afternoon tea service with options harvested specially from a Chinese garden.

"An African-American woman fired from a Maryland Hooters in 2013 sued the 'breastaurant' - and is now set to receive thousands of dollars from an arbitration ruling. Plaintiff Farryn Johnson has said the Baltimore restaurant where she worked had an issue with her blonde highlights. Johnson claimed in an interview with WBAL, 'I decided to put highlights in my hair, blonde in particular. And when I came in to work, management was not happy about the highlights being added to my hair.' Scroll down for video . Waitress: Farryn Johnson was fired from a Maryland Hooters in 2013 sued the breastaurant - and is now set to receive thousands of dollars from an arbitration ruling . Workplace issues: Johnson has claimed a supervisor at the Hooters where she worked (pictured) had an issue with her getting blonde highlights . Johnson continued 'And the manager at the time literally said ""You can't have blonde, cause black people don't have blonde hair.""' Johnson told the television station she was given reduced shifts, written warnings, and later terminated. An arbitrator determined Johnson was let go illegally and as a result of racial discrimination, WBAL reported. He also reportedly said Hooters violated state civil rights laws, as well as federal ones. According to WBAL, Johnson has been awarded $250,000 for  both her legal fees and lost wages. Ruling: An arbitrator recently ruled in Johnson's favor. She is seen here in 2013 . Johnson's attorney Andrew Levy told the television station 'I hope that Hooters sees this as an opportunity to make improvements in the way they train their managers and they way they deal with their employees.' In a statement, Hooters said '[Johnson] claimed that Hooters actions were discriminatory and that the company does not allow African-American women to wear colors in their hair that are not natural for their ethnicity. Nothing could be further from the truth.' 'Ms. Johnson's claims of discrimination are simply without merit,' the company said. The arbitrator's decision in the case was 'adverse and flawed,' Hooters said. 'Contrary to exaggerated reports, Ms. Johnson did not receive $250,000 in back pay, but rather only $11,886.40, while her attorneys on the other hand received approximately $244,000 in attorneys’ fees,' the restaurant chain's statement said.","Farryn Johnson was fired from a Hooters in 2013 .

"Thousands of chickens and other poultry have been culled following the outbreak of a highly contagious strain of bird flu in India. Officials ordered 250,000 birds to be slaughtered in Telangana after cases of the H5N1 virus were identified, which can be deadly in humans.

Veterinary staff from the local government's animal husbandry department carried out the cull - which included destroying hundreds of thousands of infected eggs - at Thorrur village in the Ranga Reddy district. Birds present in poultry farms were slaughtered while the eggs, including those stored in warehouses, were dumped in a pit. Destroyed: Thousands of infected eggs were dumped in a pit and buried following an outbreak of bird flu . Clean up: Authorities ordered the destruction of birds and eggs at farms across Telangana in India following the latest bird flu outbreak . Bird feed stock was burned and the sites were all thoroughly disinfected in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. India has culled 6.4 million birds due to bird flu since 2006. Experts point out that cross-infection to humans is still relatively rare and usually occurs where people have been in close contact with infected birds. But fears remain the aviation flu could combine with a human strain to produce a mutation that is more dangerous and difficult to control. In February, three people were tested for bird flu and 10,000 chickens slaughtered in Britain's first outbreak of the H7N7 strain in seven years. There have been several outbreaks of the H7N7 flu in China and 18 months ago it was found in Italy. During the Italian outbreak in August 2013, three poultry workers became infected with the virus, developing conjunctivitis. More than 1 million chickens and other poultry were culled during the Italian crisis.","Follows outbreak of H5N1 virus which can be deadly in humans .

"Human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time, according to scientists. Researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in China that has introduced DNA changes to reproductive cells. Although the scientific paper is yet to be published, the scientific world is abuzz with rumours that the work has been carried out. Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren. Human embryos, like the one above, may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques . They say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications. They have described it as 'dangerous and ethically unacceptable'. However, others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers. A gene editing technique known as CRISPR can search through DNA and replace specific genes or remove them. Under proposals put forward by Dr Luhan Yang, human ovarian tissue from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer could be used to obtain immature egg cells. These could then be encouraged to grow in the laboratory before using CRISPR to remove the genetic fault causing the cancer. The defective BRAC1 gene, for example, results in inherited breast and ovarian cancer. By repairing this gene, the resulting egg could be made healthy. Researchers at the moment say this should only be used for scientific research but it opens up the possibility of using edited eggs to create human embryos that have had heritable diseases removed. According to a report by the National Post, Professor George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, says a paper outlining the technology is due to be published. He said: 'There is a paper from China. I don't think it's been accepted yet, but I think it will be at some point.' His comments match those made by several leading scientists working with non-reproductive stem cells who have raised concerns over the new technology. Until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin, muscle, nerves, bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases. Modifying the DNA of human embryos so that DNA changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations. Such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the UK, but is permitted in the US and China. A number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos. Germ line genetic editing alters the DNA in sperm and egg cells - meaning the changes can be passed on . Xingxu Huang, from Shanghai Tech University in China has been seeking permission to perform the technique on discarded human embryos after having successfully using it to modify monkey embryos that developed into live animals. Improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near '100 per cent efficiency' in trials using mice, a leading scientist has warned. Dr Tony Perry, a geneticist at the University of Bath, said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children. The warning follows a breakthrough last April in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living, adult mice using the Crispr-Cas9 gene editing technique. The Crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies. 'We used a pair of molecular scissors and a molecular sat nav that tells the scissors where to cut,' Dr Perry told James Gallagher at the BBC. 'It's a case of 'you shoot you score'...On the human side, one has to be very cautious.' Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the Crispr system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. Professor Church's own group is also said to be developing techniques that could be used to modify human embryos. Dr Luhan Yang, a scientist with Church's group, recently outlined proposals to edit the human germline in an interview with Technology Review. She proposed using immature egg cells from the ovaries taken from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. The immature egg would be grown and coaxed into dividing before a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR would be used to correct the genetic fault that was causing the ovarian cancer. However, the project is not thought to be underway yet and it is not known if it has been approved. Dr Yang, however, has been reported to have been involved in a similar project in China. Last month a leading group of biologists called for a worldwide moratorium on germ line research amid rumours that it had already been used to alter human embryos in China. Edward Lanphier, chairman of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine in Washington DC, and four colleagues, wrote in the journal Nature that such research could harm other areas of science by provoking a public outcry. They wrote: 'It is thought that studies involving the use of genome-editing tools to modify the DNA of human embryos will be published shortly . 'In our view, genome editing in human embryos using current technologies could have unpredictable effects on future generations. Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren . 'This makes it dangerous and ethically unacceptable. 'Such research could be exploited for non-therapeutic modifications. 'We are concerned that a public outcry about such an ethical breach could hinder a promising area of therapeutic development, namely making genetic changes that cannot be inherited. 'At this early stage, scientists should agree not to modify the DNA of human reproductive cells.' Their fears tap into concerns that such technology could be used to create 'designer families' where certain traits are selected for. In reality such selection can be difficult as often there is no single gene that provides a single trait and many genes have multiple functions.","Scientists in China are believed to have altered the DNA of human embryos so that changes can be passed on to future generations in the germ line .

"Commuters are now able to make phone calls and send texts on the Tube following the launch of new technology enabling phone calls via an internet connection. In what is the first roll out of the technology throughout Europe, the Wi-Fi Calling feature is designed to facilitate calls and texts when users have no mobile phone signal. The technology paves the way for London's commuters to chat and text inside the capital's 150 Tube stations where Wi-Fi connections are currently available. London's Underground platforms could soon be drowned in the sound of commuters chatting on their phones . iPhone users on EE will find their calls and texts automatically connect through the internet when they have no service signal. An EE spokesman said: 'Starting today, iPhone customers on EE can make and receive high quality calls over WiFi and send text messages, using their own phone number with no need to use an app - great for when a mobile signal is unavailable.' While it is already possible to make phone calls or send messages via Wi-Fi with apps such as WhatsApp and Viber, the new technology works automatically in the user's phone. After having downloaded the update, EE users on iPhone will see a Wi-Fi Calling section appear in the settings app of their phone, which must be switched to allow to enable the feature. The telecoms firm also confirmed that the new Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge will also have the feature on the EE network when it goes on sale this Friday. Rival networks, including O2 and Three, offer apps in order to make calls over Wi-Fi - similar to the Skype service - while Vodafone has said it will be launching a Wi-Fi calling service 'in the summer'. The telecoms firm is currently in the process of being taken over by BT in a deal worth £12.5billion that could see further combinations of technology in order to boost mobile phone reception in the future.","Commuters are now able to make phone calls and send texts via internet .

"A man has narrowly avoided jail time for impersonating a police officer to 'deviously' track down his wife and child at a women’s refuge. On Friday, Ruben Costa, 35, pleaded guilty to impersonating a member of the police force, but was only handed a two-month suspended sentence, according to the NT News. The incident occurred when the Northern Territory man returned home from work to find his wife had left him, taking their son and possessions. Ruben Costa, 35, pleaded guilty to impersonating a member of the police force, but was only handed a two-month suspended sentence . The father pretended to be a police officer investigating a crime over the phone, claiming he needed the assistance of taxi drivers in the area . Costa was unable to contact his wife but, assuming she had left in a taxi, lied about his identity in a conversation with the taxi company to hunt down his spouse. The father pretended to be a police officer investigating a crime over the phone, claiming he needed the assistance of taxi drivers in the area. Prosecutor Marilyn Lester told the Darwin Magistrates Court that Costa told the taxi operator that he was searching for a woman who had abducted a young boy. The taxi company put a call out to all staff and subsequently located Costa’s wife and son at women’s shelter. The incident occurred when the Northern Territory man returned home from work to find his wife had left him, taking their son and possessions (stock pic) When Costa received this information he confronted his wife at the shelter, resulting in an argument. According to Costa’s defence lawyer Peter Orr, Costa has been denied access to his son since the altercation. Orr insisted that Costa’s actions were due to serious worry and concern. Magistrate Cavanagh told the Darwin Magistrates Court that Costa’s actions were ‘devious and dishonest’, according to the NT News. However, he was spared a prison sentence due to his ‘remorse, work ethic and high standing in the community.

"With her contoured skin, glossy hair and high fashion wardrobe, Kim is undeniably the breakout star of the Kardashians. But while Kim has been busy hogging the headlines, her younger sister Khloe has been quietly revamping her look. Khloe, 30, has been showcasing blonder locks, a flawless face and honed physique in recent weeks - and she's looking better than ever, so what's her secret? Scroll down for video . Khloe Kardashian is looking better than ever - and it's all thanks to an intense gym regime, hair colour overhaul and very particular beauty regime . For starters, Khloe has famously shed an impressive amount of weight and is no stranger to flaunting her new curves in glamorous ensembles. She recently revealed she's lost 13 pounds in three months thanks to her grueling exercise regime. Khloe has been showing off her workouts - and her impressive strength - in a series of recent Instagram posts. The 30-year-old reality star displayed her pert posterior while weight lifting close to 100 pounds in the snap she captioned: 'Squat! Squat!! Squat!!!' Khloe, pictured, left, in 2007, and, right, this week, is now showcasing a flawless face and luscious blonde locks, even giving sister Kim a run for her money in the glamour stakes . Khloe showcased her squat skills by holding up a barbell, which had 25 pound bright yellow weights on each side of the 45 pound bar. Khloe shared with E! News the secret to her toned down figure when she attended a Kardashian Beauty Hair Care promo appearance in West Hills, California. The ex-wife of Lamar Odom donned a body hugging black jumpsuit for the event showing off her weight loss results. 'I try to work out like five days a week, its a lot but I feel great when I do it ,' she admitted to E! correspondent Maria Menounos. 'We're focusing on different body parts we're making me more lean rather than big and bulky,' she said. 'Gunnar [her trainer] switches up your workout every single day its something different but all the circuit training is cardio circuit training everything you're doing, you're still running up your heart rate so you're burning triple the amount of calories than you would if you were just weight lifting.' As well as shedding an impressive amount of weight, Khloe, pictured, left, in 2008, and, right, this week, has overhauled her wardrobe and now embraces figure hugging jeans and cleavage-baring blouses .

Adding: 'And on the weekend I have a gym in my community I try to do just cardio. You just turn on some junk TV and you don't realize what you're doing, and I love that.' While Khloe revs up her exercise routines, she is also taking her diet seriously. 'I used to not watch what I ate. I would just kind of eat whatever. I was realizing, ""I work out all the time. Why can't I drop this weight?"" It's really food,' she explained. 'So I started dieting a little. I don't eat dairy anymore—or I try not to, because I'm addicted to cheese! 'I lost like 13 lbs. since January from just cutting out diary,' she proudly shared. Last month, Khloe posted a picture of her when she shot to fame and contrasted it to a recent one. She wrote: 'Looking back at pictures of myself I didn't realize at the time how unhealthy my lifestyle actually was. 'People love to call me the fat one but as weird as it sounds I still don't think I would consider myself fat back then. Definitely overweight and unhealthy, yes. About two years ago I decided to turn to fitness as a form of therapy and as a stress reliever. 'I started slow and eventually I started working out 4 to 5 days a week. We all have to start somewhere and doing something is better than nothing at all. Working out is a huge part of my life now. I genuinely enjoy sweating out my frustrations and living a healthier life. My workouts are not all about vanity. They are about clarity for my mind and soul.' Khlpo has also had a copy-Kim makeover and looks more flawless and contoured than ever before thanks to the family's make-up artist, Rob Scheppy . Khloe, pictured with her famous sisters, Kourtney, left, and Kim, right, has aired her views on plastic surgery. In 2013, she told Cosmopolitan magazine that she had never had cosmetic surgery but did not rule it out for the future . To complement her exercise regime, Khloe  has revealed her top beauty tip for tight, glowing skin: a pregnancy cream for your décolletage. The 30-year-old reality star admitted to Into The Gloss that she uses Mama Mio's Pregnancy Boob Tube cream every day because it's all natural and helps to keep skin firm. 'It's got avocado oil and shea butter so when your boobs are growing you don’t get stretch marks,' she said. 'I like it though, because it tightens your neck, too.' Khloe, the younger sister of Kim and Kourtney, said she has been using it everyday for a year. Created by pregnancy skincare experts Mama Mio, the cream aims to soothe and strengthen the décolletage and bust. Labeled a 'secret weapon for moms-to-be,' it is formulated with green cabbage leaf and blueberry extracts to ease swelling and tenderness, plus omega-rich shea butter that hydrates, heals and firms. Khloe also confessed to using Mama Mio's Shrink to Fit Cellulite Smoother after her sister Kourtney introduced her to the brand when she was breast-feeding. 'Their names are really cute,' she explained. She has also had a copy-Kim makeover and looks more flawless and contoured than ever before thanks to the family's make-up artist, Rob Scheppy. Khloe, left, in Vegas in 2008 and, right, at a haircare launch last week, recently admitted to Into The Gloss that she uses Mama Mio's Pregnancy Boob Tube cream every day because it's all natural and helps to keep skin firm . When it comes to doing her own make-up, she says she is 'pretty good at it,' and has an extensive list of products she uses to achieve that famous flawless finish. She uses  Chanel Vitalumière Aqua foundation in 60 Beige to prep her skin, the Urban Decay Naked Illuminated Powder, Charlotte Tilbury Colour Chameleon in Bronzed Garnet on her lips and says she 'always' has an Anastasia Beverly Hills Perfect Brow Pencil with her. To keep her spots and wrinkles at bay, she washes her face with two products: Kiehl's Blue Herbal Gel Cleanser and an all-natural one from her dermatologist, Dr. Christie Kidd. Like the rest of the family, Khloe has aired her views on plastic surgery. In 2013, she told Cosmopolitan magazine that she had never had cosmetic surgery but did not rule it out for the future. 'I’m proud for losing weight when I wanted to and I’ve never resorted to surgery,' she said. 'I’m not against it - one day I probably will but it would be on my terms. I won’t be bullied into it by social media or anyone else.' Khloe's Armenia holiday wardrobe is proof of how much her style has evolved. Khloe, seen with Kim, has been dressing to impress, showing off her gym-honed figure in an array tight green dresses, some with thigh-high splits . Khloe also recounted a shocking tale to Cosmopolitan magazine where she was once overheard her mother Kris Jenner suggest she change her appearance. 'Words are the most powerful weapon; they can leave scars forever,' she said. 'She didn’t mean harm, but when I was around nine I overheard my mom telling her friend I needed a nose job. I was shocked; I hadn’t even thought about it. 'I’ve grown into my face but I’ve had makeup artists tell me, ""You should get a nose job."" I’m so happy that I never have.' The youngest sister has also been taking some style tips from Kim. Khloe has ditched her once-favoured maxi dresses for figure-hugging jeans, bottom-enhancing pencil skirts and cleavage-baring blouses. Her Armenia holiday wardrobe is case in point. Khloe has been dressing to impress, showing off her gym-honed figure in an array tight green dresses, some with thigh-high splits.

"A Florida police department is in mourning after an officer was accidentally shot by a coworker during firearms training. Officer Jared Forsyth, 33, had been a member of the Ocala Police Department since 2012. Few details have been released, with police saying it is still under investigation, however the incident occurred about 3.30pm at a gun range at the Lowell Correctional Institution. 'He was wearing his bulletproof vest, but the round entered in his arm and went through his chest,' Ocala Police Chief Greg Graham told News 13.

"Boston bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev has been thrown another lifeline by two of his victims. Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes, who lost limbs in the   2013 marathon, today opposed the death penalty as a means of punishment for their attacker, urging others to 'overcome the impulse for vengeance.' The couple's statement of compassion follows a similar appeal made by the family of an eight-year-old boy, Martin Richard, who was killed in the blast. His seven-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. This week, after finding Tsaernaev guilty on all 30 counts related to the April 15, 2013, attack, a jury will decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or life in prison without parole. 'We must overcome the impulse for vengeance': Married couple Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes have joined the appeals calling for Dzhokar Tsarnaev to be sentenced to life in prison rather than death . Emotional: The couple who lost a leg each in the blast said their position is highly emotional and practical . Moving on: Here they are pictured completing the Boston Marathon in wheelchairs on the one-year anniversary . In a statement to The Boston Globe, Kensky and Downes said: 'If there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment, it is the defendant. However, we must overcome the impulse for vengeance.' They call their position 'intensely emotional and profoundly practical.' The victims aren't the first to speak out against the death penalty in Tsarnaev's high-profile trial. The Boston Globe editorial board issued similar sentiments and last week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Tsarnaev should 'die in prison'. Like the Richards, Kensky and Downes call for life in prison without parole or appeals to ensure Tsarnaev 'disappears from our collective consciousness as soon as possible.' The Richards made their appeal in a moving op-ed for the Boston Globe, published last Tuesday, just a day after the two-year anniversary of their son Martin's death. While the Richards say they are thankful to the government prosecutors for their 'tireless and committed' work to bring justice, they are now asking them to drop the fight for execution and sign a plea deal to send the 21-year-old to jail for the rest of his life. No to execution: The family of bombing victim Martin Richard wrote an op-ed in the Boston Globe, saying they oppose the death penalty for terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The family is pictured on the two-year anniversary of the attack. Clockwise from top left: Denise Richard, Bill Richard, Henry Richard and Jane Richard . Moments before: Martin Richard is seen circled in blue on the day of the Marathon. Behind him walks Tsarnaev, carrying a backpack believed to have held one of the two bombs . Brothers: Tsarnaev's (right) defense attorneys have tried to paint him as secondary in a plot orchestrated by his extreme older brother Tamerlan (left).  Tamerlan died a few days after the bombing in a shootout with police . 'We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives,' the Richards wrote. 'We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.' They say sentencing Tsarnaev to death will only bring continued pain for themselves and the other hundreds of bombing victims. Victim: Martin Richard died at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 . 'As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours. 'The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family,' they wrote. The Richards brought their three kids out to watch the Marathon two years ago, and were standing just steps away from where Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan (who died in a shootout with police a few days later) dropped off two pressure cooker bombs. Little Martin died in the blasts and his sister Jane lost a leg. During the course of Tsarnaev's trial, photos were shown in court of the moments before he dropped off a bomb in a backpack, strolling just behind the Richard family lined up against a gate at the finish line. On the day the op-ed was published, the Richard family revisited the finish line to take part in a memorial. The family were pictured hugging and crying at the emotional ceremony. The death penalty is outlawed in Massachusetts, where the trial is taking place, but since Tsarnaev is being judged in federal court, execution is still a sentencing option. However, experts say that the jurors may sway towards life in prison, considering the state's generally liberally view on the controversial issue. Tsarnaev's lead defense attorney is Judy Clarke, a woman who specializes in helping high-profile clients like the Unabomber escape the death penalty. Clarke and the rest of Tsarnaev's legal team have been trying to paint their client as a gullible young man who was a secondary player in her older brother's terrorist plot.

"In the summer of 2014 she started noticing some symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath, but didn't know what was plaguing her. So Avril Lavigne started visiting specialists, but no one could help her out. 'I was up against a lot of doctors that told me I was crazy and that my problems didn't exist,' the 30-year-old singer told ABC News on Thursday. Turns out the Complicated hit maker was suffering from Lyme disease, which Yolanda Foster of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills and Eighties pop icon Debbie Gibson also have. Struggling: Avril Lavigne told ABC News on Thursday that she had a hard time getting diagnosed for Lyme disease. She is pictured here at her 30th birthday party in Las Vegas when she was fully suffering the effects . The blonde first shared the news with People Magazine in early April that she had been out of the public eye - and was bedridden for five months -  because she was trying to recover from the disease. Lyme disease is the debilitating bacterial infection that comes from a tick bite. 'I had no idea a bug bite could do this,' she told the weekly. 'I was bedridden for five months. I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk and I couldn't move. I thought I was dying. I had complete weakness and fatigue. One night I tried to brush my teeth on the tour bus and couldn't even stand.' On the phone: 'I was up against a lot of doctors that told me I was crazy and that my problems didn't exist,' the 30-year-old singer told ABC News . Not an easy year: 'I went from doctor to doctor for about eight months, which was unacceptable and frustrating. I found somebody had the knowledge and the expertise of treating it,' the Hello Kitty singer explained. 'I actually knew I had it the whole time, probably since the summer' On Thursday she also told ABC News how much of a struggle it was to get help. 'I went from doctor to doctor for about eight months, which was unacceptable and frustrating. I found somebody had the knowledge and the expertise of treating it,' the Hello Kitty singer explained. 'I actually knew I had it the whole time, probably since the summer.' She is talking about her challenges with getting diagnosed now because she wants to help others who are in the same situation. 'I want to bring awareness to hopefully help other people,' Lavigne added. And the Canadian said she feels she will be OK in the long run. 'I believe I will come out of this healthier and stronger than I was before,' the beauty said. The disease has given her 'perspective,' she added. 'I've never had this much down time, so it's been good in that sense. And I'mm really just choosing to look at the positives.' Avril was on the morning show to plug her new song. 'Today I am releasing a song, a single for The Special Olympics called Fly. I wrote Fly for my foundsation a couple years ago. Now I have partnered up with Special Olympics. All net proceeds got to the Special Olympics. It's about inner strength and courage.' And the message is important to the star. She explained it's about 'overcome challenges.' Sick: The singer, seen her performing at Planet Hollywood in May, told People Magazine she had no idea where she got the tick bite that infected her . 'This song took on a whole new meaning for me during the time that I have been sick, which is pretty magical,' she added. Lavigne went into detail with People, admitting, 'There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand. It felt like having all your life sucked out of you.' Symptoms of the disease range from headaches and joint pain to severe fatigue, heart palpitations, paralysis of the face and even dementia. If not caught and treated early enough with antibiotics the condition can persist for years. The disease was recently highlighted after Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster contracted it, who reveled she has lost the ability to read, write or even watch TV because of it. Awol: The Sk8er Boi singer said hubby, Nickleback frontman Chad Kroeger, helped take care of her while she was bedridden for five months . Incubation period from infection to onset of symptoms is typically two weeks, although it can be months or even years between the two, so it is impossible to say when the bites occur. Avril was between the Asian and South American world tour when she first developed symptoms . The musician thinks she may have been bitten last spring, and remembers first waking up one night in April drenched in sweat and feeling feverish. She assumed it was the flu, or even exhaustion and dehydration from touring, but when her symptoms persisted, some friends who were familiar with the disease suggested she might have it. However she said doctors were skeptical and didn't want to test her. After her last public appearance in September she tried to celebrate her 30th birthday in Las Vegas with friends, but she could not muster the energy.

"Discount store Aldi’s astonishing success story continued yesterday as it overtook upmarket rival Waitrose to become the sixth biggest supermarket in Britain. The German discounter has won an increasing share of the market since the recession as cash-strapped families look for cheaper alternatives. It now lags behind only the ‘big four’ – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons – and the Co-operative. Growth: Discount chain Aldi now has a bigger market share than upmarket supermarket Waitrose . Major supermarkets have slashed prices in recent months to fend off competition from cut-price rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. Despite this Aldi has lifted its market share from 4.6 per cent to 5.3 per cent in the past three months. Waitrose has 5.1 per cent of the market, up from 5 per cent, according to consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel. Lidl claimed recently that Britain’s middle classes had become the ‘Lidl Classes’ after sales rose by a fifth in a year. But while Lidl remains eighth behind Waitrose, Aldi is now one of Britain’s mainstream supermarkets. Between January and the end of March, Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from the same time a year earlier. This compares to 3 per cent growth for Waitrose, lifting its share of the market. The total market share of the ‘big four’ fell below 73 per cent, the lowest for a decade. Aldi – motto Spend a little. Live a lot – stocks virtually all own-branded goods and offers a far smaller selection of goods. By contrast middle-class rival Waitrose, part of the John Lewis Partnership, focuses on customer service and high-quality produce. Increase: Consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from January and the end of March compared to the same time a year earlier, compared to 3 per cent growth for Waitrose . Aldi has 560 stores and hopes to double in size by 2022. Yesterday, it announced it was opening nine more stores in London, creating up to 600 jobs. Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi had recorded double-digit growth for the past four years. More than half a million new shoppers visited the store in the three months to March 29, compared to a year before. Lidl saw sales jump by almost 12 per cent over the period to secure a 3.7 per cent market share. This is some way off Tesco’s dominant 28.4 per cent share, followed by Asda at 17.1 per cent. But Fraser McKevitt, at Kantar Worldpanel, said the success of Aldi and Lidl meant the entire structure of the ‘supermarket landscape’ was changing. The price war between upmarket retailers and discounters has led to significantly cheaper food. The Office for National Statistics says food prices fell by more than 3 per cent in February compared to a year earlier. Aldi began as a small food store opened by miner’s wife Anna Albrecht in the German town of Essen in 1914 to support the family when her husband became ill.","German discount supermarket Aldi now has a 5.3 per cent market share .

"Stretch marks are something that most women of all shapes, sizes and ages have. But this week model and chef Chrissy Teigen bought them to the fore after she posted a picture of her  legs to Instagram. The 29-year-old Sports Illustrated star is seen cross-legged after an all-day cooking session and says: 'Bruises from bumping kitchen drawer handles for a week. Stretchies say hi!' Women have been taken to Instagram to share pictures of their stretch marks after the body Chrissy Teigen posted an image of hers to the social networking site .

Some have shared pictures of their stomachs whilst others have showed their legs and bums. Chrissy's image has given a major boost to the campaign, which started last year. This woman showed off the stretch marks on her leg (left) saying she was proud of them and her body, whilst another shared a snap of the marks on her stomach (right) This lady said she shared her picture because she had hated her stretch marks for a long time . Stretch marks are thin lines that appear on the surface of the skin - they are usually purple in colour at first before they fade to a silver shade. They mostly effect the stomach, bottom or leg areas and can occur at any point in a woman's life - often they can be spurred on by weight gain or pregnancy. Often, once you have stretch marks, they can be hard to get rid of. One user who shared her picture said: 'I struggle with my body. It isn't what it used to be, but I'm learning that it's OK.' This lady commented that her pregnant belly looks like an orange as she proudly showed off her body . This Instagram user revealed that her stretch marks had come after having three children (left) while another said that she had learned to love the marks on her body (right) Stretch marks can start off as red or blue but they eventually turn silvery in colour . Another said: 'I have had these since I was 12 years old. I love my lines. Proud to share my stretch marks.' The love your lines campaign was originally started by two east-coast mothers - who chose to remain anonymous. They said of the project: 'This account is curated by two mommas hoping to make a difference in the world of the female body image. 'All women of different shapes, sizes and cultural backgrounds are encouraged to submit. We can't wait to see your love lines.'

"Health bosses are considering raising the legal age for buying alcohol to 21 to tackle binge drinking. The proposal has been put forward by experts at NHS Health Scotland, the Scottish Government’s health promotions agency, which says more action is needed to tackle the ‘continuing problem’ of ‘hazardous alcohol consumption in young people’. The move would apply in pubs, clubs, supermarkets and off-licences in Scotland. New measure: Health bosses are considering raising the legal age for buying alcohol to 21 to tackle binge drinking . If introduced it would mean the legal minimum age for buying alcohol would be higher in Scotland than it is in the rest of Britain, where it is 18. Last night Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said he would welcome the minimum age being set at 21. He said: ‘If it was 21 now, I would not be calling for it to be lowered.’ But he added: ‘Given the fact that we are where we are, I think that politically it is quite difficult, when the age is 18 for so many other adult rites in our society.’ The proposal to raise the legal age is outlined in a report titled ‘Best Preventative Investments for Scotland – What the Evidence and Experts Say’, which examines mea-sures to improve public health. It says the idea to ‘increase the minimum legal drinking age to 21 would be highly cost-effective, as it would both improve people’s health without having to spend much money, and reduce demand on the NHS’. Report author Neil Craig said: ‘In Scotland, hazardous alcohol consumption in young people is a continuing problem. ‘For both males and females, the largest increase in hospitalisation rates for alcohol-related conditions since the early 1980s has been in the 15-24 year olds, and this was particularly marked for females.’ In fact, doctors across the whole of Britain are worried about the increase in such hospitalisations. Between 2002 and 2010, the number of admissions to English hospitals among 15 to 24 year olds due to alcohol rose by 66 per cent to 55,655 – or more than 150 a day. The proposal has been put forward by experts at NHS Health Scotland, the Scottish Government’s health promotions agency . The increase among women (76 per cent) was higher than in men (57 per cent). While the Government in Westminster has been reluctant to legislate to tackle the alcohol problem, the Scottish Government has had far fewer reservations. It has already agreed a 50p minimum unit price for alcohol, although the controversial move will not be implemented if the Scottish Whisky Association succeeds in an ongoing court battle to block it. The Scottish Government has also banned ‘BOGOF’ (buy-one-get-one-free) deals and other offers encouraging bulk-buying of alcohol, and reduced the drink driving limit. A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘We remain open to the consideration of any evidence-based proposals that can contribute to reducing alcohol-related harm.’ A Department of Health spokesman in London said: ‘There are no plans to increase the legal age for buying alcohol.’","The proposal has been put forward by experts at NHS Health Scotland .

"A convicted fraudster stole £17,000 from the City firm where she worked after she started embezzling money on her second day in the job. Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, 32, used company credit cards to pay for her £10,000 wedding, as well as a £5,000 honeymoon in the Seychelles. She was arrested at Heathrow when she returned from the honeymoon - but now she has been spared jail even though a court heard that she had been convicted of fraud twice previously. Just married: But Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, pictured during her wedding to David Osborne, stole £17,000 to pay for the ceremony and her luxury honeymoon . Fraud: Saunders, pictured outside the Old Bailey, admitted cheating her company out of thousands of pounds . Saunders, also known as Gabriella Osborne since getting married at Belair House in Dulwich last September, stole £35,000 from her previous employer PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where she worked as a tax accountant. After serving a jail sentence, she started a £40,000-a-year job as a personal assistant at Insight Investments in June last year. But she proceeded to embezzle a total of £17,000 using her colleagues' credit cards - including £600 for flowers, £270 on a new watch, £210 on a new outfit and £400 for a mobile phone. The Old Bailey heard Saunders came to the UK from Nigeria and graduated from Southampton University with a law degree in 2004, before starting work at PwC. While working at the multinational firm, Saunders forged taxi receipts to destinations across the country at up to £250 a time, then signed them off by faking a colleague's signature. Couple: Saunders was convicted of fraud twice before her latest offence . Free: Saunders, pictured with her husband in an engagement photo, was spared jail . Celebration: But Saunders was arrested at Heathrow when the couple returned from their honeymoon . In 2007 she was jailed for six months for fraud, and in 2011 she was again convicted of fraud but spared jail after a court heard she had stolen money from neighbour using credit cards. The day after Saunders started working at Insight Investments in June, she charged £5,272 to a colleague's credit card in order to pay travel agent Trailfinders for her luxury honeymoon with husband David Osborne. Mugshot: Saunders pictured after she was jailed for a £35,000 fraud in 2007 . In September she used another colleague's card to pay £10,254 to Belair House, £268.20 to the jeweller Andrew Charles, £597 to PESH flowers, £208.44 to fashion store ASOS and £390 to EE T-mobile. Prosecutor Roger Daniells-Smith said: 'She paid for a prestige wedding venue, she paid for the flowers, she paid for her honeymoon outfit and clothing. 'She paid for phone calls to make these arrangements and she paid for the gift of a watch. She paid for the honeymoon which was a first-class trip to Dubai and then on to the Seychelles. 'They were arrested at Heathrow when they returned to the UK and she made no comment in interview, but it was clear from the evidence that she was solely responsible for these frauds.' Saunders, from Camberwell in south London, admitted seven counts of fraud totalling £16,990, and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment suspended for two years, with 200 hours of unpaid work. Judge Stephen Gullick decided against jailing her after he was told that she had repaid the money and was retraining as a teacher. He said: 'You have a singularly unimpressive record and you have already served a prison sentence some time ago. Pricey: Saunders spent £10,000 of her firm's money to book Belair House for her wedding reception . Honeymoon: She also stole £5,000 to pay for a luxury post-wedding break in the Seychelles . 'You did not disclose your previous dishonesty to your employers, who were prepared to take you on as an administrative assistant on a good salary. 'The fact is within days you were prepared to take advantage. You effectively defrauded others to the tune of £17,000, all of which has been paid back. That money was used to finance your wedding and the subsequent honeymoon. 'You have now started working in a completely different environment. I hope they will never place you in a position of trust with anything to do with money. 'These were serious offences but it appears you are turning your life around. If you continue to commit offences of dishonest of this nature you will eventually receive a very long sentence of imprisonment indeed.'","Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, 32, stole money from Insight Investments on the day after she started working there .

"An Air Force veteran and former Playboy model was arrested for taking an American flag from campus protesters who were trampling on it. Michelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed by police at Valdosta State University, Georgia, and driven off in a patrol car after grabbing the Stars and Stripes and refusing to return it to the student demonstrators. Video footage of the event, on Friday, shows Manhart struggling with officers, who force her to the ground after she refuses to let the flag go. Scroll down for video . Struggle: Manhart, 38, is shown, left, refusing to release a flag which protesters were trampling on. In the right-hand photograph she is seen being arrested at Valdosta State University in Georgia . Cause: Manhart came to the campus because she heard students were walking on the flag, as seen above . It shows her surrounded by protesters on the campus, who demand their property be returned. In response, Manhart says the flag belongs to 'the entire United States'. Campus police try to convince her to drop the flag, but Manhart, a former training sergeant who served in Kuwait, refuses. Speaking to the Valdosta Daily Times about her intervention, she said: 'I did not want anything like this, but I got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground, and they were walking on it. 'I was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground. I don’t know what their cause is, but I went to pick it up because it doesn’t deserve to be on the ground.' She continued: 'If your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them. 'But to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom. You have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it. I’m not fighting against them. I’m fighting against the way they are going about it.' It is not clear what the demonstrators were rallying against. They did not answer reporters' questions about what their cause was. Air Force to bare force: Manhart was once a Staff Sergeant at the San Antonio Air Force training camp (right), but was demoted when she appeared nude in Playboy magazine. She is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread . According to the Daily Times, the group didn't want to press charges against Manhart. However, police gave her a trespass warning, which bans her from the campus. Manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before. In 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for Playboy magazine. Explicit photographs from the periodical's February 2007 issue show then-Sergeant Manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with, then later without - her military uniform. Cover girl: After her original feature, Manhart appeared in Playboy again. She is shown here on the cover of the Mexican edition . When Air Force bosses got wind of the racy feature, they relieved her of her duties at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was later demoted, and ultimately left the Air Force. However, she remained defiant, telling reporters at the time 'I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't think it would be a major issue'. The decision brought an end to 14 years of service . She later appeared in other editions of Playboy - including the cover of the Mexican edition -  and posed for animal rights group Peta to support an anti-fur campaign. The Daily Times reported that Manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on Wednesday. In response to the incident, the university's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest, but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose. Dr William McKinney said: 'The American flag represents everything that is best about our country. As the Supreme Court has held, one of those things is the right to free speech, which includes the right to disrespect even the symbol of our country. 'While I firmly disagree with the actions of the protesters, I understand their right to protest.'","Michelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed at Valdosta State University, Georgia .

"A Church of Scientology-backed organization is facing a bizarre land use battle over its plans to turn a patch of secluded in woods near the presidential retreat Camp David into a drug rehab center. Lawyers hired by drug rehab network Narcocon have argued that Trout Run, a property in Frederick County, Maryland, has historic significance because President Herbert Hoover once caught a fish at the site. Opponents view the proposed designation as a trick to circumvent current zoning laws for the 40-acre plot of land and create a drug rehabilitation program that some call dangerous. Narcocon, a Church of Scientology-affiliated drug rehab network, is trying to prove that a patch of land near Camp David is historic enough so that they can build a center for twelve patients . A Scientology-back real estate company bought Trout Run for $4.85million in 2013, and has been trying to change its land designation so that it can build a center that uses saunas and vitamin therapy for addicts . Narcocon, which uses sauna sessions and the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, has been sued in the past for wrongful deaths. It has denied wrongdoing. The group's treatment program claims that megadoses of the vitamin Niacin and spending five hours a day in a sauna for a month eliminates addiction cravings that are stored in the body's fat cells. Treatments at the center can cost more than $30,000 per month and typically last for as long as six months. Narcocon officials, who run more than 120 centers around the world, deny that the program tries to convert addicts to Scientology, though the group prominently features a quote from Hubbard on its website. The organization says that is focused on a secular approach to helping people overcome addiction. Its Maryland center would house 12 patients, with eight staff living there and eight living off-site. However, the current zoning laws for Trout Run, which includes a collection of stone cottages, classify it for resource conservation and do not permit any medical purpose for the site, according to the Washington Post. Though Narcocon says that it is non-religious and does not try to convert people to Scientology, its website features the religion's founder L Ron Hubbard (pictured) prominently . Placing the property on the county register of historic places would allow Narconon to conduct its program. The rehabilitation program was founded in 1966 and is based on the teachings of Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard. Narconon claims it is a non-religious, non-profit, non-medical . rehabilitation program with patients around the world. Its methods include . spending up to five hours a day in a sauna for 30 days straight and mega . doses of the vitamin Niacin. The hypothesis underlying the program is . that drugs and their metabolites are stored in the body's fatty tissues . for years, causing the addict's cravings when partially released later . on. But these can be flushed out through a regimen comprising elements such as . exercise, sauna and intake of high doses of vitamins, according to the facility's methods. This hypothesis does not enjoy . mainstream acceptance, and researchers and practitioners tend . to discount Narconon due to its connection with Scientology. No independent study that has not been funded by the center exist to confirm the supposed efficacy of its treatment, which has repeatedly been cited as curing 75 per cent of addicts. Since its establishment, it has faced considerable controversy over the . safety and effectiveness of its rehabilitation methods and the . organization's links to the Church of Scientology. Fees can sometimes reach more than $30,000 per month and centers bring in millions of dollars a year from patients. An aide of Herbert Hoover bought the property in the late 1920s and the president went on fishing trips there,  the Frederick News Post reported. Narcocon hired a consultant whose history of Trout Run said that Hoover 'reeled in a fine one-and-one-half pound trout' during a visit. 'No President was born or died there. No epic battles were won or lost, no proclamations penned, no foreign dignitaries lodged and feted,' local drug counselor Kristin Milne-Glasser wrote in opposition to the historic designation. She said that the area merits a roadside plaque at most. President Dwight Eisenhower and other Washington elites also fished at Trout Run during his time in office. Frederick County's Historic Preservation Commission ruled that the site is eligible to be voted onto the register because of its early 20th century architecture. Social Betterment Properties International, a real estate company tied to Scientology, bought the land in 2013 for $4.85million from a government official who had long been trying to sell it. Narconon has been working on building its center since. County councilors delayed voting on the measure two weeks ago so they could have more time to review the proposal and plan to grant or deny approval on Tuesday. Beyond questions of history, opponents to the rehab center have cited safety concerns about the mysterious organization being so close to Camp David and Narcocon's alleged checkered past. Celebrity Scientologists such as John Travolta and Tom Cruise have repeated Narconon's message about how it saves 75 per cent of addicts. Trout Run was first built and developed by an aide of President Herbert Hoover (right) in the late 1920s. It is located in a woods several miles from presidential retreat Camp David (left during G8 Summit in 2012) Trout Run in Maryland was used for fishing by President Hoover (right) and President Dwight Eisenhower (left) during their times in office (file photo, Colorado, 1954) However, the organization previously lost its license  in Georgia after the death of  28-year-old former Marine Patrick Desmond, who was being treated for alcoholism but died after allegedly trying heroin for the first time while in treatment. Previous deaths at Narcocon include three young people who  died within a year at a flagship Oklahoma facility, according to NBC. Hilary Holten, 21, was found dead in her bed at the center in April 2012 of unknown causes. Stacy Murphy, 20, died of an oxymorphone overdose in July. Gabriel Graves, a 32-year-old father of two, died of unknown causes in October 2011. Narconon denied responsibility for any patient deaths. The group's Arrowhead in Oklahoma was estimated to have brought in $10.88million in revenue in 2011. The group has already approached the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene about acquiring a license for its facility but has not filed an application. Its website says it currently runs 16 centers in the United States, though the only one on the East Coast is in Massachusetts. Narcocon and its rehab network have attracted criticism from residents in western Maryland for its checkered past, though celebrities such as Tom Cruise (pictured, 2004) endorse it .

"These stunning pictures show a trio of daredevil bikers dicing with death as they leap over huge jagged rocks metres above crashing waves. The mountain bike athletes were captured taking huge leaps as the sun went down over Portland Rock, an island off the coast of Weymouth, Dorset, on Sunday by photographer Jack Davies. The group included renowned professional trial bike riders Jack Gear, 25, Andrei Burton, 29, and Joe Seddon, 19, who were unfazed by the choppy waters just 10 metres below. Mr Davies said: 'It was incredibly dangerous, the sea was 10 metres below Andrei, crashing against jagged rocks, also the wind plays a big factor, threatening to blow them off course whilst in the air. 'It's a sport based around precision and getting your landing inch perfect. If the wind blows too hard it can completely alter your course in the air and throw you off the bike.' 'It was a really interesting day and so exhilarating to watch the riders launching themselves over the rocks.' It's not the first time the riders have pulled such a daredevil stunt - last year Mr Burton and Mr Seddon took part in a promotional video to highlight the need to increase space for cyclists in London by cycling over some of the capital's top landmarks.

"Disgruntled: Marc Macrae, who was election agent for the SNP’s Westminster leader Angus Robertson, said the party showed compassion for the Lockerbie bomber but ostracised him . A former SNP aide claimed the party treated him ‘worse than a terrorist’ after his cancer diagnosis and has urged Scots to vote Tory. Marc Macrae, who was election agent for the SNP’s Westminster leader Angus Robertson, said the party showed compassion for the Lockerbie bomber but ostracised him. Mr Robertson, who is co-ordinating the Nationalists’ General Election campaign, has not even contacted him to ask how the treatment has gone, he claimed. Like Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi – who killed 270 people in December 1988 by blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 – Mr Macrae was diagnosed with prostate cancer. But while the Libyan terrorist was flown home to spend his final years with his family, Mr Macrae said he was cruelly ditched. He is now backing Tory candidate Douglas Ross, a local councillor, to oust Mr Robertson in Moray. ‘My vote is for Douglas,’ Mr Macrae said. ‘We need independently-minded people at Westminster who can make up their own minds.’ He has undergone two operations and has not worked since being parliamentary assistant to Environment Minister Richard Lochhead in February 2013. Before that, he did the same job for Mr Robertson, also in the party’s office in Elgin, Moray, and considered both men to be among his closest friends. But after his diagnosis in 2013 he claims colleagues in the party accused of him of a lack of commitment to the cause, when in fact he was simply trying to battle cancer. ‘I became very disillusioned with the party because of the way they treated their own members. I had been a very supportive Nationalist since I was young,’ he said. ‘But I was diagnosed with cancer in 2013 and was then treated like a leper by fellow members. ‘I was ostracised – from being very popular to no one speaking to me. People were saying there was nothing wrong with me, that I just wasn’t interested in the cause.’ He started working for Mr Robertson in 2008, before moving to Mr Lochhead’s office in 2011. In January 2013, Mr Macrae went to the doctor after experiencing prostate problems and was given Tamsulosin, which is prescribed for an enlarged prostate, while tests were carried out. He suffered from fatigue and struggled at work before being signed off in May that year on his doctor’s advice. When the cancer was finally diagnosed in October his GP wrote to Mr Lochhead, but Mr Macrae says the minister never got in touch to offer support. Message: Mr Macrae, pictured with Alex Salmond, claimed the SNP   treated him ‘worse than a terrorist’ after his cancer diagnosis and has urged Scots to vote Tory . Fortunately, Mr Macrae did not require chemotherapy and underwent two operations in September and October last year, in which the prostate and surrounding lymph nodes were removed. He has since been given the all-clear. He added: ‘I’ve never heard from Angus. He never contacted me to see how I was doing, how the treatment was going, not one single word. If I see other SNP members, they physically ignore me. It feels very much like they’ve been ordered not to speak to me. ‘A convicted terrorist who had the same cancer as me was shown compassion by the SNP, but I was given the cold shoulder.’ Critics say Mr Macrae’s case is yet another example of the callous way the SNP can treat even its own supporters. Margo MacDonald, who died last year after a long battle with Parkinson’s disease, was thrown out of the party after challenging the leadership, before becoming a popular independent MSP. Her husband Jim Sillars was once a close ally of former First Minister Alex Salmond but found himself exiled for years before a reconciliation during last year’s referendum campaign. For Mr Macrae, the future is now looking brighter. Not only is his cancer in remission but the 48-year-old divorced father-of-one is getting married in the summer, as is 32-year-old Mr Ross. Change of heart: The former SNP member is now backing Tory candidate Douglas Ross, a local councillor, to oust his former boss Angus Robertson in Moray . Comparison: Like Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi – the Lockerbie bomber, left and right - Mr Macrae was diagnosed with prostate cancer - but Mr Macrae said the terrorist treated better than him by the party . The Tory hopeful has the support of the Lib Dems and Ukip as part of a cross-party tactical voting bid to oust Mr Robertson. Despite the SNP flying high in the polls, Mr Ross, who was the Tory election candidate in Moray in 2010, believes he can pull off an upset. He said: ‘People are looking for a change in representation. Being the best placed of the Unionists, I can take support from various parties.’ He added: ‘The way Marc has been treated while dealing with a very difficult illness is shameful.’ Linda Gorn, who fought Moray four times for the Lib Dems, is urging supporters to back Mr Ross. ‘I’m supporting Douglas in this election because of the way he stands up for his constituents on Moray Council and across Moray as a whole,’ she said. Donald Gatt, who stood in Moray for Ukip in 2010, added: ‘Moray is a two-horse race between Douglas Ross and Angus Robertson.’ Last night, Mr Robertson said: ‘Mr Macrae fell out with the SNP some time ago and even stood as a candidate against the SNP in a local by-election. At a time of rising support for the SNP in Moray and across Scotland it is unsurprising that he is now backing the Tories.’","Marc Macrae says the SNP ditched him when he fell ill with prostate cancer .

"A café in eastern China has started to charge customers an 'air-purifying fee' on top of normal bills after it installed machines to provide fresher air. The café manager said the shop has begun operating eight air purifiers 24 hours a day. By charging a one yuan (11p) 'air-purifying fee' per person, the café hopes customers will pay more attention to the growing pollution issue facing China, reported the People's Daily Online. Fantasy Café is one of the first establishments in China to start charging an 'air-purifying fee' A label is put on every table to alert customers about the surcharge which costs 11p per person . The two-storey Fantasy Café is located in downtown Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang Province. The decision has proved popular among customers, who are mainly students and white collar workers. Many say they are happy to pay extra for breathing healthier air while enjoying coffee and meals. A label is put on every table stating clearly that there is an air-purifying surcharge. 'As soon as the customers come in, we will make it clear that there will be a one yuan surcharge for cleaner air,' said manager, Mr Sun, toHangzhou Network. 'If the customers can't accept it, they can choose not to come,' he added. A customer told the same reporter: 'I think this is a new way of running business. I feel more comfortable eating my meal here with so many purifiers in operation.' The café opened in July last year and offers various Western drinks and snacks, such as latte (£4), tiramisu coffee (£5), Spanish cured meat platter (£18) and pan-fried foie gras (£9.60). Serving a variety of Western drinks and foods, the café is popular among young people . Owner Zhu Ze, 50, bought the air purifiers earlier this year for around 100,000 yuan (£1,080). Mr Zhu told Hangzhou Network that his business has grown dramatically since he started using the devices. 'My goal is to remind my customers that we spent a lot of effort on providing fresh air,' he added. Customers say they are happy to pay extra for breathing healthy air while enjoying coffee and meals . Like other cities in China, Hangzhou – which is surrounded by some of the finest landscapes in China, such as the West Lake – has been battling with air pollution. The city of nine million suffered heavy smog on 154 days in 2014. According to People's Daily Online, Hangzhou ranks number one in China in terms of vehicles per capita. The city's 1.26 million automobiles are the main cause of the poor air quality. Earlier this month, Chinese state media published a set of stunning aerial pictures which show the hundreds of thousands of vehicles thrown on the scrap heap in a sprawling 'car graveyard' as Hangzhou government aggressively aims to cut back emissions.","Customer being charged one yuan (11p) extra as an ‘air-purifying fee’

"Students, parents and staff at a Melbourne high school are horrified after the discovery students have been drinking treated sewage water from a bubbler on campus for more than a year. In a letter sent to all parents during the school holidays, the principal of St Peter’s College in Cranbourne East, Tim Hogan admitted that ‘Class A’ recycled water had been inadvertently connected to an outdoor drinking fountain. The bubbler had been dispensing recycled water for 16 months– from December 17 2013 until April 1 2015. ‘The cross-connection came to our attention through the maintenance staff of the College on the 30th of March, 2015,’ Mr Hogan wrote in the letter, issued on April 14. Unfortunately for students, ‘Class A’ recycled water is sewage that has been treated to a standard that’s safe for watering gardens, washing clothes and flushing toilets. Students at Melbourne high school St Peter's College were drinking from a bubbling dispensing recycled water for more than a year . Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption. Whilst drinking the water, the students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea due to the possible presence of a parasite, Cryptosporidium. An investigation has been launched by the Department of Health and Human Services to assess the extent of the possible health impact on the students. The principal assured students, parents and staff that the drinking fountain was shut down on April 1 and is no longer in use. The other 20 bubblers at the school have been tested and none show traces of recycled water. The ongoing investigation will determine the number of students who have drunk from the water foundation since it became contaminated. Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption . ‘The Department has advised that drinking the Class A recycled water may have led to a slightly increased risk of gastro,’ the principal warned. However, preliminary testing of the chemicals present in the drinking water from the bubbler found that ‘the vast majority were at very low concentrations’, meaning the student were unlikely to have been harmed from consuming the water. Daily Mail Australia spoke with a number of parents of St Peter's students. All the parents were unaware of any cases of gastro or anyone who believed they'd been adversely affected by the bubbler. A Health Department official will be on site at the school on Thursday April 16 to respond to concerns the parents may have. ‘If anyone is suffering from a gastrointestinal illness and experiencing symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, they should seek advice from their GP,’ Mr Hogan advised. Families and staff are being encouraged to contact the Department of Health & Human Services on 1300 761 874. Whilst drinking the water, the students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea due to the possible presence of a parasite, Cryptosporidium .","A bubbler at a Melbourne high school has been dispensing recycled water .

"Residents living near the new setting for Benefits Street have been left outraged by housing bosses who they say have given it a makeover to impress new visitors. Kingston Road in Stockton is the backdrop for the latest series of the Channel 4 documentary which divided opinion with its debut in Birmingham's James Turner Street. The programme follows the lives of a handful of benefits claimants and last year split public opinion with many accusing producers of promoting 'poverty tourism'. Workmen have been seen on Kingston Road in Stockton, the setting for the newest series of Benefits Street . Angry neighbours claim housing bosses have ordered the makeover in anticipation of the show's release . Filming has finished in Stockton, with the new series set to air in the coming weeks. But local people claim housing bosses are trying to perpetuate a false image of the area, by giving it a makeover before the programme is aired. Residents have slammed the face lift saying the estate - owned by local housing group Thirteen Group - will look 'completely different' to anyone who visits after watching the show. 'It’s normally quite a grotty street. The front gardens were filled with all sorts of rubbish. One house had a balcony with a sofa on it. 'There were bikes just lying in the street left there by children,' said Mike Swift, who lives nearby. The housing association said the works had been planned well in advance and were nothing to do with the programme . A young resident is filmed by Channel 4 as part of the show. Viewers were split in opinion last series, with many accusing producers of promoting 'poverty tourism' Another of the residents in Kingston Road. Local people said the street was normally 'quite grotty' A local councillor said the council had tried to thwart the programme from filming in Stockton . Among the residents taking part in the new series is Dorothy 'Doris' Taylor who hasn't worked for 20 years . 'When it comes on TV next month the actual street will look completely different. It’s almost as if they know they’re going to get people coming and looking. 'They were annoyed when it came out Channel 4 were filming there, worried it was portrayed as a bad area.' Stockton-on-Tees Council and Thirteen Group have denied the works were planned with the release of Benefits Street in mind. A spokesman for the local authority said it had been scheduled in advance, adding the council had done 'everything' to thwart the controversial series being filmed in Stockton. 'We did everything in our power to persuade the producers of Benefits Street to turn their attentions  elsewhere. Sadly, you can’t win them all. 'Lots of people agreed with us that this is not a good thing for the Borough.' A spokesperson for Thirteen Group who own the houses and are in charge of the developments said: 'The ongoing investment in our properties is planned well in advance and any inference that the filming of any TV programme could influence this is completely untrue.' Among the residents who took part last year was White Dee . Upon the launch of Channel 4's Benefits Street, the nation was split in two. Many considered the programme an insightful glimpse into some of life's struggles and encompassing of some of Britain's biggest problems. Others criticised producers for, they said, making objects of their subjects. Among them was Deidre Kelly, better known as White Dee. The mother-of-two was the standout star of the first series and one of the central figures in James Turner Street. Since finding stardom on the show Dee has appeared in a string of others including Celebrity Big Brother. She was also invited to speak on a fringe panel at the Conservative Party Conference last year. But while Dee found fame and fortune in taking part (she no longer claims from the state, a spokesman has insisted), others were disheartened by Channel 4's portrayal of their lives. Some claimed they were told the programme would focus on multiculturalism claiming they only learned of its angle after agreeing to take part. Among critics of the show is John Hening, 64, a retired chartered engineer who has lived on Kingston Road for 40 years. He accused Channel 4 of not caring about residents' needs, putting them behind ratings.","Residents in Stockton's Kingston Road are followed in the newest series .

"Arrest: Tabitha Bennett allegedly drove her daughter to fight another girl and then encouraged the fight . A mother set up a fight between her 13-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old girl, drove her child to meet her and then encouraged them to brawl, according to police. Two bystanders recorded the fight on their cell phones as Tabitha Anne Bennett allegedly shouted at her daughter to take swings at the older girl in New Port Richey, Florida. Bennett, who is unemployed, was arrested and charged with child abuse, assault and battery offenses, Pasco County Sheriff's officials said. She is accused of sending a Facebook message to the older girl on April 12 and telling her that she was going to bring her daughter to fight the girl, according to an affidavit. She claimed that the 14-year-old girl had been bullying her daughter. Bennett allegedly drove her daughter to the area near Moog Street and Colonial Hills Drive and left the car holding a folding knife. 'The 14-year-old victim advised she thought she was going to die when she saw the defendant with the knife,' Detective William Orndorff wrote in his report. Bennett allegedly encouraged her daughter to fight the girl, yelling at her, 'Get on top of her' and 'kick her a**', according to police. 'The defendant's daughter was losing the fight at which time the defendant kicked the 14-year-old female on her upper left side and pulled her to the ground by her hair,' the affidavit said. Scene: She allegedly met the girl at this corner in New Port Richey before yelling at her daughter to fight . Her teenage daughter then climbed on top of the girl and continued to fight her, according to the report. The fight lasted about a minute, according to the affidavit, and afterwards, two bystanders posted footage of the brawl to social media. When questioned by police, Bennett allegedly admitted to encouraging the fight but denied kicking the girl - saying she may have kicked her own daughter instead, according to the affidavit. Bennett was released from jail Sunday on $10,500 bail. It was unclear Monday whether she had retained an attorney who could be reached for comment.","Tabitha Anne Bennett 'messaged a 14-year-old girl on Facebook and told her that she would be bringing her daughter to fight the girl'

"A high school student and her best friend, who has Down syndrome, have become an internet sensation after making a bold statement with their prom photo, which not only celebrated their friendship - but spread an important message. Matt Pliska, who is also a survivor of leukemia, asked Mikenzy Snell to be his prom date last year, and on their big night, the juniors from Waupaca, Michigan, made an emotional statement when they were photographed holding a sign that read: 'Real friends don't count chromosomes', referring the fact that Down syndrome occurs when an individual has an extra copy of chromosome 21. 'I just feel like it really shows our friendship to the next level of where it actually is but people might not see behind closed doors,' Mikenzy told WBAY. Scroll down for video . Perfect pair: Mikenzy Snell and Matt Pliska, who has Down syndrome, spread an important message about friendship when they were photographed holding this sign at their junior prom in Waupaca, Michigan . Since the news outlet first shared the heartwarming picture of Matt and Mikenzy on its Facebook page on March 30, more than 15,000 people have liked the image, ensuring that their prom night will be one that they never forget. After Matt learned that his best friend had been invited to the same dance by somebody else last year, he immediately asked her if she would be his date this time around - and she gladly accepted. And as his date, she did everything she could to make sure that he had a fantastic night. Before prom, Mikenzy took it upon herself to make sure that Matt had the opportunity to be elected onto prom court. When she learned that his name wasn't included in the junior class ballot, which would elect two boys onto prom court, she took it up with the high school office. And although she was initially told it was too late for Matt to be added to the list, she later learned that there was a new ballot with her friend's name on it. Unforgettable night: Mikenzy, who wore a black mermaid gown, posed with her friends for some pre-prom photos . Strike a pose: Matt, who wore a black tux with a bright red vest, threw his jacket over his shoulder for this snapshot . 'We found out later that week he was elected onto prom court,' Mikenzy's mom Carmen told Yahoo Parenting. 'Mikenzy knew that Matt deserved the chance just like everyone else.' Carmen explained that some of her daughter's 'best times' have been with Matt. 'They see movies, go out for dinner and go to watch high school sporting events together,' she said. Matt and Mikenzy first became fast friends in fifth grade after they were partnered together during a class trip. 'He’s such a positive person,' Mikenzy told WBAY. 'He always has a smile on his face.' Meanwhile, when Matt was asked about Mikenzy, he responded: 'Honestly, I love [her].' Celebration: Mikenzy snapped this selfie while holding a champagne flute . Mikenzy, who coaches Special Olympics basketball, said she hopes to one day have a career working with those with disabilities, but noted that wherever she ends up, she and Matt will remain close. 'I think it’ll be a forever friendship,' she told the outlet. And Matt has plenty of extracurricular activities of his own. The teen, who enjoys bowling, is the team manager for both the boys' hockey team and the girls' soccer team. 'When you have a child that has a disability, they tell you they’re not going to do this, you’re not going to do that,' Matt’s mom Flonnie told WBAY. 'Then you turn around and you watch when they’re growing up.' Good times: Mikenzy, who coaches Special Olympics basketball, threw her arms around Matt and another friend for this snapshot .

Woman charged with having sex with a dog has lashed out at a photographer and hit him over the head . Jenna Louise Driscoll has been charged with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug and unlawful wounding . Ms Driscoll was arrested on Friday afternoon after she turned up at Stafford police station to fulfill her regular bail conditions. Police had allegedly issued a warrant for her arrest after she failed to appear in court on seven charges of supplying or trafficking drugs, one charge of unlawful wounding and three charges of bestiality. According to the Courier Mail, Ms Driscoll pleaded guilty before Magistrate Bronwyn Springer for failing to previously appear in court and was fined $250 for the offence . She was released on conditional bail, which requires her to report to police, abide by residential conditions and not speak to the complainant. Police found the videos of Ms Driscoll allegedly having sex with a dog while investigating text messages on her mobile phone for allegedly dealing cannabis in October. She fronted Brisbane court on Saturday for failing to previously appear on April 7 . Police were carrying out checks on Driscoll's phone for suspected drug trafficking when they discovered the three videos which allegedly show her having sex with a dog . Ms Driscoll was charged last year with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug. ‘This isn’t something you’d normally expect, it’s quite unusual. The last case I can recall was a few years ago, it certainly isn’t something we hear reported often,' said Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland. Driscoll was also charged with two counts of possession of an item used in the commission of a crime and three counts of supplying. Police prosecutor Sergeant Scott Pearson said Driscoll had allegedly been dealing cannabis to friends.

"Conservative plans to raise billions of pounds from the 'grubby hands of scroungers' will not work, Nick Clegg warned today as he unveiled Lib Dem plans to balance the books. The Lib Dem leader promised to 'spread the burden' of deficit reduction, with cuts to welfare and Whitehall budgets along with tax rises aimed at the very wealthy. Car tax would rise by £25-a-year. But he scaled back his plans for a mansion tax, amid concern it could cost the party support in key seats in affluent parts of London. Scroll down for video .

Mr Clegg set out plans for £5billion in new tax rises, £7billion raised from a crackdown on tax avoidance, £12 billion in public spending reductions and a £3 billion cut from welfare. But he mocked George Osborne's insistence that another £12billion can be found from the welfare budget. Mr Clegg warned that it was 'quite simply impossible' to find savings on that scale without causing 'real pain to millions of families' and some of the most vulnerable people. The Lib Dems set out plans to cap rises in working age benefits at 1 per cent to two years. They would also make changes to the universal credit benefits system and take winter fuel payments and free TV licences away from wealthy pensioners – something the Tories have rejected. At a press conference in central London, Mr Clegg said: 'We are going to spread the burden of finishing the job of fixing the economy fairly across society. 'Yes that means more cuts, but it also means asking the wealthiest to pay their fare share too.' He added: 'Our plan means finding more than £3billion in savings from the welfare budget. Savings which ask wealthy pensioners to make a small sacrifice. 'Savings which involve fair adjustments to universal credit. Continued restraint on the rate of increase of benefits and a ground-breaking plan to reduce benefit fraud and error and get the most vulnerable off benefits and into work.' At a press conference with Lib Dem minister David Laws, Mr Clegg warned that it was 'quite simply impossible' to find £12billion savings from welfare without causing 'real pain to millions of families' and some of the most vulnerable people . Among the Lib Dem deficit-reduction plans confirmed by the party's leader are: . He warned that the Tories 'plan to veer away sharply from the sensible and balanced course we have set together in government'. He continued: 'If you listen to George Osborne you could be forgiven for believing that they intend to find all £12 billion from the grubby hands of scroungers and layabouts. They don't. They can't. 'Finding anything remotely close to that scale of savings is quite simply impossible without causing real pain to millions of families and some of the most vulnerable people in our society. 'With pensions rightly protected, there is simply no benefit out there large enough where you can find £12 billion of savings without hurting children or disabled people.' He added: 'The Conservatives' welfare plans are a dangerous deceit that will end up hurting the most vulnerable people in our society and millions of the poorest working families.' It emerged that the Lib Dems have scaled down the amount of money they expect their mansion tax proposal to generate by £700million. Properties valued at £2 million or more would be subject to the party's so-called 'high value property levy' from 2017-18, which they say would collect £1 billion - down from the £1.7 billion previously estimated. Mr Clegg said adopting a 'reasonable and fair' approach to the policy had resulted in the estimated revenue decreasing. The Lib Dem leader added the charges proposed 'shouldn't scare the horses' and used the same principle as council tax bands in order to prevent oligarchs who live in mansions paying the same property tax as a family. The charge would be £2,000 per year or less for properties valued at £2 million to £2.5 million, £3,500 or less if valued at £2.5 million to £3 million, £5,000 per year or less if valued at £3 million to £4 million, and £9,000 per year or less if valued between £4 million and £5 million. Mr Clegg said: 'It's not fair a family home in Lewisham pays the same property tax as an oligarch in a vast mansion. 'What we're saying is we'll extend the same fair banded approach up the value chain.' Mr Clegg challenged the other parties to spell out in similar detail how they would balance the nation's books . Car tax will increase on average by £25 a year by 2017-18, with drivers of gas guzzlers facing even higher bills under Liberal Democrat plans. Nick Clegg's party plans a review of vehicle excise duty (VED) rates to ensure that the Treasury continues to receive the money it expects as motorists switch to cleaner, lower-tax models. Figures released by the party in a pre-manifesto briefing show an extra £485 million will be raised by the rebanding in 2016-17 and £850 million in 2017-18. At a central London press conference, Mr Clegg rejected the assertion that the tax hike amounted to a new 'war on motorists', insisting the measure was to maintain the 'status quo' on the revenue raised. He said: 'It's a revenue retention measure - we simply want to maintain the same amount of money from the overall vehicle duty system as we set out in 2010. 'This is just to make sure as the system shifts around because people are buying lower emission vehicles, we still generate the same revenue.' Mr Clegg challenged the other parties to spell out in similar detail how they would balance the nation's books. He said the Lib Dems are the only party offering a 'balanced' programme to pay down the remaining deficit and deliver a £7.7 billion surplus, while still finding money to raise income tax thresholds to £11,000 and invest in the NHS. Setting out plans to eradicate the current structural deficit by 2017-18, Mr Clegg said his party was giving an 'unprecedented level of detail' about its financial plans and challenged Labour and the Tories to do the same. Mr Clegg said Labour's plans involved £70 billion more borrowing, claiming 'they are playing Russian roulette with your family's future'. Labour leader Ed Miliband leads a party that 'want you to think they can be trusted to balance the books without saying how they intend to do it', he said. 'They won't even tell you when they want to do it by,' he added. Warning that Labour's plans would involve extra borrowing, he said it would mean an extra £4 billion - £134 for every taxpayer - on debt interest payments. 'It means you, your children, your friends and your neighbours will be left paying for Labour's borrowing for years to come. 'They are playing Russian roulette with your family's future.' Explaining the Lib Dem alternative he said there was 'light at the end of the tunnel'. 'I can't promise you that the next two years will be easy. I wish I could. Your hard work and sacrifice has turned our economy around, but there is still a job to finish. But, with the Liberal Democrats, there is light at the end of the tunnel.'","Lib Dem leader explains how his party would eradicate deficit by 2017-18 .

"Robert Kirkland died on Saturday morning in Union City, Tennessee, from kidney failure complications . An entrepreneur and philanthropist who built a national chain of home decor stores and donated $100million has died at age 77. Robert Kirkland, who founded the home decor store that bears his last name, died on Saturday morning in Union City, Tennessee, from complications stemming from kidney failure. Kirkland, who founded Kirkland's home decor stores with his cousin Carl in 1966, donated the money to found the Discovery Park of America education center and tourist attraction in Tennessee. Kirkland's expanded into a chain of more than 300 locations in 35 states. His son Chris said: 'He was a man who loved learning and was always curious about how things worked. 'Discovery Park was really an extension of that curiosity and wanting to instill in children and adults a continued craving for knowledge and understanding.' A memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday at Discovery Park, which will be closed to the general public on that day. Kirkland, who founded the home decor stores with his cousin Carl in 1966, expanded the chain exponentially . He donated millions to found the Discovery Park of America education center and tourist spot in Tennessee . Kirkland was born in Newberry, South Carolina, but he lived in Union City for much of his life. He grew up the son of retailers who owned and operated a Ben Franklin five and dime store. The Kirkland cousins also founded CBK Ltd, which shipped gift and home decor items to customers around the world from a distribution center in Union City, population 11,000. By the late 1990s, Robert Kirkland and his wife Jenny had sold their business holdings and began to concentrate on philanthropic efforts through the Robert E and Jenny D Kirkland Foundation. One of those projects was Discovery Park of America, which opened in 2013. Housed in a futuristic-looking, gleaming-white structure built in a rural field in Union City, Discovery Park has exhibits about natural and regional history, dinosaurs, Native Americans, energy, transportation, science, the military and space flight. An earthquake simulator causes the floor to tremble, a 120-foot glass observation tower offers stunning views and a 50-foot metal replica of the human body includes a 32-foot slide. The 50-acre complex also boasts an old train depot, a century-old church, a rotating grist mill, antique tractors, log cabins and flower gardens. Discovery Park attracted about 300,000 visitors in its first year and it continues to add exhibits and attractions on the strength of Kirkland's $100 million donation.

"In recent years, Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location with its majestic vistas being prominently featured in many hit TV series or Hollywood blockbusters. Despite the fact that Iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920, well-known fantasy, sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late, prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide. Although the country's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen, there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as Game of Thrones, Interstellar or Prometheus. Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland – specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital. Scenes from Christopher Nolan’s epic Interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier Svinafellsjokull in the Skaftafell National Park, which is also located near another favoured filming location: Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajokull. The Svinafellsjokull glacier provided a stunning setting for Christopher Nolan's epic film, Interstellar . Interstellar tells the tale of explorers who travel in search of a new planet to sustain the human race . Europe's most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, was used in the opening scenes of Prometheus . In Prometheus, the rushing waterfall in the background is meant to help depict the beginning of time . 'Interstellar was my second time filming in Iceland and it was another worldly experience,' the director told Film In Iceland. 'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe’s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus. And finally, Game of Thrones enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognise the north of Iceland, namely Thingvellir National Park, from Arya’s storyline and as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne, in the North of Westeros. The Jokullsarlon lake, at the foot of the massive massive Vatnajokull glacier, is another favoured filming spot .","Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location recently .

"Forget the X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, today's bright young things want to make their name in the world of technology. But for entrepreneurs like Robyn Exton, who has launched a dating app for lesbians, making money means abandoning life in the UK to travel to San Francisco to look for investment. In a new Channel 4 documentary, How To Be A Young Billionaire, Robyn admits: 'I want to raise a million dollars.' Scroll down for video . How to Be a Young Billionaire follows three young British adults as they attempt to make a success out of their apps in San Francisco. Pictured: Robyn Exton who is the founder of Dattch (HER) a lesbian dating app . The 28-year-old, who grew up in Kent,  came out to her friends and family as bisexual in her 20s but struggled to find a girlfriend. But she struggled to meet someone so ever determined, Robyn came about creating Dattch (now re-branded as HER) a dating app designed for lesbian, bisexual and curious women. She said she decided to create her own app when the ones that were available weren't up to the job. 'I was with my friends in the pub and we were all signed up to a bunch of different lesbian sites. 'One of my friends had just split up with her girlfriend and we were signing her up to one of the sites we were on and we knew that what we were using was awful. Josh Buckley made his first million at 18 with his games app MinoMonsters but the app has since gone into decline seeing Josh seeking a five million dollar investment . Josh has created a MinoMonsters two which he hopes will set his wealth back on track . 'I cared so much about it and then the actual idea for Dattch came up. ' On moving to Silicon Valley, she said: 'Its really depressing because you start to realise that everything is completely dependent on money. I can't ever imagine not doing it and being prepared to give it up.' The region may be renowned for its investment in tech but with 5,000 smart phone apps launched each week and only one in ten surviving Robyn was prepared for knock-backs. In fact, the ambitious entrepreneur managed to impress the right people and secured investment from media mogul and co-founder of Bebo Michael Birch. He said: 'We liked her a lot, super-passionate, she built a great product proving she could execute was getting some early traction. 'She identified an area that we feel was being under served. had the potential to be the market leader in that and at this stage a relatively low valuation. Good time to invest.' Both Robyn and Josh seek the investment of Michael Birch the co-founder of Bebo . But with the pressure still on to raise cash, she gave a five minute presentation to 400 influential women at a lesbian technology conference in New York. A week later, the first figures from the app were promising and within 48 hours of pitching it was  the fastest growing lesbian dating app in the city. Yet, Robyn admitted to being most thrilled by another claim to fame. She recounted a story of someone spotting her Dattch sticker on her laptop. 'He said all the girls in his office talking about it and I was like ""oh where do you work"" and he was like ""I work at Vogue,""' she laughed. After securing her investment, Robyn is now moving to San Francisco permanently and plans to roll out her app across America. Another mini-millionaire who is on the hunt for investors is 22-year-old Josh Buckley who made his first million at just 18 years old. It was his development of the game MinoMonsters that earned him nearly million a month at its peak. But Josh says that he was a high earner long before MinoMonsters. 'It started when I was 11, I bought a book to teach myself programming and I built a website while teaching other people how to program. 'Within a month I sold the website for two thousand dollars. and I realised holy s*** you can make money doing this!' Just four years later the child prodigy sold a business for a six figure sum. 'The funny thing was my parents didn't even know I was running this thing at the time so they had a bit of a shock to find out I had this big windfall.' But now three years after relocating to California Josh's wealth is on the line. After pitching her app at a lesbian technology conference Dattch became the fastest growing lesbian dating app in New York City having caught the attention of Vogue magazine . Julia Onken works for high school confession app Fess but believes she is destined for bigger things . 'MinoMonsters 1 was doing pretty well. It made millions of dollars and was going up by ten per cent a week we realised it probably would have capped out at a certain level and if you don't keep growing you're gonna die - figuratively.' In the hope of keeping his fortune going Josh created MinoMonsters 2 but desperately needed a five million dollar investment in order to launch the game. He said: 'I'm trying to think what am I going to do next. We're six months behind. It feels like we've done a lot wrong here.' 'We were making 10 million a year. We're burning $3,000 a day $70,000 dollars a month.' Although Josh admitted he and his team would be prepared to work up to 16-hour days, seven days a week on his business, his chief designer Sash Mackinnon revealed that his immense work stress led him to having a heart attack at just 21. More investors have withdrawn from Josh's project and it is yet to be revealed whether Apple, his final hope, would agree to promote MinoMonsters. The game's launch has been postponed until April but Josh is still optimistic. He said: If I failed tomorrow I would get back up pretty quickly and try again and just keep on trying.' The final technology hopeful featured in the documentary is Julia Onken, 21, who moved to California with her family. A social marketing director for Fess, which encourages students to share their secrets, Julia is confident that she will become the next big thing in the tech boom. She said: 'I don't think anyone else right now would necessarily think of the idea I have. That might be cocky and I might be doing a terrible job and I just think I'm doing a great job.'","How To Be A Young Billionaire airs tonight on Channel 4 .

"Model-turned-jihadist Sharky Jama has reportedly been killed in Syria while fighting with terrorist organisation Islamic State (IS). The Melbourne man's father, Dada Jama, confirmed his death to SBS Radio while tributes to the young man flooded social media. Somali broadcaster Ibrahim Mohamed said he had spoken with the family on Wednesday who told him Sharky had died after being shot. Scroll down for video . Sharky Jama has reported been shot dead in Syria after joining Islamic State on the front lines last year . The jihadist's father had been told by Sharky's friends that the worst had happened. '[Dada] got a text message and he received a phone call from Syria, someone has told him his son has passed away,' Mr Mohamed said. 'Then he said ""I tried his number"", because he has contact with his son. Automatically, it goes to voicemail, that’s what he said, and then he knew that his son is gone.' The Department of Foreign Affairs was unable to confirm Sharky's death as its capacity to do so was 'extremely limited'. A spokesman for the department told Daily Mail Australia consular assistance was no longer available within Syria 'due to the extremely dangerous security situation'. He further added Australians who were involved in overseas conflicts were 'putting their own lives in mortal danger'. 'Any Australians fighting with non-state militia in Syria or Iraq should end their involvement in the conflict now and leave the conflict zone,' the spokesman said. 'Australians are strongly advised not to travel to Syria or Iraq; any Australians in either country should leave immediately.' Sharky was a model-turned-jihadist who was managed by FRM Management and lived in Melbourne . He reportedly fled to Syria with his friend, former La Trobe University student Yusuf Yusuf, to join the terror group . The former model's cousins have taken to Facebook to pay tribute to their much-loved family member. 'To my beautiful cousin, the lessons learnt in your presence where priceless in any capacity the childhood memories we shared invaluable you'll be greatly missed for you where great in every shade of light,' they said. While another relative wrote: 'Rest in peace my handsome lil cousin! All them beautiful memories and time we shared I shall keep dear to my heart. May Allah bless your soul.' His family were informed of his death on Monday and father Dada Jama told SBS Radio he had been told of news via a text message and phone call . His cousins posted tributes to their much-loved relative on social media, saying he was 'beautiful' Before he joined IS, Sharky was a 'budding' model with FRM Management. Reports the Melbourne man of Somalian descent had fled to Syria to join the front lines first surfaced last year. It is believed Sharky and his friend, former La Trobe University student Yusuf Yusuf, had travelled to key IS outposts of Fallujah, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, respectively. In various pictures published by his modelling agency, Sharky is seen posing for photographs in smart casual clothing. Propaganda prop: Abdullah Elmir, 17, from western Sydney, featured in a high-definition Islamic State broadcast earlier this year . Elmir, pictured, has not been heard from in IS propaganda since the video's syndication . Islamic State has been heavily recruiting young Australians to come to the Middle East via online videos . In a series of professional photographs, he is seen showing off high-topped leather boots, cargo pants and a colourful scarf on a picturesque Australian beach. In other pictures, he gazes down the barrel of the camera, a patterned fedora tipped forward on his head as he saunters down a laneway wearing a short-sleeve dress shirt and pants. Sharky's marketing card describes his chest, waist and collar measurements as well as his height (5'11""), suit size (38R) and shoe size (10.5). It is not known what role the young Australian played in Fallujah - the first major city to fall to the Islamic State in 2014, but there is no doubt it was very different to his Australian occupation. The Federal Government believes more than 70 Australians have fled to join the fighting in Iraq and Syria and the passports of more than 100 others have been cancelled. Other young Australians who have fled to Syria include Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir who recently appeared in an Islamic State recruitment video.","Melbourne model Sharky Jama has reportedly been shot dead in Syria .

"The BBC has refused to hand over the emails of a deceased woman to her grieving husband, who believes they will prove she was ‘bullied’ by the Corporation’s management towards the end of her life. Mother-of-two Marie Csaszar, 45, died last September following a ten-year battle with a brain tumour. She had worked for seven years at the BBC’s financial centre in Cardiff as a contracts manager, but according to her husband Paul, she was forced out of the post into another job after drawing attention to management blunders which he says cost licence-fee payers about £150,000. Whistleblower: Marie Csaszar died after a 10-year battle with a brain tumour. Her widower has had a request for her work emails, which he believes will show she was being bullied by bosses, refused by the BBC . Legal experts described the case as ‘highly unusual’, but predicted that it could be followed by similar claims as digital documents such as emails and social media posts play an increasingly important part in people’s lives. Facebook users in the US have the chance to designate a ‘legacy contact’ who can take over parts of their account after their death. Mr Csaszar says he believes the BBC failed in its duty of care to his late wife, and the treatment she received from management affected her health. He asked the BBC under the Data Protection Act for copies of his wife’s emails, in the hope they will provide evidence of her ‘appalling’ treatment by the Corporation, which he has spent months pursuing. However, he was told last month by the BBC that under the Act, personal data is defined as only ‘data which relates to a living individual’. Despite Mr Csaszar being his wife’s legal next of kin, an email from the BBC – seen by The Mail on Sunday – read: ‘Unfortunately as your wife has sadly passed away it is not possible for you to exercise the right to access her personal data under the Data Protection Act.’ Mr Csaszar said his wife gave evidence to the BBC’s 2013 Respect At Work review that was set up to look into sexism and bullying following the Jimmy Savile scandal. He said it was her evidence which led the chairwoman, Dinah Rose QC, to conclude some senior Corporation staff were viewed as ‘untouchable’. Details of the individuals who were the subject of Mr Csaszar’s complaint cannot be published for legal reasons but they involve at least one senior manager on a six-figure salary. Last night, self-employed businessman Mr Csaszar, 48, said: ‘Marie was being hammered from one side to the other towards the end of her life. Nobody stood up and objected. Locked out: The BBC has refused to hand over the work emails of Marie Csaszar to her widower Paul . ‘The treatment which Marie experienced at the hands of the BBC affected her recovery. She was constantly upset and left in tears, saying, “I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve being treated like this.” ‘They didn’t want Marie on the staff because she knew too much about what had gone on. ‘She would refuse to sign off certain contracts because they didn’t show value for money, but they were signed off anyway. This caused her a great deal of stress.’ Mrs Csaszar underwent intensive treatment for her cancer over several years, which left her suffering with epilepsy. However, she continued to work in her £50,000-a-year post, and raised serious concerns that could have saved licence-fee payers’ money, her husband claims. In a formal grievance procedure with the BBC in 2013, Mrs Csaszar raised a complaint about the closure of a cash office run by an outside contractor. She was advised by the BBC’s legal department that the Corporation was not liable under its contract to pay any money towards redundancy for staff employed by the contractors. But she told her husband that about £35,000 was paid out anyway. Mr Csaszar says he is desperate to see emails referring to his wife and how she was treated following her whistleblowing. He contacted the Information Commissioner’s Office, only to be told that the release of the documents was ‘at the discretion’ of the BBC. Mr Csaszar has raised his request with the BBC Trust, the Corporation’s watchdog, and is considering legal action. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We were very sorry to hear of Ms Csaszar’s death. A thorough investigation was carried out into her complaint and the outcome was provided to her in July 2013. We have provided this response to her husband. Ms Csaszar then attended work from October 2013 to May 2014 and did not raise a further appeal to her complaint.’","Mother-of-two died following a 10-year battle with a brain tumour .

"An innocent man who spent more than 30 years on death row for a murder he didn't commit has come face-to-face with the prosecutor who put him there. Glenn Ford, who was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer after his release last year, was too weak to stand when Marty Stroud walked into his Louisiana home last week but shook his hand. 'I want you to know that I am very sorry,' Stroud said during the somber meeting, which was filmed by Nightline. 'It's a stain on me that will be with me until I go to my grave.' 'Right,' Ford responded, without looking up. 'But it still cost me 31 years of my life and then nothing at the end but death because they give me from six to eight months to live.' Scroll down for videos . Apology: Marty Stroud, left, visited Glenn Ford, right, at his home to apologize for putting him behind bars for 30 years for a murder he didn't commit. Ford was released from prison in Angola last year . Face-to-face: The 65-year-old, who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer shortly after being freed from prison, shook the former prosecutor's hand as he walked into his home . 'I'm sorry,' Ford added. 'I can't forgive you.' Stroud, who wished Ford the best before leaving the home, had asked to meet the man after apologizing to him in a powerful letter published in The Shreveport Times last month. In the letter, Stroud admitted that he was to blame for mistakenly putting Ford behind bars for the fatal shooting of a jeweler, despite no murder weapon or witnesses placing him at the scene. 'In 1984, I was 33 years old,' he wrote. 'I was arrogant, judgmental, narcissistic and very full of myself. I was not as interested in justice as I was in winning.' Stroud, 63, wrote the letter after the state ruled that Ford was not entitled to receive $330,000 in compensation for his time spent behind bars because he could not prove he did not know about the killing before it was carried out. 'Glenn Ford should be completely compensated to every extent possible because of the flaws of a system that effectively destroyed his life,' Stroud wrote. Struggle: Ford told Stroud that he could not forgive him for what he had done as a young lawyer . Pain: After Stroud left, Ford was overcome with emotion and was comforted by his carers, pictured . 'The audacity of the state's effort to deny Mr. Ford any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of Louisiana justice is appalling.' Ford was accused of shooting Isadore Rozeman, a Shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom Mr Ford had done occasional yard work, in 1983 and was convicted the following year. He was sent to prison, where he lived with little light or heat, while Stroud, who had been with the Caddo District Attorney's office for two years, went out to celebrate by having drinks with his team. 'That's sick,' he said in his letter. 'I had been entrusted with the duty to seek the death of a fellow human being, a very solemn task that certainly did not warrant any ""celebration"".' From behind bars, Ford continued to protest his innocence. Then in 2013, State District Judge Ramona Emanuel voided the conviction and sentence based on an informant claiming that another man, Jake Robinson, had confessed to killing Rozeman. Regrets: A.M. 'Marty' Stroud III, pictured, wrote a lengthy apology letter to Ford last month that was published in a local newspaper. In the letter, he also slammed the state for refusing to pay the man compensation . Robinson, along with his brother Henry, had been eyed by investigators in relation to the killing but have never been charged in Rozeman's death. They have since been indicted in other murders. Wrongly accused: Ford, a father-of-four (pictured in a booking photo), was sent to death row in 1984 . 'My fault was that I was too passive,' Stroud said in his letter last month. 'Had I been more inquisitive, perhaps the evidence would have come to light years ago... 'I did not hide evidence, I simply did not seriously consider that sufficient information may have been out there that could have led to a different conclusion. And that omission is on me.' He added that the odds were stacked against Ford, whose attorneys were inexperienced in criminal law. Ford, who is black, also faced an all-white jury. 'I apologize to Glenn Ford for all the misery I have caused him and his family,' Stroud wrote. 'I apologize to the family of Mr. Rozeman for giving them the false hope of some closure.' Ford walked free from Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola on March 11, 2014, wearing a jean jacket, sweater and beanie hat and carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes. As he walked out of the prison gates, he said he was sad he had not been around to raise his now-adult sons, but added: 'It feels good; my mind is going in all kind of directions. It feels good.' Prison officials gave the then-64-year-old a debit card worth just $20. That, along with the money that he had in his bank account, left Mr Ford with a paltry $20.24 to his name. Freed: Ford is pictured in March 2014 as he was freed from the state prison following 30 years behind bars. He was given just $20 but was taken in by a non-profit group who found a free place for him to stay . Making the days count: Ford, pictured earlier this year, relies on Social Security disability and food stamps. He is suing the state for denying him medical care for his lung cancer, which is now terminal . His lawyers set up an Amazon wishlist for strangers to donate funds and items - from furniture to clothing - so Ford could start to re-build his life, and he continues to accept donations. With the help of a non-profit group, Resurrection After Exoneration, he had a place to live free of charge and has since moved to his own apartment. He relies on Social Security disability and food stamps, while volunteers help to take care of him. He has also visited California to see his four sons.

Ahead of the meeting with Stroud, he told Nightline he was shocked by Stroud's letter, but that he refused to get angry over his situation.

"BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead is facing calls to step down immediately as a director of HSBC over her links to the bank’s tax scandal. Mrs Fairhead, 53, has said she wants to stay for a least another year, but yesterday it emerged that two major investors and a leading shareholder group have voted to get rid of her. She has been under mounting pressure to quit both of her lucrative positions, at the BBC and the scandal-hit bank, after claims that HSBC’s Swiss operation helped wealthy clients hide billions from the taxman. Facing vote: Rona Fairhead is facing calls to step down immediately as a director of HSNC over her links to the bank's tax scandal . Last month she was criticised by MPs as ‘incredibly naïve or totally incompetent’ for her failure to pick up on the scandal. And last night it emerged that American investors Christian Brothers Investment Services and Trillium Asset Management, which manage more than £4.9billion of assets between them, have lodged their votes to get rid of Mrs Fairhead as a non-executive director on HSBC’s main board. One of the UK’s most powerful shareholder groups has also urged investors to vote against her re-election as an independent director at the bank’s annual general meeting next week. In a note to investors, the Pensions & Investment Research Consultants – which advises pension funds and other institutional investors managing £1.5trillion – said: ‘Ms Fairhead chaired the HSBC audit committee up until 2010, a period when the company’s Swiss arm was allegedly undertaking tax avoidance and evasion on behalf of clients. Scandal: There are claims that HSBC’s Swiss operation helped wealthy clients hide billions from the taxman . ‘Given the lack of control and oversight of this practice, it is considered that Ms Fairhead failed in her responsibility as a guardian of HSBC.’ But HSBC has told shareholders that Mrs Fairhead, who has been on the board of the embattled bank since 2004, has ‘agreed to stay on the board for a further one-year period’ – the maximum she can be voted in for. Non-executive directors at publicly listed companies must be elected on an annual basis, regardless of how long they intend to stay. A source said that both she and the bank would ‘assess’ whether she should stand for re-election in 2016 ‘closer to the time’. Public accounts committee chairman, Margaret Hodge, told Mrs Fairhead she should resign or be sacked by the Government as BBC Trust chairman . HSBC declined to comment. Last year Mrs Fairhead received more than £513,000 in fees and benefits for her work at the troubled bank, including a £334,000 fee as non-executive chairman of HSBC North America Holdings. PIRC said the huge pay package ‘could be considered to compromise her ability to scrutinise the bank’s activities independently’. Mrs Fairhead also earns £110,000-a-year for her three-day-a-week job as chairman of the BBC Trust, and a further £130,000 as a non-executive director of the fizzy drinks giant Pepsi. Many MPs expected her to resign from HSBC, especially after her bruising encounter with the Commons public accounts committee. Its chairman, Margaret Hodge, told her she should resign or be sacked by the Government as chairman of the BBC Trust, because she had done her job at HSBC so poorly. ‘Either you knew [about the tax evasion] or you didn’t know – and I think in that case that you are either incredibly naive or totally incompetent,’ she said. Mrs Fairhead told MPs that she had not been aware of any wrongdoing. She said she had relied on various committees and structures to flag up problems, and was ‘horrified’ when they later discovered what was happening.","Rona Fairhead is facing immediate calls to step down as director of HSBC .

"Comics at the BBC must go through a lengthy process to get some jokes on air because the Corporation is extra-wary about causing offence, an editor at the company has claimed. Chris Sussman, executive editor for comedy, revealed particular jokes have to go through 'quite a lot of layers' to be approved. Some jokes even have to be looked over by director general Lord Hall - alongside editorial policy advisers, the channel and legal advisers - before they are aired, he said. Comics at the BBC must go through a lengthy process to get jokes on air, including some being looked over by director general Lord Hall (left), an editor at the company claimed. It is because the Corporation is extra-wary about causing offence - like in the Sachsgate scandal involving Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross (right) The cautious attitude comes after a 'difficult few years', Mr Sussman added. Speaking at a Bafta event The Telegraph reported him saying: 'It's been a difficult few years and I think that is reflected internally in terms of the processes and procedures we go through when we’re making programmes. 'To get a certain joke on air, to get a joke approved, we have to go through quite a lot of layers. 'Sometimes we’ll run something past at script stage, if we’re unsure. Most of the time it’s about ""here’s the show, have a look at it"".' The strict rules come after a 'difficult few years' following the Sachsgate scandal, where Ross and Brand left lewd messages on Andrew Sachs' (left) voicemail, Mr Sussman added. Comedian Frankie Boyle (right) has previously criticised the BBC about its cautious attitude towards comedy . Mr Sussman joined the Corporation after Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand caused outrage by broadcasting a series of answer phone messages they left with Andrew Sachs. The messages included lewd comments about Brand's relationship with Sachs' granddaughter, Georgina Baillie. Comedian Frankie Boyle has previously criticised the BBC about its cautious attitude towards comedy. He called the Trust cowardly for the broadcaster’s lack of political comedy in 2010 shortly after leaving Mock The Week. In an open letter Boyle added that the BBC wanted to 'deliver the flavour of political comedy with none of the content'. John Lloyd,  producer of Blackadder and Not the Nine O'Clock News, added that comedy that is not funny could 'sink the corporation'.","Chris Sussman said particular jokes must go through 'a lot of layers'

"The Labour candidate in Britain's most marginal seat was last night accused of failing to tell voters that she met Vladimir Putin in Moscow two years ago when a controversial billion-dollar arms deal was signed. Tulip Siddiq, a former aide to Ed Miliband, and who is standing for Labour in Hampstead, was at the Kremlin with her aunt, the hardline leader of Bangladesh who is accused of human rights abuses. A smiling Ms Siddiq was photographed alongside Putin and Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and Ms Siddiq's mother Rehana. Labour candidate Tulip Siddiq (left) was last night accused of failing to tell voters that she met Vladimir Putin (right) in Moscow two years ago . But the Tories last night accused Ms Siddiq of trying to conceal her extraordinary links to Putin and Sheikh Hasina. They claimed she appears to have gone to great lengths to cover up her trip in January 2013 – just six months before she won a hotly-contested Labour selection contest in Hampstead – and her links with Hasina. The Tories also said she had deleted postings and photographs on her blog which showed how she campaigned to get her aunt re-elected. And they questioned why her 1,200-word official Labour profile made no mention of Putin, the arms deal or being a member of a ruling Bangladeshi dynasty. A Tory official said: 'It seems very odd that Ms Siddiq has appeared to try to conceal the most interesting parts of her political life.' Retiring Labour MP Glenda Jackson won Hampstead with a majority of just 42 in 2010. Last night a Labour spokesman said: 'Tulip is proud of her background and has always been very open about it.' As for the photograph, the spokesman said: 'Tulip was totally separate from any official delegation but was invited to an event with her family.'

"Whistleblower Julian Asssange has added insult to injury for Sony Pictures after his website Wikileaks put hundreds of thousands of emails and documents from last year's cyberattack into a searchable online archive. The calculated move by Assange to expose thousands of indiscreet and personal correspondences will likely spell fresh embarrassment for the embattled company so soon after they hoped the dust had settled on the matter. Assange and Wikileaks issued a statement on Thursday saying that the data has a public interest, but the majority of the correspondences run from the mundane to the deeply personal. They expose not just the unguarded opinions of Sony executives, but also reveal health concerns about their children and sadness over dying parents. Scroll down for video . Adding insult to injury: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange (pictured here speaking via video link at the Commonwealth Law Conference in Glasgow on Wednesday) has said that the information leaked belongs online because it shows the inner workings of an international company . Sticking the knife in: Julian Assange has defended collating the Sony hack into one searchable database saying that the entertainment giant has links to the Democratic party and the American 'military industrial complex' The data dump today comes after November's massive hack which has already cost the entertainment giant upwards of $100 million. Wikileaks claim they built a database from the 170,000 emails and 30,000 other documents stolen from Sony Pictures by a group calling itself Guardians of Peace. The group hacked Sony Pictures in retaliation for the Kim-Jong-un assassination film, The Interview, starring Seth Rogen. Assange's decision to put the data up in a searchable form could be seen as particularly cruel coming so soon after Sony had finished dealing with the fall-out from the damaging affair. A picture says 1000 words: Angelina Jolie stares down Amy Pascal at The Hollywood Reporter Women in Entertainment Power 100 Breakfast on December 10, 2014 - just days after leaked Sony emails between her and  Scott Rudin (right with Pascal) revealed Jolie to be described as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' Resignation: The embarrassing revelations exposed by the hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment led to CEO Amy Pascal (pictured with Aaron Sorkin) leaving the company . 'The cyber-attack on Sony Pictures was a malicious criminal act, and we strongly condemn the indexing of stolen employee and other private and privileged information on WikiLeaks,' a Sony spokesperson said in a statement to Variety. 'The attackers used the dissemination of stolen information to try to harm SPE and its employees, and now WikiLeaks regrettably is assisting them in that effort. ' In a statement, Assange said the documents deserve to be easily accessible. 'This archive shows the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation. It is newsworthy and at the centre of a geopolitical conflict. It belongs in the public domain. WikiLeaks will ensure it stays there.' Wikileaks also claim that the documents show Sony's close ties to the Democratic Party and its efforts to collect 'intelligence' on rival studios - including ironically, Oliver Stone's new film on NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden. 'The work publicly known from Sony is to produce entertainment,' Wikileaks wrote in their statement issued on Thursday. 'However, the Sony Archives show that behind the scenes this is an influential corporation, with ties to the White House, with an ability to impact laws and policies, and with connections to the US military-industrial complex.' The WikiLeaks site lets users find emails, documents or an entire cache of files through searches using keywords, people who sent or received emails and types of files. The site made a name for itself in 2010 when it began publishing diplomatic cables leaked by Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Bradley Manning. Cause of the woes: The Interview, a comedy about two journalists - James Franco and Seth Rogen - was widely seen as the reason why Sony was attacked by cyber-hackers affiliated with North Korea . Assange is currently battling a detention order in Sweden, where he is wanted by prosecutors in an investigation of alleged sex crimes. He has avoided being extradited to Sweden by taking shelter in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012. Sony Pictures blasted WikiLeaks for creating the archive, saying the website was helping the hackers disseminate stolen information. 'We vehemently disagree with WikiLeaks' assertion that this material belongs in the public domain,' the company said in a statement. The searchable online archive is the latest blow for the entertainment and technology company struggling to get past the attack, which the company estimates caused millions in damage. Sony Pictures' troubles began last December after it suffered an extensive hacking attack and release of confidential emails ahead of its release of 'The Interview,' a comedy that centers around the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Canceled: Following the cyber hack, Sony Pictures pulled The Interview from general release and ended up releasing the movie online only . Guardians of the Peace took credit for the attack and threatened terror attacks if the film was not pulled from theaters. The company at first shelved the film, but it subsequently opened in a limited release. U.S. intelligence officials said the group was linked to North Korea, but no official link has been made. The attack exposed tens of thousands of sensitive documents, including studio financial records, employment files and emails between Sony executives. Some emails revealed exchanges between Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures' co-chair Amy Pascal that contained a frank assessment of Angelina Jolie's talent and racially offensive jokes about President Barack Obama's presumed taste in movies. Indeed, an email from studio executive Clint Culpepper labeled comedian Kevin Hart a 'whore' and producer Scott Rudin called Angelina Jolie, a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. The scandal led to the resignation of  Pascal. 'The content of my emails to Scott were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am,' Pascal wrote in a public apology. 'Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.' Recent hit: Amy Pascal with the stars of Sony comedy, The Wedding Ringer, from left, Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, Josh Gad and Kevin Hart at the premiere in LA on January 6 . The company announced in February that Pascal would transition to a job as the head of a new production venture at the studio. Rudin also published an apology, saying: 'I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive — and not funny at all. To anybody I've offended, I'm profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused.' Wikileaks claim they have found correspondence which exposes Sony's political fundraising and lobbying for anti-piracy. They point to emails which detail how members of the studio set up a 'collective' to get around campaign donation limits and made contributions to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Wikileaks justified their move by pointing to lobbying issues they have found in the leaks. 'Sony is a member of the MPAA and a strong lobbyist on issues around internet policy, piracy, trade agreements and copyright issues,' their press release claimed. 'The emails show the back and forth on lobbying and political efforts, not only with the MPAA but with politicians directly.'","WikiLeaks uploads hundreds of thousands of emails and documents into a searchable online archive .

"Billionaire Paul Allen has created a new company that will launch satellites and people into space from the world's biggest plane. The Microsoft co-founder this week unveiled 'Vulcan Aerospace', which will look after the space programs of Stratolaunch Systems. This includes an ambitious project to launch spacecraft and probes into orbit from of a huge carrier aircraft with a wingspan of 385ft (117 metres). Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder this week unveiled 'Vulcan Aerospace', which will look after the space programs of Stratolaunch Systems. This includes an ambitious project to launch spacecraft and probes into orbit from of a huge carrier aircraft with a wingspan of 385ft (117 metres) The plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude, avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from Earth. This will then go into orbit as normal and deliver a satellite. Initially, the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs (6,124 kg) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles (180 km and 2000 km) above Earth. Allen's vision is to create a giant air pad in the sky, allowing payloads to reach space faster and at a lower cost than existing technologies. The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft will be powered by six 747-class engines, is currently being assembled at Mojave, California. Initially, the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs (6,124 kg) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles (180 km and 2000 km) above Earth. The plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude, avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from Earth. The company will 'shift how the world conceptualises space travel through cost reduction and on‐demand access,' according to Vulcan Aerospace president Chuck Beames who made a presentation in Colorado Springs this week. The Stratolaunch Systems project was inspired by SpaceShipOne which won the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004 for becoming the first privately funded manned vehicle to reach space. 'Stratolaunch's ability to launch from variable locations will enable satellites and humans to be efficiently inserted into their most optimal orbit at a time of the customer's choosing,' Beames wrote. The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft's 385 feet (117 metres) wingspan compares to 320 feet for H-4 Hercules and 225 feet for Boeing 747-8 . Earlier this year, the world received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane that will serve as an airborne launch pad for putting satellites - and eventually people - into orbit. Picture is its twin fuselage sections . 'Launching far away from populated areas (i.e. middle of the ocean) also significantly reduces public safety risk. The Stratolaunch carrier plane is on track to make its first test flight in 2016, according to Space.com. The rocket is being developed by Orbital ATK, and the designs uses solid-fuel lower stages and an upper stage powered by RL-10 engines. But according to SpaceNews, Beames indicated that the company is also looking at other launch vehicle options. Wingspan: 385 feet (117 metres) Engines: Six 747-class engines . Fuselage length: 238 feet (72 metres) Weight: 1,200,000 lb (544,311 kg) Maximum speed: 460 knots, 530 mph (850 km/h) Maiden launch: Flight testing will begin in 2016. The first launch of the space launch vehicle is likely to take place in 2018. Satellite delivery:  Initially, the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs (6,124 kg) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles (180 km and 2000 km) above Earth. Launch sites: Several sites are under consideration, including Kennedy Space Center, Wallops Island and Vandenberg AFB. An animation of the moment the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft delivers a rocket high into Earth's atmosphere before it goes into orbit . Each of the twin fuselages of the the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft is 238 feet long and, when complete, will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels . 'What we really want to do is focus on a lower-cost propulsion system that is evolvable in some fashion,' he said. 'We're still looking at Orbital as a potential option,' he said. 'We're widening our aperture to see if this is the right path forward.' Stratolaunch could someday support several launch vehicles, he said. As a result, Stratolaunch said it is temporarily halting work on a crewed vehicle that would launch on the Orbital ATK booster. That company added that it is deferring work on a crewed vehicle that would launch on the Orbital ATK booster to focus more heavily on getting the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft off the ground. In February. the world received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane. Its 385 feet (117 metres) wingspan compares to 320 feet for the Hughes H-4 Hercules and 225 feet for the Boeing 747-8. Pictured is one of its twin fuslage sections . Rare stills taken from footage shot for a recent news story by KGET 17, a Bakersfield TV station, show its huge size, according to a report by Guy Norris in Aviation Week. Hours after unveiling its next-generation 'Vulcan' rocket this week,  United Launch Alliance (ULA), ran into its first problem - the rocket's name. 'Vulcan is a trademark of Vulcan Inc. and we have informed ULA of our trademark rights,' Chuck Beames, president of the Paul Allen-backed Vulcan Aerospace, told Reuters. 'Paul Allen and Vulcan were early leaders within space exploration with the launch of SpaceShipOne more than a decade ago. We are flattered by ULA's tribute to our legacy by naming their new rocket 'Vulcan',' Beames said. ULA, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co, selected Vulcan as the name of its new booster, which will be developed in phases beginning in 2019, after it won more than 1 million votes in a crowdsourcing initiative. 'We have done our due diligence regarding the legal right to use the name Vulcan,' ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye wrote in an email. 'ULA is committed to taking every reasonable step to avoid any confusion with other entities using this name and we are confident we can do so,' she said. The images show one of the two twin fuselage sections under assembly. In the news report, Scaled Composites president Kevin Mickey says the company has so far built 'roughly 200,000lbs of composite structure' for the vehicle. Instead of a satellite, the Stratolaunch airplane could launch a Dream Chaser spaceship, which would be outfitted with an as-yet-unspecified upper-stage rocket motor. 'Dream Chaser seemed to be the logical way to go,' Stratolaunch Executive Director Charles Beames said in October. The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft's 385 feet (117 metres) wingspan compares to 320 feet for the Hughes H-4 Hercules and 225 feet for the Boeing 747-8. Each of the twin fuselages of the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft is 238 feet long and, when complete, will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels.

"With Pearl Lowe and Gavin Rossdale for parents, there's no denying that Daisy Lowe is rock and roll royalty. The genetically-blessed model proves she's a chip off the old block in an edgy new beauty shoot for Rodial. Wearing a leather jacket and skinny black jeans, Daisy smoulders in the new shoot to promote the beauty house's contouring range. Daisy Lowe, 26, is the ultimate rock chick as she rocks leather and heavy eye make-up in her new beauty shoot for Rodial . The 26-year-old was chosen by the brand last year thanks to her 'modern, cool and quintessentially British edge.' So how does she achieve that flawless look? FEMAIL caught up with the young star to discover her style and beauty secrets. 'It's a fail safe range,' says Daisy. 'You just have to learn where to place the contouring. My top tip is: suck in your cheeks and make a fish face, which casts a natural shadow on your face. 'Then apply the bronzer over that shadow and then pop the highlighter above that.' Daisy, who has been working as a model for years, shows off her flawless skin and razor-sharp cheekbones in the new shoot to promote the brand's contouring range . Daisy was chosen by the brand last year thanks to her 'modern, cool and quintessentially British edge' After years on the modelling circuit, Daisy says the top tip she's picked up is using concealer around her nose to even the skin tone. 'Oh, and make your forehead and chin a lighter shade than the rest of your face for a more defined look,' she said. As well as starring in beauty campaigns, Daisy has been busy partying at Coachella festival with her famous friends. The IT girl was spotted representing the British talent at the Soho Desert House Coachella party in the company of stars like Zoe Kravitz and Katy Perry. The supermodel, who counts the likes of Alexa Chung and Cara Delevingne as her best friends, even created a lipstick for the beauty giant . Daisy poses on set with the brand's president, Maria Hatzistefanis, who met the model at the Rodial Beautiful Awards, where she was named Woman Of The Year . The English rose had her porcelain skin on show in the floor-sweeping number, catching some of the LA rays at the riviera spot. Gushing about her picturesque weekend in the sunshine, Daisy wrote on Instagram: 'Oh stop it Palm Springs- you are just too much for my eyes to handle' alongside a picture of the palm trees.

"A meat trader who swindled cash through a mortgage fraud scam to pay for luxury holidays was ordered to pay back £500,000 today. Grant Allen, 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled first class around the world with his girlfriend Gaynor Godwin and bought a holiday home on the Costa Del Sol, Spain, using criminally gained money. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing £30,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth £7,600. Grant Allen (left), 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled round the world with his girlfriend, Gaynor Godwin (right) using money from a mortgage fraud scam. Edward Byatt (behind Allen, left) was also involved in the fraud . Allen also splurged £8,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World. The Old Bailey heard that he hid the fraud by buying and trading properties and funnelling large amounts of cash through his unwitting girlfriend's bank account. The couple lived in a £700,000 home in Rayne, Essex - where £33,000 was spent on landscaping the garden - and also owned a property in Hertfordshire, bought with the proceeds of the fraud. When the home in Essex was raided in 2011, detectives found large piles of cash including £1,000 which was stashed in the extractor fan in the kitchen. Judge Stephen Kramer QC today ordered Allen to pay back £491,000 as the proceeds of crime. Allen, who was jailed for six years for mortgage fraud and money laundering, could face another three years behind bars if he fails to pay the money back. Allen splurged £8,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World . However, the court heard he has assets including homes in Essex, Bishop Stortford, and southern Spain which he can sell to cover the repayment. A second defendant, Edward Byatt, 39, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was ordered to pay back £10,000 for his part in the fraud. His name was on the deeds for the home in Rayne, despite Allen living there with Ms Godwin and their young son. ‘Grant Allen used other people in the laundering process. He is somehow involved in criminal behaviour,’ prosecutor Charles Evans told the trial in 2013. ‘The money would have been criminal proceeds.’ During his trial, Allen claimed he worked as a meat trader and a builder, and suggested his funds had come from successful gambling ventures. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing £30,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth £7,600 . Mr Evans told the jury: ‘Grant Allen and Gaynor Godwin lived an enviable lifestyle and travelled to Dubai and America, sometimes travelling first class and staying in luxury hotels.’ Godwin was cleared by the jury of conspiracy to remove criminal property after telling them she had no idea where Allen had got the large sums of money. But Allen and Byatt were both convicted after trial and were both in court to hear the order being made. The judge will consider on Thursday whether to impose on Allen a strict financial reporting order which would force him to present the authorities with regular documents showing his use of money.","Grant Allen, 38, spent £30,000 holidaying with girlfriend Gaynor Godwin .

"Jason Cotterill sent revenge porn to his jilted lover's daughter and threatened to post a sex video on the mother's Facebook page . A mother whose jilted lover sent revenge porn to her 18-year-old daughter has spoken of the 'absolute nightmare' her life became as he bombarded her with abusive messages. Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with messages over the internet, even threatening to post a sex video of her on her Facebook page. The terrified woman said her life became a living 'hell' when Cotterill, who was jailed last week, sent an explicit photo of her to her own daughter. 'It got so bad I considered suicide,' the mother said. 'If it hadn't have been for some great friends I would have gone through with it.' 'It wasn't nice for my daughter. It was my past - years ago. My kids didn't need to know about that. 'I was trying to move on with my life. It's part of my life I want to totally erase. 'I know I'm not blameless because I shouldn't have slept with him. It was a stupid, stupid thing to do, it was a drunken thing. But it made my life an absolute nightmare.' Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant, saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she 'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook accounts in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. The victim said: 'My life was made hell. I became depressed, anxious and scared to leave the house. Cotterill was jailed for 12 weeks and ordered to not contact woman again following a trial at Birmingham Magistrates' Court (pictured) 'He didn't know where I lived but I thought ""What if he finds out?"" It got me worried to go out, I was constantly looking over my shoulder. I became very depressed, and the fact that he was sending pictures to my daughter was the final straw. 'It was just constant. There was no let-up. He kept sending messages. Some people said ""Oh it's only messages"", but it consumes your life. 'They say you should delete your Facebook account but it's a way of keeping in touch with my friends and family, especially friends I don't get to see. I blocked him but each time he set up new profiles to get past it... There was no way he was going to stop.' She reported Cotterill to Facebook but the social media site did not take any action, the victim claims. Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with messages over the internet, including threatening to post a sex video of her on her Facebook page . Eventually the woman told the police about the messages, ending the abuse, but the court case was yet another ordeal. She gave evidence from behind a screen that was just a few yards away from Cotterill, who smirked as she spoke. 'I thought if I didn't go to court he could carry on doing it, so I got the courage from somewhere,' she said. 'I'm happy I did, but it was difficult. This has been going on since August 2013 so it's nice to be believed. 'It feels like a weight's been lifted and hopefully this will be the end of it.' 'I'm happy the police arrested him and brought him to justice. I hope this sends the message out that you can't do this kind of thing. 'I have no idea how I got through it. There was a point where I was going to give in until a very, very good friend of mine said ""You cannot let this man do this to you anymore"". She was very concerned about my health, my mental stability. 'The Government has made this sort of thing a criminal offence, and that is a good thing. 'But I think about young children and teenagers who are going through a similar nightmare, and it sickens me. There are people out there who are not strong enough to deal with it.' Cotterill, from Oldbury, West Midlands, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim. District Judge David Robinson said: 'You harassed the complainant over a three-month period and used social networks constantly in a threatening manner to get her to re-engage with you. 'There are a number of aggravating features in this case. 'You sought to use dozens of Facebook profiles to get in touch with her, you also found a link to a pornographic site and made use of that. 'You either involved or threatened to involve others, sending the link to the woman's friends and her sister, insinuating that her children might get to see the photos. 'You used the power you had over her by the knowledge of those photos.'","Jason Cotterill bombarded his victim with abuse and threatening messages .

"Shocking images have been released showing the 'horrific' conditions inside a Gold Coast caravan park with a long and checkered history of drug abuse, violence, and abject poverty. The Mudgeeraba Caravan Village is home to more than 100 people, and has been the site of a fatal house fire, stabbings, brawls, and continual violence. Queensland Police patrol the site daily due the extreme level of incidents, and ambulance officers will now only enter the caravan park, which lies just ten kilometres from the region's famous Glitter Strip, under police protection. The Mudgeeraba Caravan Village is home to more than 100 people, and has been the site of a fatal house fire, stabbings, brawls, and continual violence . Senior Sergeant Mark Anderson, from the Mudgeeraba Police Station, said that officers considered that caravan park 'safe' before midday, but that 'once residents start on the drugs or alcohol, the situation deteriorates'. 'We try and get children out of there as quickly as we can. It’s easier for us to deal with ­incidents if there are no children around,' he told The Gold Coast Bulletin. The conditions of the caravan park has been labelled 'horrific' by authorities, with some of the sites, which include an old bus, tarpaulins, and run-down caravans, are left without running water. The owner of the caravan park, Bob Purcell, said that the discounted rent of between $90 and $200 he offered to residents attracted a certain type of person. ‘If you have cheap rent you’re going to get some sort of problem with those sort of people,' he told A Current Affair. Senior Sergeant Mark Anderson, from the Mudgeeraba Police Station said that police try to remove children . Residents of the caravan park have told of the horrific levels of violence in the Village . ‘We’ll get up to mischief here on occasions,' he said. In 2008, a man died in a caravan fire, and in 2010, a male resident of the caravan park was charged with the stabbing of another man at the Village, reported The Courier Mail. In March last year three residents, allegedly armed with knives and baseball bats, were hospitalised after a violent brawl broke out involving 20 men, reported The Gold Coast Bulletin. Residents of the caravan park said that one of the biggest problems in the park stemmed from drugs and alcohol abuse. One residents said that much of the violence had to do with 'who's paid and who hasn't paid'. ‘There’s blues all the time, and there’s no security at all,' he said. Residents of the caravan park said that one of the biggest problems in the park stemmed from drugs and alcohol abuse . Police are called to the caravan park frequently, and called the conditions of the park 'horrific' The same man admitted he had padlocks on his gate and front door just to ward away potential conflicts. Christian volunteers from Transformations Ministries visit the caravan park regularly, and offer food supplies as well as counselling services to the residents. Program co-ordinator Mark Farrugia said that the volunteers tried to show unconditional love and that the ministry offered drug and rehabilitation service. ‘This place provides a next step from the street. It is providing roofs over people’s heads,' Mr Farrugia said. ‘Where you find a low socio-economic area you find the issues of drugs and alcohol are involved, and particularly where the drug ice is involved it escalates people’s erratic actions.","The 'horrific' Mudgeeraba Caravan Village is home to over 100 people .

"A new collaborative robot (pictured) can work alongside human factory workers . Helpful robots are typically shown as mechanical maids or humanoid teachers in sci-fi films. But now there’s a new collaborative robot that can work alongside human factory workers to give them a helping hand. The Fanuc CR-35iA claims to be the first 'heavy-lifting industrial collaborative robot' to work with humans without the need for safety fences. The Coventry-based company Fanuc's robot uses integrated vision technology called iRVision to keep an eye on humans and automatically stops  if it touches an operator. This removes the need for safety fences - a previous requirement for all industrial robots - and is said to increase efficiency and enable a higher level of automation, the firm claims. The robot can lift objects weighing up to 77 lbs (35kg) and could be used in a number of industries, from warehouses to production lines. For example, it could move heavy objects or assemble parts within a shared workspace without safety fences. ‘Collaborative robot technology opens up a new era for manufacturing in which humans and robots will work even more closely on tasks; increasing productivity and efficiencies across the plant floor,’ said Chris Sumner, vice president of Fanuc. The machine is covered in a green soft plastic cover, which is designed to protect humans and stop them being ‘pinched’ in the event they are touched by the robotic arm. Of course, robots have been used on production lines for decades. In the car industry for instance, many are automated so robots perform the bulk of dangerous tasks, such as welding, away from humans. Amazon has already introduced robots to it vast warehouses to work along human employees. The Fanuc CR-35iA claims to be the first 'heavy-lifting industrial collaborative robot' to work with human employees without the need for safety fences. Images of plans are shown above . Robots have been used on production lines for decades. In the car industry for instance, many are automated so that robots perform the bulk of dangerous tasks, such as welding (pictured), away from humans . Some 15,000 robots pick up items ordered by customers in warehouses to save humans walking miles. The robot can lift up to 77 lbs (35kg). It's designed to work alongside humans without the need for safety fences. The robot stops what it's doing if it touches a human. This is down to integrated vision which lets it 'see' human employees. It has a protective green covering so it doesn't 'pinch' workers. It's designed to be as reliable as other robots on production lines and could be used in warehouses to lift heavy objects, for example. ‘We pick two to three times faster than we used to,’ 34-year-old Amazon worker Rejinaldo Rosales said during a short break from sorting merchandise into bins at Amazon's massive distribution centre in Tracy, California, about 60 miles east of San Francisco. ‘It's made the job a lot easier.’ The squat orange robots use technology acquired when the company bought robot-maker Kiva Systems in 2012, according to Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president for operations. The Tracy centre has 1.2 million square feet of space - the equivalent of 28 football fields – which are tended by 1,500 full-time employees and 3,000 Kiva robots, gliding swiftly and quietly around the warehouse. The robots navigate by scanning coded stickers on the floor, following digital commands that are beamed wirelessly from a central computer. Fanuc's robot can lift objects weighing up to 77 lbs (35kg) and could be used in a number of industries, from warehouses to production lines. This illustration shows it lifting a wheel into a car (left) and it moving a piece to a machine (pictured right) Each of the orange machines can slide under and then lift a stack of shelves that's four feet (1.2 metres) wide and holds up to 750 lbs (340kg) of merchandise. The system uses bar codes to track which items are on each shelf, so a robot can fetch the right shelves for each worker as orders come in. Workers are needed for more complex tasks such as shelving, packing and checking for damaged items and the robots adjust to their speed. Amazon has already introduced robots to it vast warehouses to work along human employees. A Kiva robot is shown moving goods (left) and another robot unloading them (right), which is placed in a safety cage . Amazon has launched a competition encouraging engineers to create its next generation of shelf-picking robots. Bots will battle it out at the ICRA conference in Seattle in May. 'The challenge combines object recognition, pose recognition, grasp planning, compliant manipulation, motion planning, task planning, task execution, and error detection and recovery,' Amazon said. Participating robots will earn points by locating products on shelves, retrieving them and putting them into cardboard boxes ready to be sent to customers. Points will be deducted for dropped or damaged good and the team that creates the winning robot will win $26,000 (£17,463). Amazon currently uses robots by Kiva Systems to fetch items so its human workforces doesn’t have to walk as far in its vast warehouses. But its machines can't pick and pack products yet.","The robot Fanuc CR-35iA was engineered by a company in Coventry .

Victorino Chua penned what he called a ‘bitter nurse confession’ in which he spelled out ‘how an angel can turn to an evil person’. In 13 pages of rambling, broken handwritten English, the Filipino nurse said he might ‘explode’ at any time, adding: ‘If I will be pushed, they gonna be sorry.’ Chua is accused of killing three patients by contaminating their saline drips with insulin and deliberately poisoning 18 others at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport between 2011 and 2012. His lawyers say the document – found in his home following his arrest – is not a criminal confession but an ‘outlet for his anger and frustration’ written at the suggestion of a counsellor 12 months before the first alleged poisoning. But questioned by detectives after his arrest for changing patients’ prescriptions on the wards, the 49-year-old said: ‘Sometimes I snap’. Dependant on painkillers, sleeping tablets and antidepressants, Chua also wrote that he sometimes felt like killing himself, but feared he would ‘go straight to hell no questions asked’. As the prosecution in his trial at Manchester Crown Court drew to a close yesterday after nearly three months, the jury were read the entire document which was found in a kitchen drawer of his home in Stockport after he was arrested in January 2012. Chua sat impassively in the dock as jurors were told how over more than a dozen pages of sometimes hard-to-follow broken English written in scrawling capital letters, he recounts the story of his life, beginning: ‘My name is Victorino Domingo Chua.’ Document: Extracts from the 13-page note show that Chua wrote about 'a devil in me', going 'straight to hell' and being 'an evil person' making a 'bitter nurse confession' In the document, the father of two said he was writing ‘in case something happen to me (so) my family can continue my case or can tell somebody to look at it and work out how and (sic) angel turn to an evil person’. He added: ‘The bitter nurse confession. Got lots to tell but I just take it to my grave. My family will make history here in England.’ The jury has been told the ‘case’ refers to a complaint he had lodged against his local GP surgery after it mistakenly posted his confidential medical records to a different address. In a later addition to the document dated December 2010, Chua described how he could control the number of painkillers he took for back and knee pain when he was at home – but at work he ‘can’t help it to take more than the limit’. He added: ‘I’m just telling them I’m fine and alright just to shut there (sic) mouth. ‘Still inside of me I can feel the anger that any time it will explode ... just still hanging on ... can still control it but if I will be pushed they gonna be sorry.’ Earlier he wrote how he was avoiding going drinking with friends, adding: ‘They thought I’m a nice person but there (is) a devil in me.’ Deaths on the ward: (Left to right) Patients Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71 and Derek Weaver, 83 . Allegations: Chua is accused of killing three patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, pictured . The jury was also read sections of Chua’s police interviews during which he was asked about working on two wards where he is alleged to have murdered patients Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and 83-year-old Derek Weaver. He replies: ‘Sometimes I snap.’ Asked what he meant, Chua said he would tell colleagues to ‘leave me alone’ because if they distracted his work on the busy admissions unit he would be ‘back to square one again’. Chua said he normally did a 44-hour week with up to 12 hours’ overtime, doing the overnight shift so he could help his wife with their children during the day. In the document, Chua described his upbringing in the Philippines and how his life changed when his wealthy businessman father split from his mother. Once ‘the envy’ of relatives and neighbours, he and his siblings struggled to get by after the marriage breakdown. He described befriending wealthy students by buying them drugs or dealing for them, while earning extra money by doing odd jobs like washing cars. He lived with his grandmother, who he said pushed him into nursing even though ‘I don’t like it’. He had a difficult relationship with his father, he said, and when he saw him suffer a fatal heart attack in 1986 ‘I didn’t feel anything’. Chua described himself at that time as ‘a naughty boy, doing bad things’, taking medical gear from the Manila hospital where he worked and selling them to people who couldn’t afford treatment. ‘I’m evil, at the same time angel,’ he wrote. Eventually he lost his job and supported his new wife and their young daughter by buying and selling cars before applying to work in Britain in 2002. He started working at care homes in Warrington and Stockport, suffering a prolapsed disc hoisting a patient in 2003 which left him dependant on painkillers, a problem made worse when he later injured his knee falling in snow. After he started work at Stepping Hill Hospital in 2009 – which he said he ‘loved’ – Chua described his state of mind as ‘can’t sleep, paranoid and mental’ and said he would stay in his room all day. He hated noise and shopping trips, adding: ‘I see small things as a big problem.’ He wrote that he went to visit relatives in Japan and considered not returning, but decided to stay in England. Chua added that he sometimes wanted to ‘end my life’ but needed to be with his family, adding that ‘if I go, I go straight to hell no question ask(ed)’. Chua denies murder as well as 24 counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, eight of attempting to administer poison, one of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and one of administering poison. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Victorino Chua, 49, wrote 13-page document  describing his battle with depression and physical injury .

"A former Weber County court clerk has won a sexual harassment lawsuit against a former judge who wrote a love poem to her. A federal jury in Salt Lake City on Thursday awarded more than $270,000 to Marcia Eisenhour after finding that former Justice Court Judge Craig Storey violated her right to equal protection. The jury found Storey liable for some $240,000 of the damages and the county liable for the rest. Storey wrote in 2007, 'I'd love to harvest your sweet grapes,' and called Eisenhour the 'most gorgeous thing alive.' Storey was a judge for Weber County Justice Court from 1984 until 2010, when a new Ogden Justice Court (pictured) opened and took over the county's caseload . Utah's Standard Examiner reported that the 'semi-erotic love poem' was 11 pages long. Storey testified that he never intended for her to find or read the poem. Crucial to the case was a meeting Ms Eisenhour had with the Court Judge in July 2008 after she had seen the love note. Storey was said to have asked whether she was in a relationship and where she was going on holiday. For Ms Eisenhour this proved the 'last straw' as far as his possessiveness of her was concerned. Storey claimed his worries related to Ms Eisenhour's weight-loss, recent job performance and absences. He said he was going to have to change her work hours because of complaints from other court staff. Eisenhour said her absences were her attempts to avoid the judge. Storey was a judge for Weber County Justice Court from 1984 until 2010, when a new Ogden Justice Court opened and took over the county's caseload. Eisenhour was a court employee for over 25 years. Eisenhour's attorney April Hollingsworth said she suspected the case was not over, that Storey's and the county's lawyers have indicated they would be filing motions for a new trial.","Judge pays $240,000 damages after he wrote semi-erotic poem for clerk .

"Princess Beatrice has been seen at the Bahrain Grand Prix, her fourth holiday in a month (pictured at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix last November) After 11 holidays in under six months, you might have thought Princess Beatrice would be ready to put the brakes on her globetrotting. But yesterday the underemployed 26-year-old was spotted enjoying the high life in an overseas location yet again, this time at the Bahrain Grand Prix . She was in the Gulf state, ruled by a controversial king whose regime has been accused of violently repressing pro-democracy activists, with her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark, according to an onlooker who saw her among dignitaries on the starting grid before the race. ‘She was walking behind the Crown Prince of Bahrain. She was introduced to the recently abdicated King Carlos of Spain and curtseyed,’ the source said. ‘Bernie Ecclestone was leading that group of dignitaries.

"A Brazilian model who shot to fame after winning the Miss BumBum contest in 2014 has sparked outrage by posting a snap of her naked body painted with an image of the Virgin Mary to her Instagram account, along with a special Easter prayer. Indianara Carvalho, 23 - who had hymen surgery last year to 'restore' her virginity so she could enjoy her first time all over again with ‘someone special' - accompanied the racy photo with the phrase: 'Good Friday. Lord, on this day I ask for peace, love, wisdom and strength.' The image, just one of a series of nude body-painted shots she shared over the Easter weekend, attracted more than 750 'likes', as well as a tirade of disapproval from her followers over its sacrilegious nature. Scroll down for video . Sacrilegious? Indianara Carvalho, 23, accompanied the racy image (pictured) with the phrase, 'Good Friday. Lord, on this day I ask for peace, love, wisdom and strength' 'Don’t mix God with your ridiculous shame and profanity,' wrote one Instagram user, Eliane Paz Salinas, of the portraits, which were created by Brazilian artist Binho over a marathon ten-hour spray can session. Another, Cadmo Barrera Lerma, ranted: 'You have lost my total respect, at least one in your list of followers.' Janvier Veliz Angulo concurred, stating: 'This proves that beauty is not everything … you have lost me as one of your fans.' Referring to Miss Carvalho's accompanying prayer, another user fumed: 'I think that to ask for peace and love and protection there is no need to be naked!!!! Please respect things related to God!' Clutching a Rosary: The photo, just one of a series of nude body-painted shots she shared over the Easter weekend, attracted 750 'likes', as well as a tirade of disapproval from her followers . Faith: Miss Carvalho, pictured in other poses from the same shoot, had hymen surgery last year to 'restore' her virginity so she could enjoy her first time all over again with ‘someone special' Christianity is the dominant religion in Brazil, with Roman Catholics accounting for 64 per cent of the population and Protestants making up 22 per cent, according to the latest Census. Miss Carvalho's lengthy prayer also stated: 'Father, protect my ears from all evils and watch my steps on the path to truth. 'May your blessings fill my spirit and my heart, which is so kind and cheerful... Feel your sweet and gentle presence... I am your grace.' The buxom blonde triumphed in Brazil's annual bottom beauty contest last year, which sees 27 women - one from each state - complete to prove their backside is best. Shortly afterwards, she underwent 'vaginal rejuvenation surgery' which includes a hymenoplasty, in order to bring 'respect' to her BumBum title, and to use her newly virginal status to find love. Christianity is the dominant religion in Brazil, with Roman Catholics accounting for 64 per cent of the population and Protestants making up 22 per cent, according to the latest Census . Miss Carvalho, pictured mid-workout, said last year that by re-becoming a virgin, she hopes to bring 'a bit of respect and new concept to the Miss BumBum title' The procedure, which is not available in the UK, can be done by using surgical gel to create a new hymen that lasts a few days before dissolving, or more permanently by using a flap of skin cut from the vaginal wall. Women undergoing the latter treatment must abstain from sex for at least three months after undergoing the procedure. According to the New York Daily News, Miss Carvalho said: 'I wanted to undergo surgery to reconstruct my virginity before I have new photographs done. 'I wouldn't feel good about appearing naked if I wasn't exactly as I came into the world if you know what I mean. 'I think I also want to give a bit of respect and new concept to the Miss BumBum title by being a virgin.'

"Famed for phenomenal cuisine, majestic rural landscapes and vibrant cities, Vietnam offers an undisputed sensory overload. But there's one sight the becomes most engrained in the memories of even the most seasoned traveller - the wacky things people carry on the back of a motorbike or scooter. Lee Thompson's seen plenty in his 14 years as an award-winning photojournalist covering the civil war in Libya, the revolution in Egypt, the tsunami in Japan and other extensive travels before he co-founded The Flash Pack, a small group flashpacking tour company. But even he repeatedly marvels at what the men and women of southeast Asia can balance and transport on just a scooter or a beaten up old motorcycle, and on one of his company's Vietnam & Cambodia tours with a group of nine this month he was compelled to capture some of the finest. There's seemingly no measure to what can be packed onto the back of a bike or scooter in southeast Asia . The Flash Pack's Lee Thompson captured this man with scores of live chickens in weaved baskets this month in Sapa, Vietnam . That's one way to pop a wheelie! A man pulls a packed trailer from a loading dock at the Mekong river crossing in Vietnam with a motorbike . In this series of images from a single 14-day trip, he photographs a man casually puffing on a cigarette and carrying what looks like more than 20 live chickens in woven cages perched on the back of his scooter in Sapa, Vietnam. At a Mekong river crossing in Vietnam he is there to watch a motorcyclist dragging a massive trailer out of a boat loading dock on a bike, with the load so heavy he continuously pops wheelies, all the while not in the slightest bit bothered his two wheels have become one. Thompson enjoys the fact that what looks quirky to a Brit is simply every day life for the locals. In Vietnam alone there are more than 37 million motorbikes or scooters, most definitely the vehicle of choice in traffic that would make western country's peak hours look tame. 'Unlike other tour companies we venture in to remote parts of Sapa where it's not unusual to see bikes carrying livestock like chickens, pigs and goats - it makes really great photographs but it's just a way of life for the locals,' said Thompson. In Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, all that's needed to move some large piles of chairs is two wheels and some clever  packing . Getting around on two wheels is a way of life in Vietnam where there are more than 37 million motorbikes (and only a few million cars) 'I watched as one of the bikers tried to work out how he would carry eight goats on his bike, he fell three times before he finally got going and the goats didn't seem to happy about it!' A family of five and a smiling group of four adults pile onto scooters to get from A to B while another transport a giant pile of chairs stacked on a tray from one side of the city to the other with the power of just his humble two-wheeler. With limited resources comes innovation, as is evident with one mother who has attached a cane high chair to the front of her vehicle to make it more comfortable for her to transport her toddler around town in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 'Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh are full of bikes and it makes the morning commute in London seem easy,' Thompson said. 'Even though most of our group was very well travelled the amount of bikes on the road still comes as a shock in these amazing countries - it's crazy!' A mother fits a high chair is onto the front of a scooter for her toddler in this shot captured in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam . A bike that's seen better days carrying pigs is not an unusual sight on the road to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, says Thompson . A family drive is a cosy affair for this five-some packed onto a scooter  in Hanoi . The man on the back of this scooter in Hanoi, Vietnam, holds a ladder and some building materials as they weave their way through traffic . Thompson says the eight goats in the cage on the back on this bike 'didn't seem happy' as the rider tipped them over three times . The commute in Vietnam makes the daily battle on the Tube that Londoners endure look easy, but they don't seem to mind . The morning commute in Ho Chi Minh City is certainly less stuffy than piling into the Tube on a Monday morning . And here are some more unique uses for scooters... An assortment of exotic fish are in bags and ready for sale, cleverly attached to this man's scooter, in Hạ Long Bay, Vietnam . A basket vendor balances an array of products on the back of this small motorised bike in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam .

"Claudia Martin, 33, has been convicted of suffocating her newborn baby daughter . A mother-of-five today avoided jail for suffocating her newborn baby daughter by stuffing toilet paper down her throat and hiding the infant's body in a suitcase. Claudia Martins, 33, wept as she walked free after a judge accepted she had a 'momentary abnormality of mental functioning' which she no longer suffered from. A court heard she was suffering from a condition known as a 'pathological denial of pregnancy' which continued after giving birth to a baby girl. Until that point she had managed to keep her pregnancy secret from her family and gave birth to the child in the bath before killing her. She 'intended' to dispose of the tragic baby's body unnoticed, wrapping it in a plastic bag and towels, but was prevented from doing so when paramedics arrived and whisked her off to hospital. Earlier that evening she had complained to her family of a bad back but an ambulance was called when it was noticed she had wrapped herself in blood-soaked towels. Before she left her sister's home in Knowle, Bristol, on September 12 last year, she was seen rearranging items in a suitcase and placed items on top. Three days later, her sister, Vilma, complained of a smell coming from Martins' bedroom and traced it to the suitcase, Bristol Crown Court heard. When she opened it she found towels soaked in blood and the body of a baby girl, which was between 35 and 36 weeks gestation. Martins was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Mr Justice Teare, sentencing Martins at Winchester Crown Court, Hampshire, to a two year community order with supervision requirements, described her actions as 'wholly out of character'. He said: 'On September 12 last year you gave birth to a baby girl and very shortly afterwards you killed that baby by inserting tissue paper in her mouth. A court heard Claudia Martins (pictured) was suffering from a condition known as a 'pathological denial of pregnancy' 'Immediately thereafter you hid the baby in a suitcase and it was not discovered for three days. 'The explanation for your conduct is you were suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which substantially impaired your judgement. 'This arose from a medical condition known as a pathological denial of pregnancy which continued despite the obvious presence of a baby. 'The giving of birth didn't bring the denial to an end and you continued to deny the pregnancy to your family, friends and medical personnel. 'It was a great shock to you and induced in you a state of panic. 'Your actions of killing the baby were a manifestation of your irrational condition and your actions were wholly out of character.' He added that her friends provided glowing references of her childcare qualities which were in 'stark contrast' to her actions on September 12 last year. Martins (pictured) was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility . He continued: 'Quite why you developed a pathological denial of pregnancy is unclear but it's likely to be you living with the pressures of living with two children in cramped conditions without a partner in a foreign country and unable to speak English without any prospect of a job.' The family of Martins, who is originally from Mozambique but a Portuguese national, will arrange accommodation for her supervision, the court heard. The conditions of the order mean she must report to her probation officer on a regular basis to help her rehabilitation into society. When she killed her baby daughter she was living at the shared property in Knowle with eight other people including her sister. However, she can no longer live with her sister because social services will take her four children away into care if they live under the same roof. During the trial Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, told how Martins concealed her pregnancy from her friends and family and denied giving birth altogether, saying she simply had a period. Martins avoided jail and was sentenced to a two year community order with supervision requirements when she appeared at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) He said: 'She placed the body of the baby in a suitcase, hidden from anyone. 'No doubt, we suggest she intended to dispose of it but was prevented from doing so by the arrival of the paramedics, who took her off to hospital.' Following the discovery of the baby's body police were called and officers arrested Martins on September 15, the day after she was discharged from hospital. In police interviews on September 17 she claimed she was in the bath because her back and legs hurt when the baby suddenly came out. She said she caught the baby but it wasn't crying or moving. However, Dr Russell Delaney carried out a post mortem examination on September 17 and could not find any evidence that the baby was stillborn. He added he believed that the wad of tissue paper, made up of around five pieces, was deliberately inserted, a court heard. Mr Vaitilingam added: 'It is also Dr Delaney's view that the obstruction of the baby's airways by this object would have caused its death if the baby had been born alive.' In mitigation, Christopher Quinlan QC said: 'Here we have a vulnerable defendant being held in custody and in my respectful submission she should not be there. 'Given the circumstances of this case and the jury's finding the court could impose a sentence that results in her immediate release.' Martins has already served eight months in custody following her arrest in September last year which Mr Justice Teare took into account when sentencing. Speaking after the verdict, Senior Investigating Officer Det Insp Neil Meade said: 'The death of a baby is always a tragedy but the unique circumstances make this a particularly emotive case for everyone involved. 'Our thoughts are very much with the victim's wider family as they are struggling to comprehend how and why this tragedy happened.'","Claudia Martins convicted of the manslaughter of her newborn baby girl .

"Kurt Ludwigsen is facing 94 sex-related charges . A women's college softball coach who was fired from his job at a Christian school in New York  last month has been arrested and charged with nearly 100 sex-related offenses. Kurt Ludwigsen, 43, is accused of kissing,  harassing and touching 13 of his players during his time at Nyack College. He is facing 44 counts of forcible touching of another's sexual parts, 49 counts of harassment involving unwanted physical contact and one count of sexual abuse. Ludwigsen was hired by the school in September and police were told he started behaving inappropriately towards his players in October, the Journal News reported. South Nyack-Grand View Police Chief Brent Newbury said: 'The parents thought something inappropriate was going on with the coach. 'This is something we don't normally expect to see at Nyack College, or any college, but specifically Nyack College because of its missionary background. 'While we're fortunate nothing really really serious happened, this is bad enough.' Ludwigsen, who has children aged 15 and 12, lives with his family in Ridgewood, New Jersey. This would have been his first season as coach. Ludwigsen, 43, is accused of kissing, harassing and touching 13 of his players during his time at Nyack College . After Ludwigsen was hired, Nyack's athletics director said the school's softball program was 'in good hands' After the University of Arizona graduate was hired to coach the Lady Warriors, Nyack athletics director Keith Davie said: 'We are very excited to add Kurt to the athletics staff of Nyack College. 'The softball program is in good hands and we are excited about the direction that Coach Ludwigsen will be going. 'The Lady Warriors softball program will become a solid competitor in the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference in a very short time.'

"Great-grandmother: Gloria Ross, 84, died following a stroke in hospital – after she was ignored by nurses for more than an hour, her distraught family say . A great-grandmother died following a stroke in hospital – after she was ignored by nurses for more than an hour, her distraught family say. Gloria Ross, 84, who spent 30 years in the National Health Service as a nurse, was found with a distorted face when she was visited by her grandson Wayne Wilkins, 25. But when he asked nurses at Whipps Cross Hospital, North East London, for help, they said Mrs Ross was ‘just tired’ – and told him the senior nurse was ‘on a break’. Mr Wilkins called his mother, Mrs Ross’ daughter Maxine, 49, who rushed to the hospital and pleaded with nurses to step in. It was not until an hour had passed that Mrs Ross was finally assessed by a doctor, who realised she had suffered a stroke and arranged for her to be taken to a stroke unit at Royal London Hospital. However, she never regained full consciousness and died two weeks later. Crucially, her oxygen levels were not checked until she was seen by the ambulance crew – 90 minutes after Mr Wilkins raised the alarm. They were found to be at a level where brain damage can set in. Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs Whipps Cross and was put into special measures last month over a series of failings, has begun an investigation into the treatment of Mrs Ross. The nurses’ alleged inaction occurred despite the NHS’s own campaign – launched six years ago – that uses the acronym FAST, standing for Face, Arms, Speech, Time. People are told to call 999 ‘immediately’ if a suspected victim’s face has fallen on one side, they cannot raise their arms or if their speech is slurred. Describing her mother’s appearance after the stroke, Miss Ross said: ‘Although she opened her eyes, she could not communicate and became agitated with pain, so was on morphine. It was awful watching her like that. ‘There were at least four nurses on the ward at Whipps Cross but they didn’t do anything until I hit the roof. ‘My mother gave her working life to the NHS. Although she has shown early signs of dementia, she was still very much with it, still very quick apart from memory loss sometimes. Inquiry: Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs Whipps Cross (above) and was put into special measures last month over a series of failings, has begun an investigation into the treatment of Mrs Ross . ‘What was killing me was wondering how long my mother had been there before Wayne saw her. She still recognised us when I got to Whipps Cross so she must have been wondering why nobody was coming to help her. I want other people to be aware of what happened and for the hospital to make sure it never happens again.’ Mrs Ross, a widow with four grandchildren and a great-grandchild, was being looked after by her daughter at home but was admitted to Whipps Cross after developing a urinary infection. She suffered the stroke on Sunday, March 22 and died in the Royal London on April 2. Her case comes after Barts Health Trust was put into special measures by the Care Quality Commission watchdog last month due to a catalogue of failings at Whipps Cross. A Barts Health NHS Trust spokesman said: ‘We are extremely concerned to learn of the issues raised by the family of Mrs Ross. We will be conducting an investigation.’","Gloria Ross was found with a distorted face when grandson visited her .

"A 90-year-old man loved by his community has been found with his hands tied behind his back and beaten to death in his own home. Police say Earl Arthur Olander who lived alone in a home in rural Minnesota, was discovered covered in cuts and bruises and his home had been ransacked. They have now offered a $1,000 reward for any information which could lead to an arrest, while neighbors have spoken of him as a 'stand-up person' and a wonderful role model.

'You never heard a swear word out of his mouth,' he added. 'We considered him a surrogate grandfather for our kids. He was a great example for the kids.' Police went to investigate the property about 7pm on Saturday after being contacted by a neighbour, who had been asked to check on Mr Olander by a relative who was concerned they were unable to reach him by phone. Carver County Sheriff's Office said the exact and manner of death had not yet been established - but they believe there was more than one killer involved. Mr OIander was a lifelong bachelor, and many locals marveled at his ability to work his 160 acre farm despite his age.

"Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's top lawyer, admitted it has been ‘inexcusably slow’ in tackling online trolls . Twitter's top lawyer has admitted it has been ‘inexcusably slow’ in tackling online trolls who make the lives of others a misery. Vijaya Gadde said the social network had let internet abuse go ‘unchecked’ because it did not recognise the scope and scale of the problem. Miss Gadde said Twitter had tripled the size of the team that deals with online abuse – because it had to do better. She made the announcement on the day a study found that 88 per cent of abusive behaviour on social media happens on Twitter. Anti-bullying campaigners have also long complained that Twitter is a sanctuary for trolls who post hateful abuse behind the veil of anonymity. In an article for the Washington Post, Miss Gadde said that running Twitter required constant vigilance but that the company had ‘failed to live up to’ this aim. She admitted that ‘our response times have been inexcusably slow and the substance of our responses too meagre’. Miss Gadde wrote: ‘This is, to put it mildly, not good enough. ‘Freedom of expression means little as our underlying philosophy if we continue to allow voices to be silenced because they are afraid to speak up. We need to do a better job combating abuse without chilling or silencing speech’. Miss Gadde, general counsel for Twitter, said the extra staff the company had hired meant it was responding to five times as many complaints about abuse. The company was also making other changes ‘in ways that won’t be readily apparent’ to ensure its 284million users worldwide are safe.

"An Afghan woman who was forced to marry her rapist and have his baby has revealed how she gave up all of her hopes and dreams to 'buy' her daughter's future. Known only by the name Gulnaz, the Kabul-based woman was only 16-years-old when she fell pregnant with the child of her depraved attacker Asadullah - who is also married to her cousin. Even though a rape led to her pregnancy, Gulnaz's brothers insisted she would not be allowed to return to her 'shamed' family as she was unmarried and a Kabul court sentenced her to two years in prison for 'adultery by force', later increased to 12 years following an appeal. The only hope of a reduced sentence was to marry Asadullah, which she did in early 2013. Now she is pregnant with his third child but insists she only agreed to marry her rapist so that her first daughter - named Smile - could live a shame-free life in the Afghan capital's 'traditional' society. Just over two years after Gulnaz married Asadullah, the couple agreed to a joint interview with CNN's Nick Paton Walsh. Victim: Known only by the name Gulnaz (left), the  woman was only 16-years-old when she fell pregnant with Smile (centre) - the child of her rapist  Asadullah (right) Agonising decision: Gulnaz said that she had married the man who had attacked her because she didn't want to ruin her daughter's life . Gulnaz said that her decision to marry the rapist was purely based on the fact her daughter, Smile, would have been unable to live a normal life in the Afghan capital without a father. Tragic: Gulnaz said that her decision to marry the rapist enabled Smile to live a normal life . 'I didn't want to ruin the life of my daughter or leave myself helpless so I agreed to marry him,' she said. 'We are traditional people. When we get a bad name, we prefer death to living with that name in society,' Gulnaz added, reportedly refusing to look her husband in the eye during the interview. Asadullah - who was jailed for the rape but subsequently had sentence reduced - appears totally remorseless about his crime. He insists that by agreeing to marry her, he actually 'rescued' Gulnaz. 'If I hadn't married her according to our traditions, she couldn't have lived back in society,' he said. 'Her brothers didn't want to accept her back. Now, she doesn't have any of those problems,' he added. Asadullah is still married to his first wife - Gulnaz's first cousin - with whom he has five children. In total seven children and three adults  live in the family house. Gulnaz was found guilty of 'adultery by force' following the brutal attack in 2008. When the case came to court Gulnaz was sentenced to two years in jail, which was later increased to 12 years on appeal. A first release offer, which she eventually agreed to, stipulated she must marry her attacker. However her sentence was then cut to three years after a third appeal, and, according to reports at the time, the requirement for her to marry the man, who himself was jailed for seven years, was dropped. Gulnaz gave birth to her daughter in the Badam Bagh women's jail in Kabul before then President Hamid Karzai took the highly unusual step of freeing her with no pre-conditions in December 2011. Released from prison, Gulnaz faced a life of isolation and poverty as mothers without husbands are shunned by their communities and their own families and become social outcasts. Although there was no longer a legal obligation for her to so, Gulnaz later approached the rapist's family to arrange the terms of marriage and give Smile the best chance of a normal life.

"Dozens of public servants were less than humoured when they were told their jobs would be lost in a cruel April Fools' Day prank. The Canberra based Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade workers were given an 'announcement' on a big TV screen that their workplace was being closed and moved to Melbourne.

The Canberra based Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade workers were met with this 'announcement' on a big TV screen . The message was displayed for five hours before one of the centre's supervisors told workers that it was an April Fools' Day prank.

The main role of the employees involved in the parnk is to ensure passport applicants meet the requirements in a process known as 'ELLO'.

"The surviving daughters of a mother who has been imprisoned for strangling six of her children to death moments after they were born are standing by their murderous mom. Megan Huntsman, 40, is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to killing the six newborns, then stashing their bodies in the garage of her home in Pleasant Grove, Utah. A judge today handed Huntsman six sentences of five years to life - but family members rallied round her even as her 'cold and calculated' crimes were recounted to the court. Scroll down for video . Prison: Megan Huntsman, 40, was today given six terms of five years to life in prison after admitting the murders. Three will run consecutively, which means she will spend at least 15 years in prison - and likely much longer. She is pictured today in court . Grisly: Investigators are shown above searching Huntsman's garage, where a total of seven baby corpses were found in cardboard boxes. One of the children was stillborn - Huntsman strangled the rest . Huntsman, a meth addict, told police that she started killing off her children when she got pregnant because her drug problem meant she couldn't care for them. Local reports from the courtroom told how Hunstman's attorney took to the stand and read out letters from two of her daughters, who were born before her addiction began. The letters drew a stark contrast between the loving mother they say they knew, and the type of woman who would kill her own flesh and blood on six different occasions. Her mother, Joyce Huntsman, was reportedly in court - and took the stand to tearfully defend her daughter despite the heinous crimes. Discovery: Hunstman, left, was arrested after her estranged husband Darren West, right, found the bodies in her garage. West, who previously served time in prison, is not considered a suspect in their deaths . Scene: Her estranged husband found one of the babies' bodies while cleaning out the garage at her Pleasent Grove, Utah home, pictured, in April last year . She told the court that the woman who committed the crimes was 'not my Megan'. According to the KSL local news station, a detective recounted Huntsman's cold and deliberate method of execution. Unwitting: West, pictured after the sentencing, is thought not have known nothing about the murders . The officer said Huntsman told she would take the babies in her hands when they were just minutes old. Then, he said, she would press on their necks with her thumbs until they choked to death. She would then put their tiny bodies in . Ultimately the corpses of seven babies were found - one of which was determined to have been stillborn. The crimes were uncovered by Huntsman's husband Darren West - now estranged - who called police when he found the first body. The births and murders are said to have taken place from 1996 to 2006. According to stunned neighbors when she was arrested, Huntsman was 'perpetually slim' and they would never have suspected she was pregnant. The sentences handed down to Huntsman today were the maximum possible for her crimes. Three of them will be served consecutively - meaning she will spend a minimum of 15 years inside, and likely much longer. The sentence brings closure to a case that sent shockwaves through the quiet, mostly Mormon community where Huntsman stored the tiny bodies for more than a decade. The small city of Pleasant Grove is south of Salt Lake City.","Megan Huntsman, 40, pleaded guilty to the six murders in February .

"Like super-models, they follow a strict daily diet — in their case, three carrots, an apple and a few cabbage leaves — to keep in shape for their public appearances. Over recent months, they have been feted across the globe and pampered wherever they go. One is even going to have a song written about his life. But when I meet Darius — the biggest rabbit on earth — and his similarly sized son, there is little evidence of diva behaviour. Former Playboy model Annette Edwards holds her world record Continental Giant rabbit Darius aloft . Five-year-old Darius is 4ft long and weighs just under 3st — the king of the Continental Giant breed. He is the size of an average eight-year-old child. Slightly wary, I join him on the floor of his owner's home in the Worcestershire village of Stoulton and find he is a thoroughly gentle soul. He sits quietly, as I stroke his ultra-soft, grey fur, and examine his outsized ears and paws. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record — and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff. Aged only one, Jeff is already 3ft 8in long and weighs 2st. With a rabbit's peak weight and length kicking in at the age of two, Jeff has got some way to go. 'He's going to get bigger,' says their owner, Annette Edwards. 'His length is amazing. I think he might well take Darius's record.' Annette, a former Playboy model (not a Bunny Girl, it must be noted!), is a genius at giant rabbit-breeding. She has held the record for the world's biggest rabbit, with different animals, since 2008. It would be no surprise if Jeff took the title off his dad: after all, Darius took it from his own mother, Alice. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record — and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff . Annette, who has owned 100 bunnies over the past ten years, says the art of giant rabbit-breeding is simple. 'It's the same as humans,' she says. 'Some breeders make the mistake of only having one big parent. Both parents have got to be big. Jeff's mum, Sally, is 3ft 5in long. She's one of mine, too.' The crucial thing is that rabbits from the same family shouldn't interbreed. 'You mustn't,' Annette stresses. 'You end up with all sorts of illnesses, and overgrown teeth.' Unsurprisingly, nutritious food is at the heart of giant rabbit- breeding, and Annette admits that Darius is 'very greedy'. As well as those daily carrots, apples and cabbage leaves, her brood have a bale of fresh hay a week between them. But, even with these hearty appetites, rabbit-breeding is a cheap hobby: £10 a week in grub for both bunnies. And medical care isn't expensive, either. 'They don't need much looking after,' Annette says. 'Only vaccinations against myxomatosis, and solutions to get rid of fly eggs.' Certainly, Darius — recently given a clean bill of health by vets — seems to be in very good condition, as well as being intensely relaxed. It's only when I boldly try to pick him up — it's like lifting a hefty toddler — that he struggles a bit. Apparently, he's a little shy of strangers but very affectionate once you get to know him. 'Darius has more experience with people,' says Annette. 'But he's a little slower. He plods around and follows me more. Jeff follows in his footsteps but he's more energetic because he's younger.' Annette is currently single but insists that sharing her home with giant rabbits hasn't affected her love life. 'No one has ever minded them,' she says, 'I'd only be with someone who likes animals.' She is clearly devoted to the rabbits and looks after them with great attention. 'A lot of giants only live until the age of five. But mine live to eight to ten.' On the sad day that they die, Annette's beloved bunnies are buried in the garden under a rose tree. This devotion to animals began in her childhood. 'I was an only child brought up by my grandmother,' says Annette, who herself is a grandmother of 14 and a mother of ten. 'I had a couple of rabbits as pets. I adored them — they were my little friends.' Giant genes: Jeff and his giant father Darius - who currently holds the record for being the world's largest rabbit . Annette had to put rabbits to one side when she embarked on a modelling career. She was Miss Birmingham at the age of 29, as well as the Face of Nivea and a Page 3 Girl. She still models — 'mostly magazine work' — and, three years ago, at the age of 60, she was the Sun's oldest ever Page 3 Girl. Her work took her around the world, including New York, where she appeared as a model in Playboy magazine. As her children started to grow up, Annette returned to her love of rabbits. A friend put her in touch with a rabbit dealer in Holland, where the Continental Giant comes from. In 2004, she bought Amy and Roberto — they were unrelated, so she could breed them. 'My family were a bit shocked — they thought they were the size of dogs! But I loved that they were so big, so gentle and loving — and very different.' At that stage, Annette had no intention of going for any records. But, after an article on her rabbits appeared in the local paper, she was asked if she had considered applying to the Guinness Book of Records. Like all world records, measurement had to be precise to the last millimetre and gram. To judge their body length, they had to be laid out and measured from front paw to back paw, with legs fully extended. And so it was, in 2008, that Annette learned that 3ft 3in long Amy was a world record holder. Annette has held the record for owner of the world's biggest rabbit ever since. Not surprisingly in this age of bizarre hobbies and record-collecting, there's keen competition — and Darius is insured 'for a lot of money'. Is his title under threat? Annette says: 'No one's come close so far.' Of course, I bet you are asking yourself whether what they say about the rampant breeding habits of rabbits is actually true. Well, the answer is: yes. Rabbits, giant or otherwise — left to their own devices — can produce 60 young a year. Competition: Darius the rabbit measures 4ft 4in long while 3ft 8in Jeff still has six months of growing to do . 'That's cruel — it would kill the mothers in the end,' says Annette. 'So I keep them to two litters a year, each of around four or five rabbits. 'It's important to keep them relaxed. When it's warm outside, they like to lie under a tree in the garden. But in cold weather I keep them indoors [in large dog crates] — although it's the damp you should be more worried about — it gets into their bones.' Annette says her rabbits are easy to have about her home. They roam around the kitchen, garden and a small barn. They don't have access to the rest of the house, although she sometimes takes them into the sitting room, wrapped in a blanket. The rabbits cost £500 a time for personal appearances and have regularly appeared on television — including the Paul O'Grady Show. A musician has asked if he can write a song in Darius's honour, and their record-breaking has featured in news bulletins all over the world. Still, the Kardashians of the rabbit world have kept their cool, and not given in to any of the wicked temptations of global celebrity. Whether Darius retains his title or his son succeeds him, you just know that there will be no bad blood between the two most famous rabbits in the universe.","Annette Edwards has owned more than 100 bunnies in the past 10 years .

"It's a skill more often seen performed by  US Navy squadron the Blue Angels or the British Red Arrows. But in this incredible video, one passenger captured the moment two passenger aircraft landed perfectly in sync at San Francisco International Airport. As the two planes exit the cloud and approach the runway, this quick-witted passenger realised his seat was the perfect spot to video the respective landings. The two planes begin their descent simultaneously at San Francisco Airport . In astonishing video captured by a passenger on one of the planes, both aircrafts' wheels touch the tarmac at the same time . What resulted was the planes, one an American Airlines, landing at the same time on adjacent runways. As well as the two measuring their approach almost identically, the wheels touch the tarmac simultaneously. Richard Toomer, from the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), told MailOnline Travel: 'What we’re seeing here is ‘Closely Spaced Parallel Runway operations’ in practice – a safe and normal procedure at airports around the world. 'San Francisco has two pairs of parallel runways, separated by just 750 feet. Other airports such as Atlanta and Sydney have similar runway configurations and operations. The two planes come through the clouds to begin their similar descent to the ground . 'Although pilots are used to this type of approach, it does result in a very interesting view out of the window for passengers.' Plane landings are seen by many as a work of art in themselves for many tourists and enthusiasts alike. Probably the most famous, and incredible, is the landings of passenger planes on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin. On board it was silent, which helped the person videoing maintain their concentration to film the scene . Approaching Princess Juliana International Airport, aircraft come astonishingly close to those relaxing on Maho Beach that makes for terrific footage. Maho Beach is located on the Dutch side of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, in the territory of Sint Maarten. Aircraft are forced to land so close to the beach so as to touch down near the start of the short Runway 10, which is 2,300 metres in length. As a result the area is popular with plane spotters and many of the surrounding bars and restaurants on the beach display airline departure and arrival timetables. The plane landings at Saint Martin's Princess Juliana International Airport have become legendary worldwide .","Video shows the planes approaching the runway at the same speed .

A deputy is seen swabbing what appears to be blood from the door of Hazeltine's squad car . Champagne says at around 9.15am, the shooter pulled up to a convenience store , got out of his 2014 Chevy Silverado pickup and opened fire on Hazeltine, who was hit in the face, elbow and eye. One of the bullets reportedly penetrated his lung. Another bullet lodged behind his eye, and the 36-year-old law enforcement officer may be at risk of losing his sight. Hazeltine is believed to have returned fire, but it was unclear whether Paul Devillier was wounded. Champagne says Hazeltine was in stable but guarded condition at Interim LSU Hospital Thursday afternoon. Two nearby schools, R.J. Vial Elementary and J.B. Martin Middle School, were briefly placed on lockdown after the shooting. Devillier had two weapons on him at the time of his arrest. Police say he does not have a criminal record but they suspect he suffers from mental health issues. Road rage: Devillier allegedly got into a verbal spat with Hazeltine because the deputy refused to stop traffic and allow his 2014 chevy Silverado (pictured) to make a turn . Worried for their comrade: Authorities walk outside LSU Interim Hospital, where Hazeltine was listed in guarded but stable condition . Burt Hazeltine was alert as he was being transported to the hospital, and according to Sheriff Champagne, he even cracked a joke in the ambulance about his ordeal, reported NOLA.com. Despite his severe injuries, the sheriff said a nurse attending to Hazeltine told him he 'got lucky.' During a press conference Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Champagne revealed that before the shooting, Devillier got into a verbal spat with Hazeltine because the deputy refused to stop traffic and allow him to make a left turn onto Louisiana Avenue, reported Fox 8. According to officials, Devillier then went to his father's home and called the sheriff's office, claiming to be an NCIS agent and demanding to speak to Sheriff Champagne. He then drove back to the Time Saver convenience store and called over Cpl Hazeltine, who was still directing traffic. When the deputy approached Devillier’s truck, he spotted a gun on the dashboard, pulled his service weapon and demanded the drive show his hands. Survivor: Hazeltine, pictured left with his wife, Mandy, was in stable but guarded condition at Interim LSU Hospital. There is a concern he may go blind in one eye . Happy family: Hazeltine and his wife have been married for nearly 14 years and have two sons and two daughters together (pictured) Career officer: The 36-year-old has been on the force for about 15 years, most recently serving in the traffic division . That is when investigators say the 56-year-old opened fire on Hazeltine. Little is known about the suspect at this time, but sheriff's officials said he was fired from TSA in 2013 and got a divorce that same year. Burt Hazeltine has been on the force about 15 years, serving in the traffic division. The deputy and his wife of nearly 14 years, Mandy, have two sons and two daughters. Those who know the couple described them to The Advocate as devout Christians who are very active in their community.","Cpl.

"An 11-year-old retired K-9 officer took his last ride in a squad car in a heartwarming farewell held by fellow officers and residents celebrating his time on the force. Zeus, a German Shepherd, was honored in a grand procession in Connecticut on Wednesday before he was put down because of a severe degenerative hip disorder and declining health. The tribute for the police dog, who worked with the Ridgefield Police Department for eight years as a K-9 officer, began around 4.45pm and ended at the Ridgefield Veterinary Hospital. Scroll down for video . Zeus (pictured above), an 11-year-old retired K-9 officer was honored in a special tribute on Wednesday by the Ridgefield Police Department . The German Shepherd, who served eight years in the force, took his last ride in a cop patrol car during the grand procession held earlier this week (Zeus pictured with Officer Shawn Murray, his former partner and carer after he retired) On Wednesday, ahead of the procession, the police department wrote an emotional message about Zeus on their Facebook. 'Today is the day we have to say goodbye to our beloved K-9 Zeus,' they wrote. 'It is an extremely emotional day for all of us. 'He was a fellow officer and friend. He will be deeply missed but never forgotten. Our thoughts and prayers are with Zeus, Officer Murray and his family during this difficult time.' During the grand procession, residents of Ridgefield lined the streets as they watched the cop cars drive by through the streets of the town. Zeus had the special tribute before he was put down because of a severe degenerative hip disorder and declining health (Zeus pictured during the procession on Wednesday) Officers from the department and police departments across the state came to pay their tributes . Zeus was being taken to Ridgefield Veterinary Clinic (above) where he was to be euthanized . The vehicles traveled from the police headquarter and ended at the veterinary hospital. Residents held signs reading 'Thank you Zeus' and 'Zeus our hero during the afternoon. A flag was waved at half staff next to a draped black cloth at the department as Officer Shawn Murray, Zeus's former partner, pushed him in a cart during the tribute. 'This is an honor to be here for him during his last moments,' Chief John Roche told WTNH. 'The disease that had racked him had deteriorated to such a point where it was just so difficult for him to exist and continue on.' A flag was waved at half staff next to a draped black cloth at the department (pictured above) Chief John Roche (above) said during the tribute: 'This is an honor to be here for him during his last moments' In his eight-year career with the force, Zeus assisted with more than 250 narcotics arrest and also helped officers track down 50 missing or wanted individuals. The largest amount of narcotics he was responsible for seizing was ten pounds of marijuana in 2006, when he joined the force and was partnered with Officer  Murray who he continued to reside with after his retirement. The animal had to retire last May due to health issues, and for some losing Zeus is not only losing a coworker, but also a family member. 'He was in the yard when there were picnics,' Detective Scott Murray, Officer Murray's brother told WTNH. 'He played, he chased the ball, he did what all normal dogs do, what all normal family dogs do, except he had a job.' Following the special tribute, the police department wrote their final goodbye to Zeus. On Wednesday, the police department wrote an emotional goodbye to Zeus thanking him for keeping them safe . The police department said it was an honor to work beside Zeus. During his eight-year career with the force, the dog assisted with over 250 narcotics arrests (his badge pictured right) Ridgefield Police Department officers said: 'You will be dearly missed but never forgotten' 'Zeus, it is with tears in our eyes that we must say goodbye,' they wrote. 'You were a valued member of our team and only did great things. 'It was an honor to work beside you and knowing that you were there always helped put our minds at ease. 'We know you would not have hesitated to lay down your life for any of us if we were ever faced with a life threatening situation. You wore the Ridgefield Police badge with Respect, Pride and Dignity. 'Thank you for keeping us all safe over the years. You will be dearly missed but never forgotten.

"A dozen or more metal implements are arranged in neat rows on the table next to the bed. They look like something Frankenstein might have had applied to his monster's neck. I begin to feel nervous. What on earth have I got myself into? The pristine white room adds to the feeling that I'm about to undergo major surgery. But I'm not. I'm here to try the wackiest face treatment to hit the beauty scene: the tuning fork facial. Offered at the upmarket Hale Clinic in London and other clinics nationwide, the scary sounding tuning forks are pieces of metal that make different pitched sounds when struck and made to vibrate. Tuned in: Marianne is given the tuning fork treatment . When they are placed on specific parts of the face - the neck, the jowls, forehead and around the eyes - vibrations are said to tighten sagging skin, eradicate dark circles, lessen the appearance of wrinkles and stimulate collagen. The results mean that your face looks younger, brighter and more toned. Some say it's the non-jab equivalent of Botox. The treatment comes from the U.S. - where else? Advocates claim the 'sound waves of the forks vibrate and travel deeply into the body along energy pathways, affecting human physiology and reaching places not easily accessed'. So far, so New Age gibberish. There seems to be no scientific proof that tuning forks can make you look younger, prettier or more rested. It sounds nutty - the kind of thing practised by people who like panpipes and hemp seeds. The UK beauty industry employs more a million people and is worth £17 bn . I prefer my facials to involve peels, not strange pieces of metal. But while I may be sceptical, I am also, at 37, willing to try anything. Over the past few years, frown lines have begun to appear on my forehead, and my face appears increasingly pale, puffy and bloated. I explain all this to therapist Samara Reid, who's sympathetic. 'What's wonderful about these facials is they improve the appearance of the skin, but also treat the cause of the problem,' she says. 'If you're pale, you probably have poor circulation. The forks can boost blood flow, which will give you a healthier colour.' Samara has been a facial acupuncturist for 20 years, but she has started using the forks on their own and in conjunction with needles. 'I can see my jawline for the first time in a while, and my skin looks plumper and pink, rather than white' The therapies work on the same principle of Chinese acupuncture, which follows the idea that our body's energy - or 'Qi' - flows through 12 main channels called meridians. If this flow is interrupted, it can cause ill health and affect our appearance, causing premature ageing, dry skin and eye bags. Inserting needles or vibrating tuning fork on these trigger points supposedly restores the flow of energy, improving fine lines and circulation, leading to a clearer, rejuvenated complexion. Samara uses them together for a more powerful effect, but for the needle-phobic the forks can be used on their own. Certain forks are designed for different parts of the face and the body - there are dozens of them, with names such as 'Sun', 'Earth' and 'New Moon'. The physical vibrations have an effect on the body, while the sound from the forks is simultaneously soothing. Samara pings one of the forks and puts it up to my ear. The sound is magical, like a xylophone from outer space. She asks me to get on the bed and remove my socks. She explains she will tap my feet with the forks and apply needles to 'bring the energy down for grounding' (whatever that means) before starting on the face and getting the energy flowing all around my body. Samara uses a 'Gold Ohm Unison' tuning fork. She strikes it against a hard disc strapped on her leg, which creates a vibration, before putting the base of the fork on various points on my feet. I can feel a gentle, deep vibration travel through my feet and halfway up my legs. It's a strange, tingly sensation, and builds as she places the fork on more points on my feet. Within two minutes I feel as if I'm floating. She then puts needles in between my toes to 'cleanse the system'. They don't hurt at all. Then she moves to my face. She feels around my jawline and says she can feel I have raised glands. She asks if I get a lot of sore throats, and I say yes. 'The vibration from the forks can help the lymph glands to drain, which will help bring down the swelling,' she says, adding that all she's doing is 'clearing blockages', which will help everything work better. Inserting needles or vibrating tuning fork on these trigger points supposedly restores the flow of energy, improving fine lines and circulation, leading to a clearer, rejuvenated complexion . Marinna finds the physical vibrations have an effect on the body, while the sound from the forks is simultaneously soothing . She also explains that she uses tuning forks to help tighten loose muscle around the jawline. As she puts the base of the 'Earth' fork around my jawline, the vibrations go deep into my head. It feels odd, but also rather lovely. She then puts the forks up to my ears and I hear a clear, deep, bell-like sound that feels as if it's cleaning my mind. All my normal chattering thoughts are gone for a moment. Samara, who is wafting around the room ethereally, as New Aged therapists are wont to do, explains in her soft, slow voice that different forks have different sounds, varying from deep and resonant to high-pitched. She says the 'New Moon' fork is good for wrinkles and crow's feet, because it relaxes the skin. But when she starts talking about how the sounds will 'bring me into alignment with the cycles and rhythms of the cosmos', it feels a step too far. She found the effect was less pronounced the following day - although she still looked better . I begin to feel it is all ridiculous. But then she moves up my face. Samara tells me I have deep lines between my nose and mouth and my cheeks are puffy. She asks if I get a lot of sinus problems. Again, I say yes. She's more thorough than some GPs I've seen. Samara presses the forks along the side of my nose, where the vibrations should help drain the sinuses, and then my eyes, where apparently they will help reduce dark circles. Finally, Samara comes to my forehead. She tells me I have a line forming between my eyebrows, known as the 'suspended sword', which can be caused by fear and concentration. 'Do you frown when you are concentrating?' she asks. I do. 'And do you find yourself feeling frightened quite often?' she asks. Yes! This woman is a mind-reader. And then we're done. It feels as if I've been lying there for a minute, but Samara tells me it's nearly an hour. I feel spaced out. I'm so relaxed it's hard to speak. Apparently, this is normal, the result of feel-good endorphins created when pressure points are stimulated. I'm pleasantly surprised - in the mirror, my face looks less like the Pilsbury Doughboy. I can see my jawline for the first time in a while, and my skin looks plumper and pink, rather than white. The next morning, I take a long, hard look at my face. The effect isn't as pronounced as the day before, but my skin looks smoother and I have more colour. Samara recommends 12 sessions, but most people see a difference after just three or four. At £90 for an hour, it's not cheap, but it's reminded me of a basic beauty truth: a glowing complexion isn't something to be obtained in an expensive cream - it comes from being healthy inside and out. Samara packs me off with some good advice: drink fresh ginger tea to boost my immune system and try to avoid dairy, which doesn't help if you're prone to congestion, coughs and colds. Maybe I am the hemp seed type after all. I have booked a second appointment. Samara REID, the Hale Clinic, London (020 7631 0156). Experts recommend 12 sessions. At £90 for an hour, it's not cheap .","Marianne Power tried the tuning fork facial at Hale Clinic in London .

"Ed Balls this morning repeatedly refused to match the Tories' election pledge to increase NHS spending by £8billion a year. The shadow chancellor said he would not make 'unfunded and uncosted commitments' after promising to cut the deficit every year. It comes after David Cameron pledged to give the NHS whatever it needed - but refused to say how he will find the money. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls this morning repeatedly refused to match the Tories' election pledge to increase NHS spending by £8billion a year . Speaking on the BBC this morning, ahead of Labour's manifesto launch in Manchester, Mr Balls insisted the party could be trusted to give the health service what it needed. But asked if he would give the NHS the £8billion a year budget boost demanded by its chief executive Simon Stevens, Mr Balls said: 'I won't promise £8billion of spending.' He said: 'We're not going to make unfunded and uncosted commitments. The Tories said at the weekend they'll find the £8billion. 'George Osborne was asked 18 times by Andrew Marr where money is coming from and he couldn't answer the question. That is what corrodes trust in politics.' Mr Balls added: 'I'll save the NHS but I'm not going to make promises until we can show where the money will come from – that's the irresponsible approach. It's actually become the George Osborne approach. 'We'll cut the deficit every year and the only promises we can make are promises where we can show where the money is going to come from. 'And clearly we need to make the economy stronger; we need the revenues to come in. I want, consistent with getting the deficit down, to do more for the NHS. 'But if I roll up and say '£8billion, I'm not going to tell you where the money is going to come from,' that would be irresponsible and that is what the Tories did this weekend.' David Cameron has pledged to increase spending by £8billion a year by 2020 - which Labour has refused to match . Pressed if Labour would deny the NHS the cash it needs, Mr Balls said: 'I said last year that we will do what it takes.' Mr Balls' remarks come as the Labour leader Ed Miiband prepares to unveil the party's manifesto in Manchester this morning. Mr Miliband will say he wants to be Prime Minister to build a 'fairer, more equal, more just country... that works for working people once again'. The manifesto will outline everything which a Labour government would do, from schools and hospitals, to crime, pensions, benefits and the environment. It includes a promise to cap energy prices, cut class sizes, offer more free childcare, increase the minimum wage, ban most zero-hours contracts, build more homes and find an extra £2.5billion for the NHS. It will rule out a rise in VAT, National Insurance or the basic rate of income tax. But it will also promise to cut spending of every government department apart from health and education, scrapping winter fuel payments for wealthy pensioners, capping rises in child benefit, a mansion tax on £2million homes, a levy on tobacco firms and an increase the top rate of tax to 50p. Explaining the party's commitments this morning, Mr Balls said: 'By the end of parliament we want to get the budget back into surplus or earlier if we can.'","Balls said he would not make 'unfunded and uncosted commitments'

"A woman who threatened to jump to her death off a New York City bridge was saved by a group of hero cops who spent more than two hours talking the woman out of jumping. The unidentified woman from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, was apparently distraught over her troubled marriage. She walked to the Kosciuszko Bridge from the Brooklyn side shortly before noon on Monday, climbed over a railing and stood on a section of metal piping barely wide enough to fit her feet. Scroll down for video . A woman walked on to New York City's Kosciuszko Bridge from the Brooklyn side on Monday just before noon, climbed over the railing and stood on a section of metal piping 125 feet above Newtown Creek . Police arrived on scene at about 11.50am and spent more than two hours talking to the woman and trying to calm her down . At about 2pm the woman agreed to be rescued and New York Police Department officers pulled her to safety over the railing . After she was pulled to safety by police officers, the woman was taken by ambulance to Elmhurst Hospital for observation . Emergency services were called to the scene at about 11.50am and two lanes of the Brooklyn-bound side of Kaosciusko Bridge as officers tried to keep the woman calm. Two NYPD patrol boats cruised 125 feet below the bridge on Newtown Creek, which connects Greenpoint to Maspeth, Queens, according to the New York Post. A witness said the woman is a 44-year-old Polish mother-of-one who was going through a tough divorce with her husband. 'I'm just glad [authorities] were able to talk her down,' said the witness, who did not want to be identified. 'She's just going through a difficult time and needs help.' A witness said the woman on the bridge was a 44-year-old mother-of-one from Poland. She reportedly was from Greenpoint, Brooklyn . She agreed to be rescued after police officers spoke to her about her daughter, and was lifted off the bridge 'so she could be with her', a police source said .

"Fiona Cullum provided a safe haven for Hassan Hussain and Yassin James after they gunned down innocent nursery teacher Sabrina Moss . A mother who sheltered the killers of an innocent nursery teacher and lied to the police has been spared jail. Fiona Cullum, 25, provided a safe haven for Hassan Hussain as he and fellow murderer Yassin James, 20, were hunted by police for gunning down Sabrina Moss in the street on a night out to celebrate her 24th birthday. Cullum then lied to officers when quizzed about Hussain after he was arrested in 2013 over the murder in Kilburn, north west London. The men sprayed bullets at mother-of-one Miss Moss and her friends as they took cover from the rain  outside a bar. Miss Moss' friend Sabrina Gachette, then 24, was lucky to survive after being blasted in the back with a sawn-off shotgun during the attack outside Woody Grill, in South Kilburn. The Old Bailey heard the shooting was part of an ongoing rivalry between two gangs. Hussain, 30, James and their getaway driver Martell Warren, 23, were last year jailed for a total of 111 years after they were convicted of murder and attempted murder. But Cullum, who sheltered Hussain and James 'hours after the murder' before telling officers she did not remember them being in her home, was today handed a suspended sentence by Judge Stephen Kramer QC. He sentenced her to 18 months imprisonment for harbouring Hussain and to 24 months for lying to police, but suspended the sentence for two years after highlighting her ‘exceptional’ personal mitigation, which included drink and drug problems. Cullum was also handed a two-year supervision order and ordered to carry out 50 hours of unpaid work. Miss Gachette, who punched the air when Cullum was found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice, walked out of court after hearing the sentence, as did Miss Moss' furious mother. The judge said those who help criminals to evade justice in serious cases ‘strike at the very heart of our justice system’. ‘What you did was serious and hindered the police investigation into the shooting,’ he told Cullum. Miss Moss was out celebrating her 24th birthday when she was shot dead in a street in Kilburn, north west London . The men (pictured on CCTV on the street before the attack) sprayed bullets at mother-of-one Miss Moss and her friends as they took cover from the rain outside a bar . ‘You hid behind a defence that you were so drunk or in drugs you could not recall the days in question and maintained in any event you did not see Hassan Hussain.’ But he added: ‘You have a sad background, drinking alcohol from the age of eight and taking drugs from the age of nine years old. ‘[According to the evidence] you were and are a vulnerable woman with more than your fair share of problems used by a dangerous and cruel man.’ Allowing her to walk free from court, the judge said: ‘I have taken an exceptional course with you. Go away and don’t come back again.’ Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said: ‘This case is not concerned with who was involved in the plan to seriously harm members of the South Kilburn gang, or the shooting of Sabrina Moss and others when that plan was carried through. ‘This case, rather, is concerned with events after that dreadful incident because in the period immediately following the murder, each of these defendants took steps to assist those responsible for the shooting to evade apprehension and to deny the police evidence relating to Warren in the form of the mobile phones he had been using in the run up to and during the period of the murder, and relating to the car he had been driving.’ ‘In the case of Fiona Cullum, she provided such assistance to Hussain and James by sheltering them in the hours after the murder when the police investigation on and around Kilburn High Road was at its most intense, and then lied to the police about them when she was spoken to shortly after Hussain and James were arrested.’ Hussain (left), James (right) and getaway driver Martell Warren were last year jailed for a total of 111 years . Hussain and James turn to run after the shooting, which killed Miss Moss and seriously injured her friend Sabrina Gachette . Cullum stood trial alongside Reid Daniel (left), 24, and Matthew Bouzemada (right), 22, who were both jailed for three years after they were convicted of assisting getaway driver Warren . She told police she did not remember speaking to Hussain and that he had not been at her address. Giving evidence in court Cullum claimed she was so ‘out of it’ on drink and drugs she had no idea Hassan was sheltering in her small north London flat. ‘It is at least a possibility that in this sort of state that Hussain entered... and stayed there for however long, entirely without her knowledge, while she was sleeping off the effects of the night before,’ her barrister Rebecca Randall said. But a jury found her guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice for sheltering Hassan and providing a false statement to police. She was acquitted of perverting the course of justice for sheltering James after the jury could not reach a verdict. Cullum stood trial alongside Reid Daniel, 24, and Matthew Bouzemada, 22, who were both jailed for three years after they were convicted of assisting getaway driver Warren. Bouzemada was also sentenced to an extra six months for breaching a suspended sentence for drug dealing.

"A 65-year-old schoolteacher is set to become the oldest woman ever to give birth to quadruplets. German Annegret Raunigk, already has 13 children, and her remarkable story will be featured in a TV documentary. Her latest pregnancy was the result of artificial insemination using both donated sperm and eggs. Scroll down for video . Annegret Raunigk, a primary school teacher from Berlin, will create medical history when she becomes the oldest mother of four in a single birth in the world . Ms Raunigk, who is in the 21st week of her pregnancy, said she was ‘shocked’ when an ultrasound scan showed she was carrying quadruplets. Her gynaecologist initially mentioned the possibility of a 'selective reduction', where one or more fetuses is aborted in a multi-fetal pregnancy, but she declined. But the English and Russian teacher, who is due to retire this year, said she decided to have the babies as she was ‘still quite fit’ and capable of looking after them. She added: ‘I don’t think I will have any problems.’ Ms Raunigk, from Berlin, previously made headlines in Germany when she had her daughter Leila at the age of 55. Baby fame: Ms Raunigk, then 55, hit the headlines in Germany ten years ago, when she gave birth to her youngest child, Leila (pictured in 2005) She told German media that she does not worry about what her future will look like in five years time, with a teenage daughter and the young quadruplets, as she assumes she will 'stay healthy' Her 13 children – the oldest of whom is 44 – are by five different fathers, and Ms Raunigk has seven grandchildren. She defended her decisions to get pregnant later in life, saying: ‘I think one needs to decide for oneself and not listen too much to the opinions of others.’ At present, the oldest woman to have given birth to quads is Merryl Fudel, who was 55 at the time.

You are the reason why I got out of bed in the morning and managed to put one foot in front of another.' Mrs Okines said she loved Hayley's 'sarcasm, dry sense of humour and stubbornness'. And she added: 'I can't imagine spending the rest of my life without you.' Mr Okines spoke of his 'very special girl' in a poem read out in church. He said: 'Hayley, if you can hear me, I love you so much.' A slideshow depicting some of Hayley's achievements and the people she had met throughout her short life were played on a big screen in church.

When she was 13 Hayley met her favourite popstar Justin Bieber (both pictured) - much to her delight . Hayley and her parents (pictured) when she appeared in a documentary about her illness . They included cherished images of the youngster on holidays, on outings, with friends and family, and with celebrities including Kylie Minogue, Frank Lampard, John Terry and Norman Wisdom. Father Michael read excerpts from Hayley's book, Old Before My Time, published when she was 14, before paying tribute to her 'courage' in an address. He said: 'She has touched the hearts and minds of many people, in the parish, in Sidley, the nation and internationally, too. 'We all of us one day will depart this life and will we have the same courage as this young lady to face the problems of life so head on? 'Not to wish away our problems but to deal with them to directly with strong determination.' Father Michael said Hayley's 'memory and legacy' would never be forgotten. There are 74 known cases of progeria around the world and Hayley was one of only four in the UK .

Hayley Okines' mother Kerruy leads friends and family as they arrive at All Saints Church in Bexhill-on-Sea . The hundreds of colourfully dressed mourners follow Hayley's coffin as it is taken away from the church . And he went on: 'Hayley's smile tells us that she lived an action-packed life. It is hard to keep up with all her adventures, as a 13-year-old girl she hugged Justin Bieber. 'She was a teenager with all the hopes and excitements of life. This is her memory, her legacy, to live for the day and to do so with courage.' Following prayers, Hayley's coffin was brought out of church to Don't Stop by 5 Seconds of Summer, before a private committal. Hayley and her family had fundraised for her medical treatment and to raise public understanding of the condition. Hayley became well-known three years ago when she was part of a documentary about her premature ageing condition. She suffered from the rare disease progeria which ages the body at eight times the normal rate. Progeria takes its name from the Greek word 'proeros', meaning prematurely old. It involves a mutant protein called progerin that accelerates physical ageing. There are around 74 known cases of the disease around the world and only four in the UK. 10 year old progeria child will have the appearance of an octogenarian with symptoms including baldness, arthritis and heart problems, but the mind of a 10 year old. Progeria patients normally die from heart attacks or strokes at an average age of 13. But Hayley, from Bexhill, East Sussex, defied the odds to live four more years and even published an autobiography about living with the disease. Her story was catapulted into the limelight after she starred in documentaries called The Girl who is Older than Her Mother and World's Oldest Teenager: Extraordinary People. Her autobiography, called Old Before my Time, detailed pop-star crushes and a dislike of school. But it was also a moving insight into how a child copes with a disease which resulted in Hayley having the body of a 105-year-old. In an interview with The Sunday People in 2013, her mother described the hell of living with the disease. 'The most difficult part is Hayley has the mind of a normal 13-year-old girl locked in an old person's body,' she said. 'Someone else has to get her a drink as she's too small to reach taps by herself. 'And buying fashionable clothes is tough because she still wears clothes for a five-year-old. Hayley, who turned 17 on December 3, left school last summer. However, despite pioneering drug treatment in the US that gave her a new lease of life, she was unable to conquer the disease. Her health deteriorated and she contracted pneumonia, and died at home on April 2. Her death was announced on April 3 when her mother Kerry posted on Facebook: 'My baby girl has gone somewhere better. She took her last breath in my arms at 9.39pm x.' Hayley's parents have previously described the heartache her condition had caused. Her mother said: '[When she was born] she had fine blonde hair, blue eyes and her father and I were besotted with her. 'At 10 months she walked for the first time – we were so proud. 'The only concern was she was so petite and didn't appear to be growing. 'But as I'm only 5ft 4ins I tried to tell myself she simply took after me.' Hayley and her family fundraised for her medical treatment and to raise public understanding of the condition . At 13 months, Hayley still wore clothes for a three-month-old, so her mother took her to their GP. Tests revealed she had a rare gene mutation called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. Next came the devastating news that Hayley would only live until the age of 13. Determined to make the most of the time she had, the family embarked on giving Hayley amazing memories. Members of the local community raised thousands of pounds to pay for her to go to Disneyland in California. In her short life, Hayley went swimming with dolphins, travelled all over the world, met Prince Charles, Kylie Minogue and Justin Bieber and starred in several TV documentaries. Despite her terrible prognosis, the teenager remained upbeat. 'In many ways I feel I've been lucky. Because of this I've met more people and done more than many do in a lifetime,' she said.","Girl dubbed '100-year-old teenager' Hayley Okines died earlier this month .

"A photojournalist who grew up in an ultra orthodox Jewish home in Israel has revealed the intriguing rituals, ceremonies and customs performed by his community in a series of images. Yaakov Naumi’s fascinating photographs include a man lying in a grave to prolong life, a chicken being walked on a piece of string and men tying a rope to a bride and dancing around her. Naumi, 32, who was raised in the Israeli town of Bnei Brak and educated in an ultra orthodox school, admitted that some of the rituals, when viewed with the eyes of an outsider, ‘look strange’. Scroll down for video . A Jewish man lies in an open grave that's had a body removed from it in a ritual that he believes will help prolong his life . A strictly orthodox rabbi dances the 'mitzvah tantz' at the wedding of his grand-daughter in Bnei Brak. He's not allowed to touch the bride at any point . According to the Jewish holy Torah, it is prohibited to touch a woman to whom you are not married . A ceremony - known as a ‘tisch’ - to commemorate Jews being rescued from a genocidal act in ancient Persia . A Jewish woman walking a chicken with a piece of rope. She will then have swung the chicken over her head in a ritual to transfer her sins of the past year to the animal . Writing for Flash90.com, he said: ‘Over time I learned to step out of my perspective and look at them [rituals and customs] with different eyes, with the eyes of an outsider. Then, even the simplest ceremony looks strange. ‘But no doubt, I was born and raised haredi [ultra orthodox] which allows me to understand and follow external appearances and corresponding behaviours. ‘Over time I realised that when Western culture touches upon haredi culture, then the haredim appear to themselves as strange.’ Naumi trained as a photojournalist with the haredi press, Behadrey Haredim, and revealed that despite his ultra orthodox background, his work there meant he encountered rituals and traditions that he’d never seen before. Hundreds of orthodox Jews snaking around in a dance in Jerusalem to protest against a government proposal to make military service in the Haredi community compulsory . Dozens of hands reach for a baby in a ritual known as  ‘pidyon ha ben’. It's taking place in Bnei Brak and its purpose is to redeem the baby . Jewish men perform the Tashlich ritual, where they throw food into a body of water to cast out their sins . This ceremony is called the 'Redemption of the first born donkey' and sees a donkey and a sheep decorated in pearls . Thousands of orthodox Jews gathered at the funeral of Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv in Jerusalem . The wedding ceremony of Rabbi Shalom Rokach to Hana Batya Pener was attended by tens of thousands of orthodox Jews . The Israeli flag is burnt at the 'Lag Ba'Omer ritual which commemorates the death of the 2nd-century Jewish miracle worker Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai . He added: ‘My purpose with this series is not to show the haredi as odd, but instead to empower the essence of their rituals.’ One of the most striking images in the series is that of a rabbi dancing the ‘mitzvah tantz’ at a wedding. The ritual sees a rope tied to a bride and a rabbi, plus the fathers and brothers of the groom, dance around her. It’s important that they don’t come into contact with her at any point, as they follow a teaching in the Jewish holy Torah that says that touching a woman you’re not married to is prohibited. Another image shows a Jewish woman walking a chicken with a piece of rope. She will then have swung the chicken over her head in a ritual to transfer her sins of the past year to the animal. Four plant species - palm stalk, citrus, myrtle and willow branches - are held during the 'Hoshana Rabbah' ritual . Strictly Orthodox children of the chassidic Nadvorna dynasty attend a “chumash” party celebrating receiving the first book of the ‘Torah’, the Jewish written law . A young boy peers through the stands where strictly Orthodox Jews gathered for the traditional Jewish wedding of Chananya Yom Tov Lipa, the great-grandson of the Rabbi of the Wiznitz Hasidic followers, in the town of Bnei Brak . Strictly Orthodox Jews gather for the traditional Jewish wedding of Chananya Yom Tov Lipa, the great-grandson of the Rabbi of the Wiznitz Hasidic followers, in the town of Bnei Brak . Strictly Orthodox Jews follow an ancient Biblical command and harvest wheat with a hand sickle in a field near the central Israeli town of Modi’in. They will store the wheat for almost a year and then use it to grind flour to make unleavened bread for the week-long Jewish holiday of Passover . A strictly Orthodox Jew of the Lelov Chassidic dynasty whips another strictly orthodox man with a leather strap as a symbolic punishment for their sins as they perform the traditional Malkot ceremony in a synagogue in the town of Bet Shemeshm . Strictly Orthodox Jewish women wearing full covering as a means of modesty walk through the neighborhood of Meah Shearim . To Westerners, lying in an open grave, meanwhile, would be shocking behaviour. But for strictly orthodox Jews, it’s a practice they believe will lengthen life. Naumi photographed a man in white overalls peacefully lying in an open grave from which a body had been taken out. The photojournalist also produced pictures of a dance taking place during the Jewish holiday of ‘Purim’. He caught the performers kneeling head to head on a table and it seems at first that they may be wrestling. They are in fact taking part in a ceremony – known as a ‘tisch’ - to commemorate Jews being rescued from a genocidal act in ancient Persia. A dance is also the subject of another image that’s just as captivating. It shows hundreds of orthodox Jews snaking around in a dance in Jerusalem to protest against a government proposal to make military service in the Haredi community compulsory. Naumi said that if his photographs make someone stop and ask ‘what is this?’, then he has succeeded.","Yaakov Naumi’s fascinating photographs include a man lying in an open grave in a ritual to prolong his life .

"A teenage boy who stood before his Florida church and made a heartbreaking plea for someone to adopt him has finally found the loving family he has always craved. Davion Navar Henry Only, 16, had spent his entire life in foster care after his mother gave birth to him behind bars. Three years after his emotional plea at St Mark Missionary Baptist Church in St Petersburg he has finally found a permanent home with the woman who first met him as a seven-year-old when she became his caseworker. Scroll down for video . Davion Only, 16, who captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea for a family to 'love him forever', has been adopted by his old caseworker Connie Bell Going (right) and her family . Davion plays on the Xbox in his bedroom with his soon-to-be adopted mom Connie sitting behind him together with her daughter Carley, 17, and her adopted son, Taylor, 14 . Throughout Davion's search for a family, and his years in the system, Connie Bell Going, had been by his side. On April 22 she will officially become Davion's mother. She admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family, but she said it was worth it. Since August, Davion has been spending weekends with Connie and her daughters, Sydney, 21, Carley, 17, and with her adopted son Taylor, who is now 14. Then in December, Going took the steps to begin the adoption process and Davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home. Since then there have fights and tables have been flipped, but in the end everyone loves one another, and she is prepared for the challenges. 'I'm okay with messy and difficult,' she told the Tampa Bay Times. 'You just have to have your armor on all the time, but it's more than worth it. And every day things get a little bit better.' Davion became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church: 'My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born. I know God hasn't given up on me, so I'm not giving up either.' He then said: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.' Davion Only, 16, has been adopted by his old case worker, Connie Bell Going in Florida (above). She has known the teen since he was seven years old. Davion had been in the foster care system his entire life . Davion (above) captured hearts  in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a St Petersburg church congregation for a family to 'love him forever' Most of all, Davion said he just wanted a family that would 'love him forever'. Millions of people around the country soon heard about Davion's story, and the young boy was even interviewed by Barbara Walters on The View, which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in Ohio and his family. That is until Davion got into a fight with one of the other children, and the minister sent him back to Florida, and back to live in the foster care system. After Davion returned, people kept asking Going what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months. 'That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong,' she said. Making matters worse, Davion and Miss Connie, as he calls her, did not speak when he came back to Florida. Davion had cut himself off from other people, playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year. Davion Only (pictured above with Connie Going at the church where he made his speech in 2013) was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's children . Going says she had begun to call him numerous times, but he always hung up the phone. Then, one night last July, Davion called up Miss Connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy. 'Do you remember what I asked you before?' he said. 'Well, how do you feel about adopting me now?' For the first time since he had asked, Going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear. The 52-year-old case worker has three children of her own, one adopted and two biological daughters, and was a single mother, but she was no longer Davion's case worker, which made the process easier. From August through December he started spending more and more time with the family, a perfect fit as he was already close to Going's adopted son Taylor. Then, in December, Going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting Davion. Davion Only (pictured above in church three years ago) called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last July . Davion got his first bedroom, his first set of siblings, and, most importantly, the one thing he had been hoping for all along. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion said to Going last December. 'Only now I get to call you that for real, right?' Davion officially became part of the family in February however, when after he and Going celebrated their birthdays, which fall on the same date, they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers. After 16 years Davion was finally home. What's more, because of that day in September 2013 when Davion stepped up on the pulpit, hundreds of others have been adopted as well. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion (above in 2013) said to Going last December .","Davion Only, 16, captured hearts around the nation in 2013 when he made a plea for a family to 'love him forever'

"A 1-year-old girl who was shot in the head in a drive-by shooting outside Seattle has died. A spokeswoman for Harborview Medical Center says the girl was brain dead and care was withdrawn Saturday night. Police say Malijah Grant was shot in the head Thursday afternoon while sitting in a car seat in the back of a silver Chevrolet Impala at an intersection in Kent, Washington. Her parents were in the front seat when police say a black car pulled alongside, and the driver and a passenger in that vehicle opened fire before driving off.

Linda Johnston, who lives nearby, ran outside after she heard gunshots. 'I was sitting in my bedroom here and heard the shots. 'Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,'' she told Seattle television station KOMO. 'The baby was on the ground, and other people were doing CPR on the baby, and the mother was in hysterics and the dad was in hysterics, too.' Also seen in wrenching footage from the scene was one woman who was heard screaming 'I want revenge!' into a cellular phone.

"The BBC has apologised and admitted the fell victim to a hoaxer who appeared on the World Service claiming the Star Wars films are anti-women, anti-gay and said Darth Vader listens to rap music. Godfrey Elfwick was recruited via Twitter to appear on the programme World Have Your Say, where producers were preparing an item about the trailer for the new film in the franchise. In particular, the programme were looking for people who had never seen any of the films to watch them and give their assessment. Scroll down for video . Harrison Ford as Han Solo, right and Chewbacca, left, in a trailer for the new Star Wars film, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. However, despite the fact that Mr Elfwick's Twitter bio states that he is a 'demisexual genderqueen Muslim atheist' he was still invited on to the programme. Beforehand he also tweeted: 'I've never actually seen #StarWars but the fact that the bad guy was all black and ate watermelons was unbelievably racist even for the 70's.' And appearing on the show he started off by saying that the old Star Wars films are full of social problems 'rooted in homophobia and casual racial sterotypes'.

He then turned his attentions to Darth Vader adding: 'The main bad guy - what's he called Dark Raider - is he black, he has a deep voice, he listens to rap music - it's just a really bad racial stereotype.' He finished his assessment by saying that film-makers Disney should make 'strong feminist' films such as The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, before being cut off by presenter Chloe Tilley. However, a BBC spokeswoman said afterwards: 'On this occasion, the force was not with us. Princess Leia, who was captured by Jabba the Hutt in Return of the Jedi.

"A stunning fireball that crackled across the sky near the Russian-Finnish border last year shared its orbit with a huge asteroid found in October. This is according to a new study which claims the Kola fireball had a 'disturbingly similar' path to asteroid 2014 UR116, which is due to pass by the moon in 2017. Spotted on April 19 last year, researchers used camera footage to help recreate its trajectory and hunt down any remaining fragments. A stunning fireball that crackled across the sky near the Russian-Finnish border last year shared its orbit with a huge asteroid found in October. Pictured is he fireball at the time of entry at the Kola Peninsula . Joseph Maria Trigo-Rodríguez, a researcher at the Institute of Space Sciences in Barcelona, Spain, headed the team of scientists who studied the meteorite's orbit. They determined the fireball's path by studying its flight and the meteorite's final impact site, before creating a computer model based on those figures. This led researchers to the Annama meteorite, which is an ordinary H5 chondrite - a group of space rocks with high strength that make up 31 per cent of meteorite falls. The computer model compared the orbit of Annama, a 1,100lb (500kg) rock, with the evolution of a dozen orbits of near-Earth asteroids. Scientists determined the fireball's path by studying its flight and the meteorite's final impact site, before creating a computer model based on those figures. This led researchers to the Annama meteorite (pictured) The computer model compared the orbit of Annama (pictured), a 1,100lb (500kg) rock, with the evolution of a dozen orbits of near-Earth asteroids . 2014 UR116, a mountain-sized asteroid which passes Earth every three years, was discovered by Russian scientists in December. Vladimir Lipunov, a professor at Moscow State University, said the space rock, poses no immediate threat - although warned it could 'theoretically' hit Earth.. However, he said it highlights the damage an asteroid could cause - in this case an explosion 1,000 times greater than the surprise 2013 impact of a bus-sized meteor in Russia. At 400-metres (1,300 feet) in size, the space rock is about the same size as the Empire State Building is tall. Proffesor Lipunov said it is difficult to calculate the orbit of big rocks like '2014 UR116' because their trajectories are constantly being changed by the gravitational pull of other planets. It showed a similarity with the evolution of 2014 UR116, which given its size and minimum distance to the planet, has been classed a 'potentially dangerous asteroid'. Vladimir Lipunov, a professor at Moscow State University, said the space rock, poses no immediate threat - although warned it could 'theoretically' hit Earth. Currently, 1,573 asteroids of this type are known so researchers are investigating to what extent they can pose a danger. While the study does not claim that asteroid 2014 UR116 sent the Annama meteorite directly at Earth, it suggests the two bodies are related. Scientists believe that streams of asteroid fragments can travel on nearly identical orbits. Tidal forces may disperse the debris over time and asteroids can also break up due to the pull of large planets. 'The tidal effect on an asteroid, which rapidly rotates under the gravitational field of a planet, can fragment these objects or release large rocks from its surface,' said Trigo. '[This] could then become such dangerous projectiles at a local scale as the one fell in Cheliábinsk (Russia) on February 15th 2013'. Manuel Moreno-Ibáñez, CSIC researcher that participated in the study, explains: 'The data we have obtained provided new clues about the origin of the rocks with a few meters in diameter that produce meteorite falls. 'So far, we only know the orbits of other 22 meteorites, and not always with the sought accuracy.' The researchers hope their latest study will help shed light on how asteroid create projectiles, and which ones pose a threat to Earth. Knowing where the meteorite originates could also help them us better understand the formation and evolution of the solar system. The Kola Peninsula, where the fireball hit, is a peninsula in the far northwest of Russia. Constituting the bulk of the territory of Murmansk Oblast, it lies almost completely to the north of the Arctic Circle .","Scientists created a computer model to analyse Kola fireball's trajectory .

"Deputy PM Nick Clegg said control of the Department for Education would be a key demand of any new power-sharing deal . The Liberal Democrats could seize control of the nation's schools in a coalition deal to erase Michael Gove's 'zany' ideas from the classroom, Nick Clegg signalled today. The Deputy PM said control of the Department for Education would be a key demand of any new power-sharing deal. Mr Clegg said he wanted to avoid a repeat of battling against the 'ideological gimmicks' of Mr Gove, who was the first Tory Education Secretary when the coalition was formed in 2010. Mr Clegg repeatedly clashed with Mr Gove over his education reforms, including Tory plans to scrap GCSEs and a Lib Dem scheme to provide free school meals to under-7s. Mr Gove was demoted from running the ministry in last year's Cabinet reshuffle to become Tory Chief Whip. The Lib Dems have sought to claim the mantle as the 'party of education', pledging to protect spending from 'cradle to college' for 2 to 19-year-olds. In the 2010-15 coalition, the Lib Dems ran three departments: Business, energy and climate change and the Scotland Office. As Deputy PM Mr Clegg oversaw policies across Whitehall, while Danny Alexander also sat in Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, acting as George Osborne's deputy. However, senior Lib Dems believe the party should have demanded one of the key departments running public services, like health or education. Today Mr Clegg signalled that he has his sights set on the Department for Education, which runs schools in England. Asked if it was the kind of cabinet post he wanted, he said: 'I would, particularly having wasted a lot of time dealing with a lot of zany, ideological gimmicks from Michael Gove and his team. 'It would be a good thing if the Liberal Democrats were able to run education policy on our own terms, not least because we are the only party which is prepared to give the schools, colleges and nurseries the means that they need to absorb 400,000 new youngsters in our education system over the next five years.' Campaigning in Cornwall, he announced plans for an independent education standards watchdog to restrict ministers' ability to interfere with the contents of the national curriculum and exams. Mr Clegg said he wanted to 'get politics out of the classroom'. Establishing an Educational Standards Authority (ESA) is part of a plan for England which would also include a new Royal College of Teachers. Other measures include curbing some of the reforms put in place by Mr Gove, with the Lib Dems insisting that all teachers in state-funded schools - including academies and free schools - have qualified status or are working towards it. A slimmed-down core national curriculum would be compulsory in all state schools, bringing free schools and academies in line with those run by councils. Michael Gove was demoted from running the Department for Education in last year's Cabinet reshuffle to become Tory Chief Whip . The Lib Dems have also committed to increase funding for the education budget for two to 19-year-olds by 2020, ensuring that the amount of cash per pupil would be protected in real terms. Mr Clegg said he would 'turn a page on the Gove-esque centralising interference in what teachers teach in the classroom'. He said: 'We are setting out ideas and amplifying ideas today which will take out a lot of the political interference which has dogged the day-to-day life of teachers far too much - from the micromanagement of the history curriculum by Michael Gove through to excessive day-to-day workload.' Mr Clegg also promised to restore morale in the teaching profession. 'I get very distressed when I hear how teachers feel that they have been somewhat put upon in recent years,' he said, promising to 'celebrate not denigrate the great, noble profession'. The Tories tonight hit back at the criticism. A friend of Mr Gove said: 'By zany and ideological, does Clegg mean teaching children to spell properly and do their times tables? 'Or making exams harder? Or training teachers in schools rather than left-wing colleges dominated by the unions? Either he's lost the plot or he's lying again, as he did on tuition fees.' A Conservative Party spokesman added: 'Decisions about what is in the curriculum should lie in the hands of those who can be held to account by parents at the ballot box - not unelected bureaucrats as proposed by the Lib Dems. 'The Lib Dems can't run on their record and run away from it at the same time. They signed up to the new National Curriculum, now they want to re-write it all over again. They voted for extending academy freedoms over the curriculum, now they want to scrap them. 'It's thanks to Conservative reforms that 1,000,000 more pupils are now in good or outstanding schools. Conservative policies have delivered a 71% increase in students taking rigorous academic subjects and ensured 100,000 six year olds are reading more confidently. 'The biggest risk to our education system would be the chaos of Ed Miliband as Prime Minister - and voting Lib Dem will only make that more likely.'","Lib Dem leader makes a promise to take 'politics out of the classroom'

"The first man to serve as White House social secretary, Jeremy Bernard, is leaving after four years on the job. The White House said today that Bernard would depart after a state dinner next month held in honor of the Japanese Prime Minister, confirming rumors that Bernard, 53, would soon exit the administration. The first lady said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy,' she added. 'Jeremy will be missed, and Barack and I wish him the very best in all of his future endeavors.' The first lady, pictured here in November 2011 with White House Social Secretary Jeremy Bernard in Hawaii, said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' Obama added, 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy' The White House did not name a replacement for Bernard, who is also the first gay man to hold the position, nor did it explain why he was leaving. Michelle Obama spoke highly of his time on staff, however, saying, 'For the last four years, Jeremy has worked tirelessly to open the doors of the White House to as many people as possible and to make each and every event in the White House one to remember, not only for Barack and me, but for the tens of thousands of guests who pass through our doors each year.' Bernard simply stated that it's been an 'honor' to serve the Obamas and lauded the first lady for welcoming 'every guest to the White House with her signature warmth, grace and style.' 'I feel so privileged to have worked for such an extraordinary President and First Lady,' his statement read. The former California resident told the Washington Post that he planned to return to The Golden States, and he's 'really looking for some time to think about what’s next and spend some quality time with Garbo, my rescue beagle.' Bernard is pictured here catching snowflakes on the Colonnade of the White House in this February 2014 photo captured by the building's official photographer. The White House today confirmed that Bernard, 53, would depart after a state dinner next month . According to a profile of Bernard in Vogue, Bernard stumbled into politics in the early '90s while waiting tables in Los Angeles. There he met a fundraiser for then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, Dave Mixner, who brought him under his wing and into Clintonland. Bernard later formed a California-based political consulting firm with his ex-boyfriend, Democratic operative Rufus Gifford, that became the vehicle for Barack Obama's West Coast fundraising during his first campaign for president. Obama rewarded Bernard for his hard work with an appointment as the White House's liaison to the National Endowment for the Humanities. He briefly served as the chief of staff to the U.S. Ambassador to France in 2010 before accepting the position of social secretary the following year with his boss' blessing. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as social secretary since February 2011, carefully avoiding the limelight, unlike his predecessor Desirée Rogers, the first African-American social secretary, who was forced out of the administration after just 13 months on the job. It was during Rogers' tenure that socialites Michaele and Tareq Salahi crashed a White House state dinner in 2009. The couple went on to start in Bravo's Real Housewives of D.C. reality TV series. No such mishaps happened during the tenure of Bernard, whose behind-the-scenes work kept the White House in shipshape during social events. His first interview since taking the job, the Vogue profile, did not hit newsstands until February of this year - his fourth anniversary as social secretary. Asked for the interview why he believes he was chosen for the job, Bernard said, 'I would imagine part of it is a trust issue. I was there from the beginning. I was a known quantity. They certainly knew that I was loyal and supportive.' This March 18 photo shows, from left to right, Jeremy Bernard, Democratic operative Karen Finney, Executive Director of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities Rachel Goslins, and former Obama administration officals Stephanie Cutter at the ELLE and HUGO BOSS Women in Washington Power List Dinner at The Residence of the German Ambassador. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as White House social secretary since February 2011 and has carefully avoiding the limelight for the better part of his tenure . Under Bernard's watch, the White House has moved from formal printed invitations for many events to an email system. It has also shed the tradition of seating husbands and wives away from each other at dinners. Bernard told Vogue his team had received 'some criticism' for departing from the traditional seating chart, but it done in accordance with the first lady's will. 'it does bring a comfort level,' he said, of husbands and wives being allowed to sit together. 'And I believe that was part of what Mrs. Obama wanted. 'It is still the White House, still very historic and traditional, but it doesn’t have to be uncomfortable.' Speaking to the Washington Post about his impeding departure, Bernard summed up his work as making 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 'as open as possible and to grant access to as many people as possible, especially people who had never been to the house before.' 'It’s easy to fall into patterns, and what Mrs. Obama has been able to do is have an attitude that keeps it fresh,' he said. At the time of the Vogue interview, which was conducted over several months, dating back to the beginning of November even though it was not published until February, Bernard claimed not to know what his next professional move would be and said he was focusing on the last two years of the Obamas' residency in the White House. 'The good thing about this job—and perhaps the bad thing—is that I am not able to think about the future,' he said. Bernard said that a previous White House social secretary told him 'she lost sleep toward the end because people told her she would go on to do great things next, but they never told her what.' 'She warned me that I do have to start thinking about it,' he recalled. 'I know I do; I just haven’t yet. I’m sort of putting my head in the sand.'","White House said today that Jeremy Bernard would depart after a state dinner next month, confirming rumors he'd soon exit the administration .

Looking at women 20 to 29,  62.2 percent were childless in 2014 - a jump from 60.6 percent in 2012. Childless rates for women in their thirties increased last year, but they did not break records. 28.9 percent of women 30 to 34 years old were childless in 2014, as opposed to 28.2 percent in 2012. The highest childless rate for that age group was in 2010, however, with 29.7 percent. 18.5 percent of women ages 35 to 39 were childless last year, compared to 17.2 percent in 2012. The peak childless figure for that group was in 2002, at 20.3 percent. Researchers found that the childlessness rate for women 30 to 39 in 2014 was 23.9 percent, up from 22.9 percent in 2012.

The 2012 figure was 46.5 percent. For women ages 15 to 50, 42.4 percent were childless in 2014. 41.3 percent had no kids in 2012. In a separate table, the U.S. Census bureau looked at educational attainment levels for women 40 to 50 years old. Those with a graduate or professional degree had the highest childlessness rate at 22.5 percent last year. Those who did not graduate high school had the lowest, at 9.9 percent. On its website, the government agency said it found 'Women age 40 to 50 in 2014 who were in managerial or professional occupations were more likely to be childless than women of similar age in other occupations.' The U.S. Census Bureau also said that 'Among women age 20 to 50, those in the Northeast had fewer children per 1,000 women than did those in the South, Midwest or West.' Yahoo!

"After exposing potential security risks with airlines' in-flight entertainment systems, one of the top experts on counter-threat intelligence in the wold was pulled off a flight by FBI agents.

Roberts, who works for security intelligence company One World Labs, was questioned for the next four hours. Scroll down for video . Chris Roberts of One World Labs was grabbed after his plane landed in Syracuse, New York, on Wednesday . Roberts has been featured on the Fox News television show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren (left) The FBI agents took electronic devices and computer files from Roberts and confiscated his laptop and thumb drives, Fox News reported. They asked to forensically image his laptop, but Roberts told the agents to get a warrant. He was coming to town to speak at an aerospace conference about vulnerabilities in airplane systems and did make a presentation at the event on Thursday without the use of his electronics. The incident occurred only a few hours after a report about Roberts' research was released by Fox. Roberts said in the report: 'We can still take planes out of the sky thanks to the flaws in the in-flight entertainment systems.

"The family rift tearing France's National Front apart plunged to new depths today when Jean-Marie Le Pen said his daughter Marine 'may want me dead'. It follows the 87-year-old honorary president of the far-right party falling out with Ms Le Pen, the current leader, over his extreme views. She was particularly angry that Mr Le Pen, a convicted racist and anti-Semite, called the Nazi gas chambers 'a detail of history'. Outage: Jean-Marie Le Pen angered his daughter when he said Nazi gas chambers were 'a detail of history' Anger: The 87-year-old has now said his Marine - the leader of the Front Nationale - 'may want him dead' But, in response to suggestions he should step down from his position, Mr Le Pen told RTL radio it was a 'crazy idea'. Mr Le Pen explained: 'The prestige that I obviously still have within the National Front would cause a considerable stir, and a loss of influence for Marine that she probably doesn't gauge.' He added: 'Marine Le Pen may want me dead, that's possible, but she must not count on my co-operation.' In an interview on Wednesday, Mr Le Pen flamed allegations of anti-Semitism by praising the wartime leader Marshall Phillippe Petain, who collaborated with the Nazis. Mr Le Pen also said that France's Spanish-born Socialist Prime Minister was an 'immigrant' and so unfit to run the country. And he made it clear that he was 'nostalgic' for the days when Algeria, the biggest country in Africa, was French. Stubborn: However, Mr Le Pen has refused to step down as honorary president of the far right party . Ms Le Pen took over the National Front (FN) from her father in 2011, and has tried to purge it of its extremists. Furious with her father's latest outburst, his daughter said she would oppose his candidacy in December elections to lead the southeastern Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region. She said his 'scorched earth strategy' of causing maximum public outrage amounted to 'political suicide'. 'The FN doesn't want to be held hostage to his vulgar provocations,' said Ms Le Pen, adding: 'His aim is to harm.' Denier: Mr Le Pen is known for his anti-semitic views, and was found guilty of Holocaust denial in 2008 . In an interview with Rivarol magazine, Mr Le Pen stood by his gas chambers remark, saying: 'I am not the type of man who changes his mind or crawls.' In a poll published last year, 83 per cent of French described Mr Le Pen as a handicap to his daughter as she fights to become president in 2017. The party has enjoyed immense electoral success over the past year, winning 25 per cent of the popular vote in local and European elections a year ago. Socialist Party leader Jean-Christophe Cambadelis suggesting the in-fighting exposes the true nature of the FN, saying: 'Jean-Marie Le Pen says out loud what many FN leaders, members and even voters think. 'Behind all that lies a political debate: should they keep what sets the far-Right apart or hide it to win elections? Marine Le Pen has chosen to hide it, Jean-Marie to affirm it.'","Marie Le Pen has fallen out with her father over his 'extreme views'

"A man who was run over by Suge Knight has refused to testify against the rap mogul, defiantly stating in court that he is 'no snitch'. Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 45, was crushed beneath the wheels of Knight's pickup truck outside a burger stand in January, leaving him with two fractured ankles and wounds on to his head, knees and shoulder. But he claimed from the witness stand of the Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday that he does not remember the specifics of the confrontation, in which his companion Terry Carter, 55, was killed. 'No snitch': Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 45, (left, file photo) told the court that he 'will not be used to send Suge Knight (pictured right last week) to prison'. Knight is accused of murdering Terry Carter, 55, and trying to murder Sloan, whom he left with broken bones and other injuries . Suge is accused of murdering Carter and trying to murder Sloan, but claims he was ambushed and ran the men down in an escape attempt. Speaking to the court, Sloan said: 'I don't want it to get misconstrued that I told on this man. 'I'm no snitch. I will not be used to send Suge Knight to prison.' At one point he even refused to confirm that he recognized Knight in court. He also said he was only there because he had been subpoenaed. Knight, who is diabetic and has previously collapsed in trial hearings, is being kept in jail while the hearings proceed. Last week he came to court in a wheelchair, which his lawyers described as a 'ploy' to humiliate him. The judge said that if he did not need it to walk he would not have to use it again. At Monday's hearing Sloan even seemed to speak in Knight's defense - telling the court that he punched him through the window of the truck earlier in the fatal encounter. Strapped in: Knight, pictured above on April 8, is being held on a $25million bail. He came to court last week strapped to a wheelchair . He later agreed with Knight's defense attorney when he said Knight 'hadn't attacked you in any form, fashion or manner.' Summarizing his position, Sloan said: ''Every day, I tried to forget it,' Sloan said. 'I just know, I screwed up, and Terry's dead.' In response to his apparent memory lapse, judge Ronald Coen said that 'this witness is being deceptive.' Killed: Terry Carter, 55, was killed after Knight ran him down. He has claimed the killing was legal as he was trying to escape . Knight was caught on camera running over Sloan and Carter during the January 29 encounter. Sloan and Carter were both involved with Straight Outta Compton, an upcoming film about the rap group N.W.A. Sloan's testimony was offered during a preliminary hearing Monday during which a judge will determine whether there's enough evidence for Knight to stand trial on any of the charges. Authorities contend Knight intentionally hit Sloan and Carter. But Knight's attorney Matt Fletcher says his client was ambushed and was trying to escape an attack when he hit the men. Fletcher pressed Sloan on his feelings toward Knight and whether he was 'enraged' at him on the day of the incident. Sloan said he was mad, but disputed that he told detectives that he was enraged. Knight, 49, was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, and his label once listed Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists. He lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy. He has prior felony convictions for armed robbery and assault with a gun. He pleaded no contest in 1995 and was sentenced to five years' probation for assaulting two rap entertainers at a Hollywood recording studio in 1992. He was sentenced in February 1997 to prison for violating terms of that probation by taking part in a fight at a Las Vegas hotel hours before Shakur was fatally wounded in a drive-by attack as he rode in Knight's car just east of the Las Vegas Strip. Shakur's slaying remains unsolved. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs — he fired one set of attorneys during a hearing and medical conditions sent him to the hospital four times from courthouse appearances. He complained last week when deputies brought him into court handcuffed to a wheelchair and has detailed health woes, including weight loss and blindness in one eye, when he's been allowed to speak in court. Upset: Carter's family gasped as they saw prosecutors handling a picture of his dead body in court . The appearance of fragility comes in sharp contrast to Knight's violent reputation and his once-feared status in the music industry. He faces up to life in prison if convicted of killing Carter. Knight is being held on $25 million bail, an amount his defense claims is excessive. According to the New York Daily News, Carter's two daughters gasped and walked out of court after seeing prosecutors holding a picture of their father's dead body. Crystal Carter reportedly said outside court: 'I loved my dad, I miss him.'","Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 45, was one of two men hit by Knight's pickup truck .

"The family of a two-year-old boy shot and killed in his home have been left outraged after a local newspaper used his death for a political cartoon about gun culture. Kaden Lum was gunned down in Bremerton, Washington, on March 28, in front of his mother by an unidentified suspect who is still on the run. Heather Kelso, who was sharing a room with the youngster's mother, Jalisa, was also killed while a neighbor visiting at the time was shot in the abdomen. Just two weeks on from the horrific incident, the Kitsap Sun printed the controversial illustration on their opinion page. It depicts Kaden as an angel next to a caricature of a devil dressed as Uncle Sam. Kaden Lum was gunned down by an unidentified suspect at his home in Bremerton, Washington, on March 28 . The controversial cartoon depicts Kaden as an angel next to a caricature of a devil dressed as Uncle Sam . The wording above the cartoon of the boy reads: 'Since Kaden is an angel, then…' while 'America's gun culture' is written over the top of the devil. The boy's grandfather believes the decision to print the cartoon, designed by veteran cartoonist Milt Priggee, was in 'bad taste'. Jason Trammell, 51, told KING 5-TV that he has probably cried more times in the last fortnight than he has in 40 years. He said: 'It was in very bad taste. It was disrespectful and it was not in line with honoring my grandson's memory. The editor of the paper, Dave Nelson, defended the decision in an op-ed. 'The intent behind our commentary might be to provoke thought, but it shouldn't be to harm,' he wrote. 'I don't believe Milt [Priggee] was intending to hurt a family, though I acknowledge the pain that's followed. It's a tough one. In the cartoon, Kaden was portrayed as an angel. The boy's heartbroken father James Trammell (right) questioned what person had the 'audacity' to shoot a child and then run away . The boy's mother Jalisa Lum was also inside the home at the time of the shooting and desperatley tried to shield her son. She was not hurt . 'That portrayal isn't hurtful. You see a precious angel that a family lost and who our community shouldn't forget, just like we shouldn't forget the vexing problems that lead to tragedy.' He added that there had been a range of reactions to the illustration. The most emotional however was from Kaden's family who met Nelson to express their disgust. 'The strongest [reaction] was from a few family members of Kaden, who Monday and again Tuesday spoke with me in person passionately, angrily and with despair over the loss of the little boy and their feelings toward the cartoon and the Kitsap Sun,' Nelson wrote. 'I understand their anger, and I'm sorry that something we published led to more sorrow in a difficult time. 'Would things have been different if the cartoon published a week later, after more time to heal? If the baby wasn't illustrated so accurately? 'Was there another way to make the same point? That's what I've wrestled with, as I have with other editorial cartoons that I've declined to run over the years when one crossed a line. Police (pictured at the scene in the aftermath of the shooting) have not made any arrests in the case and do not have any suspects . 'It happens more often than you'd think. 'Milt Priggee speaks for himself through his cartoons, it's my job to decide whether to publish them. It's my job to hear the complaints, occasionally the praise, and publish the opposing viewpoints as well. 'It's everyone's job to keep having conversations that might be difficult and to pray and offer thoughts for a family and a community that's still hurting.' Kaden's mother, Jalisa Lum, was desperately trying to shield her son from the gunman when he was shot, it is reported. She was not hurt in the gunfire and later told police that she did not know the attacker. She told Fox 13: 'There are no words to describe what has been taken away. 'I grabbed the baby because I didn’t know where the gunshots were coming from, and I dove to the ground and held him.' The boy's heartbroken father, James Trammell, told Fox 13: 'You spend all this time bringing your son up, watching him progress. Then all of sudden, somebody comes and just takes it all away.' 'He [the suspect] took a baby from us, and took the mother of another child,' he added. 'What person has the audacity to pull something like that and then run?' A friend of the family Carisa Gibson has set up a GoFundMe page to help the boy's parents cover the funeral costs. It has raised nearly $7,000.","Kaden Lum was shot at his home in Bremerton, Washington on March 28 .

"Frozen salt and vinegar crisp, anyone? We all know freezing is a great way of preserving foods. But believe it or not, the process can make some things taste even better. From cakes to curries, freezing brings out more of their flavour and boosts the texture. Here, Tessa Cunningham puts a host of our favourite foods to the frozen test . . . CAKES . If you think nothing beats the gooey deliciousness of a home-made cake fresh from the oven, think again. Resist the temptation to cut that first slice straight away and, instead, put your cake into the freezer. Scroll down for video . The gooey deliciousness of a cake fresh out of the oven is unbeatable but they can dry out and get stale very quickly. Freeze your cake for 24 hours straight from the oven and the sponge will be bouncier than ever . After being frozen for 24 hours, the sponge will be even bouncier because this process boosts the moisture, so you get an even creamier and softer centre. Let your cake cool entirely, then put it into the freezer without a wrapping. Once frozen solid, wrap it in clingfilm, and it can be kept frozen for up to three months. When you are ready to tuck in, defrost for up to three hours, until thawed. HERBS AND SPICES . Keeping fresh herbs in the freezer will intensify their flavour because they take on moisture during the freezing process. Once defrosted, it also makes them softer, so all their lovely juices seep out more readily and the flavours are more potent. Tough herbs such as rosemary and thyme preserve the best, but ginger, lemongrass, garlic and chilli will last up to six months when frozen. By keeping fresh herbs in the freezer you will intensify their flavour because they take on moisture during the freezing process . Just pop stems in a plastic container and freeze. You can sprinkle frozen chilli, garlic and ginger into stews, fishcakes or curries. Frozen herbs are also brilliant in pies, pasta and pestos. You can even freeze them in ice cube trays with a drizzle of water. That way, they can go straight into a stew or soup — no defrosting needed. CRISPS . Left out for just a few hours, crisps will start going stale and soggy. But even wrapping left-overs in clingfilm to seal out the oxygen won’t keep them super crunchy. Crisps have a tendency to go stale and soggy once they have been left out for a few hours but this problem can be solved if you simply pop them in an airtight back and put them in the freezer . So if you’ve ever found yourself scoffing a big bag just so that they aren’t wasted, stop right now. Pop the crisps in an airtight bag and place them in the freezer. They will stay fresh for at least two months. By extracting air, freezing makes the crisps crunchier and they can even be eaten straight from frozen. NUTS . Once you open a bag of nuts, the clock starts ticking. As nuts have a high oil content, they go rancid very quickly. Now, you have a solution — freezing will preserve the flavour and texture instantly. Due to the high oil content of nuts, they go rancid very quickly but freezing them will preserve the flavour and texture right away . To freeze peanuts, walnuts, pecans, macadamias, cashews, hazelnuts and almonds (shelled or unshelled), wrap them in clingfilm, then place them in a resealable bag. They will keep for up to a year and, when you want to eat them, they’ll defrost in less than an hour. TOMATOES . Fed up with struggling to peel the skins off tomatoes? Freeze them first then, once thawed for two hours, the skin will come off easily. That’s because the freezing process loosens the skins. While you probably won’t want to use frozen tomatoes in salads, as it makes the flesh slightly squishy, it does intensify the flavour. Peeling the skin off tomatoes can be really tricky, but if you freeze them and let them thaw for a couple of hours the skin will come off much more easily . So, once defrosted, you can use your tomatoes to make richer sauces for pasta and stews, or as a topping for pizzas. Alternatively, before freezing, roast your tomatoes at a gentle temperature with garlic, fresh herbs and a drizzle of olive oil for up to four hours. When cooled, transfer them to freezer bags. Use in chilli or home-made tomato sauces. CURRY . Curries don’t only have to be enjoyed the first time round — you can freeze the leftovers and reheat when needed. Freezing a curry is a great way to make the most of leftovers especially because as the curry cools the flavours and aromas combine to create even better seasoning . And hey presto!, they taste even yummier. That’s because, as the curry cools, the flavour and aroma compounds mingle together, developing more seasoned notes. The individual flavours you tasted the first time around, such as cinnamon, garlic and nutmeg, are still there. But the effect is more mellow. RASPBERRIES . Frozen raspberries are great scattered on muesli, added to ice cream or whizzed in smoothies. While freezing may make the berries a bit softer, it accentuates their sharp, fresh flavour, too. Frozen raspeberries can be delicious when sprinkled through muesli, added to ice cream or whizzed into a tasty fruit smoothie . Place your berries in a single layer on a baking tray and put the tray in the freezer. Once they are frozen, you can put them into an airtight bag or plastic container and store in the freezer. They will stay good for up to a year. BANANAS . Fancy a healthy, guilt-free ice cream? Then tuck into a frozen banana after dinner. Bananas have a high pectin content, which gives them a creamy, rich texture when frozen — just like ice cream. When bananas are frozen they adopt a creamy, rich texture which makes them a great guilt-free ice cream . To freeze, peel a ripe banana and chop into thin slices. Put into an airtight container and freeze until solid (around two hours). Decant the slices into a blender or food processor and whizz. In seconds, your frozen banana will look just like ice cream and taste every bit as yummy. Scoop into a bowl and enjoy. For an indulgent treat, add chocolate chips or nut flakes.","Everyone knows freezing is a great way of preserving different foods .
But there are a few types of food you may not have thought of freezing .

"A football fan has triggered a furious row after posting a picture of two Muslim men praying at a Premier League stadium and labelling it a ‘disgrace’. Stephen Dodd tweeted a picture of Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula worshipping on their knees in a stairwell of Liverpool’s Anfield ground. He added the caption: ‘Muslims praying at half-time at the match yesterday #DISGRACE.’ Fury: Stephen Dodd took this photograph of Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula praying at Anfield last month . Mr Dodd’s post, made after Liverpool took on Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup last month, was met with widespread condemnation on social media, with users branding him a ‘bigot’ and ‘disgrace to humanity’. The tweet was reported to police, who investigated but decided no criminal offence had taken place. They have referred the matter back to the club. Last night, Liverpool promised to take ‘appropriate action’ against the supporter. It is not known if Mr Dodd is a season ticket holder, but he could have this revoked or be banned from future matches. Yesterday Mr Bodi, 46, a solicitor from Preston, told the Daily Mail that it was not the first time he had prayed at a match. Backlash: Dodd tried to defend himself by saying that he was a long-standing fan of Liverpool . ‘It only takes a few minutes and this time it was during half-time that we needed to pray,’ the lawyer said. ‘We have a small window in which to pray. That day, the time came for prayer and the window would have closed before the game finished so we did it at half-time. Campaigners have called for football clubs to install prayer rooms so Muslim fans can pray in peace and avoid the possibility of anti-Islamic abuse. Fiyaz Mughal, who runs Islamophobia hotline Tell MAMA, suggested that stadiums should have a 'multi-faith prayer room' in their stadiums. He told MailOnline: 'We are aware of incidents where practising Muslims have been abused since they have decided to quietly pray in public areas during half-time breaks. 'Given that people want to peacefully pray, we would suggest that clubs consider making a prayer room available for those fans who want to do so. 'The prayer room just has to be a space that is clean and where people can spend about 10 minutes praying and which is available through the match. 'It also can be listed as a multi-faith prayer room so that other faiths who want to use it, can do so.' Currently both Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers have prayer rooms at their stadiums for the use of fans. The rooms are non-demoninational and can be used by fans of any religion, but are more likely to be used by Muslims because they must pray at fixed times during the day. Newcastle United has also built a prayer room at its training ground because there are a number of Muslim footballers playing at the club. 'Most people are absolutely fine with it and the stewards at Anfield are wonderful, but it only takes one or two people to react in the wrong way and you could have a nasty situation.’ Muslims are required to pray five times each day – between dawn and sunrise; at midday when the sun passes its highest point; in the late afternoon; just after sunset; and around nightfall. Because prayer times are based on the movements of the sun they differ from place to place. Liverpool’s FA Cup quarter-final against Blackburn kicked off at 4pm, meaning Mr Bodi and Mr Bhula had to say their afternoon prayers at half-time, as the window of opportunity closed before the end of the game. Mr Bodi, whose eight-year-old son Ayman can also be seen in Mr Dodd’s photo, added: ‘My little boy said at the time “someone is taking a picture of us” and I thought maybe it was someone who hadn’t seen prayers before. I certainly didn’t expect to be called a disgrace for doing it. ‘But this guy wasn’t abusive to us and the support since has been very nice, I’m thankful. ‘I’ve supported Liverpool for 40 years and I used to be a season ticket holder. From what I understand this guy doesn’t live too far from the ground and is probably a boyhood fan, so I wouldn’t want him excluded from the ground or anything. ‘He should be given a talking to and made to go on an awareness course or educating.’ Mr Bhula, 37, who is also a solicitor, said he would happily meet with Mr Dodd to explain the importance of prayers in Islam. He added: ‘Education is key to stopping things like this from happening. Maybe the man who took the photo has not come across Muslims before who have explained the significance of prayer. I would be quite happy to meet with him to explain why we pray and when it needs to be done.’ In a statement, Liverpool said discrimination would not be tolerated at the club and it would ‘take appropriate action against the individual involved’. In 2013, a group of West Ham supporters were abused by onlooking fans because they were praying behind the main stand at Upton Park during a match. Match: The incident took place when Liverpool were playing Blackburn Rovers at Anfield in March .","Stephen Dodd photographed Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula praying during half-time at Anfield last month .

"When planning a romantic trip with his girlfriend to watch One Direction in Cardiff, he got the first part of his plan right by managing to buy the gig tickets.

"The family of a Bristol woman killed on holiday in France by a parasite-ridden historic tree has been paid £86,000 in compensation. Carolyn Thorpe, 62, was enjoying a cup of coffee outside a cafe in Hiers-Brouage, a seaside town in south-west France, when the 20-foot tree toppled and crushed her to death in 2007. Her daughter Sarah Wright was also injured by the American ash tree, which was planted 200 years ago to mark the birth of Napoleon I's first son. Carolyn Thorpe was sat in a pavement cafe when the huge tree fell onto her and her daughter. Ms Thorpe, age 62, was killed and her daughter Sarah Wright was injured.

Of the sum, Ms Wright received €42,000 (£30,400) while €77,000 (£55,600) was paid out for Ms Thorpe's death. The American ash tree - which was kept as a historical monument within the small town - was between six and seven metres high and measured 13 feet in diameter. When contacted by press agency AFP the current Mayor of Hiers-Brouage refused to comment.

"The former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes  is suing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers accusing them of unsanitary conditions that led to a MRSA infection  that he says ended his career. The 36-year-old is seeking $20million in lost future earnings and $15,000 in damages after he contracted the deadly infection in 2013 following a surgery on an ingrown toenail, according to  Albert Breer of the NFL Network. The lawsuit was announced on Monday and alleges that the Buccaneers 'failed to disclose and actively concealed ongoing incidents of the infection among other individuals' who used  team's facilities, according to ESPN. Lawrence Tynes has filed a lawsuit against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for $20million in lost future earnings . Tynes was in training camp with the Buccaneers in 2013 when he contracted the deadly MRSA infection . The suit also claims that the team did not use necessary sterile techniques and routinely left therapy devices, equipment and surfaces unclean, according to ESPN. Tynes and another player, offensive guard Carl Nicks, both contracted Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections during a July 2013 outbreak of the  infection during the Buccaneers' summer training camp prior to the season. Nicks reached a settlement with the team last year over his infection for $3million, according to Deadspin. Tynes, who has not kicked a football since 2012, said that he spent eight or nine days without being diagnosed and his infection worsened. 'No one cultured my toe at the facility,' he told ESPN. 'I left that facility on my own and found a doctor in town and said, 'Can you look at my toe because I think all the doctors at the Bucs are lying to me.' The former kicker is seeking an additional $15,000 in damages and says the infection has ended his career . The lawsuit claims that the team did not use necessary sterile techniques and routinely left therapy devices, equipment and surfaces unclean . 'And I took my sock off, he looks at my toe, without any scientific study or anything, he said, 'You have MRSA.' And I'm at a billion-dollar company with the supposed best doctors in the world, and not one of them told me that I had that? I know they knew I had it. They just didn't want me to have it.' He also told ESPN he nearly had his toe amputated due to MRSA, and said that because of the pain in his toe he can longer play. After he contracted the infection, Tynes was  placed on the non-football injury list (NFI) by the team just before the season began. MRSA is usually contracted by people in hospitals or other medical facilities. It is resistant to most antibiotic treatments and can lead to deadly flesh-eating bacteria. The infection can remain in the body for years while being treated. The superbug killed more people than AIDS in 2011. Source: Centers for Disease Control . The NFI list is the team's way of denying . liability after he contracted the precursor for flesh-eating bacteria, . which denies him of certain benefits he is eligible for while on IR. Players on IR reserve their full salary, an accrued season (towards both free agency and retirement benefits) and full health insurance – players on NFI receive none of those benefits. First infected after a July 30 procedure to remove an ingrown toenail on his kicking foot, in earlier reports Tynes said he went to the team after his foot became red and swollen within a few days. Six different antibiotics and three surgical procedures later, he previously told Fox Sports that the team was denying liability. 'I'm standing up for what I think is right,' Tynes told ESPN. 'Or what I know is right. I'm in this thing 'til the very end. I'm not going away.' The former New York Giants postseason hero had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line hooked directly to his veins to more efficiently get antibiotics into his system to fight the infection, according to Fox Sports. The kicker's plight was first brought to the nation's attention by his wife after Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano told media the infected players were 'responding well' to treatment. 'I hear my husband is responding 'well' to treatment. LOL! He's NOT responding at all yet. This is our #bucslife,' Amanda Tynes tweeted August 13, 2013 with a picture of her ailing husband on the couch, hooked up to an intravenous drip. Less than a month later, with their kicker still sidelined and hopes of him recovering in time to contribute to the 2013 season dwindling, the Buccaneers informed the two-time Super Bowl champion the weekend before the season opener that he would be placed on the non-football injury list, further infuriating him and his wife. Tynes (9) twice kicked the New York Giants to the Super Bowl with NFC Championship-winning overtime field goals . 'The Bucs informed my husband via EMAIL that he will be placed on NFI. Wouldn't expect anything more from such a classy organization,' Amanda Tynes tweeted at the time. 'Historically, other teams have done the right thing,' said Lawrence Tynes. 'Other players who have had staph or MRSA, the appropriate designation is IR.' MRSA infections are resistant to most bacteria and, if untreated, can turn deadly. They are usually diagnosed in people who have been in hospitals or had medical procedures and can take years to overcome, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Tynes took to the airwaves to voice his concerns and speak out against what he felt was negligent treatment by the team. He signed a one-year contract with the Buccaneers prior to the 2013 season after a six-year stint with the Giants, where he became famous for twice nailing field goals in overtime that sent his team to the Super Bowl. Tynes started his career with the Kansas City Chiefs.","Lawrence Tynes contracted the deadly infection after surgery on his foot in 2013 and is now seeking an additional $15,000 in damages .

"It has spent four years orbiting the closest planet to our sun, but despite desperate attempts to extend the life of Messenger spacecraft, it is slowly spiraling towards Mercury's scorched surface. Yet even as its mission draws to an end, the final weeks of Nasa's Messenger spacecraft are revealing the planet in unrivaled detail. Messenger is currently 18 miles (29.1km) above Mercury after Nasa engineers used the last of its fuel in a last ditch effort to push the spacecraft higher into orbit after it dropped to within nine miles (15km) of the surface. Among the images sent back by Messenger as its mission draws to an end is this picture of 2km high cliffs cutting through the Carnegie crater. They are thought to have formed as Mercury has cooled and contracted . The spacecraft, however, is expected to smash into the planet's surface on 30 April. But as messenger drops ever closer to Mercury's surface, it is sending back some of the most detailed images ever obtained of the smallest planet in our solar system. Researchers have uncovered the mystery of Mercury's 'stealth' colour scheme. The say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted Mercury black over billions of years. It solves the mystery of Mercury's unusual colouring - which has baffled scientists. On average, Mercury is much darker than its closest airless neighbour, our Moon. Airless bodies are known to be darkened by micrometeorite impacts and bombardment of solar wind, processes that create a thin coating of dark iron nanoparticles on the surface. But spectral data from Mercury suggests its surface contains very little nanophase iron, certainly not enough to account for its dim appearance. As comets approach Mercury's neighborhood near the sun, they often start to break apart. Cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight, so Mercury would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets. Scientists have calculated that after billions of years of bombardment, Mercury's surface should be anywhere from three to six percent carbon. Among the features it has revealed to scientists in the past month are patterns of distinctive hollows - each around a couple of hundred metres wide - in the bottom of a huge impact basin. It has also sent back detailed images of huge 1.2 mile (2km) high cliffs that cut across a crater named Duccio on the surface. Another image shows a 621 miles (1,000km) long cliff that rises 1.8 miles (3km) above the surface, called Enterprise Rupes. Data sent back by Mercury suggests these cliffs, or lobate scarps as they are called, have formed as Mercury has cooled and contracted over time, creating dramatic tectonic faults on the surface. Another image shows a meteorite crater that has almost completely filled with lava on Mercury's northern volcanic plains, leaving just the hint of a rim behind. It also shows how the contracting surface of the planet has also created strange formations where ridges and cliffs have hit other lava filled craters. Andy Calloway, Messenger Mission operatoins manager at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, said: 'The MESSENGER spacecraft operates in one of the most challenging and demanding space environments in our Solar System, and we have met that challenge directly through innovation and hard work, as exemplified by the stunning discoveries and data return achievements. 'Our only regret is that we have insufficient propellant to operate another 10 years, but we look forward to the incredible science returns planned for the final eight months of the mission.' This image by Messenger shows the distinctive hollows on the floor of the Zeami impact basin on Mercury . This ghostly crater filled with lava oozed from volcanic vents on Mercury leaving just the outline of the rim . This crumpled crater has been deformed after it filled with lava and then ridges formed as the surface cooled . Launched in August 2004, Messenger has traveled more than 4.9 billion miles (7.9 billion kilometers) during its mission to Mercury. The above graphic was released by Nasa to mark ten years since the spacecraft was launched in 2004 . Its journey included 15 trips around the sun before it entered orbit around Mercury in 2011 - the first spacecraft to ever do so. During its mission is has acquired more than 250,000 images and collected more than 10 terabytes of data with its suite of seven instruments. It has helped to reveal volcanic vents that measure up to 15 miles across that were once sources for the large volumes of lava that have covered the surface and carved out valleys. It has also revealed Mercury's complex internal structure and that the planet has an unusually large core that is still partially liquid. On 6 April engineers used the last of the Messenger spacecraft's hydrazine fuel to try to push it into a higher orbit. However, the tanks ran dry before they could raise it to more than 11 miles (18km) above the surface. In an attempt to increase its height further the team then ejected helium gas from the spacecraft through its thrusters to raise it to its currently height. This image shows some of the mysterious irregularly shaped hollows on Mercury's surface in greater detail . They hope to raise it further with another burst of helium on April 14. Karl Whittenburg, deputy mission operations manager at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, said: 'To our knowledge, this is the first-ever use of a pressurant for a planned propulsion of a spacecraft, so we could only theorize how it might perform. 'We are now fully confident that future use of gaseous helium will continue to provide Messenger with a unique vantage point for studying Mercury.' This image shows fine-grained volcanic material that has blown across impact craters almost like snow . This colour image of Mercury was one of the first sent back by Messenger as it approached the planet in 2008 . The above artist's impression shows Messenger as it orbits above the surface of Mercury. It is due to impact on the surface at the end of April as the planet's gravity slowly pulls it down out of its current orbit . Messenger has also revealed the temperature of Mercury's surface. This image of the planet's north pole shows the extreme heat it is subjected to with red indicating temperatures greater than 126°c and blue -220°c .","Messenger is expected to impact on the surface of Mercury around April 30 .

"Women are undervaluing themselves and asking for less pay than they should – widening the gender pay gap, it is claimed. Research found that women applying for jobs through recruitment agencies remain coy about asking for asking a decent wage package. A study found women routinely ask for £4,000 less for a typical job, but that this widens to up to £10,000 less in more senior industries such as accountancy. Gender gap widening: A study found women routinely ask for £4,000 less for a typical job, but that this widens to up to £10,000 less in more senior industries such as accountancy . On average, women ask for almost a fifth less than men, rising to nearly a third less in some financial sectors. Not only do they ask for less than their male colleagues, but they are also asking for below what they could typically expect to earn in their industry. New research from Reed.co.uk found that female applicants state their ‘anticipated salary’ as £19,900, on average, while men asked for £23,800. Expected salaries varied by industry with women asking for 29 per cent less than men in accountancy, 22 per cent less in banking, 21 per cent less in the energy sector and 18 per cent lower in education. A qualified male accountant expected to earn £47,000 in their next role compared to just £36,400 for women with the same experience. The gender gap narrowed in the manufacturing industry and the legal sector to just 9 per cent. And in the IT and security industry, women actually asked for higher pay, albeit just 2 per cent more – reversing the trend. The findings were released to coincide with Equal Pay Day today, to raise awareness of the gender pay gap. East Anglia and the East Midlands had the largest gender difference in expected salaries, while North West England had the smallest. Lynn Cahillane, of UK jobs website Reed, said: ‘Our latest research shows a major difference in the pay expectations of men and women. ‘Whatever your gender, it’s important to never undervalue your worth at work, so if you’re thinking about looking for a new job. Selling themselves short: East Anglia and the East Midlands had the largest gender difference in expected salaries, while North West England had the smallest, according to the research from Reed.co.uk . ‘If you’re happy in your current job but feel you’re not getting paid enough, then it’s time to take on one of the tougher tasks we all face whilst in employment – negotiating a pay rise.’ The study also showed ‘a stark contrast’ between what women expect to get paid and what’s actually on offer. Using the website’s ‘average salary checker’ tool, Reed.co.uk found many female applicants asked for less than their industry’s average. Women on Boards (WoB) said that female workers were kept in the dark about what their male colleagues were earning, making it hard to know how much to request. Fiona Hathorn, of WoB – which campaigns for more women in the boardroom – said: ‘I think it is unrealistic to suggest that women are expecting less when pay levels are often not transparent in organisations. ‘I believe it is the responsibility of the company, not the employees, to make than men and women are paid same. ‘Research has also shown that women need to be very careful about asking for more money. ‘Stereotypical unconscious biases are alive and kicking in the UK which means that women who ask for pay rises are often negatively treated thereafter, having been viewed as aggressive. ‘Men on the other hand are not only expected but encouraged to challenge pay and opportunities.’","Women routinely ask for £4,000 less for a typical job, new research finds .

"Edwin 'Jock' Mee allegedly targeted young army cadets - including a woman who was 19 when he locked her in a room and raped her . An army recruitment sergeant who is accused of carrying out a campaign of abuse against female cadets allegedly locked a female recruit in an office and raped her. Edwin 'Jock' Mee, who worked at the military base in Croydon, south London, allegedly invited the young woman in for an appointment to discuss her application to join the Army and locked the doors of the room they were in . The woman, now 27, told Southwark Crown Court that Mee raped her as he called her a 'sweet woman'. She claims she became pregnant before suffering a life threatening ectopic pregnancy. Mee is accused of carrying out sex attacks on 11 victims as young as 15 while working at an Army careers centre between October 2010 and September 2011. The divorced father-of-five denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three rapes and one count of assault by penetration. Many of his vulnerable victims were threatened with deportation if they did not submit to his sexual demands, the court was previously told. One of his alleged victims claimed she was told by Mee she would 'need to be nice to him' when she met him for her first application appointment. The woman had arrived in England from her Sierra Leone homeland in 2007 when she was 19. She told the jury she had been 'inspired' to join the Army by her then-fiance, but said Mee littered their first meeting with comments about her 'boobs', her looks and saying that he 'liked her'. Speaking from behind a curtain she told the jury: 'He told me a little bit about him and his ex-wife. He said that if I help him, he will help me through my application but if I f*** with him...' She then said 'excuse me' to the jury before continuing his sentence adding that he said 'he will f*** with me'. Earlier in the interview at the Scottish recruitment sergeant's office in Croydon, south London, he had asked her about her background and then asked if she was a prostitute. When she replied no she claimed Mee make a comment about her breasts. She started attending the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office (ACIO) in Croydon, once or twice a week on Mee's orders after completing her British Army Recruitment Battery test, desperate to find out if she had secured a job. After she had asked about the progress of her application he invited her in for a 6pm appointment to discuss it, and left her waiting almost two hours, jurors were told. The woman, now 27, claims she asked Mee why he had brought her there and he told her she would have to wait, making her nervous. Scroll down for video . Giving evidence from behind a screen she said: 'He came and asked me to sit on his lap and I told him I can't.' The sergeant then stormed off and while she was waiting, she could hear Mee locking the doors, she claimed. 'Then he said ""I want you to make love to me"" and I said ""Jock"" and he said ""there is no other way, the front door is locked, there is no camera in here and the door is closed2 so I have to choose,' added the woman. 'I said ""I can't"", he said ""you have to do that"".' Mee, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court earlier this week, has denied 17 counts of sexual assault . Mee boasted about going to prison and 'fighting' and used 'threatening remarks and gestures', jurors heard. 'He said if you don't want to do it then you can't leave,' she said. The sergeant then held her hands behind her back, telling her: 'You have to use this door, I have the keys.' The woman then wept as she told jurors Mee raped her. She told the court that she turned to her GP after suffering 'severe' pain following the alleged brutal rape. 'During that period for two nights running I had severe tummy aches so I had to go to my GP,' she said. 'The GP said I have to do a test, I had to take a pregnancy test before I could take things further,' she said. The woman claims she spoke to Mee after she had a miscarriage but she never saw him again. Mee's alleged victim suffered a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy and was operated on at St Helier Hospital in Surrey. 'Did you tell anybody about what had happened with Jock Mee and the baby and the story at that time?' asked Rosina Cottage QV, prosecuting. 'At the time I didn't tell anyone anything because I was really stressed,' she replied. When investigators from the army knocked on her door, she was so frightened she pretended to be someone else, the court heard. The alleged offences were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police, before the case was then handed to the Metropolitan Police. The British Army recruiting sergeant worked at Mitcham Barracks in Croydon in Careers and Information . Southwark Crown Court also heard evidence from another alleged victim who claimed she gave up her hopes of being in the Army when she was 17 because the attentions of Mee, who allegedly asked her if she was a virgin, made her feel 'very uncomfortable.' Speaking from behind a curtain, the woman, who is almost 22, told London's Southwark Crown Court: 'He just smacked my bottom on the way out.' She told the jury that 'he did not say anything', adding: 'I was just very shocked and a bit overwhelmed. I did not know what to say. I was not expecting that to happen. I was speechless. I did not know what to say.' She also claimed he pestered her with questions about her personal life, asking her about eight times to go out for a drink and whether her mother would let her stay at his house. He would also 'stare' at her chest during the interviews, she told the court. The woman had applied to join the Army in March 2011 but had abandoned the plan by December that year, after being asked by Mee to go for a drink with him about eight times. She said: 'I just stopped training. I felt very uncomfortable about it. My interest was diverted by what I was experiencing - the unprofessionalism. It was just not somewhere I wanted to be near.' Lisa Wilding QC, defending, claimed the incidents did not happen and suggested that when Mee found out they shared the same birthday, he only said 'make sure you do not drink too much, it will affect your training'. The woman responded sharply: 'That is a lie.' The trial, which is expected to last six or eight weeks, continues.

"The former head of the NHS this morning launched an extraordinary public attack on Labour for being the only party not to commit to an extra £8billion a year for the health service. Sir David Nicholson said it was crucial that all the main political parties backed the NHS’s five-year plan, which calls for a 7 per cent boost to the health budget by 2020. David Cameron and Nick Clegg have pledged to find the cash – but Ed Miliband has refused. Warning:Sir David Nicholson, the retired head of NHS England, has warned of a 'substantial financial problem' at the heart of the NHS and says it is being ignored by politicians . Speaking this morning, Sir David said: ‘That £8billion needs to be available and all of the parties but Labour have signed up. But it’s important we get all the parties signed up. I think it will be helpful for the NHS if Labour agree to sign it.’ Sir David said it was vital for the NHS for there to be a ‘political consensus’ guaranteeing its budget. He said once the NHS knew what its budget was going to be it could start tackling the growing black hole in its finances. ‘They must make sure we are not building on sand but on a stable financial base,' he said. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt this morning weighed in behind Sir David - admitting that the NHS faced 'a significant financial challenge over the next Parliament'. But he said: 'That’s why we have committed to finding at least an extra £8billion a year by 2020. This is the amount, Simon Stevens the current Chief Executive of the NHS said the service would need.' Mr Hunt added: 'Labour must explain why they won't find the money the NHS says it needs.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also backed Sir David's remarks. He said: 'The NHS does need more money. Now, it’s David Nicholson’s successor, as it happens, Simon Stevens identified this number: £8billion by the end of the next parliament. 'He and David Nicholson are quite right to expect political parties to explain how they’re going to come up with that money.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, appearing this morning on LBC, backed Sir David's intervention . Sir David's intervention came after Mike Dixon, leading GP and Chair of the NHS Alliance also laid into Labour. He said: ‘The NHS will be extremely worried by the lack of political consensus around the £8billion funding for the NHS’ five-year plan. 'NHS leaders have been clear that this is the minimum amount needed to maintain current service provision. 'It’s not rocket-science to predict the impact on the NHS if this commitment is not met: patients would face longer waits, services would face severe cuts and rationing, and many hospitals and GP practices would struggle to survive in their current form.’ Sir David accused politicians of ignoring a black hole in the NHS budget to boost their election chances. He warned that there was a 'substantial financial problem' at the heart of the NHS and claimed the financial peril it faces will soon be 'crystal clear'. The former NHS chief said that politicians were talking about spending more money rather than addressing existing funding gaps. Sir David was called the Man With No Shame after he refused to resign over the Mid-Staffordshire Hospital Trust scandal and retired with a gold-plated pension last year. Before he left the NHS he spoke of his 'bitter regret' over not speaking to affected patients and their families during the Stafford Hospital scandal, where 1,200 died, but he refused to quit. David Cameron was back on a building site  yesterday, while Ed Miliband was pictured outside the BBC in central London . Sir David Nicholson has worked in the NHS since 1977, the same year he joined the Communist party. After working in mental health for a decade, he rose through the ranks to become chief executive of several bodies including the Shropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority at the time of the care scandal in which up to 1,200 people died. In 2006 he became chief executive of the whole of the National Health Service, in charge of a £90billion budget and 1.3million staff. He claimed £50,000-a-year in expenses on top of a salary of his £211,000 salary, £20,000 bonus and around £47,000 of 'benefits in kind'. The package was criticised at a time when his 'Nicholson Challenge' was imposing £20billion in efficiency savings on the NHS. He insisted he had to travel by first-class to do his job, but refused to explain to MPs why his expense claims included 41 first-class trips to Birmingham, where his 35-year-old wife lives with their baby daughter. He was also accused of overseeing a culture of fear within the NHS where hospitals fiddle their figures and whistleblowers are prevented from speaking out. In a three-year period under his rule a total of £14.7 million was spent on almost 600 'compromise agreements' preventing ex-employees from speaking out. A year after his retirement he has re-emerged to warn of problems with the NHS' finances. He told the BBC: ''I have not heard in most of the conversations politicians are having at the moment about what they're going to do about that financial hole. 'They want to talk about extra services and extra investment when actually there is a problem there to face.' The former head of NHS England also cast doubt on Tory and Liberal Democrat plans to fund the health service. Sir David Nicholson said the so-called 'Stevens plan' both parties have signed up to, which involves the government injecting £8 billion cash into the NHS while gaining £22 billion from efficiency savings, will be difficult to implement. Labour is the only main party which has not signed up to the five-year plan drawn up by current NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, instead favouring a £2.5 billion Time to Care fund paid for by a mansion tax and tobacco levies. Sir David told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'What the public is being told at the moment is that 'we'll give you a bit of extra money and everything will be fine' and that actually these managers can deliver £22 billion and then everything will be fine. 'So in a sense if they find it difficult to do that and I think most of them will, I think they are going to be blamed.' Sir David launched 'Nicholson's challenge' in 2009, when he ran NHS England, and urged staff to find £20billion in 'efficiency savings' by 2015 - but it failed. He says the situation today is similarly grave and warned that the NHS will have to take 'emergency action' such as freezing recruitment. Savings could mean that patients could be forced to wait longer waits for treatment, more expensive drugs may not be used and it will be even harder to see a GP. Sir David was one of the most criticised civil servants of recent times when he was the £211,000-a-year head of NHS England. In that period he defied calls to resign from MPs and campaigners over his role in the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal, where hundreds died through neglect. Relatives described how elderly patients became so thirsty they resorted to drinking dirty water from vases, while nurses said they left wards in tears because care was so poor. Sir David was accused of not taking action while in charge of the regional health body overseeing the trust, and later when appointed NHS chief executive in 2006. In fact at the height of the scandal, in October 2005, he toured the hospital wards and wrote a glowing letter to managers praising them for hitting targets. But he has repeatedly insisted that at the time he had 'no idea' of the unfolding scandal and maintained that the failings were 'system wide'. He came under further pressure when it emerged he had ignored the concerns of two whistleblowers about another trust, University Hospitals Lincoln, where 670 patients may have died needlessly. Sir David became known as the 'man with no shame' because of his stance over the scandals and his pension pot is  likely to be more than £2million. He said last night: 'Other people will make judgements about my record. I think I made a contribution to improving services. But obviously I regret people suffered. I regret patients did not get the best possible care.'","Sir David Nicholson called on Labour to commit to spending extra on NHS .

"The Secret Service will have to drive Scooby One and Scooby Two back to Chappaqua without HIllary Clinton riding shotgun. Instead, she's flying coach and toting her own luggage. A United Airlines regional jet carried her back to the East Coast on Thursday from the Omaha, Nebraska airport. Her flight was bound for Newark, New Jersey, the major airport most convenient to her spacious Chappaqua, New York home. A reporter with the liberal news outlet Vox tweeted a photo of Clinton toting her own luggage on Thursday in Omaha . SHE'S JUST LIKE US? A Town Car sedan (right) met Mrs. Clinton on the tarmac in Newark on Thursday, flanked by police and Secret Service vehicles . Hillary Clinton took the fast route home from Iowa to the East Coast: just a 3-hour flight instead of 20 hours of driving time . Clinton had just finished a three-day presidential campaign swing in Council Bluffs, Iowa. That's just a few miles away, and home to a cafe where she held a top-secret meeting with Democratic Party insiders who were told to surrender their cell phones and cameras beforehand. In contrast with the private jet service Hillary has been accustomed to on her storied and lucrative speaking tours, her ride home was a no-frills commercial flight without a First Class seat to be found anywhere. For flights from Omaha to Newark, United uses Embraer ERJ-135 and ERJ-145 jets with nothing but narrow economy-class seats. END OF AN ERA? Scooby's first trip ended with a total of 10 confirmed sightings and more than 1,300 miles driven . Clinton flew back East on an EMbraer ERJ-series plane like this one . EASIER TO RUB ELBOWS: The aircraft Mrs. Clinton took home has narrow chairs and the whole plane is economy class, but at least there's no middle seat . Hillary's handlers have been trying to reposition her as an 'everywoman' eager to meet with ordinary people. But her first Iowa event, promoted as a spontaneous coffee shop sit-down with average voters, turned out to be a carefully staged production whose young participants were driven to the cafe by Clinton's Iowa political director. At least three of the 'everyday Americans' featured in Hillary's campaign launch video have ties to Democratic Party politics. And hours before her flight, Secret Service agents parked the now-familiar 'Scooby' van in a handicapped spot so she would have a shorter walk. On Thursday a Vox reporter photographed Hillary at Omaha's Eppley Field airport, holding on to her own rollaboard luggage and talking with a member of the public. But while she boarded the plane like everyone else, she didn't disembark that way: Afellow passenger tweeted a photo of the Town Car sedan – and police escort – that awaited her in Newark on the airport tarmac. Just one person tweeted that Clinton was on their plane, not unlike her Ohio lunch at Chipotle where no one recognized her . EMBARRASSING: U.S. Secret Service parked 'Scooby' in a handicapped space Thursday while Clinton held a top-secret meeting with Democratic Party officials . It's not clear how Clinton's twin 'Scooby' vans, her armored and customized campaign vehicles, will get back to Chappaqua. The Secret Service did not respond to a request for comment. Agents will likely have to drive the vehicles back themselves. If Hillary were the American president, they would be rolled aboard Air Force One and flown east. But that will have to wait at least until January 2017.","United flight 3954 carried Clinton from Omaha, Nebraska to Newark, New Jersey on Thursday .

"Accused: Dr Ram Manohar, 38, of Barnston, Wirral, has denied four counts of sexual assault . A senior doctor facing sexual assault allegations from two separate nurses is accused of groping the breast of one of them and saying 'you bad girl' after smacking her on the bottom. A&E consultant Dr Ram Manohar, 38, is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. David McLachlan, prosecuting, said Manohar offered to help Nurse A with her training on December 23, 2013, Liverpool Crown Court heard. He said she knew Manohar and, while in his room, asked for his help to learn about matters including chest X-rays. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any warning Ram Manohar put his hand down her nurse's dress and he put his hands into her bra.' She said he moved his hand around but she had not asked for a demonstration. Nurse A said he later asked her a question about the heart, which she got wrong. She said: 'He smacked me on the bottom quite hard and said to me, ""you bad girl"".' Mr McLachlan said Manohar squeezed her left breast to indicate where her left ventricle was and while discussing breast lumps asked to see her nipple, but she refused. She said the conversation moved onto the femoral pulse. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any word of warning he put his hand up her dress and down her tights.' Manohar then allegedly touched her inappropriately. Nurse A said he told her 'this type of teaching is only for you' before she left the room 'feeling disgusted with herself'. She later told friends she felt 'violated' before contacting police. Manohar told officers he had known her since working with her at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. He said after a night out she had asked him back to her house, but he had refused. He said she had also asked him on December 12 'to find her a single and smart man because she was desperate'. Manohar said on December 23 she unzipped her top, making him uncomfortable, and followed him around 'like a puppy'. The doctor denied touching her inappropriately and said his office door had been open. He said she had been pointing to different parts of her body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive'. Manohar is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital (pictured). Nurse A said he groped her breast after she asked him about chest X-rays . Nurse B alleged that Manohar touched her inappropriately on July 10 and October 31, 2013. She said the first time she went to A&E because she had pins and needles in her hands and feet. Nurse B said he examined and touched her genital area. However, she said she thought he had been professional and thanked him before he gave her a hug. She said on October 31 she saw him about a 'very bad headache' and he treated her in a dark room, checking her reflexes before touching her genital area. The A&E consultant claims he had been pointing to different parts of Nurse A's body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive' Nurse B again thought he had acted professionally and went to the hospital to drop off a thank you card. She said he invited her to meet him for coffee and she went to the hospital for 'a coffee type date' because she did not know he was married. Nurse B alleged Manohar invited her into his office, kissed her, told her how beautiful she was and suddenly without warning put his hand into her knickers. Mr McLachlan said: 'She stopped him straightaway. He told her that he was married with children.' Nurse B also reported him to the police. Manohar told officers he did not inappropriately touch her during either examination. He said she told him she had feelings for him but he said he was married and she started crying. Manohar admitted he then kissed her but said he did not think he had put his hand into her knickers. He said: 'I think she caught my hand and put it on top of her trousers or something.' Manohar, of Barnston, Wirral, denies four counts of sexual assault. The trial continues.

"The red planet might still have liquid water, suggests information collected by Nasa's Curiosity rover. Researchers have long known that there is water in the form of ice on Mars. Now, new information from the Mars rover Curiosity, published in the journal Nature, shows that it is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet. The ‘Hidden Valley’ in Gale Crater on Mars. Very fine-grained sediments, which slowly fell down through the water, were deposited right at the bottom of the crater lake. The sediment plates at the bottom are level, so everything indicates that the entire Gale Crater may have been a large lake. New information from Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity, published in the journal Nature, shows that it is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet. The explanation is that the substance perchlorate has been found in the soil, which lowers the freezing point so the water does not freeze into ice, but is liquid and present in very salty water. Curiosity detected salts called perchlorates, which can absorb water from the atmosphere and turn it into briny liquid. When night falls, some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost, but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water, so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid. Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012 in the large crater, Gale, located just south of the equator. The giant crater is 154 kilometres in diameter and the rim of the crater is almost five kilometres high. In the middle of the crater lies the mountain, Mount Sharp. Curiosity has travelled more than 10km from the landing site towards Mount Sharp and has carried out many studies along the way. Doctor Morten Bo Madsen, associate professor and head of the Mars Group at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said: 'We have discovered the substance calcium perchlorate in the soil and, under the right conditions, it absorbs water vapour from the atmosphere. 'Our measurements from the Curiosity rover's weather monitoring station show that these conditions exist at night and just after sunrise in the winter. 'Based on measurements of humidity and the temperature at a height of 1.6 metres and at the surface of the planet, we can estimate the amount of water that is absorbed. 'When night falls, some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost, but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water, so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid. Researchers say that Gale Crater was once a giant lake on the red planet . 'The soil is porous, so what we are seeing is that the water seeps down through the soil. 'Over time, other salts may also dissolve in the soil and now that they are liquid, they can move and precipitate elsewhere under the surface.' Observations by the Mars probe's stereo camera have previously shown areas characteristic of old riverbed with rounded pepples that clearly show that a long time ago there was flowing, running water with a depth of up to one metre. Now the new close-up images taken by the rover all the way en route to Mount Sharp show that there are expanses of sedimentary deposits, lying as 'plates' one above the other and leaning a bit toward Mount Sharp. Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971. It revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, and before this study, scientists believed liquid water could not exist on its surface. In June 2013, Curiosity found powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September of the same year, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. Last month, scientists provided the best estimates for water on Mars, claiming it once had more liquid H2) than the Arctic Ocean - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years. The findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on Mars to thrive, but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry. Dr Madsen said: 'These kind of deposits are formed when large amounts of water flow down the slopes of the crater and these streams of water meet the stagnant water in the form of a lake.' However, he added that it is not likely that life will be found on Mars as it is too dry, too cold and the cosmic radiation is so powerful that it penetrates at least one metre into the surface and kills all life - at least life as we know it on Earth. The finding, however, could make it easier for humans to live on Mars in the future. He explains that about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars had 6.5 times as much water as it does now and a thicker atmosphere. But most of this water has disappeared out into space and the reason is that Mars no longer has global magnetic fields, which we have on Earth. Observations by the Mars probe's stereo camera have previously shown areas characteristic of old riverbed with rounded pepples that clearly show that a long time ago there was flowing, running water with a depth of up to one metre. Currents of liquid iron in the Earth’s interior generate the magnetic fields and they act as a shield that protects us from cosmic radiation. The magnetic field protects the Earth’s atmosphere against degradation from energy rich particles from the sun. But Mars no longer has a global magnetic field and this means that the atmosphere is not protected from radiation from the sun, so the solar particles (protons) simply ‘shoot’ the atmosphere out into space little by little.","Possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet .

"Ex pop star: Rev Richard coles (pictured) rose to fame as half of the band The Communards . When a high-profile vicar yesterday attacked the Tory plans to sell housing association homes as a ‘right to steal’, it might have sounded like a stern ticking off from the pulpit. But this was the Rev Richard Coles – who sits on the board of Wellingborough Homes, a housing association in Northamptonshire – and he is no ordinary churchman. Known to many for presenting Radio 4’s gentle human interest show Saturday Live, he is the supposed inspiration for the hero of the BBC church sitcom Rev. And while he might now feel free to attack others for seeking the right to buy their own home, he not so long ago felt he had the right to do whatever he chose himself, regardless of the law or anyone else’s feelings. For Coles raised eyebrows by last year publishing a frank memoir which detailed not only his rise to fame as half of the famously gay 1980s pop band The Communards, alongside singer Jimmy Somerville, but also his enthusiasm for ‘dogging’ – having sex with strangers in the open air – and for taking drugs including cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines. He also confessed that he falsely told his friends that he was HIV positive, to generate attention and sympathy, and kept up the unpleasant pretence for five years. Coles, 52, is now a regular on TV and radio, but on Sundays he performs at his 14th century parish church, St Mary the Virgin, in Finedon, Northamptonshire. He lives nearby in a ‘rather lovely’ grace and favour vicarage provided by the Church of England. Last October he warned his parishioners to ‘brace themselves’ for the publication of his biography Fathomless Riches, and said shortly after: ‘I hadn’t realised quite how eventful my life had been until I sat down to write about it. The truth is, country parsons often have a more vivid past than you might think.’ Born in Northamptonshire to shoemaker parents, Coles was sent to public school and it was while he was a chorister there that he realised he was gay. Coles, 52, is now a regular on TV and radio, but on Sundays he performs at his 14th century parish church, St Mary the Virgin, in Finedon, Northamptonshire . Within a few years he had taken a drug overdose, saying that in the 1970s being gay ‘was like being a paedophile now – it was a life which seemed to offer only disgrace’. He moved to London, however, met Somerville, and they formed The Communards. Their song Don’t Leave Me This Way went to number one and was the best-selling single of 1986. Money poured in. But Coles remained unhappy, jealous of Somerville’s fame and feeling geeky himself. He took large quantities of drugs, apparently spending a whole year in Ibiza on speed and ecstasy, and taking LSD. He believes the ecstasy was sometimes laced with heroin. He eventually conquered his shyness with other men when he discovered a lay-by where he could meet strangers and have sex in the woods at night. He described the discovery of this dogging spot as ‘one of the great liberations of my life. Having lots of casual and anonymous sex with strangers’. He added: ‘It was extremely healing for me. Would I repudiate it? No. I had a fantastic time.’ After a theology degree Coles was ordained in 2005 and says he now leads a celibate life with his civil partner David Oldham, 37, a curate in a neighbouring parish.","Rev Coles sits on the board of Wellingborough Homes housing association .

The boy had just been put to bed when his father heard the unlocked security door and front door open and thought it was his 20-year-old son returning, police said. Instead, a stranger wearing a hooded sweatshirt entered, exchanged a few words and then began shooting at and chasing the father, according to the family's account. Bullets pierced the wall of the bedroom where the 8-year-old and his 17-year-old brother were in bed. The father told police he ran into the boy's bedroom and tried to shield him as the gunman followed, still firing. 'It was a matter of seconds, just bam! Bam!

"A former Marine who was sentenced two years ago for starting a fire that caused over $1million in damages to an Ohio mosque has sent a letter apologizing and asking forgiveness from its members. Randy Linn, now in a California federal prison where he's two years into his 20-year sentence, said that he can't believe that he tried to destroy a place of worship. Federal prosecutors said Linn drove about two hours from his home in St. Joe, Indiana, to suburban Toledo on September 30, 2012, and broke into the mosque where he poured gasoline on a prayer rug and lit it on fire. Randy Linn was sentenced two years ago for starting a fire that caused over $1million in damages to a suburban Toledo, Ohio, mosque . Federal prosecutors said Linn drove from his home in St. Joe, Indiana, to the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo (pictured) in September 20112, broke into the mosque, poured gasoline on a prayer rug and set it on fire . 'Well again, I’m very sorry for what I did. Hopefully someday you all can forgive me. And yes I don’t like it here, you can tell everyone, that I’m sure will put a smile on everyone face,' he said in his letter, according to The Blade. Cherrefe Kadri, president of the center, said she thought Linn's letter was sincere . Linn had several firearms in his car and carried a gun into the mosque, which was empty at the time. Linn later said while pleading guilty to hate crime charges that he'd become enraged after seeing images of wounded soldiers in the news and decided to burn the mosque. He also blamed what happened on a day of heavy drinking. Being forgiven, he wrote last December, would 'probably give me a little bit of peace of mind.' Cherrefe Kadri, president of the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo, told The Blade said she waited nearly six weeks to respond to Linn's letter. Most of the members have moved on, she said. 'I think his letter was truly sincere, and I told him that,' she said. Her response, written on stationery with an image of the mosque at the top, said that she hopes he can make peace with God. 'Neither our community nor I harbor any hatred, ill-will or malice toward you,' she wrote. A sprinkler system extinguished the blaze, leaving smoke and water damage in the prayer room of the facility.

"Eating out just once a week raises your risk of suffering from high blood pressure. Those who frequently dine out or feast on takeaways are more likely to have pre-hypertension – elevated blood pressure – with just one extra meal out a week raising the odds by six per cent, a study found. Eating out is associated with higher calorie, saturated fat and salt intake – all causes of high blood pressure. Scroll down for video . A study found that just one extra meal out a week raising the odds of having high blood pressure by six per cent. Stock photo . A team at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore found 27.4 per cent of the population suffered from pre-hypertension. Of these, 38 per cent ate more than 12 meals out per week, the American Journal of Hypertension reported. Professor Tazeen Jafar, of Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore (Duke-NUS), designed and supervised a study to find behaviour associated with hypertension in a young adult population in South East Asia. Her team surveyed 501 university students, aged 18 to 40, in Singapore. Figures on blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and lifestyle, including meals eaten away from home and physical activity levels, were collected. The association with hypertension was then determined. Researchers in Singapore found those who frequently dine out or feast on takeaways are more likely to have pre-hypertension. Stock photo . Using statistical analysis, the researchers found that pre-hypertension was found in 27.4 per cent of the total population, and 38 per cent ate more than 12 meals away from home per week; while the gender breakdown showed that pre-hypertension was much more prevalent in men (49 per cent) than in women (nine per cent). The findings showed those who had pre-hypertension or hypertension were more likely to eat more meals away from home per week, have a higher mean BMI, have lower mean physical activity levels, and be current smokers. The novel finding of the study, published online by the American Journal of Hypertension, was the link that Dr. Jafar's team was able to show between pre-hypertension and hypertension with meals eaten away from home. The researchers said that what was also significant was that even eating one extra meal out, raised the odds of pre-hypertension by six per cent. Dr Jafar said: 'While there have been studies conducted in the United States and Japan to find behaviours associated with hypertension, very few have surveyed a South East Asian population. 'Our research plugs that gap and highlights lifestyle factors associated with pre-hypertension and hypertension that are potentially modifiable, and would be applicable to young adults globally, especially those of Asian descent.' She said future studies should examine the effect of lifestyle modification programmes on blood pressure levels of at-risk people.","Those who often dine out are more likely to have elevated blood pressure .

"It was 25 years ago this week that the skeletal remains of a woman were found near Daytona Beach in Florida - and police are still trying to find out who she is, and who killed her. The Jane Doe was found in a wooded area in Volusia County on April 23, 1990. Investigators believe her badly decomposed remains, which consisted mostly just bones, had been there for up to eight weeks before they were discovered. The death was ruled a homicide and the case remains open, and police hope a new facial reconstruction using the latest technology with help them finally solve the murder. Unsolved homicide: Forensics have used the latest technology to reconstruct the skeletal remains of a woman found near Daytona Beach 25 years ago this week to produce this image. She was never identified . A forensic artist recently created a lifelike, computer-generated image of the woman’s face, which is the biggest development in the case in years,The Daytona Beach News Journal reported. The Jane Doe is described as between 25 and 40 years old, about 5-feet 4-inches in height and of a medium build. At the time of her death, her brown hair was tied into pig tails. According to forensics, the woman seems to have had multiple children. The new reconstruction shows the vast improvements in forensic science over the years. The last image, released in 2001, was done by a FBI-trained facial reconstruction artist using the victim's skull. Advancements: The last image of Jane Doe was done in 2001 using the controversial method of forensic facial reconstruction, which relies on the victim's skull and an artist building the face using clay .

"Dawn was breaking as we pulled out of Calvi station, and the town's medieval citadel, perched on a headland, was bathed in the rosy glow of the first rays of sunlight. Trundling along the coast on the narrow-gauge railway, I was heading deep into the mountains of central Corsica for a self-guided walking trip. 'Are you doing the GR20?' was the question on everyone's lips as soon as they spotted my hiking boots. I responded with an emphatic 'non'. The trail, which runs down the mountainous spine of the island, happens to be the toughest trek in Europe. The Corsican Mouflon, or mountain sheep, make easy work of the tough GR20 hiking trail . The GR20 trail runs down the mountainous spine of Corsica and happens to be the toughest trek in Europe . I had chosen a much gentler route, or so I thought. I was following the ancient Sentiers de Transhumance, footpaths used for more than 1,000 years by shepherds leading their animals to summer pastures. It started in the remote Golo Valley, a wild and desolate canyon flanked by barren cliffs. After trudging up a stony ledge high above the valley floor the first morning, I began to wonder what I had taken on. Over the following days I found myself scrambling over dry river beds, scaling rock-strewn gullies and clinging to cable handrails as I inched across wobbly suspension bridges. Everywhere I looked the views were jaw-dropping. Fortunately, I was travelling in comfort with my luggage transported from one hotel to the next, so all I needed was a daypack and water bottles filled to the brim. The Golo Valley, where the ancient Sentiers de Transhumance used for more than 1,000 years begins . Most of the trails were clearly marked with orange daubs of paint and I was equipped with maps and detailed instructions. Even so, there were times when I got hopelessly lost. Accommodation ranged from small auberges to family-run hotels. The first night I stopped at the Casa Balduina, a simple B&B in Calacuccia, where I was welcomed by owner Jeanne with Earl Grey tea and home-made fruitcake in her shady garden. Each morning I would set off early to avoid the blistering midday sun. The average hike was five to seven hours and at times I walked for ages without meeting another soul. The water below one of the hiking track's footbridges proves too enticing to not jump in for a swim . Sometimes I'd pause beside little packhorse bridges to dangle my feet in water that was as clear as gin. At the Piscine Naturelle, an emerald rock pool in the midst of the pine trees, I took a deep breath and plunged in up to my neck for a refreshing dip. It was cold as ice. I stayed at the Hotel Aitone further up the hillside which served hearty Corsican fare in its panoramic restaurant. Tucking into Civet de Sanglier, a wild boar casserole, I watched a crimson sun slip below the sea. Next day I decided to cheat and cut short the itinerary. After trekking through the beautiful Spelunca Gorge, I caught a cab to the seaside resort of Porto where a 16th Century Genoese tower stands guard over the harbour.

We sailed along the Calanques, a series of rocky inlets, caves and sea cliffs which have been sculpted into exotic shapes by constant erosion. It was as if Gaudi had fashioned battlements, spires and organ pipes. I was to see them close-up on my final hike along the cliffs to Les Roches Rouges Hotel in the village of Piana. Flinging open the shutters the last morning, I was greeted by an unforgettable sight. The entire Gulf of Porto lay below me. I promised myself I'd be back to do a coastal walk or - who knows - maybe I will attempt the GR20. The stunning coastline of Corsica that has been sculpted by constant erosion .

"A father has admitted killing his 13-year-old son by giving him a morphine tablet when the boy complained that he was feeling ill. Kevin Morton gave his son Kye Backhouse an extremely strong painkiller, a court heard - a mistake which he says he will 'have to try and live with it for the rest of my life'. He could now face jail after pleading guilty to manslaughter over the teenager's death at Preston Crown Court. Tragedy: Kevin Morton, right, has admitted killing his son Kye Backhouse, left, by giving him morphine . 'Happy-go-lucky' Kye was found dead at his home in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria in October last year. A previous court hearing was told that Morton, 49, gave his son a super-strength morphine tablet because he was feeling unwell. But police and ambulance were later called to the flat, where Kye was found dead and Morton was arrested after admitting he had given his son the painkiller. He confessed to his actions in a Facebook post in December, writing: 'I loved my little boy more than anyone in the world. Death: Kye, 23, complained of feeling unwell before his father gave him the strong painkiller . 'I gave him a tablet by mistake that was too strong for him, it's my fault - I have to try and live with it for the rest of my life but it was an accident.' After Kye's death, his family released a statement paying tribute to the schoolboy. 'The family is devastated at the sudden loss of Kye,' they said. 'He was the most amazing and much-loved young man that anybody could wish to meet - he made everyone around him smile every day and even now with him gone, he is remembered with a smile. 'The emptiness Kye has left in all our lives can only be understood by people who knew and loved him. We are so very proud of him and miss him deeply. 'We cannot even begin to express our feeling of loss - we ache to hold you once more. He was a kind and loving son, brother, grandson, cousin and nephew and a friend to many. 'Kye has left a big hole in the family and things will never be the same again.' During the latest court hearing, Morton hung his head as his barrister James Heyworth said his client made 'full and frank admissions' in police interviews. He was released on bail ahead of sentencing in June, but was warned that he is likely to face jail after pre-sentence reports are prepared for the court. Judge Anthony Russell QC told Morton: 'You have pleaded guilty to a very serious offence. 'As you appreciate, the likely outcome of this case is a custodial sentence. But it's important for the court to have as much information about you as possible in order to assess both the nature of the sentence and the length of it.'","Kevin Morton gave Kye Backhouse a strong painkiller when he was ill .

"A prankster who pretended he had put his girlfriend's dog in a washing machine got a very painful comeuppance after she glued him to a chair- naked. Dominika Petrinova, from the Czech Republic, was furious after her boyfriend Erik Meldik's prank, which went viral after he posted it online.

Dominika Petrinova decided to get her painful revenge by gluing wax strips to the plastic chair after her boyfriend's previous prank where he told her that their pet dog called Sam was in the washing machine . So Ms Petrinova had decided to exact her revenge in a painful prank of her own. This hilarious video shows her setting up the gag by super gluing the waxing strips to a plastic office chair.

But Ms Petrinova said she had decided the dog in the washing machine stunt was too much, and wanted to teach her boyfriend a painful lesson that he would not forget in a hurry. She said: 'I was really upset when I thought Sam was in the washing machine, and he was running after me saying he was sorry but he clearly wasn't because he was filming it and put it all online. 'Well, now I am pretty sure he is genuinely sorry.' He screams as he uses a set of drawers to try and yank himself off the strips which are stuck to his genitals . He finally pulls himself free leaving behind a fair portion of skin behind on the waxing strips in the process .

"Facinet Keita was representing Guinea in the 2012 Olympics when he was knocked out in the qualifying stages . An Olympic judo star from Africa is still fighting to stay in Britain – three years after flying here for the London Games then refusing to leave. Facinet Keita, 31, fled the Olympic village in summer 2012, claiming his failure to win a medal meant he ‘would be murdered’ if he returned to his native Guinea. His wife who was left to look after the couple’s two children has now split from him because she ‘couldn’t wait for him’. Mr Keita – the official flag-bearer for the West African nation during the opening ceremony – said he decided to go on the run after losing to an opponent from the Pacific island of Guam within five minutes. He said: ‘My coaches told me I had lost the fight like a baby. They said I embarrassed my country and I would be in big trouble when we are at home.’ After three months sleeping rough, Mr Keita handed himself in to authorities and was locked up in an immigration detention centre. While there he made two requests for asylum, both of which were rejected. After the second failed request, he was told he had to leave Britain on December 17, 2013. He agreed to board a plane to Ghana, but upon arrival there he said that he was turned back because he did not have the correct travel documents. He returned to Britain and was once again detained. However, he was released in March 2014 and has since been coaching judo in Stoke-on-Trent. He now plans to make a third application for asylum. Mr Keita said he has built a new life in Britain and has met friends who have become like family. ‘The people here are really welcoming, if you show them you are a good person,’ he added. Mr Keita was one of 20 Olympians who remained in Britain after the Games.

He is now being supported by an asylum seeker charity in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, while he applies for his third asylum application, after his first two bids and an appeal were refused . He is volunteering at a Sneyd Green Primary School Judo Club in Stoke (pictured) because he cannot earn a living pending his asylum application . Before travelling to the UK for the Olympics, he had won five national titles in Guinea and regularly appeared on TV. Mr Keita denies he has stayed in Britain to claim benefits. He said: ‘My situation is difficult, 100 per cent difficult. I want to be near my family and I want to see them but I can’t.’ His request to stay in Britain has been backed by the African Social Health Agency, which supports asylum seekers. It described Mr Keita as an asset to the local community. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We do not routinely comment on individual cases. 'The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and we consider every claim on its individual merits. 'When someone is found not to need our protection, we expect them to leave the country.'","Facinet Keita, 31, represented Guinea in Men's +100kg judo but lost bout .

"With many homes under the hammer this weekend, Australian capital cities can expect record-breaking profits on their properties at auctions across the country. A Pain and Gain report released by CoreLogic for the December quarter has revealed that home resales recording a gross loss were at an all time low with more properties making a decent profit. When being compared to their prior purchase price, only 8.6 percent of homes had recorded a loss and a shocking 32.3 percent had shown properties selling for more than double their original price. This home at 14 Ridge Street in South Perth was bought for 925,000 and rebuilt by the owners after knocking down the original home . It will go for auction between $3 and $4 million, with the current expected price being left as a surprise . The home is three storeys with garage parking for three cars and was built in 2007 . It boasts 5 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, library and fully fitted laundry, cellar, and home theatre . The total value of these profit making resales was over $17 billion, three and a half times more than the total of the loss-making resales at only $418 million. This made the average profit made on each of the successful properties was $251,696 with the average loss on the unsuccessful homes being $65,435. This is pretty good for those looking to sell up in capital cities, but not so good for those seeking to buy. The report showed that Sydney recorded the lowest loss-making resales at just 2.4 percent over the quarter which is down from 3.5 percent in a year. Perth and Melbourne also saw extremely low resale losses of 5.5 percent and 5.6 percent respectively. However this change in the market has not yet caught on in regional areas. An example of huge price increases – and profit margins for sellers – include a property at 6 Dudley St Bondi, purchased for $1.46 million in 2005 by and is expected to get over $3 million at auction this weekend. Another is a home at 14 Ridge Street in South Perth bought for 925,000 and rebuilt by the owners who are expecting to more than double the purchase price at auction on Saturday.

Across the regional market, homes tend to sell more regularly than in capital cities. At the end of 2014, homes were being owned for 10 years, whereas at the end of 1013, it was 9.6 years. Melbourne homes are held for longer than any other capital city with a current owning period of nearly 12 years.

"A 13-year-old Indian girl faced with an arranged marriage has written a letter to her teacher begging her to stop the wedding (stock image above) A 13-year-old Indian girl faced with an arranged marriage has written a letter to her teacher begging her to stop the wedding. Duli Hembrom wrote to the principal of Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya after failing to convince her parents to call off the wedding, which is due to take place in two days. She wrote: 'I do not want to get married, I took an oath at the time of admission that I will not get married before I turn 18.' She added that she wanted the teacher to stop the marriage 'whichever way possible', the India Times reported. It is thought the 'oath' Duli refers to is the school's promise she had to make when she started, but exactly what it included is not known. Her father Lachhu, who lives in Gudibanda with Duli's mother, said child marriage was a common phenomenon in their society. He told the Hindustan Times that it was difficult to find a suitable match for a grown-up girl. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. But the country has the second highest number of child marriages, according to a UN report. Nearly 52 per cent of girls are married before reaching 18 years old, Indian records show. Between 2011 and 2020 more than 140 million girls will become child brides globally, analysts estimate. Aarati Benera, a women’s rights activist, described child marriage as 'illegal and a social evil'. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Above, women and girls sit waiting to be married in a mass wedding ceremony in India . Despite numerous campaigns from many of the world's largest charities and NGOs, the issue of child brides remains a global concern. In 2013 there were around 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. This is despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed  during British rule in 1929, specifying that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Meanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old, analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households. And girls younger than 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s. Aarati Benera, a women’s rights activist, described child marriage as 'illegal and a social evil'.","Duli Hembrom wrote to the principal at Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya .

"Countdown co-presenter Rachel Riley was left embarrassed on a recent episode of the show when contestants offered up a rather rude eight-letter word as their answer to the word game. Host Nick Hewer faced a conundrum of his own as he tried, and failed, to stifle his giggles as a blushing Ms Riley spelt out the word 'erection'. Hewer, who first found fame as Lord Sugar’s sidekick in The Apprentice, was clearly trying not to laugh when Dubliner Gerry Tynan and Anne Lewin, from Brighton, both offered up the double entendre. Scroll down for video . Countdown co-presenter Rachel Riley looked embarassed when the two contestants  came up with the same eight-letter double entendre in the word game (pictured) as host Nick Hewer failed to stifle his laughter . Fortunately celebrity guest Dr Phil Hammond, who was in dictionary corner with Susie Dent, saved the day with nine letter word 'recondite'. It is not the first time the show's host has struggled to contain himself when a rude word has popped up - last year Hairy Biker Dave Myers offered up the seven-letter word 'todgers', causing much hilarity among the hosts. In February an English teacher shocked viewers when submitting the word 'm*nges', an expletive sometimes used to describe female genitalia. It is not the first time Nick Hewer (pictured) has struggled to contain himself when a rude word has popped up . In 1991, two contestants offered 'w***ers', and in 2010 another suggested 's**tface'. In 2010 the presenters looked uneasy when the letters U, D, F, C, K and E all came up in a selection - but luckily the contestants resisted the temptation to go for the obvious and instead submitted the five letter words 'caged' and 'faced'. It's not the first word to have left Rachel Riley blushing. The former Strictly Come Dancing star found herself stifling laughter after drawing the words 'p*ss' and 'a*se' shortly after replacing Carol Vorderman in 2009. During her 26-year stint, Ms Vorderman was left red-faced more than a few times. Words such as fart, porn and poo were among the collection of letters which had the Loose Women star and her co-hosts laughing. The Channel 4 afternoon show, which has been running since the station launched in 1982, recently picked up a Guinness world record when it reached its 6,000th episode. The words and number contest was launched with late presenter Richard Whiteley at the helm and has also been fronted by Des Lynam and Jeff Stelling. Countdown is on weekdays at 2.10pm on Channel 4.

"A senior Secret Service supervisor has been placed on indefinite administrative leave and is not allowed to enter the office after a female employee accused him of assaulting her at agency headquarters. The female agent alleged that she was attending a party with Xavier Morales, her boss, in a Washington, D.C. restaurant when he said he loved her and  wanted to have sex with her. After the two employees returned to the office from the party, Morales, 48, tried to kiss the woman and grabbed her arms when she resisted, according to two people briefed on her statement. Secret Service supervisor Xavier Morales, 48, has been placed on indefinite administrative leave after a female employee accused him of assaulting her at agency headquarters . The woman alleged that Morales did not relent until after a brief struggle, according to the Washington Post. The party, held on March 31 at the Capitol City Brewing Company, was being thrown in Morales' honor to celebrate his recent assignment to head the Louisville Secret Service field office. Morales, who was a manager in the agency's security clearance division, was due to start his new position this week. Instead, he had to turn in his gun and badge and had his security clearance suspended after Secret Service internal investigators began a preliminary review and conducted interviews in regards to the female agent's complaint, according to agency spokesman Brian Leary. Secret Service Director Joseph P. Clancy released a statement to the Washington Post saying the 'allegations as reported are very disturbing'. 'The Secret Service is an agency that demands that our employees conduct themselves with the highest level of integrity,' he said. 'Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.' Clancy had his investigators refer the case to the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, due to Morales' high rank. D.C. police have also been contacted due to the criminal nature of the allegations. The incident has come barely a month after two Secret Service employees crashed a government car into a White House barricade after drinking at an agency retirement party nearby. Morales, who is married to a longtime special agent, was responsible for determining which agents should lose their security clearance or jobs because of misconduct or other reason. The new position he was meant to start this week is considered a major stepping stone within the agency.

"More than 1,000 crimes have been created by the Coalition in a frenzy of law-making – including a ban on washing clothes in Trafalgar Square. The legislative splurge is equivalent to introducing a new law for every working day. In the Coalition agreement, the Tories and Lib Dems pledged to roll back Labour’s ‘state intrusion’, promising a bonfire of pointless powers. But research shows the Government has invented 22 ways of criminalising the public every month. The so-called crimes include diving into the Thames without authority, queue-jumping at a Tube station and hogging the middle lane of a motorway. Making it an offence to wash or dry clothes in Parliament or Trafalgar squares was designed to prevent protesters setting up camp at tourist spots. Offenders can be fined £200. Between May 2010 and May 2014 – the latest year for which information is available – ministers created 1,073 offences. During the 13 years Labour was in power, 4,300 offences were placed on the statute book – approximately one every day. Meanwhile, other antiquated laws remain in force that are simply baffling. Londoners planning to do some DIY can load timber straight into their car, but under section 54 of the Metropolitan Police Act 1839 it is illegal to carry a plank across a pavement, punishable with a £500 fine. Spring cleaning can also put a person on the wrong side of the law. Section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 makes it an offence to beat a carpet in a London street after 8am. Ben Rose, a partner at law firm Hickman & Rose, which carried out the research, said: ‘The law-making machine has become an unstoppable juggernaut.’ More than 1,000 crimes have been created by the Coalition in a frenzy of law-making – including a ban on washing clothes in Trafalgar Square (above) Josie Appleton, of the Manifesto Club, which campaigns against excessive regulation, said: ‘Creating so many trivial crimes brings the law into disrepute.’ The Ministry of Justice said 696 crimes had been removed from the statute books over the four-year period – meaning the net number of new laws was 377. Here are some of the more unusual crimes created since May 2010: . Old crimes still enforceable: .","Splurge is equivalent to introducing a new law for every working day .

"Almost half of headteachers have vacancies in English, maths and science departments amid a growing recruitment crisis in secondary schools. They are struggling to fill core teaching positions, with some posts attracting only one or two applicants. School leaders warn the 'bleak' situation is likely to worsen due to the rise in pupil numbers and 'greater competition' for graduates among employers. Almost half of headteachers have vacancies in English, maths and science departments amid a growing recruitment crisis in secondary schools . A survey by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) found that 44 per cent of respondents had vacancies in English, 52 per cent in maths and 50 per cent in science. Overall, 86 per cent had 'difficulty' recruiting teachers for core subjects. Meanwhile, 62 per cent had similar problems in non-core subjects. And 65 per cent said they believed recruitment was more difficult than in previous years. London schools are experiencing the most problems finding teachers in English, maths and science, followed by the North West and East of England. The non-core subjects facing recruitment difficulties include geography, design and technology, business studies, computer science, religious education and modern foreign languages. The survey received 97 responses from headteachers and groups of headteachers from local networks of schools. One leader of a secondary school in southern England said: 'I have advertised for a head of maths twice and so far only had one applicant. This is a non-selective comprehensive school which has been significantly above average for maths consistently in the last five years. 'Why wouldn't someone want to lead such a great team?' A headteacher in the East of England said: 'A recent advert for a head of English drew two candidates, both with insufficient relevant experience. 'Head of ICT/computing drew a field of two suitable candidates out of four applicants, and teacher of maths drew one suitable applicant from a pool of two. All in all it is very bleak and there is a distinct lack of choice.' A survey by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) found that 44 per cent of respondents had vacancies in English, 52 per cent in maths and 50 per cent in science . A headteacher in North Yorkshire claimed 'recruitment is becoming a significant factor in preventing school improvement'. He said: 'Maths, physics and now good-quality English candidates are in very short supply and schools in challenging circumstances are facing the future with little hope of recruiting credible candidates.' Meanwhile an assistant headteacher in the Midlands said their school – rated outstanding by Ofsted – only received two applications for a full-time English post. Brian Lightman, ASCL general secretary, said: 'The existing teacher supply model does not work. Schools all over the country are experiencing unprecedented difficulties recruiting trainees, qualified teachers, middle and senior leaders. 'The next government must act urgently to ensure that effective processes are put in place to model numbers of teachers needed in each sector and region, and then promote the status and value of teaching as a profession.' The union is drawing up a ten-point plan to deal with the recruitment crisis, proposing action by both teachers and politicians. It wants an expansion in school-led teacher training, the development of a core curriculum for teaching degrees and the launch of a campaign to attract new recruits.","School leaders warn the 'bleak' situation is likely to get even worse .
