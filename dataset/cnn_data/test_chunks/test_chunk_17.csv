"Manchester City bounced back from their recent 4-2 derby defeat by easing to victory against West Ham. An own goal by James Collins and Sergio Aguero's 20th Barclays Premier League strike of the season was enough to give City the three points. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates the players' performances at the Etihad Stadium. MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1) JOE HART 6 - The England goalkeeper couldn’t have wished for a quieter 28th birthday, and was rarely called into action by a toothless West Ham. PABLO ZABALETA 6.5 – Treated for bloody nose early on but that was about the extent of the damage inflicted on City. Got forward well as usual. Manchester City right back Pablo Zabaleta keeps Enner Valencia at bay by putting in a crunching challenge . MARTIN DEMICHELIS 6 – Careless slip let in Carlton Cole in the first half but otherwise looked relatively comfortable alongside a new defensive partner in Mangala. ELIAQUIM MANGALA 7 - Dominant display from City’s £32million defender who was able to enjoy a trouble-free return to the line-up, and snuffed out the few threats offered by the Hammers. ALEKSANDAR KOLAROV 6.5 – Went close with slightly deflected freekick and another effort from a tight angle in the second half. Defensively, faced little threat from Valencia. FRANK LAMPARD 6 – Only his fifth Premier League start for City and of lack match sharpness showed on occasions as his touch let him down. Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard was given a rare chance to impress by starting against West Ham . FERNANDO 6.5 – Didn’t have too much on his plate but was alert to track Kouyate’s burst from midfield in the first half and produced a fantastic interception tackle. JESUS NAVAS 8 – Much better from the little Spaniard. More direct and looked for an earlier pass, which contributed to both of City’s first two goals. Jesus Navas played a major role in Manchester City's two goals at the Etihad Stadium . YAYA TOURE 7 – A more lively display than of late from the much-maligned Ivorian who passed the ball well and his interception started the move for City’s second goal. DAVID SILVA 6.5 – Subdued display despite going close with a couple of efforts, and stretchered off following lengthy treatment after taking an elbow to the head from Kouyate. SERGIO AGUERO 7.5 – The Argentine’s third goal in two games took his total to 26 for the season, and the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 20. Can’t argue with that. Sergio Aguero celebrates with City team-mates Navas and Yaya Toure after putting his side 2-0 up . Manchester City ace Sergio Aguero wheels away in celebration after scoring his 20th Premier League goal . Subs: Caballero, Sagna, Boyata, Fernandinho (for Lampard 88), Nasri (for Silva 75, 6), Dzeko (for Aguero 90+1), Pozo. Scorers: Collins og 18, Aguero 36 . Booked: Navas, Silva . WEST HAM (4-1-4-1) ADRIAN 6 – Had little chance with either of City’s goals, particularly Collins’s own-goal which looped over his head and in off the underside of the bar. CARL JENKINSON 6 – One of West Ham’s better defenders and produced an excellent interception to deny Aguero an almost certain goal in the second half. JAMES COLLINS 5 – Won’t enjoy seeing a replay of his freakish own-goal. Almost redeemed himself with a great block on Silva – but not quite. West Ham centre back James Collins diverted the ball past Adrian to give Manchester City an early lead . WINSTON REID 5.5 – Did his best to hold City at bay but guilty of an awful dive in the dying stages that was thankfully ignored by the referee and ridiculed by the City fans. AARON CRESSWELL 5.5 – After his goalscoring exploits against Stoke last weekend, had a difficult afternoon up against Navas and struggled to cope at times. ALEX SONG 5 – Had his hands full trying to screen West ham’s defence against the blue tide in the first half and replaced by Jarvis as Big Sam tried to salvage something in the second. Alex Song, pictured with Lampard, was replaced by manager Sam Allardyce in the 66th minute . CHEIKHOU KOUYATE 6 – His arm into Silva’s face was the talking point of a dull game. It seemed to be more careless than malicious but City may think otherwise. MARK NOBLE 5 – Overrun in midfield and was able to offer his team very little. Struggled tpo get into the game at all. STEWART DOWNING 4.5 – Lost the ball in the build-up to City’s second goal and that summed up his performance. Below-par and lacked any impact at all. ENNER VALENCIA 6 – Anonymous in the first half but picked up a bit after the interval and had West Ham’s best effort with a fine individual run and shot. CARLTON COLE 4.5 – Was gifted the Hammers’ best opportunity in the first half but took too long to get a shot off. Struggled with little service and replaced by Nolan. Carlton Cole failed to impress on his first start  since his side's 0-0 draw with Southampton in February . Subs: Nolan (for Cole 66, 6), Jarvis (for Song 66, 6), Nene, O’Brien, Amalfitano, Jaaskelainen, Burke. Booked: Kouyate, Downing . Referee: Anthony Taylor 6.5 . Star man: Jesus Navas .","Man City bounced back from derby defeat with 2-0 win over West Ham .

"Winston Reid says West Ham no longer suffer from the fear factor that came with facing Manchester City as they prepare to visit the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. City had won their last five games against West Ham – by an aggregate score of 14-1 – before falling to just their second league defeat of the season at Upton Park in October. And after a recent run of form that has seen the Barclays Premier League champions lose six of their last eight games, Hammers defender Reid says he and his team-mates no longer dread facing Manuel Pellegrini’s side. Winston Reid says West Ham no longer suffer from a fear of facing Manchester City after beating them at last . West Ham celebrate after inflicting City's second league defeat of the season at Upton Park in October . City had won their last five games against West Ham - by an aggregate score of 14-1 - in dominant style . ‘Yeah,’ Reid said when asked whether the fear of facing City had gone. ‘When we beat them, we were having a good period ourselves and we need to get back to that. ‘I think of the last of those games last season where they tore us apart. The boys obviously said to themselves “we’ve got to do a bit more”. ‘We have to be at our best.’ While City are missing Wilfried Bony, Stevan Jovetic and James Milner through injury, principal threat Sergio Aguero is back in form after scoring twice last Sunday. But Reid – who kept the Argentine relatively quiet in October’s win – says he has the experience to know what to do against the Premier League’s joint-top goalscorer. ‘We’ve got to work hard, he’s pretty tough to play against,’ the New Zealand captain said. ‘We’ll see how we do. Reid battles with Marko Arnautovic during West Ham's clash with Stoke City last month . West Ham United players Diafra Sakho, Winston Reid and Mark Noble pose for photographers outside the Olympic Stadium the club are set to move into, with next season being their last at Upton Park . ‘He’s too quick for me, but you’ve just got to be in the right position. We’ve played against him a lot of times, so you just have to be in the right position and make sure you’re defending properly.’ Reid hopes to reach the peak of English football after signing a new six-year contract at West Ham. To start, and to take anything from the Etihad, the Hammers must remedy their late-goal curse which was topped by Marko Arnautovic’s 95th-minute equaliser for Stoke last week. Sergio Aguero will be City's principal threat and Reid says he has the experience to cope with his pace . Reid signed a new six-year deal with West Ham this year and is looking forward to staying with the Hammers . ‘The last games haven’t been the best but we believe in ourselves. We can go up there and do something,’ Reid said. ‘It’s something that we have to change.’ Manager Sam Allardyce agrees. ‘We had a brilliant performance (when beating City),’ he said. ‘It was hugely difficult but we managed to win it. We had a bit of luck which is always what you need against the big boys.’ West Ham manager Sam Allardyce hopes luck will be on the side of his team at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday .","West Ham no longer fear facing Manchester City, says Winston Reid .

"As one might imagine, Rafa Benitez's arrival at Stamford Bridge as interim manager in 2012 came as quite a slap in the face to Chelsea fans still hurting from Roberti Di Matteo's untimely departure just months after winning the Champions League. This was a man who had beaten the Blues in two Champions League semi-finals with drab defensive tactics - meaning that a sub-standard Liverpool side reached two finals, while Jose Mourinho's team of world class individuals missed out. As expected, we didn't warm to Rafa when he walked out for his first game at the Bridge. He had made a number of derogatory comments about the club during his Liverpool days and was rightly given a frosty reception. Rafa Benitez is set to leave Napoli this summer and will have a host of clubs after his services . Benitez was made Chelsea interim manager in 2012 but it's fair to say the fans never warmed to him . Cody Taylor is a fan writer on 90min.com . He did little to bring the support on-side in his the first few weeks either. Chelsea drew Benitez's first two games 0-0, before a 3-1 defeat against West Ham in a London derby - embarrassing. The only thing is, in the end he managed to get the job done and it would be the same for another club today. Rafa never liked being called the 'interim' manager, in fact he made a point of letting people know the title irked him, but he was brought in on a mission to keep the club on course until the end of the season. It wasn't pretty, but that was exactly what he did. Rafa also managed to get a better return from Fernando Torres - a player that was pretty much useless at Chelsea before and after. The season even ended with another European trophy. People often forget that in 2011/12 Chelsea finished 6th in the Premier League - the lowest in 10 years - a fact conveniently masked by two cup wins. In 2012/13 Rafa ensured Chelsea finished 3rd and got an automatic pass back into the Champions League group stage when there was big pressure from Arsenal and Tottenham. As Chelsea fans, we certainly didn't like him, but looking back we hate to think what might have happened without him. Benitez got the best out of his squad for the rest of the season and he got the best out of Fernando Torres . Chelsea won the Europa League in 2013 under Rafa Benitez after beating Benfica in Amsterdam . One Chelsea fan thanks Benitez for his efforts on the last day of the season in 2013 at Stamford Bridge . The rumours are that he could now be on for a return to the Premier League - he knows English football inside out and would actually be perfect for several clubs. Manchester City is one possible destination - he'd probably do a similar interim job there while they wait for Pep Guardiola - and Newcastle is another. The reality is that while Rafa possibly wouldn't be a popular choice at either, he would give both clubs exactly what they need. City require an experienced and pragmatic stop-gap that knows how to keep things ticking over until they can land their superstar. Newcastle need someone who can get the best out of a talented group of players that are significantly underachieving at this moment in time. In that respect Rafa certainly made sure Liverpool punched above their weight. People don't like to admit it, but he's a good manager and probably deserves his chance in the Premier League again.","Rafa Benitez's contract at Napoli expires this summer and he is set to leave .

"Yaya Toure's agent has called Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini a 'weak manager' and criticised the club's chief executive Ferran Soriano and director of football Txiki Begiristain. Toure's performances have come under the microscope amid a dismal run for City which has seen them go from title contenders to being in a battle simply to finish in the top four. But agent Dimitri Seluk has claimed the club are trying to make Toure a scapegoat for bigger problems behind the scenes. The agent of Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (left) has called Manuel Pellegrini, his manager, 'weak' Pellegrini has struggled this with the  champions this season, and Dimitri Seluk has placed blame on him . 'Some people at City are trying to blame Yaya for what has happened this season,' he said. 'But those people aren't taking responsibility for their own mistakes. 'I am talking about executives who have bought players for a lot of money - and then put those players on the bench. Executives who spend a lot of money on Stevan Jovetic and then drop him from the Champions League squad. I feel sorry for Pellegrini. He's a good coach, but a weak manager. 'He won the title with the team left behind by (predecessor) Roberto Mancini.' Toure, whose relationship with the club came under strain last summer, has been linked with a move away this summer, with Mancini making clear his interest in signing the 31-year-old for Inter Milan. Seluk said that it was wrong to criticise Toure over City's struggles and blamed the manager and executives . Pellegrini was described as a good coach but a weak manager by Toure's agent in a scathing attack . 'If City want Yaya to leave, they should come out and say so,' Seluk told the Sunday Mirror. 'Two of the biggest clubs have already asked me if he is available, and I know that if City would sell, another 10 would call me inside 24 hours.' City go into Sunday afternoon's match against West Ham four points above fifth-placed Liverpool and with the pressure firmly on Pellegrini. Txiki Begiristain (left) Manchester City's director of football, Ferran Soriano (centre) the CEO were criticised . Seluk picked out the decision to buy Stevan Jovetic and then leave him out of the Champions League squad . The Chilean has maintained he is not worried about his job, but admitted that could change if they dropped out of the Champions League places. 'You are wrong if you think that, at this club, if you don't win the title then you are out,' he said in a number of national newspapers. 'If we miss the top four then maybe it will be different because that would not be the same thing, the analysis of the season will be different.'","Manchester City are willing to listen to offers for Yaya Toure this summer .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said he was unfazed by his side's staggeringly low possession stat during the 1-0 win over Manchester United and all that mattered to him was achieving a positive result. The Blues, who secured victory through forward Eden Hazard's first-half strike, held the ball for just 29 per cent of the match at Stamford Bridge -  their lowest total over 90 minutes since Opta started recording this sort of data in 2006. United were also able to string together over 400 more successful passes than the home side. Mourinho, though, insisted that his team's priority was to win the game and not concern themselves with statistics. Presented with United's dominance of possession, the Portuguese responded passionately. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says he is unconcerned by statistics and only cares about getting results . Mourinho gestures on the touchline as he watches his side beat Manchester United 1-0 at Stamford Bridge . Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (left) dribbles with the ball ahead of Manchester Untied's Wayne Rooney (right) Hazard celebrates scoring the only goal against Manchester United as Chelsea edge towards the league title . 'They could have 99 (per cent). It was no problem,' he said. 'When you decide to play the game strategically, you don't care about stats, you just care about the points.' With Chelsea's last seven league victories all coming by a single goal margin, it would be hard to argue Mourinho is anything but sincere. He continued: 'We were very well prepared for this game. We were able to make some of their important players disappear.' Indeed, Mourinho's bold decision to play Kurt Zouma in an enforcing midfield role really paid off to stifle United's attack. Chelsea's win over the Red Devils sees them extend their lead at the top of the Premier League table to 10 points. Mourinho's men could wrap up the title as early as April 29, should they win their next two games against Arsenal and Leicester City. Chelsea have not won the Premier League since 2010 under former boss Carlo Ancelotti, but given their lead at the top and with only six games left to go, it would take a brave man to bet against them missing out this term. Hazard, in particular, has impressed for the Blues throughout the campaign and is being hotly tipped to win the PFA Player of the Year award.

"Stoke boss Mark Hughes has dismissed the latest reports linking Asmir Begovic with a move away from the Britannia Stadium. There has been fresh talk this week of Real Madrid being interested in the goalkeeper, with it even being suggested in Spain that talks had opened between the club, Begovic's representatives and his current employers. But, at his press conference to preview Saturday's Barclays Premier League home clash with Southampton, Hughes said: 'There will be a lot of stories bandied about, but I would take that one with a pinch of salt to be perfectly honest. I don't think that is true.' Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic has been linked with a summer move to Spanish giants Real Madrid . The Bosnia international has been one of the Premier League's most consistent keepers . Potters boss Mark Hughes has played down reports of Begovic leaving the Brittania Stadium . Begovic is out of contract in 2016 and Hughes has repeatedly emphasised his optimism the 27-year-old Bosnia international will sign a new deal with Stoke this summer. 'We are scheduled to have talks with Asmir's people in the next few weeks I think,' the manager said on Friday. 'I think both parties have stated that probably at the end of the season those talks will come to a conclusion, and we are very hopeful Asmir will stay here. 'There will be speculation around better players at football clubs, and we are no different. He has attracted attention because he is an outstanding goalkeeper.' In terms of other potential items of summer business, Hughes is also hopeful Stoke will wrap up the signing of teenage winger Moha El Ouriachi from Barcelona. It was reported earlier this week that the 19-year-old Moroccan-born player was bound for the Potters this summer after deciding joining them was a better option than accepting the new contract offer made to him by Barca. And Hughes said on Friday: 'There is a hope that we will be able to conclude that deal.' Barcelona B winger Moha El Ouriachi is set to sign for Stoke City, according to the player's agent . Stoke have already signed Bojan Krkic and Marc Muniesa from Barcelona in the last two years . The Welshman, who is a former Barcelona striker and who has previously signed forward Bojan Krkic and defender Marc Muniesa for Stoke from the Catalan outfit, added: 'We are trying to improve the quality of the Under-21 group and he (El Ouriachi) is a good young player. 'He is one we think we can bring to the club, so we will try to pursue that one and it looks very hopeful. 'He is predominantly left-footed, has good ability one on one and has good pace. He ticks a lot of the boxes in terms of what we are looking for in young players. 'If we can get it concluded, once he is here then we hope to develop him and push him towards the first team if we can. 'He is not one that is going to go straight into my team, but it is with a view that in the future it will happen.' Stoke will be without Muniesa and winger Victor Moses for Saturday's contest. Stoke will be without winger Victor Moses after the Chelsea loanee picked up a hamstring injury . Muniesa misses out due to a slight hamstring strain, while on-loan Moses has returned to parent club Chelsea because of a hamstring problem of his own that is expected to keep him sidelined for the rest of the season. Defenders Marc Wilson and Erik Pieters are both nursing knocks to the wrist but Hughes feels the pair should be available for the visit of the Saints. Meanwhile, Potters forward Peter Odemwingie returned to full training on Thursday as his recovery from the knee injury that has kept him sidelined since August goes on, with a return to first-team action before the end of the campaign his target. As a club, 10th-placed Stoke are continuing to work towards the goal of bettering their record Premier League haul of 50 points achieved last season when Hughes guided them to their best finish in the division of ninth. Nigerian forward Peter Odenwingie has returned to training after a lengthy spell on the sidelines . They currently have 43 points and the game against sixth-placed Southampton is the first of six more games they have left to play this term. Hughes' men have not won in their last four matches but picked up their first point in that sequence last time out with a 1-1 draw at West Ham, and he is adamant the campaign is not petering out. 'We have our own things we want to chase and achieve this year,' Hughes said. 'They are still very much there for us, so the challenge is to keep our focus. 'I was really pleased with the performance at West Ham. If we were a team looking ahead to the summer break, we wouldn't have been able to score as late as we did (stoppage time).'","Mark Hughes has played down reports linking keeper with Real Madrid .

"He could have put it anywhere really. Stuck it away simply, without too much fuss. Yes, there was a goalkeeper still to beat but running straight on to the target, not a blue shirt in range, the odds were most certainly with Luis Suarez. Yet every great player has a showman inside and the Uruguayan is no exception. His finish — curled into the top corner, right-footed, inch perfect, yet explosive — was a moment of pure pleasure, a flourish that will not be forgotten. It was also Barcelona’s third — probably the goal that puts this tie beyond reach. Here was a goal-scorer at the top of his game, playing for a club that now brings the best out of him.

BY ADAM CRAFTON . Lionel Messi is playing with joy again, and bringing the best out of Neymar and Suarez, too. The Catalans have scored more goals than any Champions League team away from home this season — and all have come from their forward trio. Suarez has 11 goals in his last 11 games for Barcelona, and six in six in the Champions League. Liverpool fans will not enjoy hearing this, but he seems at home. So maybe it has something to do with the players after all. Suarez wasn’t schooled in tiki-taka or the Barcelona way, but the combination of an energetic high pressing game married to quite gorgeous technique and invention fits him like a glove. As Barcelona’s old boss, Pep Guardiola, struggled with his new group against Porto, Barcelona marched on, their philosophy enduring beyond coaches or academies. They buy great players, and these players often do great things. That is the Barcelona way too. Paris St-Germain got a late and lucky consolation goal that some will feel keeps this tie competitive, but for those of a more earthbound persuasion it is hard to see it as anything but over. Suarez killed it with his two goals leaving PSG to seek a 3-0 win at the Nou Camp inside 90 minutes to progress. And they haven’t got nil in them — not against this trio. David Luiz was Suarez’s victim here, and he took chunks out of his reputation, without so much as a baring of teeth. For once, though, sympathy was with the Brazilian. A hamstring injury was due to keep him out for a month — and that was just 10 days ago. Shorn of key individuals by injury and suspension, Laurent Blanc started with Luiz on the bench — and was forced to promote him to the action after 21 minutes when Thiago Silva limped out of the game. Barcelona were already ahead by then and instantly one feared for Luiz against opponents with such flair and movement. It took a while, but eventually those fears were realised. Luiz, to his credit, was up for it — he just wasn’t up to it, which is different entirely. Suarez would have known that, and known Luiz’s defensive frailties even when fit from his time in the Premier League, and the way the goals were scored suggested he had no compunction capitalising on it either. Suarez scores his first goal of the night to make it 2-0 to Barcelona after bustling past three PSG defenders . Suarez nutmegs Luiz wide on the right touchline on his way to scoring Barcelona's second goal of the evening . Suarez runs away to celebrate his goal as he joined by his ecstatic team-mate Neymar, who had earlier made it 1-0 to Barcelona . Suarez is mobbed by his jubilant Barcelona team-mates after his first goal as they enjoy their trip to France . Basically, to get nut-megged once is unfortunate; to have it happen twice suggests someone is trying to make you look a twit. This was street football — and not for the first time Luiz was cast as the plaything of a hapless gamer. What skill by Suarez, though. Collecting the ball on the right flank, he turned and put it through Luiz’s legs, leaving him helpless and unable to recover. Suarez then held off two PSG players as he darted through the tightest of gaps into the penalty area, finishing past an equally defeated keeper Salvatore Sirigu. His next was even better. Through the middle, charging directly at Luiz, embarrassing him with a nutmeg again, before finishing in style, an absolute gem of a goal. It is hard to imagine how, even with the fillip of Gregory van der Wiel’s deflected shot, PSG can claw this back. Blanc’s team have enormous spirit as Chelsea discovered and held their end up here, too, but Barcelona simply have too much class. They took their chances and PSG did not — a fatal flaw with the odds already stacked against them. Neymar (centre) opens the scoring for Barcelona after just 18 minutes with a side-foot shot into the bottom right hand corner of the goal .

Neymar is mobbed by Barcelona team-mate Messi, who provided the assist for the Brazilian's goal . Barcelona worked the ball well for Neymar to open the scoring - CLICK HERE to read our brilliant match zone from the game . Edinson Cavani was the prime culprit and he had a night of clumsy control and missed opportunity when it mattered most. Javier Pastore, too. Eric Cantona says that he is the best player in the world, better than Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo — but not all of Eric’s statements are shot through with wisdom. Pastore set the tone for PSG in front of goal, by making a hash of their first chance of the night. When they did finally score it was only because a tame shot by Van der Wiel took a spiteful deflection off substitute Jeremy Mathieu. Barcelona started well and could have gone ahead when Messi hit a post with a curling 20-yard shot after 14 minutes. It served as a warning and four minutes later Barcelona went ahead. The move began, as so many do, with Sergio Busquets breaking up play. From there, Barcelona countered with terrifying speed, Messi feeding Neymar, who finished astutely with only Sirigu to beat. He could have had another after 26 minutes when a fine jinking run forced a good save. Javier Pastore fluffs his lines as he misses a brilliant chance to put PSG 1-0 up against the run of play . Gregory van der Wiel's (left) late deflected effort gave PSG a glimmer of hope ahead of the second leg next week . Shortly before half-time the Italian was needed again, when Luiz took on too much sweeping up at the back and was caught in possession by Suarez. He curled a shot which Sirigu plucked out of the air, the last time he would get the better of their exchanges. Not everything Barcelona does is beautiful, however. Jordi Alba’s dive under pressure from Thiago Silva after five minutes was deeply unimpressive and deserved a booking. Mark Clattenburg, the referee, ducked out of that one, although he did later book Messi. One to tell the grandkids, no doubt, although they might be more interested in a retelling of Suarez’s goals.

"Coach Leonardo Jardim believes Monaco's march to the Champions League quarter-finals is proof that clubs do not have to splash the cash in order to achieve European success. Four years have passed since Dmitry Rybolovlev's takeover prompted a slew of big-name arrivals at the Stade Louis II, with the likes of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho signed for hefty transfer fees. But the Russian billionaire has tightened the purse strings in recent seasons and, with most of Monaco's expensive signings subsequently moving on, Jardim has been forced to nurture young talent after finding his options in the transfer market somewhat restricted.

Promoter Bob Arum, who was also on the call, then got frustrated when the first caller in the queue wasn't someone who was supposed to be in line to ask a question. 'Let's reorganise and do this call some other time, please,' Arum said. Samuels said there were so many people calling in that some were unable to get on the call.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger accepted his side were 'a bit lucky' after a fumble from Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici handed them a 2-1 extra-time victory and a place in the FA Cup final. The Gunners will head back to Wembley on May 30 aiming to defend the trophy after edging past the Sky Bet Championship side, who had rallied after going behind just before half-time to a fine goal from Alexis Sanchez. Reading drew level on 54 minutes when Garath McCleary's volley was deflected past goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who could only palm the ball back over the line. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger accepted his side were 'a bit lucky' to beat Reading on Saturday . Wenger's side failed to hit the level seen in recent games against Reading at Wembley . Although Arsenal did twice hit the woodwork through a header from defender Gabriel, which was touched onto the crossbar by Federici at full stretch, and a close-range shot by Aaron Ramsey, the Barclays Premier League side could not find a winner in normal time. In the end, an error from Australian Federici proved so costly, the keeper allowing a low, angled shot from Sanchez to slip through his legs and roll over the line on 115 minutes. 'It was a difficult game against a well organised, resilient, committed and physically strong Reading team,' Wenger said. 'They really wanted it Reading, they were willing to die on the pitch to go to the final and you have to congratulate them for the effort they put in. 'In the end, we were a bit lucky because their keeper made a mistake and I can understand that he is distraught, but as well he kept them in the game for long periods.' Wenger added: 'What was missing was a bit of speed of combination and sharpness in the final third maybe, but overall the concentration was there. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game . Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp . 'I don't think we switched off (for the goal), but after half-time we did not come on with the same intensity. We started to suffer and we paid for that.' Wenger refused to single out Szczesny for blame on the Reading goal. 'I would have to see it again,' he said. 'At first I thought it was not in because it took some time for the referee to give the goal, so I thought 'okay, we escaped'. Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal . 'But on slow motion maybe he goes back a bit to save the ball with his feet, then when the ball bounces, it was certainly over the line. 'We will have to analyse it, but the cross should not have come in and after the guy was free, so it was a combination of mistakes.' Wenger said an ankle injury to defender Per Mertesacker 'does not look good', which could make the German defender a doubt for Sunday's Barclays Premier League game against leaders Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. The Reading goalkeeper, who had been magnificent until then, left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him . Arsenal reached a record 19th FA Cup final, and will be looking to overtake Manchester United's mark of 11 victories, with five coming under Wenger's tenure. 'Now, let's focus on our next game, we come back here in the final, but we have time to prepare,' Wenger said. 'The final is a 50-50 (game). If we can beat the record we will be very happy. 'Let's hope we have all of our players available and come back in good shape.' Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved . Chelsea look in a strong position to go on and win the title, having defeated United 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening.

"A stern defensive line has twice helped Jose Mourinho and Chelsea to Premier League glory, with a third likely to follow upon the resolution of the 2014-15 campaign. Statistics show the Chelsea manager is the best in Premier League history at shutting out opponents, edging out the man he replaced upon returning to London for his second stint at Chelsea, Rafa Benitez. Of the 189 Premier League matches the Portuguese has overseen, he has an astounding 101 clean sheets, nullifying his rivals in 53.4 per cent of games. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has the best clean sheets percentage record in  Premier League history . A stubborn defence has twice helped Mourinho win the league, with a third likely at the end of the season . Mourinho (left) beats Rafa Benitez in the clean sheets record and average of goals conceded . Benitez has 13 more, 114 from 254 matches with Liverpool and Chelsea, keeping out his opponents in 44.9 per cent of his games. From his 133 games at Manchester City, Roberto Mancini edged out Sir Alex Ferguson by 0.1 per cent. Ferguson retired at Old Trafford with 359 shut-outs and clean sheet percentage of 44.3, but Mancini had 44.4 per cent with 59 from 133. Mourinho also heads the list of managers with the lowest average of goals conceded per game, with 0.63. His Chelsea teams have collectively only conceded a stubborn 120 times under his guidance. Again, Benitez is second but with a much bigger difference, as the Spaniard averages 0.82 goals every Premier League encounter.

"Floyd Mayweather has taken a very public swipe at his 'haters' ahead of his fight-of-the-century bout with Manny Pacquiao next month. The 38-year-old boxer has shared a video flaunting his diamond-encrusted watches, fleet of super-cars and carpets of cash on his Instagram account. The 15-second video shot by director James 'JP' Dayap, a proud member of The Money Team brand owned by Mayweather, hits out at his supposed haters. Scroll down for videos . Cash: Floyd Mayweather (pictured) has shared a video to his 5 million Instagram followers where he hits back at his supposed 'haters' Party: The 15-second video showing off his extravagant lifestyle even features a room full of half-naked girls twerking (pictured) for his amusement . Fighting talk: The word 'haters' appears at the start of the video, leaving no doubt about who it is directed at . Wealth: Rapper Yo Gotti's song blares over footage of the five-division champion inspecting his fleet of super cars (pictured) Petrol head: Mayweather then walks past another row of expensive cars which seem to include Porsches and Ferraris . Bling: The footage which was shot and edited by director James 'JP' Dayap - a proud member of Mayweather's The Money Team brand - features rows of jewel-encrusted watches . Super-fight: The 38-year-old boxer (pictured) is expected to earn around £120million for his upcoming bout against Manny Pacquiao . Rapper Yo Gotti's song blares over the footage of Mayweather's opulent life and essentially lists his many expensive possessions which include: 'Big crib, ten cars, twenty acres.' As the lyrics boast 'I could write a book about money', the five-division world champion sits at his coffee table counting his endless piles of cash. The video then cuts to rows of luxurious Rolex watches adorned with jewels and Mayweather standing proudly in front of his Las Vegas mansion. A few seconds of the video even show four half-naked women twerking, supposedly for the boxer's pleasure. It surfaces just two weeks before one of the most anticipated fights in recent boxing history, when he takes on eight-division champion Manny Pacquiao. With the two fighters' management teams and the hosts MGM Grand locked in a stand-off between ticket allocations, they have yet to go on public sale.

Business: Mayweather's The Money Team clothing brand (logo pictured) has been worn by stars like Justin Bieber and billionaire Warren Buffet . 'Normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight,' according to Connor Gregoire, an analyst for SeatGeek. He added: 'It is bizarre... To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.' Tickets for the fight were expected to cost between £1,000 and £5,000 in the 16,500-seat Grand Garden arena in the Las Vegas Casino. But those prices have incredibly tripled in the resale market before they have even gone on public sale. Mayweather's promoter said that tickets would go on sale this week for the May 2 fight but MGM Grand's officials have been tight-lipped about their availability. Scenic: Near the end of the video, the legendary boxer surveys a beautiful scene from a balcony . Rich: Mayweather shared a video flaunting his diamond-encrusted watches, fleet of super-cars and luxurious properties with his Instagram followers . The hotel issued a statement on Friday saying there would be a 'limited number of tickets available for sale' and that it is working with promoters to finalise a date for their release. Meanwhile Pacquiao's manager blamed the opposing fighter's camp for holding up the ticket sales, claiming they refused to sign an agreement drawn up months ago. Michael Koncz said: 'It's a real mess right now... I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the hold up? 'Millions of dollars are at stake in the dispute because after the MGM takes its share, each camp gets a certain percentage of tickets and is able to resell them with ticket brokers for higher prices.","He released the video flaunting his wealth to 5 million Instagram followers .

"Atletico Madrid are meeting with representatives of Palermo over the signing of Argentine forward Paulo Dybala, according to reports in Spain. Dybala, whom the Serie A club value at £29m, has also been linked with Arsenal and Chelsea but it seems the La Liga side are in the box seat. AS report that a representative for Palermo, Gustavo Mascardi, is in Madrid and is set to meet the Atletico hierarchy on Friday. Atletico Madrid are in talks to sign Palermo's Paulo Dybala, according to reports in AS . Argentine Paulo Dybala has attracted interest from a number of leading European clubs . He will then report back to Palermo president Mauricio Zamparini and to Dybala, who has scored 13 goals in 30 matches this season. Dybala, 21, has made clear his desire to play Champions League football and isn't short of interest, with Juventus, Roma, Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain all in the race. Elsewhere, AS profile the Porto coach Julen Lopetegui, who masterminded their 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night. 'Lopetegui grows and grows,' they say on their front page, linking him with the Real Madrid job that might become vacant this summer. Lopetegui represented Real as a player and also coached their B team in the 2008-09 season. Marca report that Real boss Carlo Ancelotti has upset Isco by demanding that he rediscovers the 'defensive intensity' that made his 'an undisputed starter.' They also focus on the race between the stars of Real and Barcelona to reach 100 goals for the season. At the moment, Barca's deadly trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar have 91 goals to the 88 of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema.

"Manchester City have 'let themselves down' this season and the squad have had 'a lot of honest conversations' since the 4-2 defeat at Manchester United nine days ago, says England goalkeeper Joe Hart. The Premier League champions have had a disappointing campaign under manager Manuel Pellegrini and are down in fourth position, 12 points behind runaway leaders Chelsea with five matches left to play. 'We are not in the place where we wanted to be, we wanted to be really challenging for the title like we've done in previous years,' Hart told the club website on Tuesday.

We've let ourselves down at key moments. 'It's a difficult league to win. The two times we've won it, it's gone right to the wire,' Hart added of their title triumphs in 2012 and 2014. 'This season, in a lot of games we've played well but teams have tended to raise their game against us. It's just how it is, that's not me moaning.' Hart said the defeat at third-placed United earlier this month was a particularly tough pill for him and his team mates to swallow.

'There's been a lot of reflection, a lot of honest conversations. It was a tough result to take. 'This is my club. It was a bad result to lose with the great rivalry we have and the positions in the league.'

"Mixed martial arts fighter Anderson Silva will meet with Brazilian taekwondo officials in the hope of competing in next year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, despite facing a possible doping ban. Silva this week expressed his desire to represent Brazil in the 2016 Games, and local taekwondo officials said they like the idea of having the MMA fighter on the team. The Brazilian taekwondo confederation said Wednesday that 'this wonderful possibility' of Silva competing in the Olympics will be discussed next week between the fighter and local officials. Anderson Silva (right) will meet with taekwondo officials in the hope of competing in next year's Olympics . The 40-year-old Silva began his career as a taekwondo fighter and is a black belt in the sport. He is an ambassador for taekwondo in Brazil. Silva, who is currently suspended by UFC after failing drug tests, said in a letter to the taekwondo confederation that it would be 'an immense pleasure' to be part of the Brazilian team in Rio. 'Everybody knows that every top athlete dreams about the Olympic Games,' Silva said. 'As an ambassador to the sport, and with the games taking place in my country, I'm even more motivated by the Olympic spirit.' Silva said he would compete with all his 'esteem, strength and honor.' On Wednesday, he posted on his official Twitter account a photo of himself practicing taekwondo. Silva tested positive for two steroids in an out-of-competition test Jan. 9, and also failed a test after his UFC victory over Nick Diaz on Jan. 31. The 40-year-old Brazilian posted a photo of himself practising taekwondo on Wednesday . The Brazilian later said in a statement that he always 'played clean' and 'never used any substances' to improve his performances, and that he was 'still waiting for the results and analysis from the specialists that are working to reveal the truth.' Silva has a hearing scheduled for May on the doping allegations. Silva is considered one of the best pound-for-pound mixed martial arts fighters in the history of the sport, . The former middleweight champion returned to the cage in January after breaking his lower left leg more than a year ago. He beat Diaz but the victory was quickly overshadowed by the doping headlines that surfaced shortly after the fight. Silva delivers a flying knee against Nick Diaz in their middleweight bout in Las Vegas in January . According to the Brazilian taekwondo confederation, its president Carlos Fernandes was 'pleased' to receive Silva's proposal, but many details still must be discussed before his participation in the games can become a reality. There are doubts about Silva's eligibility for the games, as well as about his form, considering he hasn't competed in taekwondo events in a long time. 'He is a great MMA athlete, but taekwondo has its own characteristics, so I'm sure he is not ready yet to compete for a spot in the team,' Lucas Ferreira, one of the other Brazilian taekwondo fighters hoping to participate in the Olympics, told Globoesporte.com. 'He will have to fight for a spot like everybody else. If he proves he deserves to make it, then great.' Another Brazilian fighter, Guilherme Felix, said it wouldn't be ethical for Silva to earn a spot in the Olympics 'without showing the results for it.'","Anderson Silva is currently suspended by UFC after failing drug tests .

"AP McCoy landed the second win of his last Aintree meeting thanks to a trainer he will be praying doesn’t win Saturday's Crabbie’s Grand National. Irishman Gordon Elliott trains Cause of Causes, a gelding owned by McCoy’s boss JP McManus and one of the mounts he could have taken in the race instead of Shutthefrontdoor. McCoy won on board Elliott’s Don Cossack, who took apart a strong Melling Chase field with a 26-length defeat of Cue Card. AP McCoy celebrates after winning the Melling Chase race at Aintree on Friday . McCoy rode Don Cossack to victory as he prepares for his final Grand National on Saturday . Afterwards, Elliott, enjoying his third winner of the meeting and the man who trained 2007 National winner Silver Birch, preferred to concentrate on Don Cossack’s win rather than the National jockey arrangements. Elliott, who has booked Paul Carberry to ride Cause of Causes, said: ‘We have got Paul which is good but if we had AP it would have been twice as good. ‘They make their decisions and we will enjoy today and worry about tomorrow tomorrow.’ A dramatic race saw Balder Succes fall at the third fence and Sire De Grugy come down at the sixth. McCoy settled the matter with a decisive move entering the home straight. Don Cossack’s only defeat in six runs this season came when he did not show his best and ended up third to Uxizandre in the Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival. Don Cossack ridden by McCoy (second left) leads the field on the way to victory at Aintree . McCoy jumps the final fence on Don Cossack as he rides to victory in the Melling Steeple Chase . Elliott added: ‘Two years ago I said he was the best horse we have ever had. We had a bad season with him but he has proven how good he is. It will be the Gold Cup next season.’ McCoy’s penultimate ride over the Grand National fences ended in disappointment when Eastlake was pulled up in an action-packed Topham Chase in which only 10 of the 30 starters completed. Success went to Nicky Henderson’s Rajdhani Express, who overhauled long-time leader Fairy Rath after the last. It was a sixth win in races over the famous Aintree fences for amateur jockey Sam Waley-Cohen, who rides Oscar Time in today’s big race. Meanwhile, also Gold Cup-bound next season is Paul Nicholls-trained Saphir Du Rheu, 15-length winner of the Grade One Betfred Mildmay Novices’ Chase under Sam Twiston-Davies. Twenty four hours earlier, a second consecutive success for Silviniaco Conti in Thursday’s Betfred Bowl, along with the fact that the gelding has been beaten three times in the Gold Cup, had left Nicholls feeling he did not have a contender for next season but all that has changed now. Nicholls said: ‘After yesterday, I didn’t think we had a Gold Cup horse but we definitely do now. This is a very special horse.’ The day for jockey Brian Hughes had started badly when he took a fall from a hunter while riding as a guest of former Aintree chairman Lord Daresbury, bashing his nose and lip. But it also proved to be a lucky omen. The last time Hughes had ridden out on the Daresbury estate before Aintree, he landed the 2010 Topham Chase on Always Waining. This time he followed it with success on Cyrius Darius in the Grade Two E-Lites Top Novices’ Hurdle. It was a second race win of the meeting for Hughes, who rides outsider Ely Brown in the National. Winning trainer Malcolm Jefferson said: ‘I would love to have a nice two-mile chaser and he could be the one.’ liRISH jockey Robbie McNamara was last night considered very doubtful to take the ride on top weight Lord Windermere after being taken to hospital following a fall in the first race at Wexford. Also, Wayne Hutchinson must receive medical clearance to ride Godsmejudge after he was stood down from his remaining rides yesterday following a fall from Balder Succes in the Melling Chase.","AP McCoy wins second feature race at Grand National festival .

"Andy Flower, England team director who guided sides to three Ashes triumphs and the world No 1 spot, will not be interfering in any way with the work of the next director of England cricket. The England Cricket Board gave Flower the confusing title of technical director of elite coaching after he renegotiated a new role at significantly lower pay after resigning as team boss following the last Ashes whitewash. This has led to speculation that Flower’s continuing role on the ECB staff would conflict with the job description of the new appointment. Former England team director Andy Flower is now technical director of elite coaching at the ECB . But effectively Flower is now running the England cricket academy at Loughborough and working with young players in a coaching role, and liaising with counties. And it’s understood he has no wish to get involved at England senior level again or become entangled in the politics. Those politics have Kevin Pietersen at centre stage as ever. But Flower, having closed one chapter in his life and fully moved on to his behind-the-scenes Loughborough role, is highly unlikely to speak out about KP now. Meanwhile, Pietersen, who is using social media app Periscope to film himself getting a sun tan or whistling, continues to dominate the PR battle against the ECB, who botched his axing and have totally mismanaged the fall-out since. Kevin Pietersen is back playing cricket for Surrey in the hope of winning back a Test spot in the England side . It looks only a matter of time before Manuel Pellegrini is sacked as Manchester City manager. And his son Juan, who is living in England, isn’t waiting for the axe to fall on his father, having already made plans to take his wife and four children back to Chile. However, Juan’s return is purely for family reasons with his wife, who has just had twins, wanting family support to look after four kids who are under the age of five. Only the ECB’s hopeless media team could launch the domestic NatWest T20 Blast, which needs all the promotional hype it can muster to compete with the IPL and Big Bash, on the same day as an England Test match. And only the ECB, having brought in former Ashes hero Freddie Flintoff to drum up publicity for the launch, could then decide he shouldn’t speak to national newspapers. An ECB spokesman said the date wasn’t ideal but they were constrained by the domestic and international schedule. And the print media snub was due to the ECB having limited time with Flintoff. Andrew Flintoff (left) shares a joke with Warwickshire and England's Chris Woakes at the T20 Blast launch . There was a player for all 18 counties present at the T20 Blast launch on Thursday . It can cause problems in football when agents represent players and managers. But the ECB have no concerns that former county cricketer Luke Sutton represents both Jimmy Anderson and England head coach Peter Moores. Likewise, the FA say they have no problems with England manager Roy Hodgson’s agent being Leon Angel who also looks after emerging international Danny Rose. Coincidentally, West Indies coach Phil Simmons is paid well enough to need the advice of David Manasseh, whose Stellar agency clients include the world’s most expensive footballer Gareth Bale. Sepp’s no messiah . Sepp Blatter’s smooth procession to a ridiculous fifth term as FIFA president continued at the Central American CONCACAF Congress in the Bahamas. Such was the lack of democracy Blatter’s three rivals weren’t even given the opportunity to address delegates. One delegate, Osiris Guzman of the Dominican Republic, was so sycophantic towards Blatter he spoke of him in the same terms as Moses, Jesus Christ and Nelson Mandela. God help us. Andrew Strauss is part of Sky’s top-heavy team of cricket pundits for the Ashes series. But that commitment should not prove an obstacle to him becoming director of England Cricket, a position for which he is one of the front-runners. Strauss is one of the weak links in the commentary box - Sir Ian Botham is the other - and looks far more suited to be a Hugh Morris-style leader of England cricket if that’s what the ECB decide they’re looking for. Former England captain Andrew Strauss is a front-runner to becoming director of England Cricket . Such is the friendship between Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove and Sir Ian Botham, who are each building houses on St Kitts, that the new restaurant in the Hilton Hotel that is part of the Ageas Bowl outside Southampton is to be called Beefy’s despite Botham having no association with Hampshire.","Andy Flower guided England to three Ashes wins over Australia .

"Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, who has served the club for almost 40 years, has quit the Bundesliga club in the fall-out of their shock Champions League defeat by Porto. Muller-Wohlfahrt claims the German champions' medical department has been blamed for Wednesday night's 3-1 first-leg defeat in Portugal which left their Champions League hopes hanging by a thread. The 72-year-old medical professional, renowned as a world leader in his field, said 'the bond of trust is damaged' and called the blame centred at his department 'inexplicable'. His son Kilian, Peter Ueblacker and Lutz Hansel, who are all part of the team at Bayern, have also resigned. Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt has quit  in the fall-out of their shock defeat by Porto . The 72-year-old is renowned as a world leader in his field and has been at Bayern for almost 40 years . Muller-Wohlfahrt (fourth from left) sits behind Pep Guardiola during the defeat on Wednesday evening . Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt has often courted controversy with his methods. He claims that a substance called Hyalart, which is extracted from the crest of cockerels, helps lubricate knee injuries and take away pain. He also swears by Actovegin, an amino acid preparation derived from calves' blood. In 2009, he prescribed more than 50 injections of goat's blood to St Johnstone striker Peter MacDonald for his hamstring injury. Among those to have been treated by him are Ronaldo, Usain Bolt, Michael Owen and Jose Maria Olazabal. Muller-Wohlfahrt claims to have administered more than one million injections, at least half of which have been to athletes. A statement from Muller-Wohlfahrt read: 'After the Champions League match of Bayern Munich against Porto the medical department was for some inexplicable reason made primarily responsible. The bond of trust is damaged.' And on Friday morning, the club released the following statement: 'FC Bayern Munich notes with regret the decision of chief medical officer Dr Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt (72) to resign his medical duties at the club. 'Dr Muller-Wohlfahrt in particular, but also his team, have performed first-class work for the club and its players over the years. Our sincere thanks are due for this. 'FC Bayern will shortly announce new arrangements for the club’s medical unit. Until then Dr Volker Braun, sports physician and consulting physician in trauma surgery and orthopaedics, will support the FC Bayern team at matches.' Pep Guardiola had just 14 fit players to choose from at the Estadio do Dragao and the Bayern manager implied in his post-match comments that the defeat was down to the lack of available players. 'We have players who were out a long time with injuries,' he said. 'Their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.' Muller-Wohlfahrt comes to Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben during a Bundesliga game last month . Guardiola failed to win the Champions League in his first season in Germany and is on the brink of exit again . Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Guardiola said: 'It was his decision to leave, I respect his decision. That is all.' Guardiola and Muller-Wohlfahrt have reportedly had differences of opinion on several previous occasions including over the fitness of midfielder Thiago Alcantara ahead of last summer's World Cup. Mehdi Benatia, Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben, Javi Martinez and David Alaba were among those missing from the Bayern squad on Wednesday through injury. Holger Badstuber and Bastian Schweinsteiger have also struggled with long-term problems. Footage circulating online appears to show Guardiola aiming sarcastic applause at his bench against Bayer Leverkusen last week after centre back Benatia was withdrawn with an injury. Bayern say the announcement was unexpected. Media director Markus Horwick said: 'We have no knowledge of this release, so we can not comment.' Usain Bolt was one of many athletes to benefit from Muller-Wohlfahrt's treatment at the London Olympics . Muller-Wohlfahrt has worked with the German national team as well as athletes including Usain Bolt and Boris Becker. The Bayern fall-out will not end his work with Joachim Low's team. 'He is the best doctor in the world,' Bolt said after being treated by Muller-Wohlfahrt at the London Olympics in 2012. 'The Doctor is a very, very great man. Thank you, Doctor!' He previously quit Bayern after falling out with then-coach Jurgen Klinsmann in the 2008-09 season but returned after the manager left. The German champions return to Bundesliga action on Saturday when they face Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena. Usain Bolt sought the help of Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt in the weeks leading up to the London Olympics in 2012. At the time, Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp recalled his experiences with the doctor. There's not much I have in common with Usain Bolt. He's certainly a little quicker than I was at my peak. But we shared the same doctor when it came to turning to someone in need of urgent repair. When I was a Liverpool player, I regularly used the tricks and skills of Doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt to rescue me from another injury. Now Bolt, the greatest sprinter of all time, is visiting his Munich clinic to try and be fit for the London Olympics, which start in 18 days. I've read in these pages about Muller-Wolhfahrt's methods being described by a senior figure within the US Anti-Doping Agency as 'Frankensteintype experiments'. I'm not sure what that means, although with me he would use fluid taken from the comb on the head of a hen to lubricate a knee joint that had been eroded by a succession of injuries. He would tell me that it was like 'high quality oil for the engine of a car'. He concluded that the fluid taken from a hen's comb would lubricate the knee and allow greater movement. I was happy to do what he suggested to have the confidence to play again. I've also read about him prescribing goat's blood injections for hamstring injuries. His methods are successful, which is what has drawn Bolt around the world from his Jamaican training camp and why so many go to see the man they call 'healing Hans'. Among the sportsmen and women who have stepped into Muller-Wohlfahrt's dimly lit office are Steven Gerrard, Ronaldo, Jurgen Klinsmann, Dame Kelly Holmes, Paula Radcliffe, Michael Owen, Jose Maria Olazabal and Maurice Green. There is talk of controversy about Muller-Wohlfahrt's methods, but I won't have a bad word said against him. I saw him many times and there was never anything untoward suggested. This is not a back-street quack. He is still Bayern Munich's team doctor, world renowned and a master of his art - and they didn't seem to be doing too badly the last time I watched them in the Champions League Final. Bolt versus his Jamaican training partner, Yohan Blake, is the golden ticket for London. Last weekend, Blake beat Bolt, the fastest man on the planet, in back-to-back races over 100m and 200m. Bolt then withdrew from the Diamond League race in Monaco and the alarm bells are ringing. Nobody wants him to miss these games, surely not even Blake. Athletes generally turn to Muller-Wohlfahrt as a last act of desperation, having exhausted all the local practices and medical skills of those they have been closest to. You can't tell me that Bolt has flown all the way from Jamaica to Munich without trusting Muller-Wohlfahrt's art and without searching for a solution a little closer to home. Like me, he must trust his methods and rely on his advice. He is renowned for helping sportsmen and women, like Bolt, recover from hamstring problems. When I tore a hamstring playing for England, I was out for five months. He is getting sportsmen back on track within five weeks. I only wish I had known about him then. It appears Bolt has a back problem which may have affected his right hamstring. It doesn't sound as if Bolt has suffered a tear, more likely a tweak and if he is unable to trust his hamstrings it might explain why some of his times have been sluggish, by his standards. Didi Hamann, the former German international, first recommended Muller- Wohlfahrt to me when I didn't know where else to turn. I hopped on a plane with the Liverpool physio, hoping we could find some answers. When I first met him, I was anxious, but he made me feel welcome and relaxed. He was in his 60s (he's 70 next month), but he had the skin of a man 20 years younger, with a shock of hair and healthy outlook on life.

"Ander Herrera has shunned comparisons with Paul Scholes, saying 'there will never be another'. The stylish Spaniard has been hailed as the one player who could take over Scholes' mantle of creating and scoring goals from midfield but modest Herrera has been quick to distance himself from the former England international. Herrera, 25, took part in one of Manchester United Foundation's Dream Days on Monday, meeting up with ill children and adults at Carrington. Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has played down comparisons with Paul Scholes . Scholes, pictured celebrating in January 2012, was known for ability to score goals from midfield . Afterwards he took to his Facebook page to answer questions from supporters who compared him to Old Trafford favourite Scholes, who scored 107 goals in 499 games for United. Herrera, though, said: 'There will never be another Scholes. He was a one off.' Herrera has scored seven goals in 26 appearances since his £28.8million arrival from Athletic Bilbao last summer and says his favourite strike so far was his spectacular opener in the 2-0 FA Cup win over Yeovil Town but hopes 'the best one is still to come'. Herrera's favourite goal for United came against League One side Yeovil in the FA Cup third round . Scholes smashes home one of his 107 goals for Manchester United against Reading at Old Trafford . In a United Facebook question and answer session, he went to explain that he wears both 'Ander' and 'Herrera' on his shirt as he is superstitious. 'I did it before in Bilbao, and I am superstitious. I started using 'Ander Herrera' at Athletic a few years ago and I had a very good time there so I wanted to keep putting it on my shirt. I think Marcos Rojo is the same. Actually, in Spain, everyone has at least three names including the last name of both their dad and their mum. 'I always play passionately – for the team and our supporters. I am emotional. Every win and every victory makes me happy but maybe I hope the most emotional moments are coming. I am sure of that, in fact, because I am at United.'","Ander Herrera has scored seven goals since joining Manchester United .

"Jessica Ennis-Hill has revealed she faces her 'biggest challenge ever' as she attempts to juggle being a mother with winning gold at next year's Rio Olympics. Britain's golden girl of athletics is ready to step back on the track nine months after the birth of son Reggie and next month she will take on Katarina-Johnson Thompson, 22, who has risen to prominence in Ennis-Hill's absence, winning pentathlon gold at the European Indoor Championships last month and taking her British record. After the inevitable sleepless nights and the weight sessions in her garage to keep up her fitness Ennis-Hill, at 29, knows she faces a tough return. Jessica Ennis-Hill admits juggling motherhood with her Olympic aspirations poses a big challenge . Ennis-Hill will compete against Katarina Johnson-Thompson in Austria at the end of  May . Ennis-Hill wants to be celebrating another medal win at the Rio Games in Brazil in 2016 . A comparison of achievements between Ennis-Hill and Johnson-Thompson . She will race the hurdles at the Great City Games in Manchester in mid-May before a tantalising heptathlon clash against Thompson awaits in Gotzis, Austria on May 30. 'This year is just about coming back,' insisted Ennis-Hill yesterday at her English Institute of Sport training base in Sheffield. 'I want to be successful next year. At the Olympics I want to medal. 'It is quite hard to judge because I have never come back from this. I don't feel like I am a million miles away but I am not 100 per cent sure what it is going to look like when it all comes together. 'This is the hardest challenge ever. I am not just saying that. It was really tough in the lead up to London (2012) but this is just a whole different ball game.' Ennis-Hill has not competed at all since the London Anniversary Games of July 2013, when achilles injury limited her long jump and hurdles performances before curtailing her season. Her last heptathlon was that memorable evening in the Olympic Stadium in 2012. Reggie would regularly wake up Ennis-Hill and her husband Andy three times a night in the beginning but has settled down recently. 'I love being a mum, it is amazing, and now he has a real personality,' she said. Ennis-Hill will return to hurdling at the Great City games in Manchester in May . Ennis-Hill pictured with her husband Andy at the 2013 Sports Personality of the Year awards . Ennis-Hill has admitted she has struggled to balance the demands of being a mother with returning to fitness . 'But I'd be lying if I said there hadn't been days when I thought, 'I'm not sure I want to do this, because this is really, really hard.' I thought, 'I've already become Olympic champion. Do I want all the stress again?' But I have to give it a go. I don't want to look back and think, 'Oh, maybe I could have done it.' She suggested Johnson-Thompson's continued success — the Liverpudlian won gold in Gotzis last year — is an incentive and they could go head to head over seven events in the World Championships in August or in Rio. 'I do think it helps having someone out there doing incredibly well as you want to get back to your best, if not a bit better,' she added. 'It's added motivation. It is always sad when your records go but she did amazingly. I'm happy for her, she's doing well, but equally I want to be back and competitive. Rio is going to be the time she is at her peak, so it's interesting. 'All heptahletes have a mutual respect. She's a nice girl and I hope she says the same about me. There isn't that hate at all.' Where she does verge towards such sentiment is on discussion of Tatyana Chernova. The Russian beat Ennis-Hill to gold at the 2011 World Championships in Korea but was in January revealed to have failed a drugs test in 2009.

"Liverpool are making a rival push for Manchester United target Memphis Depay. PSV Eindhoven have confirmed United have made enquiries for Holland international Depay as have Paris St Germain but Liverpool have also spoken to the player's representatives. Liverpool hope to convince Depay, 21, that he would get more regular football with them but their qualification for the Champions League could be crucial to the 23-goal winger choosing them over United. Liverpool are making a rival push for Manchester United target Memphis Depay . Liverpool hope to convince 21-year-old Depay that he would get more regular football with them . PSV value Depay at £25million and rejected a £14million bid from Tottenham for him last summer. PSV Eindhoven general manager Toon Gerbrands said: 'We have given an indication of the price for Depay, which is probably more than €25m. Therefore we can have no quibbles with Depay's management [over the price]. Gerbrands added: 'Depay must first reach an agreement with a club and if that club are willing to pay the transfer fee then he can leave quickly.' PSV Eindhoven won their first Eredivisie title in seven years after beating Heerenveen 4-1 on Saturday . Depay (right) celebrates the Dutch giants' success with manager Phillip Cocu after the match . Early years and PSV Eindhoven . Born in 1994, Depay started out at hometown club VV Moordrecht - a Dutch amateur side in south Holland - at the age of six before joining Sparta Rotterdam three years later. The son of a Ghanaian father and Dutch mother, Depay moved to PSV at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in September 2011 having impressed during a trial. Depay signed his first professional contract in June 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the Dutch giants. Playing style . Pacy, with neat close control, Depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire Eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign. Adding more goals to his game this season, the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot. Often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside, Depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents. However, still at a young age and learning the game, the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long. Talent to one day match Arjen Robben... and already better than a young Cristiano Ronaldo? While Depay has been tipped to become as good as Dutch star Arjen Robben by PSV manager Phillip Cocu, one man believes the Holland youngster could one day rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Ed van Steijn, the man who scouted Ronaldo for Manchester United, believes Depay is better than the Real Madrid star was at the same age. Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better. 'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.' Meanwhile, former Holland midfielder Cocu said of Depay: 'Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben? I think so. 'They are different players, but they are both fast and have a good shot. And both always have the urge to learn. 'But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn.' Depay's PSV team-mate Stijn Schaars is also a fan and told Helden Online: 'He's doing everything to reach the top. 'He has a body of a true athlete, power and flair. I'm not afraid of him losing his head. His drive is huge. I like him a lot.' International star and World Cup goalscorer . Depay was handed his first Oranje call-up by Louis van Gaal in 2013 and was selected for Holland's World Cup squad a year later. The energetic frontman scored the winning goal in Holland's 3-2 victory over Australia, before coming off the bench to net against Chile and help Van Gaal's men seal top spot in Group B. Having impressed in Brazil, Depay was nominated for the tournament's 'Best Young Player' award but lost out to France midfielder Paul Pogba.

"Jessica Ennis-Hill has begun communication with the IAAF in the aim of being rewarded with World Championship gold from 2011 after champion Tatyana Chernova was exposed as a drug cheat. In January Chernova was found to have provided a positive sample for a prohibited steroid at the 2009 World Championships. The Russian anti-doping agency issued a backdated ban and annulled her records from 15 August 2009 to 14 August 2011 – just 16 days before she beat Ennis by 129 points in the heptathlon in Daegu, South Korea. Tatyana Chernova (left) failed a drugs test two years before beating Jessica Ennis-Hill in South Korea in 2011 . Ennis-Hill believes it is unfair that Chernova was banned but allowed to keep her world title . Ennis-Hil has written to the  IAAF to ask shy Chernova has been allowed to keep her world title . Ennis-Hill, then the defending world champion, had to settle for silver. The following year the Brit took gold in memorable scenes at London 2012, with Chernova third. Chernova's ban is due to expire on June 21 – in time for this year’s World Championships in Beijing in August and, of course, the 2016 Olympics in Rio. ‘Obviously I'm not happy about how the ban has been handled,’ said Ennis-Hill. ‘I can’t really understand it myself. I've spoken to British Athletics and the IAAF and I am putting my faith to look into it a bit more. ‘I can't understand how that is fair. It's so frustrating – although frustration isn't a strong enough word, because you train hard for all those years and then people do things like that. It doesn't seem like she has served a ban. ‘I think we need to be strict and if you are cheating, you're out. I don't think you should be allowed to come back and keep your medals. It doesn't seem fair.’ Research carried out by the University of Oslo in October 2013 established that muscles can retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids for years, even decades after the moment at which they were taken. Ennis-Hill suggested she may have suspected Chernova but could not have allowed herself to think about anything other than her competition. ‘You might think things but you can't really say anything, you just get on with what you are doing and you can't cast aspersions until something comes out, really,’ she said. ‘That was a really funny competition for me because it was the year before the Olympics and I felt really ready. ‘I just thought I could win the gold medal, and I came away with a silver. So I was disappointed. I was thinking, “Is this how it will go into the Olympics?” ‘It gave me that extra push in a way, having that silver. But at the same time I could have been double world champion. It’s a weird one. But I definitely want that medal. We’ve had communications with the IAAF just to see how that ban works.’ Ennis-Hill praised the work done to uncover transgressions, such as the German documentary about institutionalised doping in Russia. But admitted it left a ‘dampener’ on the sport. Earlier this year Russia's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences. Chernova celebrates the gold medal she took ahead of Ennis-Hill a year before the London Olympic games . Ennis Hill (right) says the silver made her more determined to take gold at the Olympics, which she did . Ennis-Hill also criticised Nike's choice to sponsor two-time drugs cheat Justin Gatlin . ‘Hopefully things are being done about it and it won’t keep progressing on to years down the line,’ she added. Ennis-Hill also criticised Nike’s decision to award two-time drugs cheat Justin Gatlin a new sponsorship deal. ‘Again, frustrating more than anything,’ she said. ‘You see people cheating and they are rewarded for it down the line. I just don’t think it’s fair. At the same time you don’t want to get too wrapped up in it because I can’t control what sponsors do with athletes. But it’s hard to read stories like that.’ Jessica Ennis trains in the adidas Climachill apparel range designed with advanced fabric for maximum cooling, and the adidas Ultra Boost trainers.

"Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic is still bruised from a physical Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid but is expected to be fit for the return at the Bernabeu on Wednesday, said coach Diego Simeone. The Croatian suffered a cut to the top of the nose from an elbow by Sergio Ramos and fellow Real defender Dani Carvajal punched him in the stomach, an incident unseen by the referee, during the clash at the Calderon that ended 0-0. Mandzukic also suffered an ankle injury that forced him to miss Saturday's 2-1 win at Deportivo La Coruna in La Liga but he is now back in training although showing the marks of his encounter with Ramos. Mario Mandzukic was battered and bruised during Atletico Madrid's Champions League quarter-final tie . Atletico and rivals Real Madrid drew 0-0 in the first leg which was dominated by second half scraps . 'We had a training session yesterday with two groups where we were making changes and he was fine,' Simeone told a news conference on Tuesday. 'We now have another training session where we expect him to be okay and I will base my plan, which I have fairly clearly in mind, around that.' Mandzukic is favourite, ahead of Fernando Torres, to play in attack alongside Antoine Griezmann who took his time to settle in at Atletico but is now in a rich vein of form. 'He has developed a lot since he arrived and the goals that he has scored in La Liga show that,' said Simeone. France international Griezmann hit both goals against Deportivo and has 20 in La Liga. 'He has adapted to a new position very well and is starting to show his potential. He is still young and he can improve but he is on the right lines to do that,' added Simeone.

"Travelling can be tiring, especially if there are many flights involved and jet lag. However for one sleepy explorer, a trip of a lifetime to witness the Amazon Rainforest seemed to be all too much - that or he was completely uninterested in the adventurous trips he was booked on. Redditor Roxambops, aka Roxy de la Rosa posted the pictures of dozing Alex Elenes on the social networking site this week with the caption: ‘Went to the Amazon, cousin slept everywhere.’ Meet Alex Elenes. The traveller went on a trip of a lifetime to see the Amazon rainforest...but he missed the whole thing being asleep! Dozing away! Even a  trip piranha fishing could not stir the slumberer from his nap . Incredible nature moments the traveller missed due to napping include a pink dolphin watching tour and even a nail-biting piranha fishing expedition. Sadly he even missed seeing adorable sloths and monkeys in the wild, and impressive giant Amazon lily pads. When action was required of him, and he was due to take an intrepid jungle hike, naturally he slept through his alarm and missed the whole thing. The pictures were captured by his cousin Roxy de la Rosa who posted them on Reddit . Cousin Roxy said that her slumbering companion had been the one to push for the trip and that he chose the trip over going to Machu Picchu since he was set on seeing the jungle. The bemused San Diego said: ‘He had no real reason to keep falling asleep; he also slept any time we we were in our room. ‘Our trip was to Iquitos, Peru, for a few days at the end of February, and cost around £1,000 ($1,600) just for the Amazon addition.’ The sleeper had pushed for the trip, and said he was keen to see the Amazon rainforest in particular as he had already been to Machu Picchu, the alternative trip . Alex is said to be bemused at his new found internet fame, following the pictures going viral on the site. Roxy said: ‘He’s surprised anyone else thinks it’s funny besides us. ‘My favourite thing is that his biggest fear is falling out of a moving car while sleeping, yet he was fine napping on a tiny boat in the giant Amazon river.’ Expensive sleep!

"Just over a year ago, Adam Johnson sat in a room with journalists at the Stadium of Light and talked about England and the forthcoming World Cup. He wasn’t sharing his opinion as a former international, but as one who genuinely hoped his exile was about to come to a deserved end. Johnson — scorer of seven goals in as many matches for Sunderland —believed he was worthy of a recall, 21 months on from a five-minute cameo in Norway’s Ullevaal Stadium during a Euro 2012 warm-up friendly. Adam Johnson (right) was accompanied by his lawyer as he was charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming . Johnson, an England international, was considered a prospect for Roy Hodgson as recently as a year ago . Johnson (right) was wearing a black tracksuit as he arrived at Peterlee police station on Thursday . At 26, was it plausible that Johnson had rediscovered the fearless form many suspected he had left behind on Teesside when he quit Middlesbrough — the club who had expertly nurtured him — for Manchester City in a £7million deal four years earlier? For at the Etihad, amid the millionaires and the silverware, Johnson may have become a richer man, but he emerged a poorer player. In February of last year, however, and on the eve of a Capital One Cup final against the club at which his career had stalled, Johnson spoke of playing his ‘best ever football’ and wasn’t joking when he revealed summer holiday plans were on hold in the hope of adding to his 12 caps in Brazil. Few argued. But Roy Hodgson was not aboard the ‘Johnson for England’ bandwagon. Johnson scored seven times in seven games during a run last season, and was still an England prospect . Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him . Johnson leaves Peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity . The call never materialised and Sunderland — beaten by City at Wembley — finished the season fighting relegation, Johnson scoring just one goal in 16 matches as his form dipped. The eulogies which were written in the wake of his joyous January were, on reflection, a little premature. In fact, Johnson’s form has never recovered. Five goals from 31 appearances this season may well make him Sunderland’s top scorer, but that masks what have been subdued and often sluggish performances, even if he remains their likeliest match-winner. It is all a far cry from the skinny teenager who dared to dribble and made others dare to dream of the future which lay ahead. Debuting at 17 for Middlesbrough, he was billed as ‘the next Stewart Downing’. In 2005, that was high praise. He made a mockery of full backs and, indeed, those who had likened him to Downing, for it quickly became apparent that Johnson had the potential to be better than his Boro team-mate. Johnson has made three Premier League appearances under new boss Dick Advocaat (right) Ched Evans: Charged with rape in July 2011 but played for Sheffield United in September. Not released by club until end of the season. Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer: Not suspended by Leeds after charged with grievous bodily harm and affray in 2000. Jody Morris: Leeds suspended him for two weeks after the player arrested in connection with rape charge, October 2003. After six seasons at the Riverside, he was given the platform to prove as much. But at City, like so many young English talents, he regressed. There were concerns from within the club about his dedication and life away from football. His reputation, though, remained intact, such were the fleeting nature of his sightings in sky blue. To the outside observer, he was done an injustice by Roberto Mancini. And so Johnson was forgiven his uninspiring two-and-a-half years in Manchester when he signed for boyhood club Sunderland for £10million in the summer of 2012. Last year, he reflected on his time at City. ‘There is a temptation (to sign for them), of course. The wages, you’re flattered when City are after you, but you’ll go there and be third choice,’ he said. ‘When I was there, I was always the one who would be dropped when the manager rotated the team. I wouldn’t sign for them now if I was a young English player.’ The winger played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . Johnson has scored 20 goals for the Black Cats since signing for the club in 2012 . But perhaps Mancini was sound in his judgment. For although, during three seasons on Wearside, Johnson’s three goals in a trio of victories at North East rivals Newcastle have undoubtedly been the highlight, affording him terrace adulation, Sunderland had expected far more when they laid down an eight-figure sum and wages of £50,000 per week. Now, with Johnson having been charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming, they are facing up to a relegation run-in perhaps without the man in whom they have invested so heavily, should the club decide to suspend him. The future of both Sunderland and their star player hang in the balance.

Aston Villa may be able to sign Cordoba striker Florin Andone for as little as £2.5million. The Spanish side are poised to be relegated and need to raise funds.

"Ronald Koeman called for Southampton's players to show maturity, nous and respect after Victor Wanyama's future came under question. This weekend brings with it arguably Saints' biggest match of the season, with the visit of Tottenham likely to be key in the fight for European qualification. Mauricio Pochettino's first return to St Mary's adds extra spice to a match, ahead of which his successor felt the need to hold a team meeting to refocus his players' minds. Ronald Koeman says his Southampton players must remain focused on European qualification . Koeman spoke to Victor Wanyama and his other players to refocus them on the last five league games . Wanyama's claims that Arsenal were interested in his services were the catalyst and, while defending the 23-year-old by saying the story was 'bull****', Koeman called for his players to show more common sense. 'You know always in the last part of the season there are rumours talking about interest in players,' the Saints boss said. 'I don't like to say every time it's true or it's not true. 'It's important that everybody knows his position in the club. They have contracts - you can't talk about moving because you have a contract. That's not respectful to the club. 'We spoke about that, that we need that focus. If we don't have really that focus, we can't bring the level what we normally bring this season.' Such speculation about the likes of Wanyama, Nathaniel Clyne and Morgan Schneidelin brings back memories of last summer's talent drain from St Mary's. Wanyama's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at a move to Arsenal . Koeman has repeatedly insisted a similar situation will not arise this time around, although he is wise enough to know the south-coast club's place in the food chain. 'On one side it's normal because, okay, we are Southampton,' Koeman said. 'We are not Man United, because they are always talking about new players, and normally in teams like Southampton, a little bit more down, they are talking about interest in players of Southampton. 'We know that, but it's up to the press. They can write and they can say what they want, but no problem. 'We have to keep that spirit together and that was my message to the players. 'We can't do anything about that. You have to look out if they ask you that kind of questions. That's your job. There has also been speculation about the futures of Morgan Schneiderlin (left) and Nathaniel Clyne . Southampton come up against former boss Mauricio Pochettino on Saturday in the race for the Europa League . 'You're not a young kid. You have to respond, and if you respond you have to know what you respond.' Koeman says he will not be enforcing a media ban to keep his players out of trouble - something he accepts is more difficult now given the power held by agents. The former Holland international also understands the ambitions his players may well harbour, admitting he spoke out of turn a few times when he was younger. 'Of course, when I played in Holland, okay, I was looking to play in a bigger team - that's normal,' Koeman said. 'If you are not really in the highest level and you get opportunities to play in a higher level, okay, you like it, of course. Everybody likes the best. 'Everybody likes to play Champions League football - that's normal. I'm not surprised about that.'","Ronald Koeman has urged his team to focus on European qualification .

"Josh Meekings has been cleared to play in the Scottish Cup Final after an SFA panel kicked out a charge of deliberate handball during Sunday’s semi-final against Celtic. In the aftermath of the Highlanders’ 3-2 extra-time win, the Englishman admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been sent off by referee Steven McLean for stopping Leigh Griffiths’ net-bound effort on his goal-line. In an unprecedented move, the Inverness defender was subsequently cited by Tony McGlennan, the SFA Compliance Officer, for denying an opposing team an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberately handling the ball. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . That move created a furore - with Jim Boyce, FIFA vice-president and head of the refereeing committee, warning that penalising Meekings retrospectively would open up a can of worms for the game. But  a three-man judicial panel dismissed the charge - leaving the player free to face Falkirk at Hampden on May 30. Meekings tweeted: ‘Once again, would like to thank everybody for the messages and support given over the last few days. Back to business now, cannot wait!’ ‘I have seen the support from various clubs’ fans and I’m very thankful. I can look forward to the final now, and get ready for Saturday!’ Inverness Caley Thistle chairman Kenny Cameron also released a statement expressing the club’ s relief that Meekings would now be central to the biggest game in their history. ‘The club is delighted for Josh that the Judicial Panel Tribunal dismissed the complaint brought against him,’ he stated. ‘Josh will now be available for selection for the Cup Final on 30th May 2015 v Falkirk FC. ‘The result means that the club can now fully appreciate the achievement of reaching its first ever Scottish Cup Final and focus on preparations for Saturday’s game versus Aberdeen FC. ‘On a personal note, both Josh and I would like to express our gratitude to our legal team from Harper Macleod led by partner David Kerr who worked tirelessly to ensure a favourable outcome.’ Caley boss John Hughes revealed, however, that the furore over the Meekings affair had made him consider quitting his job in disgust at Scotish football. Speaking before the verdict was announced, he said: ‘It’s taken the shine off our victory. So much so that I’m even looking at myself. ‘If this is what goes on in Scottish football, I don’t know if I want to be a part of it. I’m serious when I say that. ‘I’m really, really disillusioned with it and over the last two days I have just switched off my phone. ‘I think the whole of British football knows there is a real injustice here. It’s unprecedented and so many people have something to say on it. ‘I’m a little bit embarrassed. I think Scottish football is being dragged through the mud a little bit. ‘I think there’s a wee bit more to it than what we are seeing. There has been plenty happening since I came up here, going back to semi-final kick-off times, playing Hearts (in a semi-final) at Easter Road in the middle of Edinburgh, I just think sometimes Inverness get treated with contempt.’ The Meekings affair was the latest recent high-profile case to have been brought by Complicance Officer McGlennan that has subsequently been dismissed. Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci has twice successfully defended himself against retrospective charges brought following games against Inverness and Celtic. Earlier this month, Rangers keeper Steve Simonsen escaped an extension to the two-game ban – with one game suspended – that he received after breaking rules on gambling. McGlennan said that the Simoson ban, issued by an independent panel, was ‘unduly lenient’ but another independent tribunal upheld the original decision. Meanwhile, Aberdeen’s Barry Robson lost his appeal against the red card he received against Dundee United last weekend. The veteran midfielder will now sit out two matches. 'I think there's a wee bit more to it than what we are seeing. There has been plenty happening since I came up here, going back to semi-final kick-off times, playing Hearts (in semi-final) at Easter Road in the middle of Edinburgh, I just think sometimes Inverness get treated with contempt.' PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart had warned the SFA that it was creating a dangerous precedent by citing Meekings. Speaking shortly before the outcome, the former Rangers and Motherwell defender said: 'I think you have seen this week from the reaction of players across the country, players have no problem with video evidence being used for incidents that genuinely haven't been seen by the referee. Maybe a punch behind the referee's back and fly kick when the ball is away. 'But we think, if the rule has been extended, then it is now erring into re-refereeing into a game on a Monday. 'That's not the purpose of video evidence. That's why the English FA and FIFA and UEFA steer away from that. The referee could see the incident on Sunday, he just didn't see the handball. 'I feel for the referees because their performance is now being analysed to the nth degree and I don't think that's fair on them.'","Inverness defender Josh Meekings has won appeal against one-match ban .

"A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by £345 to £975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from £870 to £1,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices . The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from £870 to £1,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game . Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay £345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost £975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season . Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.","Premier League champions have increased season ticket prices next term .

"The football family has rallied round a Blackpool pensioner sued by the Oyston family for alleged defamatory comments made on his Facebook page. Frank Knight settled before court proceedings with the owners of the Championship’s basement club, having to pay a staggering £20,000 in damages. Supporters up and down the country have reacted to that by raising close to £15,000 in under three days – an act of defiance against the running of Blackpool. Blackpool fans vent their disgust at the Oyston family, who own the club, last week . Supporters have been protesting against the Oystons before matches and then not attending the games . Knight is a lifelong fan of the Seasiders and was ordered to apologise for posting a disparaging status online this time last year. A fellow Blackpool fan began a fundraising page on the website ‘go fund me’, which has attracted interest across Britain. Countdown’s Rachel Riley and comic Russell Brand have tweeted links to the page. Brand said: ‘Blackpool fans! What's going on at your club? How can I help? #ThingsCanChange’ Riley tweeted: ‘One for the football family - petty and awful treatment of a Tangerine OAP fan by the owner, ridiculous stuff.’ It looks likely that organiser Joe Atherton will reach his £20,000 target in the coming days. Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston speaks on his mobile phone during Tuesday's draw with Reading . Owner Owen Oyston watches the match huddled under a blanket in the stands . Blackpool fan Frank Knight posted an apology on a supporters' messageboard on Thursday . And Atherton can’t believe the way in which his fundraising has taken off. ‘When typing in the £20,000 ""target"" I sat back and thought ""no chance, if we can get Frank £5k or so I'll be happy."" To break this in just over two days is amazing,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It's not just Blackpool fans either. Clubs with other struggles like Pompey, Stockport, Cardiff and Coventry fans all donated. ‘Even fans from arch rival clubs like Preston, Bolton and Burnley have donated. It's been pretty overwhelming. We’ve even had overseas donations from Australia, Sweden, Malaysia and America.’ Another supporter is awaiting a court date with the Oystons after making defamatory remarks online. Karl Oyston is to soon find out his fate for branding a fan a ‘retard’ before Christmas, telling him to ‘enjoy your special needs day out’ and claiming he was banned from the ground because he was a ‘p****’. Blackpool’s recent history has been entrenched in bitter disputes off the pitch, with paying customers regularly protesting at the ownership of their club. That was compounded last week when Lee Clark and his team’s relegation to League One was confirmed. Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Broken eggs on the floor outside Bloomfield Road . Dozens pelted the Bloomfield Road reception with eggs and flares before their draw against Reading last Tuesday. A group also travelled to the Oyston home near Waddington, Lancashire on Sunday to vent their fury. Members of the family stood within the grounds and watched as they protested in front of the gates. And Knight’s apology will only serve to exasperate the problem further. Posting on a fans’ messageboard, the pensioner said: ‘I now regret making these allegations, I fully accept that they are false and I wish to sincerely apologise for them and also for the harm, distress and financial losses my comments have caused both BFC and the Oystons and I wish to unreservedly withdraw them. ‘I accept that my publication of the allegations on Facebook and in a manner which is readily accessible to users constitutes a very serious libel. It has injured the reputation of the Oystons and has caused them considerable embarrassment and distress. ‘It has damaged their reputation in business and it is considered to be grossly defamatory of the position of the Oystons within the Club, within the football hierarchy and within the football community in general, as well as within the local community for it to be even suggested that either or both of the Oystons were not only aware of such alleged activities but also that either or both of the Oystons actually condoned them. ‘In recognition of this, I have agreed with their suggestion that I should pay to BFC, by way of damages, costs, disbursements and interest and in full and final settlement of all matters in issue between myself and BFC and the Oystons, the sum of £20,000.00. ‘After a frank discussion with the Oystons, I acknowledge that they are both genuine fans of BFC and they and their families have only the best interests of BFC at heart. I recognise that BFC is now in a significantly healthier situation than when the Oyston family first became involved in it. 'I note that the combined net assets value at cost of Segesta and BFC were £32 million as at May 2014, compared with -£42,000 as at May 1987, when the Oystons took over BFC. I accept the Oyston family’s main objective is and always has been, for the financial stability and success for and of BFC.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Lifelong Blackpool fan Frank Knight forced to pay £20,000 in damages .

"Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge was left in stitches by an impersonation of club legend Michael Owen. Ahead of the Reds' FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday, the England international met up with comedian Darren Farley as part of an exclusive promotional video to showcase the TV coverage of the match by BT Sport. Farley, who first rose to prominence on YouTube, specialises in mimicking a number of Anfield stars both past and present.

However, while Farley's Owen impression was certainly on point, his dancing left a lot to be desired.

"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals.

"Kurt Zouma was deployed in a defensive midfield role against Manchester United specifically to stop  Marouane Fellaini from continuing his good form at Stamford Bridge, according to Jose Mourinho. The big Belgian has shone under Louis van Gaal in recent weeks but he endured an evening to forget as the 20-year-old man-marked  him superbly during the Blues' 1-0 victory. Mourinho gave an insight into his instructions to Zouma after the game, explaining that he'd asked the young Frenchman to turn the match into a '10 against 10' clash. Chelsea's Kurt Zouma tussles with Marouane Fellaini during his side's 1-0 win against Manchester United . Zouma was deployed in a defensive midfield role so that he could deal with the threat of United star Fellaini . Speaking to chelseafc.com after the final whistle, Mourinho said: 'I told Zouma I want the game to be 10 against 10, I didn't want the game to be 11 against 11. 'During the week we were working for that and the game was 10 against 10.' Zouma, who also played in midfield away at West Ham and in the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham, was pleased with the job he did against the 'on fire' ex-Everton man. He said: 'I had to stay with [Marouane] Fellaini because we knew he is on fire at the moment. 'He has scored a lot of goals so I had to keep an eye on him, and I think I did it well. I had to be physical with him and stay close to him. 'The game was very difficult. The most important thing was that we had one chance and we scored. We defended very well. Manchester United didn't have many chances to score. We stayed compact.' Zouma wrestles Fellaini to the ground as Chelsea continued their bid for a fourth Premier League title . Fellaini has been in excellent form but he was unable to impact the game with Zouma watching his every move . Mourinho was similarly impressed with the performance of the former Saint-Etienne starlet, adding: 'See the jobs he is doing for us, as a central defender playing against [Sergio] Aguero, as a central defender playing against [Raheem] Sterling. 'He played as the holding midfield player against Tottenham in a system with only one holding midfield player. 'Against Man United he played to stop Fellaini from playing in the box. He is doing amazing jobs for us. He is mentally very, very strong, too. Not just physically, mentally he is very strong. 'He's learned a lot from a tactical point of view since his arrival. So we can imagine with him being aged 20, Chelsea has 10 years of Zouma.'

"Zinedine Zidane has sparked a potential transfer battle with Chelsea after claiming that Eden Hazard excites him more than Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. The Real Madrid reserve boss was unashamed in his praise for Hazard, who could be named PFA Player of the Year this weekend. Zidane’s comments are sure to agitate those at Stamford Bridge, who only tied the Belgian down to a new five-year deal in February. Eden Hazard fires past David de Gea to score the winning goal against Manchester United last Saturday . Zinedine Zidane, picture playing in a United Nations charity match, has revealed his admiration for Hazard . ‘Obviously, there is Lionel Messi and Ronaldo, both of whom are spectacular, but I like Eden Hazard more,’ Zidane, who is tipped as a future manager at the Bernabeu, told fifa.com. ‘I like everything he does on the field. I like his behaviour, his decisiveness and love to see his progress every year.’ Hazard’s form for Jose Mourinho’s side has been a major factor in Chelsea’s impending Premier League title victory this season. That and his new deal will mean the Blues are sure to firmly resist any offers if they were to materialise. Zidane added: ‘There is still scope for further progress, and if Chelsea are to win the league this season, Eden will have had a lot to do with it.’ Hazard slides on his knees after scoring against United to edge Chelsea one step closer to the title .

"Manchester United have fought all season to try to secure a return to the Champions League, but six players shown the exit door at Old Trafford are  in the competition's final four. Last season's disastrous campaign under David Moyes saw United miss out on Europe's premier competition for the first time in 19 years, with Patrice Evra and Javier Hernandez members of the failing squad. But those two - plus Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Gerard Pique - have all made the semi-finals in their former club's absence from the competition. Javier Hernandez scored the winner for Real Madrid against Atletico. He is on loan from Manchester United . Patrice Evra was part of David Moyes' failing side last season but he now plays for Italian side Juventus . Hernandez and Ronaldo combined for Real Madrid's winner against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, with the former only on loan and deemed surplus to requirements by Louis van Gaal who has instead relied on misfiring Radamel Falcao. Meanwhile, Tevez was leading the line for Juventus, with Evra at left back, in their 0-0 draw against Monaco that won a place in the last four. Pogba is out with a thigh injury but could return in the time for the semi-finals next month. Finally, Pique is enjoying one of the best seasons of his career at centre back for Barcelona and helped keep out Paris Saint-Germain's fearsome attack that featured Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani on Tuesday night. Cristiano Ronaldo has gone from strength to strength since leaving United and is in the last four once again . Carlos Tevez went to Manchester City between his stints with United and Juventus, who beat Monaco . Whatever happens in the semi-finals, there will be at least one former Old Trafford representative at the Champions League final in Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 6. United are on course for a return to Europe's top table next season, with their position inside the Barclays Premier League's top four looking fairly safe ahead of Liverpool who sit eight points behind. But for now, the Champions League semi-finals are the home of their former players, rather than their current ones. Gerard Pique spent time at United between two spells with Barcelona, and he is in the semi-finals with them . Paul Pogba was released by the Old Trafford club after spending his youth there and plays for Juve now .","Manchester United have six ex-players in Champions League semi-finals .

"For many it would be a joyous final 90 minutes watching the game they loved before heading for trenches and, in some cases, certain death. Others, already wearing the scars of gruesome battle, flocked to Old Trafford for the FA Cup Final in their military uniforms and bandages. The presence of so many soldiers on the steep terraces led the 1915 showpiece to be christened the Khaki Cup Final.

On Friday it will be 100 years since 50,000 gathered at Old Trafford to contest a controversial FA Cup final . Many soldiers already wounded from war or in uniform for training earned the match its Khaki Cup Final tag . The anniversary is being marked in Manchester by the National Football Museum whose exhibition The Greater Game: Football & The First World War tells the story of a controversial match played on the same day thousands of Allied troops were killed in a deadly German chlorine gas attack near Ypres, Belgium. Some claimed the final, won by Sheffield United following a 3-0 victory over Chelsea, should not have taken place at all following the outbreak of war the previous year. And following the final whistle the watching Earl of Derby implored all of those present who had not enlisted to do so, and play 'a sterner game for England'. Far from an open-top bus parade and joyous celebration, the Blades carried their silverware across the Pennines under darkness. Crowds who had gathered in Sheffield to greet their heroes were dispersed by police. No parade was held for the victorious Blades, who carried their trophy across the Pennines under darkness . It was certainly a far cry from what will greet Aston Villa and Arsenal when they meet at Wembley Stadium in May. Head of Creative Programmes at the museum, Andy Pearce, explained that the authorities, desperate for reinforcements for the bloodthirsty battles on the muddy fields of Europe, were not impressed. 'Football fans and players had been targeted for recruitment to the military since the start of the season,' he said. 'By the time of the cup final there was a sense that the game really was up.

"John Hughes has revealed how he came within a heartbeat of stepping down from his job at Inverness as the Josh Meekings controversy went into overdrive this week. The Caley Thistle boss says he felt so repulsed by the gut-wrenching predicament being endured by his young defender - before he was dramatically cleared - that he was ready to walk away from his post and the games he loves, just weeks before an historic Scottish Cup Final date. Keen cyclist Hughes set off on a lonely bike ride after hearing Meekings had been cited for the handball missed by officials in the semi-final against Celtic, and admits his head was in a spin over an affair that has dominated the back-page headlines since last Sunday. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . Only messages of support awaiting him on his return from footballing friends brought him back from the brink of quitting. Hughes, who lives in the Black Isle just north of Inverness, said: ‘I came in here this morning after a day off. I turned my phone off and was away myself, away out on the bike with plenty of thinking time: a great freedom of mind. ‘I was that sick of what has been going on in Scottish football I was seriously contemplating my own future. I’m serious when I say that. ‘I had just had it up to here and was ready to just give it up. If it wasn’t for what happened when I turned my phone back on, with the phone calls and texts I received from people I really value in football, that my spirits picked up again. ‘The calls and texts came in from all over the place, from some of the highest levels across the game. I’ve had phone calls that have really got me back on my feet. ‘I wouldn’t like to name them all, but there were a lot of good people and a good few close friends in the football fraternity. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . ‘They were saying: “You need to lead from the front, you need to fight it.” That restored and galvanised that focus and drive in me. And, if that was how I was feeling, how was the boy Josh Meekings feeling? It should never have come to this.’ Meekings was cleared to play in the final by the Judicial Panel yesterday, but Hughes insists this ‘unprecedented’ SFA wrangle must be the catalyst for change in Scottish football’s governance. Although those who sit on the panel are drawn from many walks of life, ranging from former players and coaches to ex-refs and members of the legal profession, Hughes said he wants ‘real football people’ drafted in instead of the ‘suits’ he claims lack understanding of the nuances and spirit of the professional game. And he seemed to point a thinly-veiled finger of accusation at SFA chief executive Stewart Regan by alleging that compliance officer Tony McGlennan was a mere ‘patsy’ in the process. Overwhelmed by a huge upswell of support for Meekings, he said: ‘No disrespect to those sitting on [the judicial panel], but you need football guys and that’s where it’s flawed. That’s why I promised myself I’d never go back down there until that gets sorted out. ‘The last time I appeared was when I was down at Livingston. It was quite galling. You have to be qualified in what you’re judging on. There’s no one better qualified than ex-players and ex-coaches. For some reason the SFA don’t want to go down that line. Why? ‘I couldn’t tell you who I sat in front of while at Livingston, but they weren’ t football people. I’m talking about playing the game, managing the game, coaching the game. John Hughes was ready to walk away from his post and the games he loves . ‘There are hundreds of these guys I’m quite sure would go in there and do it, for the sake of football. We need to use this to make sure the whole process work better. Josh’s case was unprecedented. How was that? Somebody needs to explain that to me. ‘I know the verdict has gone in our favour but I don’t think this is finished. We need to sit down and look at the Judicial Panel process. ‘I don’t believe in the Panel. I promised myself a couple of years ago I wouldn’ t walk back into Hampden until it changes. I would never question their integrity but I want football people sitting in judgment. ‘They are making a football decision and I want football people. Look at what is at stake. Here we were talking about a young player’s chance of playing in a Scottish Cup final. I’d be more confident with football people because they know the game. ‘The compliance officer is damned if he does, damned if doesn’t. Is he getting used as a patsy in all this? I honestly don’t know. ‘How far do you take it? We’re opening a whole can of worms here. We had a strong claim for a penalty when the goalkeeper comes through the back of Edward Ofere. Where do you draw the line? ‘It’s unheard of, but I honestly think there’s a little bit more to it. We can use this whole episode to make it better.’ Hughes, who accepted Meekings would have warranted a red card had the ref spotted the offence, refused to point a finger of blame at former club Celtic for the letter of complaint they wrote to the SFA in the aftermath. ‘Celtic keep getting flung into it, but I came in here this morning and all Kristine, our receptionist, says to me is that the phone had never stopped ringing with Celtic supporters wishing Josh all the best and hoping he plays in the final. ‘I believe that comes right from the top at Celtic. They conduct themselves in a great manner. I had the privilege to play for that club and everything they do is class. ‘What I will say is, in Scotland, we put people up on a pedestal. We love it. It’s our character. And we love knocking them down again. ‘But see when there has been an injustice, one thing we do in Scotland is show a real solidarity to make sure we get it right. ‘That’s what I’m finding about the whole of Scottish football in the reaction to this. There’s a real coming together as they all recognise this is not right. ‘I have to be the voice of Inverness. I’m not really saying [all] that I really want to say. I’m trying to be calculated and honest. I think there’s more to say. There’s more to it.’","Inverness defender Josh Meekings has won appeal against one-match ban .

"Almost three years after nearly leaving Liverpool Jordan Henderson has committed his long-term future to the club convinced he can win silverware at Anfield. Late in the summer of 2012, just a couple of months into the reign of Brendan Rodgers, he was lined up as makeweight in a failed bid to sign Fulham's Clint Dempsey only for the midfielder to reject the move. His determination to prove himself, and justify the £16million price tag which came with him from Sunderland the previous summer, has been rewarded not only with a new five-year £100,000-a-week contract but with the prospect of him taking over the captain's armband from Steven Gerrard when he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. Jordan Henderson is 'over the moon' after signing a new long-term contract with Liverpool . The club's vice-captain puts pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at Liverpool until 2020 . Henderson has enjoyed a strong campaign and could be handed the armband when Steven Gerrard leaves . But it is the unfulfilled potential which persuaded the 24-year-old England international to commit what should be the best years of his career to the club. 'A few years ago I had an opportunity to leave but I always knew how big this club is and I wanted to stay here for as long as possible - and nothing has changed since then,' he told liverpoolfc.com. 'I feel as though I have got a good connection with the club now and there was no doubt where my future was going to be and it was just a matter of time for my agent and the club to sort it out. 'I have been through difficult times but I would never change that because I know there will be more difficult times ahead and I'll have to use that and I'll be able to handle it a lot better. 'Hopefully we've got many years ahead of winning trophies. 'I'm the same as every other player, I want to be playing at the highest level - in the Champions League, winning trophies and being very successful. 'I had good conversations with the manager about the future of the football club and it was very bright, I was very pleased with what I was hearing. 'I want to be a big part of that and hopefully I can. 'I feel there's a lot of potential, but we need to start turning that potential into winning things. I've got a good feeling that we can do that.' Henderson arrived from Sunderland in a £16million deal in June 2011, when Kenny Dalglish was manager . The Liverpool midfielder shoots towards goal during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa . Rodgers hopes other players - youngsters Raheem Sterling (who has rejected a £100,000-a-week offer), Jordon Ibe and experienced defender Martin Skrtel are all currently negotiating new deals - will follow Henderson's lead. 'We are obviously delighted. It is great news for the club and Jordan that he will be spending best part of his career and development here at Liverpool and he is a big part of the plan going forward,' said the Reds boss. 'I am delighted for him and the club and we can continue his development. 'The club paid big money for him at the time because he had big potential and that potential has been developed and he will go into the next phase of that.

"Mila Kunis is to counter-sue the woman who is suing her for stealing her chicken. The actress and her fiance Ashton Kutcher responded to the impending lawsuit with a tongue-in-cheek video, claiming they were going to file a lawsuit against the accuser Kristina Karo, because of injuries suffered while being forced to watch her music video. On Wednesday the story broke that the 31-year-old was being sued for $5,000 by a woman claiming to be her former childhood friend, who said she suffered emotional trauma when a seven-year-old Kunis stole her pet foul. Fight fire with fire: Mila Kunis has responded to Kristina Karo's accusations she stole her chicken as a child, with a video claiming she will counter-sue for injuries sustained while watching Karo's music video . But within hours Kutcher had posted a video - obtained by TMZ - pointing out some of the holes in Karo's story. 'Let's just get this clear: you stole a chicken from a one-month-old child who spoke to you in an entire conversation,' the 37-year-old declares in the self-shot vid. 'It's just shocking to me. Not only did she have a conversation at one-month old in Ukraine, she was speaking English! This is the smartest girl I've ever heard of!' Kunis herself appears on the clip pointing out that it must be 'just coincidental' he accuser has a new music video out, and is trying to launch a singing career here in LA. Foul play: The reason for Karo's lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy . 'I was devastated. I was weeping. I was dumbfounded. I was like ""which chicken did I steal?"" because I was obviosly in the village when I stole these chickens. So I apologise to this woman who was maybe or maybe not a month old,' she said. The Jupiter Ascending star admits that she has yet to be physically served the documents, and then reveals she is preparing her own counter-suit. 'But emotionally I feel served. I would like to launch a counter $5,000 lawsuit for making me sit there and watch you music video, shamelessly. My body hurts. My eyes hurt, they're burning. That requires money.' 'No Green Card for you,' Kutcher admonishes into the camera, in response to her song title plea Give Me Green Card, which currently has almost 170k views on YouTube. The couple then turn semi-serious to address the charges. 'I feel like I will be a chicken fighter for a very long time. I will be an advocate. I would never steal someone else's chicken. I wouldn't, I wouldn't,' Kunis insists. 'Listen folks, I believe this woman, I know her pretty well, I believe that shes an ethical person that wouldn't steal a chicken,' Kutcher adds. 'So you have it right from the horse's... the chicken's mouth.' Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, had being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo. Kutcher pointed out in their response video that their accuser was also one-month old at the time and apparently fluent in English and Ukranian . Pollo loco: In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo had alleged that she was a classmate of Kunis, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. The wannabe singer, now living in Los Angeles, claimed a seven-year-old Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reported. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

"Pusok sported a black eye in his booking photo after the beating . A California county on Tuesday approved paying a $650,000 settlement to avoid a lawsuit by a man whose beating by deputies after a horse chase was captured on video. San Bernardino County spokesman David Wert said county supervisors approved the settlement with 30-year-old Francis Pusok in a closed meeting. Pusok's arrest was recorded by a TV news helicopter and has led to an FBI civil rights investigation and 10 deputies being placed on leave pending an internal probe. Wert says the agreement would settle all potential claims from Pusok's April 9 arrest. A message seeking comment was left for Pusok's lawyer. In an interview with NBC 4,  Pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for '99 per cent' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear: 'This isn't over.' When San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies arrived at Pusok's house, he said he  fled 'because any contact with police has been negative for me'. As the chase was coming to a close about two and a half hours later, video shows Pusok falling to the ground as he is hit with a taser and two deputies approach. A California county has approved a $650,000 settlement to avoid a lawsuit from Pusok after his beating by deputies after a horse chase was captured on video . Pusok's arrest was recorded by a TV news helicopter and led to an FBI civil rights investigation and 10 deputies being placed on leave pending an internal probe . The officers then start to assault Pusok, and later claimed that his taser had been ineffective due to his loose clothing - even though Pusok is clearly seen convulsing from the electric shock in the helicopter footage. Pusok estimates that within 15 seconds of the first taser hit, the cops had him in handcuffs but says they continued to assault him and yelled 'stop resisting' even though he was laying face down on the ground. He says the officers went on to tase him two more times after he was in handcuffs. Pusok remembers the cops 'hitting me every place that they could hit me - anywhere and everywhere.' 'I thought I was being beaten to death,' said Pusok.. 'I was wondering, ""When is it going to stop?""' After the incident, Pusok was arrested on suspicion of evading, stolen property, reckless driving and theft of a horse. He was treated for his injuries while being held at West Valley Detention Center where he was released Sunday night at bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for June 16, but San Bernardino County Prosecutors said Monday that they had not yet made a decision on whether to file formal charges against Pusok. Meanwhile, 10 officers - including a sergeant and a detective - involved in the incident were placed on paid leave as the FBI starts an investigation into whether excessive force was used in the arrest. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said last week that he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. In his interview on Monday, Pusok said he thinks his prior run-ins with police may have sparked their violent backlash. Indeed, Pusok's lengthy criminal record includes charges of obstructing an officer and resisting an officer, as well as attempted robbery, animal cruelty and fighting or offensive words. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon told reporters he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video . Deputies have been called to Pusok's home before, during which he threatened to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of his family, Sheriff McMhaon said. However, Pusok's pregnant girlfriend, Jolene Bindner, says some of the prior charges against her longtime partner have been trumped up. Bindner told NBC that the charges he threatened to kill a police officer are 'absolutely not true. I was there the whole time.'","County supervisors approved the settlement with 30-year-old Francis Pusok in a closed meeting .

"Not a day goes by that 14-year-old Jonathan Pitre doesn't scream in pain. Born with Epidermolysis Bullosa - or 'butterfly skin' - his body is covered with deep blistering wounds that will never heal. Holding cutlery to eat is incredibly difficult. Bathing is excruciating. Scroll down for video . Struggle: Born with Epidermolysis Bullosa, Jonathan is covered with deep blistering wounds that won't heal . Pain: He must be bathed and bandaged every day. His skin is as fragile as a butterfly's wing . Team work: Jonathan, 14, said he could not get through life without his mother Tina who carries and feeds him . 'You never know exactly what EB is unless you have it... just the feel of it, the pain that you live in every day,' the bandaged teenager remarks in an interview with the Ottawa Citizen. 'Even when I'm sleeping, when I'm dreaming, I still am sort of conscious because I feel that pain.' Unless a cure is found, Jonathan will likely only live to 25. But in a tone well beyond his years, Ottawa-based Jonathan says frankly: 'I just have to get on with it.' One in every 17,000 people suffer from the genetic condition. Healthy skin is made up of three layers, but Jonathan is missing the middle layer which holds the inner and outer layers together. Dreams: He had to stop playing sports so has turned his focus to sportscasting - and the experts are impressed with his maturity and knowledge. He is pictured here with a Vikings Junior ice hockey player . Difficulties: Both Tina and Jonathan say they try not to think about the fact that he has a life expectancy of 25 . Inspiring: He says he can even feel pain when he is asleep but is trying his best to 'live in the moment' Sufferers are dubbed the 'butterfly children' due to the fragility of their skin: as breakable as a butterfly wing. The condition has outlined Jonathan from many childhood activities. A sports fanatic, he played hockey and loved gym class until his condition meant he could not compete with the other children. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a general term used to describe a group of rare inherited skin disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile. Any trauma or friction to the skin can cause painful blisters. Mason has the rarest form of EB where blistering occurs at the junction between the epidermis and the dermis. In most cases, the symptoms of EB are obvious from birth. It is caused by faulty genes inherited from one or both parents. There are many cases when both parents are carriers of the faulty gene without realising it. EB is rare. Just one in every 17,000 children has it. There are thought to be 5,000 people living with EB in the UK. There is no cure for EB so the treatment aims at preventing blisters becoming infected. Moving forward, he is channeling his fascination into other aspects of sports. He has appeared as a sportscaster on Canadian TV shows, and guest commentated football games for SportsNet. 'It's unfortunate but you've just got to go with the flow, there's nothing I can do about it,' he told the Ottawa Citizen. 'I just studied different options - if I can't do this I'll think of other options. So that's why I came into sportscasting and scouting and coaching, that's where it all started. 'I can't play sports but there's much more to sports than players.' Professionals are astounded, remarking on his knowledge, his confidence and his maturity. Jonathan credits these attributes to his condition: 'Because I can't play sports, I stay with the adults. So I guess I had to kind of grow up faster.' He admits there is a 'nagging' feeling at the back of his mind every day that 'I only have 10 years left.' But for now, he's trying to 'live in the moment.' 'Great things do not come easily,' he told an audience at National We Day last week. 'But they do come when you try with your full heart, when you're willing and open to embrace life, when you take things one day at a time and use what you've got.' His mother, Tina, said it is a struggle every day as she bathes him, knowing he is in pain. However, she cherishes the silver lining: 'I see him every day waking up with a smile.'","Jonathan Pitre has deep blistering wounds all over his body that won't heal .

"A shocking surveillance video showing a mob of teenagers beating two high school students on a subway platform has been released. The footage captured at Spring Garden station in Philadelphia on Tuesday shows the group of youngsters viciously attacking the victims just seconds before the train pulls into the station. They then pull them to the ground, punch them and repeatedly stamp on their heads. Brawl: The footage captured at Spring Garden station in Philadelphia on Tuesday shows the group of youngsters viciously attacking the victims . Targeted: They then pull them to the ground and punch them. Other parts of the brawl are hidden from the cameras behind pillars in the subway station . The brawl, involving students from Benjamin Franklin High School, even spilled onto the tracks, with one person falling onto the line during the confrontation. As a train pulls up, both the victims and some of the suspects appear to get on the same carriage. Witnesses tried to intervene, but couldn't break up the group as the assailants kept on hitting the helpless youngsters. About a dozen students appear to be egging the fight on which officials have said may have started because of a dispute over a girl. The victims were allegedly followed into the station from the street. As they got onto the platform, someone pointed them out with a signal. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority Police Chief Thomas J. Nestel III told Philly.com: 'It’s an outrageous event. This is so dangerous, it’s not even funny. We have operating trains down there. There are passengers waiting for the train... it’s horrendous. 'We've identified some potential aggressors. There is a criminal investigation with the school district,"" Nestel said. ""The message that we're trying to get out is if you act up on SEPTA, we're going to have a picture of your face and we're sharing it with the school district. School district spokesman Fernando Gallard also told the news website those involved could be expelled or face serious disciplinary action. 'What we have seen is a brutal violent attack that could that could have ended with a loss of life.' SEPTA detectives are said to have spoken to the two boys who were victims in the attack.

"Do you want to live like hip hop mogul Lucious Lyon from the hit show 'Empire'? If you have the bank balance of a mogul you could splash out on the house used for location shoots in the Fox show, which is filmed in the Chicago area. The enormous 20,000 square foot mansion in the ritzy suburb of Barrington is opulent and private, sitting by two lakes in eight acres of manicured gardens. Scroll Down for Video . Fit for a mogul - the enormous mansion serves as the backdrop to the hit show Empire . It took five years to build the house, which sits by two lakes in eight acres of manicured gardens . The sophisticated five bedroom, nine bathroom French Country-style estate that serves as a glamorous backdrop to the show is listed at $13 million, having failed to find a buyer at $15.9 million since it first hit the market in 2013. It took five years to build the enormous mansion, with construction finally coming to a halt in 2008. This lengthy building period was partly due to the huge amount of custom woodwork and ornamentation in the house. The show centers on Lucious Lyon, played by Terence Howard, deciding which of his three sons will take over his company, Empire Entertainment . For the show, the interiors are staged often to look more dramatic than the house does in real life . The mansion even has an owner worthy of Empire, in strip club owner Sam Cecola, according to Curbed. Cecola owns the Admiral Theater strip club in Albany Park, Illinois, and previously owned the Club Paradise strip club in Las Vegas. He had to relinquish ownership of the Las Vegas property due to legal problems involving tax fraud and alleged connections to organized crime. As in the show, the stately living room features a grand piano . The house is as opulent in real life as it is in the show and has a lot of room for entertaining . The house includes a wet bar, walnut-paneled library, huge gourmet kitchen and a built-in safe and state-of-the-art security system. Outside there is a dog run, an outdoor pool, outdoor fireplace and a pond, as well as extensive waterfront views. A full bar opens out onto a terrace and the garden on the lower level . A light bright dining room just off the grand hallway . In the show, Luscious Lyon, played by Terence Howard, has been diagnosed with ALS and is trying to determine which of his three sons will succeed him and run his entertainment business. His outspoken ex-wife, Cookie, played by Taraji P. Henson, is fresh out of prison after 17 years for drug dealing and is also demanding her share of the business. The bedrooms are simply and elegantly decorated in a tasteful color palette . In the show, Lucious' daughter Lola has a bedroom fit for a princess . The formal walnut-paneled study is deeply masculine and worthy of an industry mogul . Lucious' study on the show is darker and more dramatic .","The giant mansion used to film the hit show Empire is on the market for $13 million following a price drop .

"Forget a feather down pillow - this boy would rather use his cat's belly as a place to rest his head. California-based YouTube user Lionel Hutz filmed his young son chasing the family feline around the garden in a bid to get some rest. Footage shows the cat  licking his fur before his human friend comes along and plonks himself on top. After a brief moment of stillness, the cat immediately gets up and scurries over to another spot. The boy then proceeds to follow the pet to his new location. Eager to get some rest, the infant repeats the same move and rolls to the ground. The sequence happens one more time before the cat decides he's had enough of being used as a pillow and wanders off indoors. A later video shows the duo swiftly made up, and the boy is seen gently feeding the cat handfuls of treats.

"Whoever snatched a seal or sea lion pup from a Los Angeles beach early Sunday should not confuse the animal's cuteness with its potentially vicious bite, according to an animal rescue expert. Witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup in a blanket and left in a car around 3:20 a.m. from Dockweiler State Beach, just west of the city's international airport, said Los Angeles Police Officer Rosario Herrera. The initial police report said the animal was a small seal. Marine Animal Rescue managed to save another young sea lion shortly after the animal escaped several people said to be harassing it . Witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup (not pictured) in a blanket and left in a car around  from Dockweiler State Beach . But a companion pup that escaped and was later found on the beach is a sea lion, according to Peter Wallerstein, the president of the group Marine Animal Rescue. The rescued pup weighs about 25 pounds and is probably 10 months old, said Wallerstein, who stays in a trailer at the beach and was woken by security guards seeking his help. Sea lions of this size are 'really small, really look cute, but they're dangerous,' he said. 'These are wild animals.' They're also not fit to be kept as pets. Though small pups are cute they can be very dangerous, officials warned . 'The animal needs fluids, needs special treatments,' he said. 'You can't just feed it dog food. It's not going to work.' Los Angeles police said an investigation was being conducted by the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A spokesman for the agency did not return phone messages or an email Sunday.","Authorities say that while sea lion pups can be cute they also have a vicious bite .

"Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto . The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend . And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight . The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit . King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy . The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip…from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013 . A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one. 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.","Spanish football manager tore the side of his trousers exposing his thigh .

"FA chairman Greg Dyke revealed on Wednesday night that Harry Kane has informed England he wants to play for his country in the European U21 Championships. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino would prefer Kane to rest at the end of his first full campaign rather than compete in the tournament in the Czech Republic. Spurs and England have been in talks for some time without reaching an agreement. Tottenham forward Harry Kane has been in superb form this season, netting 30 goals for the club so far . Kane scores Tottenham's third goal during the 3-1 win against Newcastle United at St James' Park last week . FA Chairman Greg Dyke (left) stands with Reading chairman John Madejski during the FA Cup semi-final . Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino would like Kane to be rested at the end of his breakthrough season . Dyke, however, said: 'I got a call from Harry Kane's agent recently just to say how much he enjoyed playing for England recently and how much he wants to play for the U21s this year in the Euros and that's important. 'If you're a young English boy coming through the system you should want to play for England.' It was part of a St George's Day message from the FA chairman designed to strengthen the bond between England's patron saint and its football team. 'England has the best football team in the British Isles and if England as a football team does well then England is a united country,' Dyke said. 'Football plays a big part in England and should play a big part in St George's Day.' Kane, with 30 goals for Spurs this season and one on his England debut last month, is due to join Tottenham's end-of-season trip Malaysia and Australia. He is scheduled to return at the start of June and, if he is part of Gareth Southgate's U21 squad, he could be away on international duty until the start of July, after which he will need a break and would miss the start of Pochettino's pre-season plans. Kane scored on his senior England debut against Lithuania in March, continuing his fine form this term . England, meanwhile, have pulled out of the annual Victory Shield U16 tournament for the home nations in an effort to save an estimated £120,000 a year. Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England have contested the trophy every year since 1947 but the FA announced it will withdraw for the foreseeable future. They are keen to target more fixtures against stronger European nations – and Dyke is reviewing costs to find £30million for his grassroots revolution. Earlier this month, Sportsmail revealed the England non-league team, known as England C, was under threat from these cuts. Dyke has revealed that Kane wants to play for England's Under 21s side at the European Championships .","Harry Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season, netting 30 goals for the club while also scoring on his senior England debut .

"Brendan Rodgers has come out fighting after suffering Wembley disappointment and insisted he is the right man to lead Liverpool next season. Another trophyless season is nearing an end after losing to Aston Villa but Rodgers said: 'I don't think there is anyone better. That is the reality of how I see it. Three months ago I was a tactical genius. Now I have lost a game and it is not so good. 'I have got a strong relationship with the owners and they understand that this was going to be the process.

Henderson is expected to take Gerrard's captain's armband on a permanent basis when the iconic No 8 departs for Los Angeles Galaxy when his contract expires at the end of the season.

"Ronald Koeman is looking forward to this weekend's 'special' match against Tottenham, ahead of which the Southampton manager praised the 'great job' predecessor Mauricio Pochettino did at St Mary's. The former Argentina defender ended a 16-month stint on the south coast last summer to sign a five-year deal at White Hart Lane. Pochettino's exit was the catalyst to an unparalleled talent drain from St Mary's, although successor Koeman has not only steered the club to calmer waters but to new heights.

Koeman had to cope with several player sales at Southampton, including Luke Shaw to Manchester United . Attacking midfielder Adam Lallana (right) was also sold to Liverpool shortly after Koeman arrived at the club . With five matches remaining, Saints are just a point and a place worse off than Spurs in sixth and can usurp them in the European spots with victory in Saturday's early kick-off. 'Everybody was afraid because we had to make a lot of changes in the team,' Koeman told reporters. 'But I think the quality of the players that we brought in were good, at a good level. I think the rest of the players had really a good aspiration and ambition to do a good season, to play a good season at a good level. 'Now we are fighting for a high position in the table. There's still five games to play and a very nice one this Saturday afternoon. 'It is Tottenham, the difference is only one point and, okay, for the fans maybe it makes it a little bit more special because Mauricio is now the coach and was the coach of Southampton. 'He is the coach of the opponent this Saturday, so that makes it special but the game will be decided between the white lines.' Koeman was speaking at St Mary's after meeting Barclays Spirit of the Game hero Tina Croucher, who was being rewarded for her community work at the club. The Southampton manager and midfielder Victor Wanyama answered questions from a handful of supporters as part of the event, where talk of Pochettino was rarely far away. Koeman says his return along with the potential implications of the result makes Saturday's match the biggest at St Mary's since he took the reins. A positive result would see Saints break their record Premier League points haul set last year by Pochettino, although he is unlikely to get a particularly warm reception. The former Argentina defender's departure left a sour taste with many Southampton fans, whose travelling support gave him a taster of what to expect at White Hart Lane earlier in the season. 'Sometimes if you go as a Barcelona player to Madrid the reception is difficult, and sometimes in Holland,' Koeman said, when asked if he has such a bad reception. 'But, okay, I think the reception for Mauricio normally has to be good because he did a great job for Southampton. 'I like him as a person and as a coach and we have a good contact.' Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama (centre) shields the ball from Swansea players back in September . There certainly does not appear any bad blood between Koeman and Pochettino, despite the latter suggesting earlier in the year that he handed the Dutchman an easy job at Southampton. Koeman took those comments in his stride, joking at the time that he only came to Southampton 'to have a nice little holiday'. Now, just days before the game, the Saints boss gave a more serious answer, praising his Spurs counterpart for the legacy he left at St Mary's. 'I think they make the beginning (of this) and developed the quality of the players, the young players,' Koeman said. 'I think the structure and organisation in the team, the spirit of the players starts under Mauricio. 'I took that over and maybe we were different in some details. From what I heard, maybe I try to do more training sessions with the ball and maybe he was a little bit more physical. 'I think the start, for the development of the team, was under Mauricio and he did a great job last season. 'We continue (that) and so far we made it a little bit better than it was, but that is all about the experience and quality of the players.'

"When pretty much any vehicle is rear ended by a tank...there is only going to be one outcome - and a very costly insurance bill. And that's exactly what happened when this poor truck driver had a nasty prang with the huge armoured vehicle during rush hour in Changchun city, China, on Thursday April 16. The dramatic collision is being dubbed the 'craziest rear-end collision in the country', reports the People's Daily Online. Pictures and videos of the scene were posted to Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, and quickly went viral. According to eyewitnesses, the accident happened on the Rainbow Plaza roundabout. It's unclear whether or not this is a military tank serving the state army, but footage shows people inside the vehicle were wearing camouflage uniforms. No comments have been given by the authorities regarding the cause of the incident. Chinese internet users however take great interests in the unusual collision. In addition to calling it 'craziest', many are concerned over the insurance compensation. 'How does compensation work? Is the police going to pay that? How about the government?' Asked one user named 'The Sun is shining on America'. Other users point out tanks are not allowed to be on the road in China and wondered how this particular vehicle had ended up in a residential area.

"Israel is developing a system to accurately detect tunnelling activity, it has been revealed. The 'first of its kind' equipment, developed by Elbit Systems working with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, will be able to detect activity at a distance using a series of sensors. These sensors were so precise there would be 'no false alarms'. The decision comes after the Israeli army considered more than 700 proposals aimed at combating a tunnel threat. Israel is developing a system to accurately detect tunnelling activity, it has been revealed. Above, an Israeli soldier inspects a tunnel in August 2014 . It is thought the system will cost around £2.3million ($3.5m) per mile to install. A proposed area to introduce it is along the land border between Gaza and Israel, officials said. Alon Shuster, head of Sha’ar Hanegev regional council, told The Times of Israel the move would be welcomed by residents. He said: 'This advancement provides an additional layer of security.' The exact time-frame of the project has not been made clear, although it has been reported it will take around a year to install. It comes after years of fighting between Israel and Gaza. It is thought the system will cost around £2.3million ($3.5m) per mile to install. Above, Palestinian men look at what used to be a tunnel . Israeli military spokesmen have previously said the aim of some of their attacks was to destroy cross-border tunnels, which are usually around one metre wide and 2.5 metres tall. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated the concern about tunnels in August 2014 and said soldiers were completing 'neutralisation' of the underground network. The new system has successfully passed initial tests. More results will be available in the next few months, officials added.","Elbit Systems are working with the Israeli Ministry of Defense .

"Marouane Fellaini has paid tribute to the departing Steven Gerrard, hailing the Liverpool midfielder as being the best passer of the ball he has faced during his professional career. The Belgian put to one side Manchester United's rivalry with their north-west rivals to heap praise on the Reds captain for his range of passing in an interview for manutd.com. Fellaini was on the pitch as Gerrard was dismissed just 38 seconds after coming on during Liverpool's 2-1 defeat to United at Anfield last month. Marouane Fellaini picked Steven Gerrard as the best passer he has played against in an official club interview . Gerrard has been revered by many throughout his Liverpool and England career for his passing ability . Michael Carrick has been impressive form since returning from injury for Manchester United . But when asked who was the best passer he has played against, the 27-year-old answered with the simple response: 'Steven Gerrard.' United face the 27-year-old's former club Everton this Sunday with a vital three points at stake in their quest to secure automatic Champions League football next season, and Fellaini acknowledged Toffees skipper Phil Jagielka as being the toughest tackler he has come up against since departing Goodison Park in September 2013. The former Standard Liege man also ranked Wayne Rooney as the best finisher he has shared a dressing-room with, while Phil Jones was given the accolade of the toughest tackler. Fellaini struggled however to pick between two of his fastest team-mates, pondering: 'I'd definitely say Smalling, but I'd also say James Wilson, he's really fast too.' Wayne Rooney was described by Fellaini as the best finisher he has played with at Manchester United . Everton's Phil Jagielka has been lauded by Marouane Fellaini for his ability to execute the toughest tackle . In the 'With and against' question and answer piece, there was  mention of Nemanja Vidic as the fittest player the £27million signing has played against, while the Belgian also named Sylvain Distin as the most athletic player he has played alongside. 'He is unbelievable. He is very fit for 37,' said Fellaini, who also reserved special praise for Yakubu during his time at Everton for the Nigerian's prolific finishing.","Manchester United midfielder picks Wayne Rooney as his best finisher .

"Jamie Carragher believes Brendan Rodgers is still the right man to lead Liverpool forward after a season with no trophies and a likely finish outside the top four. Rodgers' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy, but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager. Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. Jamie Carragher shared this image on Instagram after collecting a Beacon Award on Tuesday . 'It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. 'That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. Brendan Rodgers is under pressure at Liverpool after a third straight season without a trophy . Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup by Aston Villa in a disappointing semi-final performance . 'The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. Carragher, pictured at the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, backed Rodgers to stay at Anfield . The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. 'I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. 'There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'","Jamie Carragher believes Brendan Rodgers is the right man for Liverpool .

"Aston Villa Cup hero Jack Grealish has become the latest young Barclays Premier League star to be accused of getting high on 'hippy crack'. The 19-year-old midfielder, who inspired Tim Sherwood's team to their FA Cup semi-final triumph over Liverpool on Sunday, has been photographed inhaling from a white balloon believed to be filled with nitrous oxide — more commonly known as laughing gas. According to The Sun, the selfie  — which shows Grealish and a friend — was taken in a hotel room about six months ago following a night out. Jack Grealish has become the third top flight starlet caught on camera apparently inhaling nitrous oxide . Grealish starred for Villa in their FA Cup semi-final win over Liverpool on Sunday at Wembley . Grealish is the third Premier League starlet this month to be exposed apparently using the legal high, after Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, 20, and West Bromwich Albion forward Saido Berahino, 21, were both pictured sucking from balloons. Nitrous oxide is popular on the party scene and users say it creates feelings of euphoria and light-headedness, while others experience hallucinations. Drug advice website Frank warns, however, that ‘there is a risk of death as a lack of oxygen can occur’. Aston Villa declined to comment on Wednesday night. The allegations come after it emerged that Grealish is ready to commit his international future to England, provided Roy Hodgson assures him he figures in his long-term plans. Grealish is at the centre of a tug-of-war between England and the Republic of Ireland. He was born in the Midlands to English parents but qualifies for the Republic through his grandparents. He will give himself until the summer, when the two countries face each other, before deciding. But Sportsmail understands the teenager is leaning towards a future with England. He has received guarantees from Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill, who wants to pick the star in his squad to face England in June. Meanwhile, FA chairman Greg Dyke on Wednesday night claimed Spurs striker Harry Kane has told England he wants to play at the European Under 21 Championship. Dyke said: 'I got a call from Harry's agent to say how much he enjoyed playing for England and how much he wants to play for the U21s this year in the Euros and that's important.'

"A nine-year-old girl was attacked by a lion that was being walked like a dog by circus entertainers who had brought their show to a quiet Siberian village. The girl is in hospital after she was savaged by the animal in Namtsy, in the Sakha Republic in Siberia - one of the coldest regions in the world. Photographs show the lion being walked around by a worker for a circus that had been visiting the village. A lion that appeared to be being walked like a dog around the Siberian village of Namtsy attacked a child . In one picture an entertainer crouches down next to the lion, surrounded by snow. In another she is shown walking the animal and appears to be attempting to drag it across a wet and icy road using a makeshift leash. The circus is believed to have left Namtsy - also known as Yakutia - abruptly after the incident. The girl was walking home from music school with her mother when she was attacked, the Siberian Times reported. Gavril Kolpashnikov, the girl's father, said: 'I was fishing, and got back at night. I saw my child in a horrible condition. To put it mildly, stressed. She's shocked. 'The child is still shaking, she's not of those brave kids.' The nine-year-old girl was reportedly savaged by the lion, and was taken to hospital for treatment . The circus is believed to have abruptly left the village - one of the coldest places in the world - after the attack . He added: 'They were walking their animal as if it was a dog.'

"Liverpool are showing interest in Borussia Dortmund striker Ciro Immobile. The Italy international has not had the best of times in the Bundesliga following his move from Torino last summer and Dortmund are willing to sell. Immobile fits the profile of player Liverpool want. He has pace and is a busy forward who can chase down the opposition. His goals ratio has dropped at Dortmund but he has still managed nine goals in a troubled season for the team. Ciro Immobile (left) of Dortmund has struggled in Germany and is wanted by Liverpool to boost their attack .

Dortmund are expecting further departures with Manchester United keen on Mats Hummels and Ilkay Gundogan while Real Madrid have expressed interest once again in Marco Reus. Liverpool are also continuing to check on Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia but their lack of Champions League football could prove crucial in their pursuit of certain players as well as their budget. Arsenal have also considered reviving interest in France international Kondogbia. Arsene Wenger enquired after the 22-year-old while he was at Sevilla.

Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka was understood to be the object of Tottenham's attentions with Chelsea and West Ham also represented at the game. Chelsea have checked on Standard Liege left-back Damien Dussaut. The 20-year-old Frenchman has only started five games in the Belgian league this season but is seen as a bright prospect. Paris Saint Germain remain keen on Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech with Liverpool looking unlikely to match the financial package required to prise him out of Stamford Bridge. PSG also like Tottenham's Hugo Lloris but Daniel Levy is no mood to sell the France goalkeeper. Damien Dussaut (left) has impressed for Standard Liege despite only starting five games this season . Manchester City are considering the merits of QPR goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. The 25-year-old has had to take a back seat this season while in-form Robert Green held down the No 1 spot. However, the England U21 international is still recognised as one of the more talented English keepers in the country and has been the subject of interest from Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton over the past year. Alex McCarthy (centre) has played second fiddle to Rob Green at QPR but could be a target for Man City . He joined QPR from Reading at the end of last August despite Brendan Rodgers making an attempt to take him to Anfield. City need to address their shortage of homegrown players and McCarthy could fit in. Feyenoord, meanwhile, are struggling to finance a transfer for City striker John Guidetti who has been on loan at Celtic. Stoke City are keen on Blackpool teenager Dom Telford. The 18-year-old striker managed to break into the Blackpool first team this season scoring on his home debut against Rotherham in December. Dom Telford (right) of Blackpool has attracted interest from Stoke, who made a bid for the player in January . City manager Mark Hughes made an approach in January which was rejected but has continually sent scouts to monitor his progress and Telford could reject a contract at Bloomfield Road to switch to the Britannia. Hughes is keen to add more quality young players and has already moved for Barcelona's Moha El Mouriachi, 19, and Thibaud Verlinden, 15, of Standard Liege. Blackpool's Mark Waddington, 18, remains a target for Brighton. Fulham and QPR are showing interest in Celtic defender Efe Ambrose. Both London clubs are looking to re-shape their squads in the summer and Ambrose would still fit into their wage structure. The 26-year-old Nigeria international who has 46 caps is ready to leave Celtic and has interest from Premier League sides also but is keen on a move to London. QPR will lose Steven Caulker, Rio Ferdinand, possibly Richard Dunne and expect Nedum Onouha to move on also. Celtic defender Efe Ambrose is ready to leave the club and is wanted by London rivals Fulham and QPR . West Ham have revived interest in Pedro Obiang of Sampdoria as they consider midfield targets. As reported by Sportsmail, West Ham have doubts about a permanent deal for Alex Song with Inter Milan also showing an interest. Roberto Mancini has Song and Lucas Leiva of Liverpool on his back-up list should he fail to sign Yaya Toure from Manchester City. West Ham want more energy in midfield and have considered James McArthur of Crystal Palace but Obiang remains on their radar too. Spanish-born Obiang is a Spain U21 international and began his career with Atletico Madrid. West Ham showed interest last summer and in January.

"Andrea Dossena, the defender Liverpool once paid £7million for, will face no further action after he was accused of shoplifting in Harrods. The 33-year-old, now with League One strugglers Leyton Orient, hit headlines around the world when he was arrested at the Knightsbridge store on April 7. However, Metropolitan Police have confirmed that the Italian and a 31-year-old woman also held at the scene, were released after being interviewed. Andrea Dossena (scoring against Real Madrid) will face no further action after being accused of shoplifting . Dossena, whose crowning moment for Liverpool came when he scored the winner against Real Madrid in the Champions League, last turned out for the relegation-fighting Os on April 14 in a 1-0 home loss to Doncaster Rovers. He also netted four days after that strike against Real back in March 2009, lobbing Edwin van der Sar away at Manchester United in a 4-1 win. Dossena, whose signing was seen as something of a coup for Orient, earned around £40,000-a-week at Anfield. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'A 33-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman who were arrested on suspicion of shoplifting were advised on April 10 that they would face no further action.'

"Manchester United's pursuit of Edinson Cavani took a blow on Monday morning as Paris Saint-Germain denied they are prepared to sell the striker. United have been considering a bid for the Uruguayan as they look to freshen up their forward options, with Radamel Falcao expected to return to Monaco, and Robin van Persie failing to hold down a starting place. But PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi said the French champions were determined to hold on to the 28-year-old and have not even considered selling him.

"Nike have been forced to defend their new kits for the US women's national team following outcry over the fact they do not represent the American flag. The latest design, which will be worn by the women's team at this summer's World Cup, features an all white strip with hints of black and yellow - while the aqua colour cleats are a tribute to Canada who will be hosting the tournament. Charlie Brooks, Nike's vice president of North America communications, has defended the company's decision not to promote the 'Stars and Stripes'. ((L-R) Tobin Heath, Alex Morgan and Sydne Leroux of the USA women's team pose in their new kits . The outfits, which will be worn at the World cup, have been criticised as they do not represent the US flag . 'Not every team pays homage to the flag,' he said. 'Take Germany's kit for example, world champions. The German flag is yellow, red and black. The kit is white with black trim on it. 'I understand people asking about the colors, but there's also that level of not all national teams have to represent the flag.'

The US women's team will be hoping to replicate the success of their male counterparts who reached the last 16 of the 2015 World Cup in Brazil.

"Sir Alex Ferguson, the quiet years. No singular drive, no all-consuming discipline that keeps him on the go from pre-dawn ‘til the streetlights are burning bright. As this most honoured of sporting knights puts it himself: ‘I don’t have obsessions now.’ There’s certainly nothing that comes close to football for the famous Fergie, who has instead chosen to spend his retirement devoting himself to any number of causes; at last count, he was associated with a good dozen charities or foundations. And it will surprise no-one to learn that, while doing his bit for UNICEF, Barnardo’s et al, a little of the old firebrand spirit still burns brightly. If you want to build a statue to a Govan radical who led a rent strike and changed more than just her own wee corner of the world, Sir Alex is the man you call. Sir Alex Ferguson watches on from the stands during Manchester United's clash with Chelsea on April 18 . Ferguson, in Glasgow on Thursday to make a £5,000 donation to the Remember Mary Barbour Fund, actually physically writing out a cheque towards a permanent memorial, revealed that his life hasn’t so much slowed down as merely changed gear since he stepped down as Manchester United manager in the summer of 2013. The 73-year-old, who had lived and breathed football since making his senior debut at the age of just 16, was famous not just for the trophies won – his haul of 49 assorted cups and prizes making him easily Britain’s most successful ever manager – but the hours put in. Raised to believe that hard work was as necessary as breathing, Ferguson’s ability to push players hard was based at least in part on the example he set himself. That work ethic, simply part of his upbringing in Govan, isn’t something he’s let slide just because he no longer has one demanding day job. ‘What I’m doing is making sure I remain active,’ said Ferguson, looking trim and at ease. ‘That’s important when you retire, so I’ve got many things on my plate. ‘It’s funny, though. It’s a different kind of work. Whereas at United I was in at quarter to seven every morning, and be there to tea time every day, that was one constant thing all your life – I was doing one thing. Ferguson celebrates United's Premier League title victory in May 2013 with Rio Ferdinand . ‘Now I’m doing different things, which is maybe even more exhausting! There is no one thing, nothing like that. I don’t have obsessions now. I don’t get up at six o’clock in the morning, that’s for sure. I have a long lie now and again.’ Football is no longer the dominant factor in his life, with even questions on the game receiving short shrift, although – and this wasn’t always the case back in his managerial days - he was very polite in his refusal, answering the one out-of-bounds query by saying: Listen, Aberdeen are doing fantastic. They’ ve got a great manager and I love that club. But I’m here to talk about Mary Barbour. I don’t blame you for asking …’ Wherever Ferguson goes, he takes his native burgh with him, freely attributing a great deal of his sporting success to the lessons he learned either at home, at Harmony Row Boys Club or Govan High. ‘Your upbringing is important,’ he said yesterday, adding: ‘I think it’s the foundation of your life. I was fortunate enough to have good parents who did the best they could possibly do for me. ‘There are many people who have said I came from a poor background. I don’t think people brought up in my time thought they were poor. Ferguson and then Everton boss David Moyes shout instructions from the sideline at Old Trafford in May 2013 . ‘Talking about the role of the housewife and mother, they made sure the food was always on the table. That was the case with me. ‘You were always dressed the best way you could possibly be – and you were taught to be the best you can be. ‘That came not just from the parents but from teachers at school. That was their role. I don’t think necessarily education is about learning lessons in school. It’s about inspiring you. And I was inspired by many people.’ Ferguson wasn’t taught about Mary Barbour at school, admitting that he’d only come across her tale when looking through a book of historical Glasgow photographs complied by the great Harry Benson. Ferguson's haul of 49 assorted cups and prizes making him easily Britain’s most successful ever manager . Barbour famously led rent strikes in Glasgow at the height of the First World War, forcing a change in the law with the introduction of the Rent Restrictions Act. A consistent campaigner throughout her life, she went on to become one of the city’s first female councillors, the first female Bailie and female magistrate. The fund-raising campaign is aimed at building a statue of Barbour, to be erected on Govan Cross, Ferguson explaining his involvement by saying: ‘There was a connection with Govan, which is what stirred the real interest in me. ‘There is that great photo of all the housewives in Govan standing outside the close; that rent men was never getting in that close. That registers deeply with me. I’ve looked at that photograph many, many times. That is where my interest comes from – and it’s a great cause.’ For further information about the campaign please go to: RememberMaryBarbour.com .

"Ronald Koeman held a meeting with Southampton's players to refocus their minds on European qualification after Victor Wanyama's future came under question. This weekend is arguably Saints' biggest match of their season, with former manager Mauricio Pochettino returning to St Mary's for the first time since leaving for Tottenham in the summer. Just a point and a place separate Koeman's men from Spurs in sixth, although this season's surprise success has brought with it speculation that players will exit much like last summer. Ronald Koeman held a meeting with Southampton's players to refocus their minds on European qualification . Victor Wanyama's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at move to Arsenal . Morgan Schneiderlin, Nathaniel Clyne and Jay Rodriguez have all been linked with a move away, while Wanyama was quoted on Thursday claiming Arsenal were interested in his services. The Kenyan denied making those comments in subsequently deleted Twitter posts - an incident which proved the catalyst to Koeman sitting his squad down on Thursday morning. 'I spoke to Victor this morning,' Koeman said. 'We had a meeting with all the players because what we need is now to really have the focus on the last five games. We play for a European position on the table. 'We have a massive game this Saturday and no interest in talking about rumours in the press about future and contracts and have the focus on the football side. 'That's difficult but it's not true what they put in the press and I believe the player. Koeman spoke to Wanyama and his other players to refocus them on the last five Premier League games . Morgan Schneiderlin has been linked with moves to Arsenal and Tottenham in another Saints firesale . 'It's a good signal for everybody that we have to be focused to the football side and not about the contracts. I do not answer any more questions about player's contracts and the focus on the last five games.' Koeman called the Wanyama story 'bulls***' in a separate interview and the midfielder later posted on Twitter to clarify the situation. 'Sorry - was caught off guard this morning about a story that I hadn't read,' he said. 'To put it straight: We all respect Arsenal but right now I'm only focussed on helping Saints to have a strong finish to the season. Manchester United are said to be interested in signing Southampton's English right back Nathaniel Clyne . 'The newspaper article does not say that I have spoken to Wenger or anyone else from Arsenal - and that's the truth. 'We are doing so well and what other managers think of me as a player is totally out of my control.' Wanyama is one of a number of players to have spoken about their future in recent months, with such comments becoming increasingly regular as the season comes to a close. A week does not go by without Koeman having to field questions about the future of his players and that is something he says has to stop. Jay Rodriguez is still not back from a year-long injury lay-off but he has been linked to Manchester City . 'It's not a lot about the players but in my case as well because I have always to answer questions about Schneiderlin, about Clyne, about the future of the players,' he said. 'I think now is the moment to really focus on what we have to do which is to win the games and not about future of players. 'If I keep going talking about future of players, it's easy for the players to do the same and we said together we need to be focused on the football side and we don't need to talk about the other side.'","Ronald Koeman called a meeting to refocus his Southampton players .

"A controversial video of a woman applying make-up to a monkey has sparked debate online between those who think it is cruel and those cute. Teresa Bullock captured the two-minute clip at her house in Ohio on the birthday of her 18-year-old Macaque monkey named Angel. The video shows the monkey sitting up on a sink having its eyebrows plucked with a pair of tweezers. Its owner then proceeds to apply what looks like moisturizing cream, eye-liner, mascara and finally, and perhaps most shockingly, red lipstick. Discussing the clip, Teresa Bullock told Jukin Video: ‘Angel is an 18-year-old Java Macaque monkey with health issues so she is a little more human than most because she has to have diabetic shots twice daily and a heart pill. ‘She loves to do anything she watches you do and being pampered is the best part of her day, other than playing with her kitty. She is loved by many and smarter than most.' The monkey's owner Teresa Bullock captured the two-minute clip at her house in Ohio on the birthday of her 18-year-old Macaque  named Angel . Despite this however, the video itself has been met with some concern from viewers. On Twitter, Jordan Reilly wrote: ‘I just watched a video of a lady putting make up on a monkey. I don't understand our world anymore.’ While YouTube user Samantha B wrote: ‘Are you sure she likes it? Baring teeth is a sign of fear and threatening in the monkey world. The video is cute, I just don't know if it's worth the monkey's agony.’ Speaking to MailOnline, PETA's UK Director, Mimi Bekhechi, said that ill-informed people are often inspired to obtain monkeys as pets on the back of such videos. In the video the owner proceeds to apply what looks like moisturising cream, eye-liner, mascara and finally, and perhaps most shockingly, red lipstick . She said: ‘Macaques live in highly interactive troops of 80 to 100 members, and a young female rhesus monkey stays with her mother and sisters for life. They form ‘one of the tightest and most complicated social systems in the animal kingdom,’ according to renowned primatologist Frans de Waal. ‘In captivity, this essential social fabric is ripped apart, and their individual needs and desires – such as seeking a mate, raising their young, and resolving territorial disputes – are completely thwarted. ‘A life indoors without the essential companionship of other monkeys – to be used as a living doll, no less – bears no resemblance to a macaque's natural life. PETA's UK director, Mimi Bekhechi, said that videos like this 'often inspire ill-informed people to obtain monkeys as pets' ‘What's more, many captive primates were torn away from their mothers in the wild shortly after birth, leaving them with lasting psychological scars.’ She concluded by saying that keeping monkeys is also potentially dangerous for humans and that not only are stressed primates known to lash out and attack those who keep them in captivity, they can also transmit disease. Adding: ‘The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that the risk of herpes B transmission makes macaques in particular unsuitable as pets.’ Claire Turnbull of Wild Futures also spoke to MailOnline. The clip has been met with some concern from people and Jordan Reilly Tweeted: ‘I just watched a video of a lady putting make up on a monkey. I don't understand our world anymore' She said: 'During the video clip, the macaque displays fear behaviour (the submissive grinning) and repeatedly threatens the person applying the make-up/holding the camera, clearly indicating a level of distress/discomfort.' Adding: 'Although it may appear very cute, it is really very sad. Monkeys are wild animals, they are not pets or playthings for people. This macaque should be in the wild with his/her family in the forest. 'Even if this one is rescued, promoting the idea that they are cute, cuddly and pliable animals only perpetuates the cruel primate pet trade, as it makes people think they want one. 'This viewpoint is shared by prominent experts and primatologists worldwide.'","Teresa Bullock captured the video on the monkey's birthday in Ohio .

"Father-of-two: Paul Doyle, 56, has been jailed after being unmasked as the head of drugs ring . A gangster who lived a life of luxury in a mansion near Premier League footballers has been jailed for 16 years after being unmasked as the head of a drugs ring. Father-of-two Paul Doyle, 56, moved his family into an £820,000 home in Altrincham, Cheshire, despite having never worked and living life ‘on tick’ and incapacity handouts. Doyle - described as a ‘well-known and colourful character’ in his native Salford - put down a £200,000 deposit and obtained a £600,000 mortgage by falsely claiming his wife Jeanette, 49, worked as a company executive. But his family were probed after scandalising the leafy neighbourhood in Altrincham where his teenage son regularly rode quad bikes around the streets and later received an Asbo for terrorising other local children who complained of being robbed and beaten up. Police kept watch on the family’s home where Doyle chopped down the huge front hedge so he could check for unwanted visitors outside. He was eventually arrested during a raid on his five-bedroom house after a major investigation into the supply of various drugs in the North of England, which culminated in the seizure of £15million of cocaine and a haul of heroin. The family have since lost the property and Mrs Doyle is now living in a council house in Salford. Doyle admitted supplying class A and B drugs, between 2012 and 2014, plus money laundering and benefit fraud offences at Manchester Crown Court. He now faces a proceeds of crime hearing. Going in: Police are seen raiding Doyle's £820,000 five-bedroom home in Altrincham, Cheshire, in July 2014 . Luxurious life: Doyle put down a £200,000 deposit and obtained a £600,000 mortgage on the property (above) by falsely claiming his wife Jeanette, 49, worked as a company executive . The court heard Doyle had bought the house as his ‘dream family home’ in 2004 after being freed from a seven-year jail term for cocaine and cannabis dealing plus assault. He was claiming tax credits and other handouts, saying two heart attacks made him unable to work. But he fraudulently claimed Mrs Doyle earned £197,000 a year as a ‘project executive’ for a lettings firm and she was given a mortgage of £616,000. Monthly mortgage repayments were about £3,000 but the accounts were consistently in arrears. And in June 2006 Doyle took out loans totalling £83,000 with finance companies by making similar false representations about Mrs Doyle’s income - and even acquired a new BMW vehicle. Despite the late mortgage payments Doyle paid £450,000 into his and his wife’s bank accounts over a six-year period between 2006 and 2012. On average monthly deposits of £5,778 were made totalling around £77,000 per year. Police began secretly filming Doyle and started to track his car. It emerged he helped finance a cocaine deal in which drugs were brought into the country by couriers who travelled to the UK from France on fishing boats. Entering: The family have since lost the property and Mrs Doyle is now living in a council house in Salford . Going in: Doyle's family were probed after scandalising the leafy neighbourhood where his teenage son regularly rode quad bikes around the streets and later received an Asbo for terrorising other local children . Up to 4.2lbs (1.9kg) of heroin and 170lbs (77kg) of cocaine landed in the UK - but police began arresting Doyle’s accomplices, and he got directly involved in deals himself. He organised a collection of 2.2lbs (1kg) of heroin in Wigan, and then started running a wholesale supply line in cannabis, involving up to 88lbs (40kg), and amphethamines, amounting to around  44lbs (20kg), to crime families in Barrow-in-Furness and Carlisle in Cumbria. He was eventually caught in May last year with 6.6lbs (3kg) of amphetamines in Salford. Whilst in jail on remand police decoded conversations in which Doyle chatted about drugs - one in which he talked about how a friend ‘wanted his hoover back’ - linking him to a Cumbrian heroin dealer who hid just an ounce of the drug inside his Henry vacuum cleaner. Suspicion: Despite the late mortgage payments Doyle paid £450,000 into his and his wife’s bank accounts over a six-year period between 2006 and 2012 . Home: Doyle was claiming tax credits and other handouts, saying two heart attacks made him unable to work . Other recorded conversations heard Doyle use the codeword ‘downstairs’ for heroin, which police were able to work out because of the timing and context of the conversations. Altrincham, a market town near Manchester Airport, is the location of four of the ten most expensive streets in the North West. The top-priced road has an average property value of £2.5million. Manchester City stars James Milner and Joe Hart live in the Altrincham area, in homes worth £3.3million and £2.9million respectively, and Ireland assistant boss Roy Keane is said to have a house there. The local residents also include ex-England international Emily Heskey, who now plays for Bolton Wanderers in the Championship and lives in a £3million six-bedroom house with his wife Chantelle. The Hale area of Altrincham was reported to be home to at least 33 Premier League footballers as of 2010 - including Liverpool, Everton and Manchester United players. Ian McMeekin, defending, said the case was the ‘decline and fall of a drug dealer’. He said Doyle once had a building supply business and when buildings were demolished he would broker on the stolen brick. He added: ‘He is a well known local, born and raised in Salford. He is well known as a colourful character.’ He added that he also undertook protection work in West Africa and China where he was working legitimately but while not paying income tax. He said he was also provided with income from dog breeding. Mr McMeekin said: ‘He didn’t involve his wife through pressure or influence. He operated alone and in ignorance. His wife’s salary was ridiculously high, ought to make anyone question the legitimacy of the application. ‘The defendant has nothing left apart from his family - the house has gone. His ruin is complete and he must accept the whole responsibility for it.’ Sentencing, Judge Richard Mansell QC told Doyle he had ‘barefaced gall’ to claim benefits and added: ‘I’m quite satisfied that you played a lead role in all of your offences. ‘You had close links to the original sources of the drugs and you directed and organised the sale of drugs on a commercial scale. You plainly did make a lot of money from these enterprises - where it has gone is another matter.’ He described Doyle as ‘the head of an organised criminal gang’, who continued to orchestrate the business from behind bars because he had ‘loyal servants working on the outside’.","Father-of-two Paul Doyle moved family into £820,000 home in Altrincham .

"The seeds of the Josh Meekings furore were planted during an otherwise unremarkable match between Hibernian and Dundee in the early weeks of 2013. Easter Road striker Gary Deegan caught Dens defender Gary Irvine high on his right shin in a dangerous challenge. Referee Craig Charleston saw an incident, but not the gory details. The official had his view obstructed by bodies and because of that the SFA could take no action. The governing body immediately took the stance they *should* be allowed to use video evidence to review incidents the referee had clearly missed. They altered the rules. Rules over use of video evidence to retrospectively ban players changed after this challenge by Gary Deegan (right) on Gary Irvine . PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart disagreed, telling them so. And on Thursday night he renewed his call for member clubs to put the genie back in the bottle amidst widespread unease at the fact Meekings might have missed a Scottish Cup Final because a referee and his assistants failed to see a handball in last Sunday’s semi-final victory over Celtic. Retrospective action, believes the Scottish players’ union, has become too far reaching. Its tentacles now stretch to an uncomfortable distance. ‘The referee had a clear view of it but couldn’t see the actual contact because of the two players’ bodies,’ said Wishart of the critical Deegan and Irvine incident two years ago. ‘When the SFA told us they were considering changing the regulation to allow the use of video evidence, we were strongly against it. ‘Under the rules, they couldn’t charge Gary Deegan because the referee was the wrong side of the incident. They moved to change that. ‘But as has been proven with Meekings, it was opening a whole can of worms as you are effectively re-refereeing the games. Inverness defender Josh Meekings clearly used his hand to stop the ball in the Scottish Cup semi-final . ‘We warned this was too far and it would cause problems.’ Wishart takes no pleasure in being vindicated by the decision of the independent appeal panel which lifted a one-game suspension on Inverness player Meekings on Thursday. Under the existing rules, SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan was within his rights to charge the player. He had denied Celtic a goalscoring opportunity with his hand. The officials had missed it and, reviewing the video evidence, the governing body believed it was a red-card offence punishable retrospectively. Echoing the views of FIFA vice president Jim Boyce and others, however, Wishart believes the rules have gone too far. That the authority of referees is now being undermined for matters it shouldn’t be. ‘The purpose of video evidence is not to catch minor things,’ he continued. ‘No player has a problem with anyone getting caught giving a fly punch or kick off the ball. They know they deserve it. ‘I know the referees are not happy with this because Steven McLean is being examined after the game. ‘He made a mistake - but does he deserve the continued fall-out from that? I don’t think referees, players or fans want it. Now FIFA don’t want it, either. ‘We have moved now towards re-refereeing the game. Steven McLean did have a view of the incident on Sunday, even if he didn’t see the handball. ‘If something happens behind a referee’s back – a fly kick – that’s not re-refereeing it because the referee genuinely doesn’t see it. ‘But when referees have a view of it it’s different. ‘Steven McLean was in the ideal position to see it. ‘The rule was brought in primarily for things that happen behind the referee’s back - but he and Alan Muir had a view of this. ‘Their vision might have been blocked - but there are angles where they are looking at it with no players between them. ‘The fact is that we all make mistakes and funnily enough the biggest supporter for the referee in all of this will be the players. ‘They will be annoyed, they will be angry. Players know what it’s like to make a mistake. Meekings has been cleared to play after SFA had banned him after deeming the hand ball a red card offence . ‘It’s a major mistake and that should be dealt with in terms of referee’s observer and their markings. But you can’t re-referee a game. ‘We react to one incident - and what happened here was a reaction to Gary Deegan. ‘The immediate reaction is to change the rules so it can’t happen again. ‘But we can’t just be reacting to one single incident – it has to be wider than that. ‘No one has a problem with penalising violent conduct. The SFA have to listen to everyone within the game.’ Wishart’s issues with events on Sunday extend beyond the Meekings scenario. Inverness defender Gary Warren missed last year’s League Cup Final after contracting two bookings en route. Agonisingly, he suffered the same fate at Parkhead last weekend. In contrast with Meekings, he *will* miss another final against Falkirk under the punitive two strikes rule. ‘There is an element of fairness when it comes to being banned from cup finals, as well,’ added Wishart. ‘Does Gary Warren deserve to miss out due to two bookings? ‘If you’re sent off for violent conduct it’s different, but it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity and for a player to miss it due to two yellows or a soft red seems like injustice to me. It needs to be looked at.’","Scottish PFA chief believes retrospective action is too far reaching .

"QPR manager Chris Ramsey is convinced he is the right man to bring long-term success to Loftus Road - whether Rangers are relegated or not. Ramsey has overseen just one victory since he was appointed permanent manager in February but four points from games against Aston Villa and West Brom, and a narrow defeat to Chelsea, have revived hopes of survival. West Ham's Sam Allardyce and Bournemouth's Eddie Howe have both been linked with Ramsey's job in the summer but the former Tottenham coach believes it would be unfair for his future to depend on Rangers avoiding the drop. QPR manager Chris Ramsey is convinced he is the right man to bring long-term success to Loftus Road . 'I wouldn't say I'm expecting the sack (if QPR are relegated) but I've been in the game a long time and you have to be realistic about what generally happens, whether it's fair or not fair,' Ramsey said. 'I'm going to say it would be unfair because I'll be shopping in Lidl instead of Waitrose, I'll have a different shopping basket. 'I have to look at it from my personal point of view. The club have to do the best for their long term and if it's not me, I'd fully support whatever they decided to do. But I think it is me. 'I think the club long-term needs someone like me to have a holistic approach of building the club.' Ramsey worked with Tim Sherwood at Tottenham's academy, nurturing the likes of Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb - all of whom have thrived at White Hart Lane this season. Rangers have hung their survival hopes on experienced, and often expensive, signings but Ramsey believes he can carry out the club's wish for a more joined-up strategy. The 52-year-old is a popular and respected man within the game, with aspirations of getting the full-time job . 'I think the chairman wants to go that way because we need to keep that stability at the club for the long term,' Ramsey said. 'At Tottenham, it took us nearly a decade to get them where they are, where you could churn out player after player after player to have loads more ready to bolster the squad even if they weren't quite ready. 'At the moment we might only have three or four that could bolster the squad. 'In order to get that correct development you need to be patient but if you do get it right you set the club up for a long time.' Reports suggest that Ramsey could link up with friend Tim Sherwood (left) at Aston Villa in the summer . Rangers are two points adrift of safety having played a game more than the three teams above them and Saturday's game at home to West Ham looks crucial given the club's next two fixtures are away to Manchester City and Liverpool. Ramsey, however, insists he is not feeling the pressure. 'I had more sleepless nights at Tottenham,' Ramsey said. 'Sometimes it's harder when you're the number two, you want the number one to do so well and you're trying your best to help them. 'At the moment it is just myself and I know exactly what I want. 'The only thing here is the fans are so fantastic, they have travelled away with us and been brilliant, and I've had quite good dialogue with the owners. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has been linked with Ramsey's job in the summer . 'It's not about sleepless nights, it's more trying to make sure the people around the club have well-deserved success.' West Ham have endured a disappointing second half to the campaign, winning just twice since the turn of the year and slipping to 10th in the table. Allardyce, whose contract expires in the summer, is not expected to remain at Upton Park next season but Ramsey issued a warning to Hammers fans. 'Sam made a comment if he was called Allerdici he'd get more plaudits and I agree with him,' Ramsey said. 'He'd be called a fantastic tactician. They were top half of the table for the first half of the season. 'If it was the other way round and they'd only moved into the top half now, they'd say he'd been brilliant. So it's only perception. 'At the end of the day, you have to be careful what you wish for.'","Chris Ramsey has overseen just one victory since he was appointed permanent manager in February .

"Virgil van Dijk believed he had sampled the worst refereeing decision of his career the night he landed an early red card against Inter Milan. Events at Hampden on Sunday forced him to revise his opinion. In the aftermath of a contentious Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Inverness Caledonian Thistle, the Dutchman found sleep elusive. The claims of referee Steven McLean and his five assistants that they failed to see the handball by Inverness player Josh Meekings which denied Celtic a penalty, a red card, possibly even a crack at the Treble, struck many at Parkhead as dubious. So dubious they fired off a letter seeking clarification from the SFA. Celtic centre back Virgil van Dijk leaves field following his side's 3-2 to Inverness in the Scottish Cup semi-final . For van Dijk, the collective burst of myopia was remarkable. A greater lapse on a wider scale than the red card he received from Slovakian official Ivan Kruzliak in the last 32 of the Champions League in February; a decision he described at the time as the worst he had experienced. Resting his arms on a table in a Glasgow hotel after being shortlisted for the PFA Scotland player of the year award, the Dutchman said of the Meekings flashpoint: 'Yeah I saw it. I think everybody in the stadium saw everything. It' s very strange that the right decision wasn't made. 'I was maybe near the halfway line. Even in the stands you could see it. It was a miracle that we didn't get the right decision. Van Dijk netted a superb free-kick against Caley Thistle but it wasn't enough to secure victory . 'This decision was terrible. I don't know – I've experienced some decisions lately. The Inter Milan game, of course, was terrible for my feelings. 'The decision on Sunday wasn't right and everyone can see it. It's terrible when you think about it . 'It was harder on my feelings (than Milan). I put the ref in a position in Milan to give me a red card (following his challenges on Rodrigo Palacio and Mauro Icardi) and that's what I have to learn from. 'Sunday's was a clear decision and it wasn't made - and that's a worse feeling.' Wednesday's 2-1 Premiership win over Dundee helped. It carried Celtic another step closer to the title and was recuperative. The presence of two Parkhead players – van Dijk and Stefan Johansen – on the PFA Scotland shortlist suggests the season may yet redeem itself. Josh Meekings handled Leigh Griffiths goal-bound header but none of the officials saw it . Van Dijk is clear that punishing the Inverness player would have been futile and pointless. The blame for what happened lies, he believes, with the officials who created the mess and then closed ranks to insist they simply hadn't seen it. Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton has called on the officials to be held to account. But when SFA the freeze out their officials, it's done behind closed doors, quietly and without ceremony. 'I don't know,' said van Dijk, 'I don't think I can give my opinion on that. I want to move forward as well. We're not in the final. I want to win the league as soon as possible so we need to win on Sunday and move forward. My feeling is you shouldn't be punished for someone else's mistake.' Ronny Deila described the circumstances of the defeat to Inverness as the worst of his career. The Celtic manager returned home to stare at the walls while, for van Dijk, counting sheep proved an inadequate antidote to insomnia. 'Everybody was very down, especially after the game. For myself personally I was devastated, especially during the night, I couldn't sleep that well. 'That was the biggest chance to get the Treble and everyone at Celtic, and I think around Celtic as well, had the feeling that it was going to happen. 'If the right decision had been made in the game on Sunday we would have been in the final and we would hopefully have won the final. 'The Treble was very close. But it's not going to be turned around any more.' There are five games left now to change perceptions of the season. Celtic expect to win the league. With five games left and an eight-point lead over Aberdeen, they are almost there. Thereafter what transpires between Falkirk and Inverness in the Hampden final on May 30 is a source of utter indifference for the likes of van Dijk. 'I go on holiday so I don't think i will see it,' he said. 'After this season I don't want to watch any football. I've been the whole year watching and playing football and I have to be mentally rested for next season. I don't think I will watch it.' From the comfort of a Dubai lounger, he may give a little more time to his own future. Nominated for a second successive season by PFA Scotland, there are times when the Scottish game looks a little too easy for the 23-year-old defender. For the sake of his own development, there is the expectation he will leave Celtic this summer. Ronny Deila was angry at the referee's decision to now send off Meekings and award his side a penalty . Parrying questions on the matter, he insisted: 'My thoughts are that I want to win the league as soon as possible. 'We'll see what happens in the summer but for now I'm a Celtic player and we'll see if that is or isn't the case after the summer. 'It's an amazing club and you don't want to leave a club like this for one that is not as big. 'You need to know what you want – you don't need to lie. You have to be straight. I will be straight with everyone. 'I'm focusing on the present. You never know what will happen but for now I'm enjoying being a Celtic player.' His dilemma is clear. Celtic are a large club in a small league. Asked if a smaller club in a large league like England would be worth leaving for, he said: 'It depends on the club. If Celtic was playing in the Premier league then they would be one of the best clubs in the world and to stay here would be much more interesting than anything else. 'It is what it is right now. I just want to win the league as soon as possible and hopefully get a nice game maybe before we have to go to Aberdeen. Or maybe Aberdeen away will be a nice place to win the championship…'","Celtic crashed lost to 3-2 to Inverness in the Scottish Cup semi-final .

"Chris Ramsey has pledged his long-term future to QPR – insisting he will remain at the club for as long as they want him. Ramsey was handed the manager’s job until the end of the season after stepping up from his youth development coaching role when Harry Redknapp resigned in February. Rangers’ Premier League status is hanging by the thread following Sunday’s last-gasp defeat by Chelsea at Loftus Road, but Ramsey insists he is more than happy to remain in W12 regardless of what division they are in next season, although he hopes to be made permanent boss. Chris Ramsey insists he's happy at Queens Park Rangers and will stay at the club for as long as they want him . In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail the 52-year-old said: ‘I’m a QPR person now, whatever happens there’s a long-term project at the club which Les (Ferdinand) has put into place anyway. ‘We’re going to try and build the academy in order to emulate one or two of the clubs who we can see have excelled in the Premier League with the right foundations in place. ‘As long as the club want me I will remain here – it’s as simple as that. I want to stay at QPR, I’m really happy. The 52-year-old is a popular and respected man within the game, with aspirations of getting the full-time job . ‘To be honest with you QPR have been quite loyal to me as when I first joined I got offered a few first-team jobs elsewhere and I didn’t take them, but they allowed me to talk to these clubs and they could have easily told me to do one then but they didn’t, so I feel like I owe them. ‘So now I’m going to stand by them and show them some loyalty.’ Speculation has been rife that Ramsey will link up with his former Tottenham colleague Tim Sherwood at Aston Villa this summer if he wasn’t handed the job on a permanent basis, but he says his mind is focused solely on QPR currently. Reports suggest that Ramsey could link up with friend Tim Sherwood (left) at Aston Villa in the summer . ‘At the moment all I am thinking about is staying at QPR,’ admitted Ramsey. ‘Regardless of whether we stay up or not I think I’ve got a fighting chance of getting the job (on a permanent basis). ‘Obviously I think Les wants me to be the manager because he knows I can do the job, and I think Tony (Fernandes) would want me to be in charge, too.' QPR owner Tony Fernandes is the man who will make the final decision as to who becomes the next manager . Speaking at the ‘Sport On Board’ graduation event at Wembley on Wednesday night, a group designed to help improve diversity across the boardrooms in football, the former Tottenham coach spoke glowingly about Ferdinand – who was appointed as the club’s director of football in the wake of Redknapp’s departure. The pair both graduated from the course last year, with Ramsey highlighting how pivotal a role it has played in Ferdinand’s career especially. He added: ‘For Les especially this course has been fantastic. He’s always said this is the job he’s wanted and already I can see what a great job he is doing. Director of football Les Ferdinand (left) would like his friend Ramsey to get the job on a permanent basis . ‘There is no doubt in my mind he will go on to become one of the best in that field, and he will turn this club round one way or another.’ Ramsey himself has aspirations of becoming a top manager one day, with the No 1 hotseat the thing he has his heart set on right now. ‘I’m at that stage in my life now where if a managerial position came up I’d have to take it – and hopefully that will be at QPR. ‘These jobs are limited in the game and you may never have an opportunity to be a No 1 again. Star man Charlie Austin could be off in the summer - regardless of whether QPR stay in the Premier League . ‘You know what in the end I might not be a good enough No 1, but I think I will be. ‘So then you go and give your utmost and without banging the drum too much be confident in your own ability, which I am. ‘The main thing for anybody, unless you're very famous, is to stay in the industry, though. I’m blessed to have remained involved in the game for as long as I have been.'","Chris Ramsey says he's 'really happy' at QPR and plans to stay long-term .

"Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg found themselves in unusual positions towards the rear of the timesheet at the end of the first practice session for the Bahrain Grand Prix while Kimi Raikkonen posted the fastest time. But there was no alarm as Mercedes focused on a particular plan, with the 90-minute session at the Bahrain International Circuit hardly representative of what all the drivers will face in qualifying and the race. At the start of FP1, and with the track exceptionally dusty - a situation which will naturally improve over the weekend with use - the circuit and air temperatures were a searing 52 and 36 degrees centigrade respectively. Ferrari racing driver Kimi Raikkonen finished first in Friday's practice session for the Bahrain Grand Prix . Raikkonen is all smiles during the practice session at the Bahrain International Circuit . With qualifying and the race due to start late evening at 6pm local time, such temperatures will drop considerably. It meant Mercedes focused on laps rather than outright pace, with Rosberg chalking up 23 and Hamilton 22 - but with their times far behind the lead car, Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. The Finn set the pace with a lap of one minute 37.827secs, two tenths of a second up on team-mate Sebastian Vettel, the German who trails reigning champion Hamilton by 13 points after the first three races of the campaign. Vettel only managed 12 laps, primarily due to a loss of power with his car relatively early in the session, but with enough time in hand to ensure he returned to the circuit. Williams' Valtteri Bottas followed the Ferrari pair, a little more than half a second off the pace. The Finn was followed by Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz Jr and Max Verstappen in fourth and sixth, with Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo splitting the young pair. Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton finished 16th during Friday's Bahrain practice session . Hamilton looked in high spirits as he made his way into the Mercedes garage for the practice session . McLaren's Fernando Alonso was an encouraging seventh, finishing 0.771secs down, but for the team there were further woes as Jenson Button saw his session come to an end after just three minutes. Both McLarens saw the chequered flag in China on Sunday, with the team hailing that a breakthrough after their issues with new power-unit supplier Honda so far this season. But at the start of his first timed lap on the approach to turn one, Button spun as the engine cut out mid-corner. The 35-year-old had no choice but to abandon and take the short walk back to the garage whilst marshals rolled his car down a side road exit. Although the car returned to the pits, Button's mechanics were unable to correct the fault and get the veteran back out on track. Jenson Button stalled his car during the practice session in what was another disappointing day for McLaren . Two more rookies, Sauber's Felipe Nasr and Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat were eighth and ninth on the board, eight tenths of a second back, with Felipe Massa 10th for Williams, just under a second down. Given another outing by Lotus, reserve driver Jolyon Palmer was 14th - ahead of Rosberg in 15th and Hamilton 16th. The Briton again put in another credible performance alongside more experienced team-mate Pastor Maldonado, finishing a little more than four tenths of a second behind the Venezuelan. At the rear, ahead of Button who naturally failed to set a time, were Manor's Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi. The former was five seconds back, but more importantly 1.3secs ahead of his team-mate.","Kimi Raikkonen finished ahead of Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel .

"A trucker has been caught on camera launching an extraordinary foul-mouthed tirade at another motorist after a crash along the M6. In footage shot from a dashboard camera on Sunday, the trucker lets rip after a car towing a caravan moves into his lane and the two vehicles collide. Eventually the car towing the caravan jackknifes, coming to rest across the front of the van, blocking the slip road - believed to be junction 8 with the M5, near Birmingham. This is the moment a van driver unleashes a foul-mouthed tirade at another motorist (pictured) after the man moves into his lane and the two vehicles collide, ending with the car stopped across the lorry's bonnet . As the footage begins it shows the car indicating to turn into the slip road, before moving across, despite there being little or no space between the van and the car in front . The footage was posted on Shropshire-based Facebook user Mark Hazell's account and was viewed around 2million times in less than 48 hours before being removed. As the car driver got out to survey the scene, the trucker ranted: 'F****** w*****. What the f*** are you doing coming over on me? 'What are you doing, you f******* idiot, you come over on me? You had no.....cos you indicate, you had no f****** gap? Where were you? Were you in front of me? You d*******.' With his turn-off rapidly approaching, the car driver makes a dive for the inside lane, moving across the path of the van before the two vehicles collide with one another . The car momentarily disappears from view before a loud crunching noise is heard, and the car spins around to stop up against the van's bonnet (pictured) After the accident, blocked the slip road, the car driver (pictured here wearing the striped top) jumps out to argue, with the van driver sending a torrent of abuse back . The heated swearing tirade continued before the trucker told the driver: 'I've got it all on camera. Good. The f****** idiot, absolute f****** idiot.' The crash happened on a stretch of the M6 hit by speed restrictions and lane closures because of roadworks. Responding to comments left on Facebook, Mr Hazell said he had two more videos of the crash which he would hand over to police.","Crash happened as van driver was moving along M6 slip road at junction 8 .

"Trainer Roger Varian insists he has not lost faith in Belardo after the 2014 Dewhurst Stakes winner beat only one home in Saturday’s Greenham Stakes. But Varian’s determination to keep the son of Lope De Vega away from the fast ground he encountered at Newbury means the colt looks more likely to head to the French 2,000 Guineas rather than the British equivalent at Newmarket on May 2.

"AP McCoy’s last chance of a National winner before he retires has evaporated after Benvolio, his intended mount in this afternoon’s Coral Scottish National at Ayr was withdrawn. McCoy will bring an end to his two-decade domination of jump racing after he rides at Sandown a week today. But he will be a spectator in the big race this afternoon after unsuitable drying conditions at Scottish track prompted Benvolio to be scratched. AP McCoy finished fifth on Shutthefrontdoor in the Grand National, but will not ride in the Scottish National . McCoy’s final quest for National glory began in the Irish version of the race when sixth on Cantlow on Easter Monday. The soon-to-be-crowned 20-time champion was then fifth on favourite Shutthefrontdoor in last Saturday’s Grand National. McCoy, who recorded the 4,348th win when successful on Capard King at Ayr, said: ‘It is disappointing not to be riding in the Scottish National but the ground was going to be too quick for Benvolio and, sadly, I couldn't do the weight on any of the others.’ McCoy has three rides at Ayr today - Sea Lord, Upsilon Bleu and Lettheriverrundry – but then is not expected to ride again until the Sandown next weekend. A crowd of close to 20,000 is expected at Sandown with only a few tickets still unsold. A heavily-influenced AP McCoy day will see the venue festooned in banners bearing his name while his 2010 Grand National winner Don’t Push It and Deanos Beeno, an eight-time winner when ridden by him, will be among the champion racehorses to be paraded. McCoy will be presented with the trophy for his 20 championship before the third race, the AP McCoy Celebration Chase in which he is expected to ride Paul Nicholls-trained Mr Mole. Meanwhile, Richard Hannon says he is confident Cheveley Park Stakes winner Tiggy Wiggy will at least stay the seven furlongs of this afternoon’s Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury. McCoy will retire next week, but had been hoping for a final National success before Benvolio withdrew . But evidence will have to be conclusive if the speedy filly, who won six of her eight races as a two-year-old, is to cement her position for the one mile 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket on May 3. If her stamina is found out, a sprinting career would beckon. Hannon said: ‘She has been settling very well at home and she has been here and won before. Hopefully, she will feel at home. ‘I don’t think seven furlongs will be a problem and if she gets that there is a chance she will get further. This race will take the freshness out of her.’ Hannon puts 2.000 Guineas hopes Estidhkaar and Ivawood, the Middle Park Stakes runner-up, on Classic trial in Newbury’s one mile Greenham Stakes and Ivawood also has stamina questions to answer. Hannon said: ‘Ivawood is by (sire) Zebedee, who never got further than five furlongs and he has loads of speed. Estidhkaar will definitely get a mile and I hope they both will. It will be a finding out day.’ The Greenham also features Roger Varian-trained Belardo, the 2014 Dewhurst Stakes winner.","AP McCoy's mount Benvolio withdrawn from Scottish Grand National .

"A small mistake from Lewis Hamilton allowed Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to gain the upper hand in second practice for the Bahrain Grand Prix. To some extent the duo took it easy in FP1 as the team focused on a particular plan given the session was hardly representative of what all the drivers will face in qualifying and the race. Come the start, and with the track exceptionally dusty given its desert setting and which will naturally improve over the weekend with use, the circuit and air temperatures were a searing 52 and 36 degrees centigrade respectively. Nico Rosberg (pictured) got the better of Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain second practice . Rosberg was slower in sectors one and two of FP2 but a mistake from Hamilton gifted him first place . Hamilton (left) takes a corner in Sakhir, Bahrain ahead of Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel . Come the start of FP2 at 6pm local time,when qualifying and the race commence under the hundreds of lights around the circuit, both temperatures had dropped considerably and that is when Rosberg and Hamilton came to the fore. In FP1 pace was not their concern as the duo finished 15th and 16th, 1.466secs and 1.705secs adrift respectively of Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari. In FP2, and with the natural order restored as they finished first and second at the top of the timesheet, just 0.115secs was the gap at the end of their runs on the soft Pirelli tyre, the quicker of the two compounds this weekend. That was due to a lock-up from Hamilton in the second sector of the Bahrain International Circuit which cost him four tenths of a second, otherwise he would likely have beaten Rosberg by three tenths given he was faster in sectors one and two. It allowed Rosberg to lead the way with a lap of one minute 34.647secs, with Mercedes' nearest rivals again Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel, but half a second back. Vettel had his issues throughout the day, though, initially in FP1 as his car suffered a loss of power at one point, but with enough time in hand to ensure he returned to the circuit. Hamilton suffered a lock-up in the second sector of the Bahrain International Circuit, leaving him in second . Sparks fly from the rear end of Hamilton's Mercedes during a practice session in Bahrain . In FP2, with nine minutes remaining, Force India's Sergio Perez clipped Vettel's car, ripping off the front-wing endplate on the left side. With debris on the track the session was red flagged, and with the stewards also announcing an investigation into the incident for causing a collision. Come the restart, Raikkonen and Hamilton took a wide berth in exiting the pit lane around a couple of cars that were slow away, far from impressing the stewards who are to also look at the duo's unnecessary manoeuvres. Behind the leading quartet came Williams' Valtteri Bottas followed by Daniel Ricciardo in his Red Bull and Lotus of Pastor Maldonado, all within a second of Rosberg. Sauber's Felipe Nasr, Daniil Kvyat in his Red Bull and the Williams of Felipe Massa completed the top 10, with the latter 1.237secs off the pace. Sebastian Vettel had issues throughout the day, eventually finishing the second practice in fourth place . Vettel finished fourth, behind Rosberg, Hamilton and third-placed Kimi Raikkonen in Bahrain . McLaren's Fernando Alonso was 1.5secs back in 12th, whilst for team-mate Jenson Button it was a day to forget.

In FP2 the veteran was on his third lap when his car ground to a halt, although on this occasion his mechanics were able to send him back out. Button eventually completed 15 laps, finishing down in 19th place between Manor duo Will Stevens, who finished 4.484secs back, and team-mate Roberto Merhi.","Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were 15th and 16th in FP1 .

"Aaron Cruden has refused to give up hope of appearing in this year’s World Cup, but the harsh truth is that the All Blacks’ title defence has suffered an early blow with the likely loss of their No 10. The 26-year-old Waikato Chiefs fly-half received grim confirmation on Monday that he has ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and will be out for six months. Aaron Cruden is almost certain to miss the World Cup after scans revealed the need for knee surgery . Cruden hobbles off the field after damaging his knee during the round 10 Super Rugby match . Four years after New Zealand’s quest to claim the Webb Ellis Cup was so nearly derailed by an injury to Dan Carter, his successor has suffered the same fate — albeit much earlier. Cruden has started 15 Tests for the world champions in the last two years, establishing himself as first choice. ‘I haven’t completely ruled out making the World Cup,’ he said. ‘I still don’t know if it’s sunk in.’ New Zealand coach Steve Hansen added: ‘He has developed into a very good All Black and is a key member of our team. He will be a loss for the Chiefs and the All Blacks.’ England lock Joe Launchbury is hopeful of making his comeback in Wasps’ Premiership clash with Leicester on May 9. Launchbury has been sidelined since October because of a nerve problem caused by a bulging disc in his neck. Cruden will see a surgeon on Wednesday to arrange a knee reconstruction in the coming weeks . The knee surgery will rule him out of action for at least six weeks, meaning he will miss the World Cup . Leicester have announced the signing of Australia back-three player Peter Betham from Super 15 champions the Waratahs. Meanwhile, the final of the inaugural European Champions Cup is set to be played out in front of a sparse crowd at Twickenham on May 2. Ticket sales had crept just past 25,000 before the semi-finals and with two French clubs — Clermont Auvergne and Toulon — contesting the showpiece, a crowd of under 40,000 is expected at the 82,000-capacity stadium. That would be the smallest attendance for a final of the continent’s elite event since 2003, when Toulouse and Perpignan attracted just 28,600 in Dublin. Toulon are set to be without English full back Delon Armitage, who reportedly suffered a broken hand in Sunday’s win over Leinster.","Scans have revealed All Blacks flyhalf Aaron Cruden needs knee surgery .

"Frankie Dettori made it six winners in four days as well as three flying dismounts with a treble at Newbury on Saturday centred around a neck success on Charlie Hills-trained Greenham Stakes winner Muhaarar. Spring has sprung this week and Dettori has been bouncing higher than Tigger. In this sort of form, those who suggested his best days were well behind him will have to eat their words. Frankie Dettori leaps from his mount  after riding Muhaarar to win The AON Greenham Stakes at Newbury . Dettori rides Mr Singh to win The Al Basti Equiworld Maiden Stakes at Newbury racecourse . Thursday’s announcement that Dettori’s boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani had signed up Gregory Benoist to ride the French-based horses in his expanding string, means the 44-year-old Italian can concentrate on Britain. That means less tiring criss-crossing of the Channel for Dettori as well as having another positive spin-off – being available for rides going spare with old boss John Gosden after winter staffing rehuffles. So far, Dettori has been mopping them up. Three of the jockey’s winners – Derby prospect Golden Horn, who won the Feilden Stakes at Newmarket, Oaks candidate Star of Seville, who scored at Newbury on Friday, plus maiden winner Mr Singh on Saturday were all prepared for action by Gosden. Dettori said: ‘The Greenham was good. They went very fast and Muhaarar is a horse that needs to settle. He did and produced. ‘I don’t think I have had thee flying dismounts before so early. I have had a fantastic week. It is brilliant and being back at John’s – I have gone full circle. I am back to where I started.’ Dettori riding Muhaarar to victory in the The AON Greenham Stakes at Newbury on Saturday . Dettori had spoken of his enthusiasm for the season ahead when unveiled as the new ambassador for his home course Newmarket last week. He showed that on tricky Ayaar, 7-1 Luca Cumani-trained winner of Newbury’s Spring Cup. He now has nine winners from 29 rides, not sound seismic but it is significant compared to the last two seasons. The 2014 campaign had only 37 successes and, a truncated 2013 season when he returned from the doldrums of splitting from Godolphin and a six-month cocaine ban had him walking around like yesterday’s man. Dettori riding Ayaar win The Be Wiser Insurance Spring Cup at Newbury racecourse on Saturday . He is no longer champion jockey material but he does look to have significant better chances of good rides in quality races. His 1,000 Guineas ride will be Richard Hannon-trained Nell Gwyn Stakes winner Osaila, who runs for Sheik Joaan, while he must pick from Hannon-trained Craven Stakes third Moheet and John Quinn’s Group One winning two-year-old The Wow Factor in the 2,000. Hannon has insisted both Greenham Stakes second and third Istidhkaar and Ivawood will join his Craven Stakes winner Kool Kompany in the 2,000 Guineas. He also might still run Tiggy Wiggy, runner-up to Ralph Beckett’s Redstart in the Fred Darling Stakes Saturday, in the 1,000 Guineas. But after a disappointing show, some bookmakers have taken her out of the ante-post betting.","Frankie Dettori made it six winners in four days at Newbury on Saturday .

Saracens’ millionaire chairman Nigel Wray spent much of last week repeating his belief the cap should be scrapped in order for Saracens to compete at Europe’s top table, raising expectations they could be set to land a ‘marquee’ player from outside the league whose wages would sit outside next season’s £5.5m cap.

"England had a good day on Tuesday at the start of this second Test in conditions that suited them. If they go on to bat themselves into a strong position, they can look at it in one of two ways. England can be happy they are good enough to take wickets at home and when the ball is swinging and conditions are in their favour - like here. If that’s the case then carry on as you are, but a position of strength is often a good one from which to take a long hard look at yourself and say ‘how can we improve?’ Alastair Cook needs something different to draw on in his same-same pace bowling attack . Cook is frustrated after dropping a catch off Marlon Samuel, who was on 32 and finished the day 94 not out . Cook and coach Peter Moores are under pressure to produce a result after drawing the first Test . The biggest reason England have not won away from home since 2012 is that they are lacking something different in their attack. The whole of England’s bowling psyche is about containment, it’s about bowling maidens and building pressure, as we saw for much of the first day here in Grenada until West Indies started to crack. That’s fine and it has been very successful for them but with so much batting depth now, with Jos Buttler arguably the best Test No 8 England have ever had, they can afford to pick someone who gives them an extra ingredient. There are those who feel it could have been provided here by Adil Rashid but by all accounts he hasn’t been bowling well enough to warrant selection. England have a good spinner in Moeen Ali - even though he looked rusty on day one - and a more than capable back-up in Joe Root. So perhaps that trump card could come in place of one of the four seamers who all have similar attributes. Leg-spinner Adil Rashid could offer what is needed but by all accounts he hasn’t been bowling well enough . Cook speaks with paceman Mark Wood, who could be what is needed with comparisons to Simon Jones . The one I would keep an eye on is Mark Wood. From what I’ve seen of him there is a bit of Simon Jones about him and the Welshman was a key element of England’s best attack of the last 20 years - the 2005 Ashes line-up. Jones learnt a lot of the skills that made him the 2005 trump card on the Caribbean tour a year earlier, for instance the ability to gain skiddy reverse swing on flat pitches, and Wood might have done that now. I don’t like building players up before they have played Test cricket and then quickly passing judgment on them when they are given their chance but Wood seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches. He is the sort of bowler who almost takes the pitch out of the equation - like Jones and like Darren Gough and perhaps Craig White from my day. Moeen Ali is a good spinner for England, even though he looked rusty after being recalled for Grenada . Wood seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches on which England struggle . In England we don’t produce enough of that sort of bowler and when we do get one we can hold them back a bit because they can be considered a luxury, or too much of a gamble. Look at the championship game which has just finished at Chelmsford between Essex and Kent. Wickets fell cheaply to medium-paced seam bowlers like David Masters, Jesse Ryder and Darren Stevens. Players like that will never have the attributes to take wickets overseas for England. A bowler like Tymal Mills, a left-armer with real pace who moved on from Essex to Sussex last winter, might. But will he be trusted to form part of a county attack in English conditions? Ben Stokes was the pick of the bowlers for me on day one because of the fuller length that he bowled. I was a bit surprised at how ‘back of a length’ he was in Antigua because I’ve seen him play in county cricket, bowl full and reverse it. He was definitely searching for that fuller length. Ben Stokes, the pick of England's bowlers on day one, athletically fields a shot from  his own bowling . Umpire Steve Davis reprimands England's Ben Stokes after he exchanged words with Marlon Samuels . Yes, at times England bowled a bit short. It might have been a case of coming from Antigua, where it was certainly not a ‘hit the top of off stump’ pitch, to here four days later where they found conditions conducive to bowling. I would have done exactly the same as Alastair Cook and bowled first and even though England were not quite at their best wickets started to tumble. Yet you have to remember that conditions and pitches change during the course of a Test — Antigua swung for three days and then didn’t for the last two — and sides have to aspire to a balanced attack. This England attack might be good enough for Grenada on a day like Tuesday but they must seek that little bit more.","West Indies were 188 for five at the close of play on day one in Grenada .

"Steven Finn believes he has rediscovered the form that made him one of the most exciting fast-bowling prospects in England. Finn was overlooked for the West Indies tour, but has spent time since the World Cup working on his run-up – and watching videos of his best spells as a reminder of why he became the youngest English bowler to take 50 Test wickets. ‘I’ve had my trials and tribulations over the last 12 months,’ he said. ‘But I feel everything at the crease is as I want it to be. Steven Finn believes he's regained his previous best form and is ready to push for an England place . Finn admits he's 'had my trials and tribulations over the last 12 months' but he's got his 'head straight' Finn smiles as he helps launch ECB's Club Open Days on Tuesday at Brondesbury Cricket Club . ‘My running style is something I’ve had my issues with – kneeing the stumps and shortening my run-up, which is what c**ked me up, really. It’s about trying to get it back to being natural. ‘We’ve got footage that I use when I’ve been bowling at my best. When I was running up as a carefree 21-year-old, I just legged it into the crease. 'It was natural, and I bowled quickly, consistently. My bowling’s looking pretty similar to that at the moment.’ Finn’s claims will be music to the selectors’ ears as they begin to fret about England’s fast-bowling stocks. Finn says he's been watching footage of when he was on the top of his form and is returning to that style . Finn’s form return comes at a good time as England's fast bowling stocks are starting to worry selectors . The 26-year-old Finn has played only one Championship game for Middlesex this season, but insisted he felt ready to add to his 23 Test caps, the last of which he won back in 2013. ‘I don’t feel I’d have done myself a disservice had I been on the West Indies trip,’ he said. ‘In the World Cup, if you take out the wickets against Australia, I was taking proper wickets – lbw, bowled, caught behind. ‘Coming back to Middlesex and getting my head straight hasn’t been the worst thing.

"Even when the cricket is torpid and the scoring rate is barely more than two an over, life with England will never be dull while Ben Stokes is around. Stokes was at the centre of everything on a hard-fought first day of the second Test as England strove to set up the victory that is essential to their wellbeing. First the Durham all-rounder injured himself, then he struck immediately when he came on to bowl and finally became embroiled in a heated dispute with Marlon Samuels that led to him being admonished by umpire Steve Davis. All in a day’s work for a gifted cricketer who looks destined to endure as many lows as he does highs in what is shaping up to be an eventful career. Stokes athletically fields a shot from Samuels off his own bowling at the Grenada National Stadium in Saint George's . Australian umpire Steve Davis reprimands England's Ben Stokes after he exchanged words with Marlon Samuels . Stokes went wicketless in 32 overs in the first Test, even throwing away a dismissal for the second time by overstepping, and ended up in a strident Twitter debate with his critics. Here he slipped on the greasy outfield and twisted his body in a manner that had anyone who saw Simon Jones suffer serious injury in Brisbane in 2002 holding their breath. Thankfully Stokes was able to continue after treatment but was still feeling the injury when he came on to bowl, with England battling for the wickets they desperately needed to justify Alastair Cook’s decision to insert West Indies. It clearly did not hinder him. Stokes struck with his second ball, forcing Shiv Chanderpaul to steer loosely to point and open the door for England to take command of this Test and the series.

Smith declines his option to review the decision which would have likely been reversed with HotSpot not available in this Test series . Smith is given out as England players celebrate their second wicket of a rain-shortened first session . It was just what Cook needed from a gifted but raw all-rounder who seemingly will always flirt with the self-destruct button but who has the ability to become a key figure in England’s future. When he scored an Ashes century in the most difficult of circumstances in Perth he was a rare ray of light in a lamentable series and looked destined to bat at No 6 for England and act as an attacking fourth seamer for the next 10 years. Yet just a few months later he was putting himself out of the World Twenty20 by punching a locker in frustration in Barbados at the start of a nightmare run of form with both bat and ball for England. It did not get any better when Stokes regained fitness and he was so out of touch that England, having moved him up and down the batting order, left him out of their doomed World Cup campaign. Now he is back he should become a fixture but already, with Moeen Ali returning after injury, he has lost his No 6 position again despite impressing in Antigua by taking the attack to West Indies. There were times on Tuesday night when Bayern Munich seemed to be scoring at a faster rate than West Indies. This was a day for the purist, a stultifying example of modern-day Caribbean cricket where there is far more life in the stands than in the pitches. Bayern may have hit six in the Champions League but there was never any danger of a six being hit in the 70 overs that were possible here. The atmosphere was made for swing bowling but the 22 yards of dirt masquerading as a cricket pitch did not assist the England attack one bit. It was Jimmy Anderson, fresh from breaking Sir Ian Botham’s record to become England’s leading wicket-taker in Test cricket, who began the day by producing an unplayable inswinger to demolish Kraigg Brathwaite. At that stage English hopes were high that Anderson would run through West Indies. Sadly for them it was not that simple. England were helped by a couple of Caribbean rushes of blood, but Devon Smith for one can justifiably feel very hard done by. The first Grenadian to play Test cricket on his home island was given out by Australian umpire Davis for what seemed a regulation edge after Smith had played a wild shot at Chris Jordan. Trouble was, replays showed Smith was nowhere near it and the sound that both Davis and presumably he heard was his bat hitting the ground. A review would have surely led to Smith’s reinstatement even though there is no HotSpot or Snicko here to attempt to provide conclusive proof of an umpiring mistake. But Smith did not call on technology. Neither Darren Bravo nor Chanderpaul will be happy with the strokes that cost them their wickets and at 74 for four West Indies were teetering. Yet Samuels, despite being dropped by Cook off Jordan on 32, and Jermaine Blackwood made life hard again with the help of that annoying 22 yards of turf.

Umpire Davis had another uncomfortable moment when he ruled Blackwood not out when Jordan, who would have been the man to miss out had England plumped for a second spinner here in Adil Rashid, appealed loudly for lbw. England decided to review and the ball was found to be hitting. But Cook’s miss of Samuels began to look costly when he opened his shoulders in partnership with Denesh Ramdin after taking 141 balls to reach 50. The calm was broken when Samuels, who has a far better record against England than any other team and names Nasser Hussain as his ultimate batting hero, wound up Stokes, who had been sledging him constantly. It ended with Stokes throwing wildly in an attempt to run out Samuels and conceding overthrows. The spiky Jamaican ended unbeaten on 94 with West Indies reaching 188 for five on a truncated day.

"England removed both West Indies openers after choosing to bowl first in a rain-shortened opening session of the second Test in Grenada but the under-pressure visitors has a major stroke of fortune. After James Anderson castled Kraigg Brathwaite with a venomous in-swinger in the third over, Chris Jordan had Devon Smith caught behind. Smith should still be there, however, after replays clearly showed the ball had missed his outside edge as he thrust forward outside off stump. Replays show Devon Smith clearly misses the ball before being dismissed caught behind off Chris Jordan . Smith declines his choice to review the decision with HotSpot not available in this Test series . With HotSpot technology not available in this Test as part of the decision review system, Smith declined to try his luck upstairs and walked off. That left the hosts 36 for two at lunch, with 15 overs gone. Play was delayed by an hour and 45 minutes after persistent morning showers, with 11 overs lost in the day. Despite having sent down 130 overs in the fourth innings of the drawn first Test, captain Alastair Cook pressed his bowlers back into action, persuaded by humid conditions and a touch of dampness in the pitch.

He is the first Grenadian to play Test cricket on the island but fell in ignominious fashion, following a wide ball that should have been left with the interval imminent. The confusion over whether or not he had edged it - and why he did not send the decision upstairs - merely added intrigue to a careless exit. The last over before lunch went to Moeen Ali, fit again and recalled in place of James Tredwell.","West Indies opener Kraigg Brathwaite missed the ball but didn't review it .

"Graeme Dott fears exhaustion will kill off his hopes of winning snooker’s Betfred World Championship. The 37-year-old, a qualifier this year, survived a series of twitches close to the winning line before clinching a 10-8 first-round victory over Ricky Walden at the Crucible in Sheffield on Sunday. He bungled a yellow but was reprieved when Walden blazed the green off the table. And although Walden looked for snookers, his tournament was over once Dott dropped in the blue.

"Steve Bruce was at least able to crack a joke after his side were left dangling precariously in the Barclays Premier League following defeat to Southampton. Although that was not the only thing cracked in this game. Graziano Pelle was given a yellow card by referee Kevin Friend in the first half for a clash with Alex Bruce but the Hull City manager could not believe the Southampton striker remained on the field. ‘Alex has got a horribly broken nose,’ Bruce revealed. ‘The boy Pelle gets a yellow card but we’re incensed. We need a break like that - not a broken nose, but a break. A decision like that which goes out way. Graziano Pelle unleashes a strike in a crowded penalty area as Southampton doubled their lead against Hull City at St Mary's . Hull City goalkeeper Steve Harper can do nothing to stop Pelle's strike despite his best efforts as Southampton made sure of the victory . The Italian striker celebrates with his team-mates after scoring his first Premier League goal since December . ‘I had a conversation with the referee who said he’s seen a hand in the air. If he’s seen a forearm smash in Alex’s face you do wonder. Pelle’s got away with it, from what I’ve seen from the DVD he meant it.’ To compound Bruce’s misery, Pelle went on to seal the victory in the 81st minute, finishing off a good passing move to score his first league goal since December 20, ending a drought of 1,245 minutes. ‘It will help him a lot,’ Southampton manager Ronald Koeman said. ‘December was a long time ago. If you’re a striker you need to score.’ Southampton (4-2-3-1): K Davis 6.5; Alderweireld 6, Jose Fonte 6, Yoshida 6, Bertrand 6.5; Wanyama 5.5 (Ward-Prowse 46 7), Schneiderlin 6.5; Long 7 (Elia 74 6), S Davis 6, Mané 6 (Tadic 61 6); Pelle 7.5 .

Harper dives in vain as Ward-Prowse sends his spot kick to the former Newcastle man's left with unerring precision . The England Under 21 midfielder pumps his fists in celebration after finding the net at St Mary's on Saturday . James Ward-Prowse had put the home side in front, coming on at half-time to convert a penalty 10 minutes later. Shane Long, Whippet-like with his tireless running down either flank, had won the spot kick by racing down the right before being chopped down by Bruce - perhaps somewhat dazed and confused from his blow to the face - inside the box and Ward-Prowse calmly placed it beyond Steve Harper’s reach into the right of goal for his first of the campaign. There was almost an incident when Sadio Mane initially picked the ball up to take the kick. ‘I had to shout to our captain Jose Fonte to stop Mane,’ Koeman admitted. ‘It was a difficult situation. James Ward-Prowse and Dusan Tadic are our first and second choice to take penalties. It’s a problem with Mane, but the rules in the team are more important.’ The home side had been fortunate to still be level, two minutes before they scored. Sone Aluko held the ball up on the edge of the box and laid off to Jake Livermore whose powerful shot almost caught out Southampton goalkeeper Kelvin Davis only for him to keep it out one-handed. On the hour mark, only one behind, Hull’s James Chester had Davis beaten with a glancing header from a corner only for Ryan Bertrand to clear off the line. Before kick off, the omens were not good for the visitors who had not won away to Southampton since February 1951 and the 64-year wait to amend that will go on. Two home wins against relegation rivals Aston Villa and Queens Park Rangers in mid-February left them full of hope and optimism of surviving the season. But since then they have not won in six and this was the fourth defeat of that barren spell. Ward-Prowse is congratulated by team-mates Steven Davis and Sadio Mane after his goal gave Ronald Koeman's side the lead .

They have a fortnight break - not involved in FA Cup action next weekend - then six games to save their season, including daunting home matches against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United. Conversely, with Tottenham losing to Aston Villa and Liverpool set to play against Newcastle on Monday, Southampton jumped to fifth. ‘It will be a fight between Liverpool, Tottenham and Southampton,’ Koeman said.

"Tony Pulis returned to Selhurst Park for the first time since he left Crystal Palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his West Bromwich Albion side to the edge of safety. Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace’s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving. A few boos broke the surface, but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season, during his 10-month tenure, when he won the Premier League LMA Manager of the Year award. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side with a fine long ranged effort .

Craig Gardner scored a fine long range effort at Selhurst Park (above). CLICK HERE to see more from Sportsmail's MATCH ZONE . ‘You never know what to expect,’ Pulis said in regard to returning to a former club. ‘They did well for me last year and I hope I repaid them a little bit in respect to what we did in the dressing room and on the pitch. ‘It is a good club. It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. The supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager. They can push on – if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club.’ Yannick Bolasie even made the effort to go over and shake Pulis’ hand as he strolled down the touchline. Yet the south London locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when West Brom took the lead. Chris Bunt swung in a corner from the left and James Morrison managed to lose Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon and nod in, completely free, from five yards out. Some of Puncheon’s team-mates looked around in disbelief that the West Brom man was afforded so much space in the box. ‘That was a weakness in our set up that Tony exploited,’ Pardew admitted. ‘It was well worked. Their guy took Puncheon to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking. ‘We knew Tony would know the players well, know the strengths and weaknesses, I tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch. They didn’t come off. Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie greets former Eagles boss Tony Pulis (right) before kick-off at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon .

People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.’ Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulis’ resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal. It is almost mission accomplished for Pulis at West Brom as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three.

"Sunderland are trailing former Wigan striker Franco di Santo. The Argentine is playing for Werder Bremen and has scored 13 goals in 22 games this season. The Bundesliga side want £8million for the 26-year-old who Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton knows well from his time at Chelsea. Sunderland are considering a summer move for in-form Werder Bremen forward Franco Di Santo . The Argentine has been in superb form for his club this season, netting 13 goals in 22 games . Di Santo began his senior career with Chilean side Audax Italiano in 2006, before catching the Blues' eye two years later. However, he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and following a similarly ineffectual loan spell at Blackburn Rovers, was sold to Wigan in 2010. He spent three seasons with the Lancashire-based outfit, scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances. Di Santo was an unused substitute during the club's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2013, before being released at the end of that season. He made the move to the Bundesliga in August 2013 and has appeared to fulfil some of his early promise. Di Santo previously played for Chelsea but struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and was sold .

"Mark Hughes thinks Tom Jones is stopping Stoke City from qualifying for Europe. But on the green, green grass of home, his side were the ones denting hopes of facing the Continent’s elite teams with this 2-1 victory over Ronald Koeman’s Southampton. The Stoke manager believes Jones’s hit Delilah, belted out regularly by the Britannia Stadium hordes, is causing his side to be marked down in UEFA’s Fair Play League because of its violent theme and thus affecting their chances of qualifying for the Europa League.

However, after Morgan Schneiderlin prodded Southampton into a deserved lead, a second-half turnaround with goals from Mame Diouf and Charlie Adam damaged the visitors hopes of finishing in the top four — and had the Stoke fans belting out their favourite 60s hit. Hughes said: ‘We are not going to get too many Fair Play points today. ‘The key was that we got three Premier League points, though.’ The result had Koeman acknowledging that the Saints’ unlikely march to the top four was over. ‘Sometimes I have to answer questions about Champions League football,’ he said. ‘I don’t like that because the distance to fourth place is five points and now maybe it is eight. We are fighting for a Europa League place — that’s our Champions League. You have to see it like that.’ Mame Biram Diouf is joined by teammate Jon Walters as the Stoke City duo celebrate their equaliser at the Britannia Stadium . Steven Nzonzi is quick to congratulate Diouf on his goal against Champions League chasing Southampton at the Britannia Stadium . French international Morgan Schneiderlin gives Ronald Koeman's Champions League chasing Southampton the lead at the Britannia Stadium . Hughes is entitled to be happy, with his side in ninth spot with five matches to play. Survival in the Premier League, always the priority in these parts, was secured as early as March, leaving the manager, with the ink drying on a four-year contract, to set new targets. He wants Stoke to better last year’s points tally of 50 and secure consecutive top-half finishes in the top flight for the first time in 40 years, and this result leaves such feats on the cards. Victory was unlikely in a one-sided first half. Southampton, who had wasted chances, eventually took one when Jose Fonte rose at the near post to divert Steven Davis’s corner goalwards but was denied by a goal-hanging Schneiderlin, who got the final touch before it crossed the line. Graziano Pelle should have doubled the lead when played in by a lively Sadio Mane but Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic saved well to leave Koeman ruing his side’s profligacy. ‘I think we played very well in the first 45 minutes and were by far better team,’ he said. ‘Maybe we could have been more clinical in the box but in general we played well today, we played at least at our level and it’s important to keep that for rest of the season.’ For all Southampton’s dominance Stoke should have been level when Geoff Cameron flicked on a Marko Arnautovic free-kick only for an unmarked Steven Nzonzi to inexplicably miss from no more than two yards out. Jose Fonte celebrates with team-mate Schneiderlin as Southampton grabbed the lead against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium . Schneiderlin  celebrates the first goal with his team-mates during the Barclays Premier League match between Stoke City and Southampton . They did go level following the arrival of Adam from the bench, albeit in exceptionally fortunate circumstances. When Nzonzi mis-hit a cross into the sky there were groans. When it landed on the bar and Diouf slammed home the rebound they turned into disbelieving cheers. The first Delilah of the day duly followed, with Adam urged to shoot wherever he picked up the ball. With six minutes remaining he did just that, lashing home following a goalmouth scramble to bring that song out again. ‘I think he played the initial ball into the box, followed his ball in and thankfully it has dropped to him,’ said an admiring Hughes. ‘It’s great technique. He knows exactly what he is doing. He has hit it into the ground and that has made it even harder for the keeper to save it.’ Adam’s fellow substitute Peter Crouch could have piled on the agony for Koeman after being teed up by Jonathan Walters but scuffed his shot wide from six yards. More misery for the Saints arrived in injury time when Toby Alderweireld went down clutching a shoulder and was carried off on a stretcher, although he is expected to be fit for the remainder of the run-in.

'Then it’s up to Jack to decide where he wants to go. I had the same situation with Nabil Bentaleb [at Tottenham], who could have played for France but decided to pick Algeria. I did have a chat with him and he asked me what to do. I just said: ""you’ve got to go with your heart. Do you think you’re French or Algerian?"" 'That’s the decision he had to make and now Jack has got to make that decision. He has to play a few more times for Aston Villa before he needs to make that decision.

"Former Rangers manager Walter Smith has praised Stuart McCall for making an impact at Ibrox - but he maintains Ally McCoist was given little chance of succeeding. McCall has put Rangers in the driving seat for second place in the Scottish Championship and a place in the semi-finals of the play-offs after taking over from reluctant caretaker Kenny McDowall. McCoist was put on gardening leave just before Christmas after handing in his notice following three-and-a-half difficult seasons in charge under the chaotic reigns of the likes of Craig Whyte and then Charles Green and his allies. But his failure to win a cup competition and his team's style of play drew serious criticism. Walter Smith (right) spent two spells in charge as manager of Rangers and has hailed Stuart McCall's impact . Smith (right) attended a John Hartson Foundation golf day to raise money for testicular cancer awareness . Smith was chairman for some of that period after accepting Green's offer to join the board - a decision he soon regretted - and insists the club was too badly run to ensure true success on the park. Smith, who was attending a John Hartson Foundation golf day to help raise money for testicular cancer awareness, said: 'The guys worked with me for four-and-a-half years there and did a great job for the club, and I was hoping they would get a good opportunity. 'I got great support from Sir David Murray but it's not turned out that they have had the same support from the people who have been running the club. So it has been very difficult for them to show what they can do. 'That's the crux of the matter, it's the circumstances they have been in that have caused them as much trouble as anything else. 'I'd be very surprised if anybody could show me a club that isn't well run, that are doing really well. 'The problems have been well documented and now they have got to concentrate on doing what they do, and that's Rangers getting back to the Premiership first and foremost and then trying to settle into a position where they can get back to being a winning team.' McCall played under Smith for seven seasons, winning six titles in the process, and the 67-year-old was pleased to see the former Motherwell boss take over, despite his pain at the exits of former assistants McCoist and McDowall. McCall was appointed Rangers manager in March until the summer as a replacement for Kenny McDowall . 'I'm not happy to see it because it cost friends of mine their job,' he said. 'But that happens in football and when other people take over I am obviously pleased to see Stuart take over and I hope he does really well. 'He has been brave enough to take the job until the end of the season. If he gets promotion, he will put himself in a very good position to get the job on a more permanent basis. 'He has gone in there and got a reaction. That happens in football. It has happened to me and a whole load of other managers, when you leave and someone else comes in, they get a reaction. Rangers have won five out of nine Scottish Championship matches since McCall's arrival at Ibrox . 'Performances have been brighter and hopefully he will keep that going until the end of the season.' However, Smith has warned that Rangers fans might have to be patient in their desire to see the club competing at the very top of Scottish football, despite power now lying in the hands of the likes of Paul Murray and Dave King following last month's general meeting. 'I'm obviously happy to see everything at the club settling down,' the former Scotland boss said. 'The lack of headlines would indicate that's the case. 'The people that are running the club are just getting their feet under the table and finding out what they have to do to move the club forward. I think that's to be expected at this stage. Smith did, however, open up about Ally McCoist's departure and admitted it wasn't easy to see . 'It will obviously take a bit of time but they will be able to handle that aspect of it. Everyone who is there now is there for the football club and that's a big, big thing. 'To be fair, when I was involved on the Rangers board, it would have been different from any other boardroom never mind anything else. 'I have been fortunate enough to be at Rangers for a long time and be there at successful times and it's not a period I can look back on with any great pleasure.'","Walter Smith spent two spells in charge at Ibrox as manager of Rangers .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers had his conviction for neglecting a rental property quashed, it has emerged. The Anfield boss was fined at Blackburn Magistrates' Court for leaving a £69,950 terrace house in Accrington, Lancashire, with broken windows and doors and rubbish strewn across the garden. The court confirmed the conviction when approached yesterday. However, Hyndburn Borough Council, which took the action, said in a subsequent statement that both Rodgers and co-owner Judith O'Hagan had their case overturned at a later hearing. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was convicted of leaving a property in Accrington to rot, but subsequently had his conviction overturned because he did not receive a summons . Rodgers was originally  told to fix the windows, doors and roof, and to remove the rubbish from the garden . Mark Hoyle, Head of Regeneration and Housing, said: 'Brendan Rodgers and Judith O’Hagan were convicted in their absence of failing to comply with a notice served on them by the council pursuant to s79 Building Act, contrary to S 99 of that Act. 'However the case against them both was overturned under section 14 Magistrates Courts Act 1980 at Blackburn Magistrates Court on the 28th April 2014 in the case of Brendan Rogers, and on the 9th July 2014 in the case of Miss O’Hagan, as neither Mr Rodgers or Miss O’Hagan had received the court summons.' The pair had been ordered to fix the windows, doors and roof, and to remove the rubbish, but the house was left to rot. Both Rodgers and O'Hagan, who bought the property in August 2007, were absent when found guilty at Blackburn Magistrates' Court. They were ordered to both pay a £400 fine and £375 costs, with a £40 surcharge. The house is located in an area of Accrington which is undergoing a £13million regeneration project to sort out over 200 derelict empty properties. An improvement notice, as served to Rodgers and O'Hagan, requires a landlord to carry out work to deal with a hazard associated with a property. If the landlord does not do the work, or 'reasonable progress' is not made, the local authority can carry out work itself and claim the costs back from the landlord. They were convicted in December 2013 of failing to comply with an enforcement notice under Section 79 of the Building Act 1984. Rodgers is also believed to own properties in London, near his former club Reading, and in Northern Ireland. Rodgers  has a contract with Liverpool until 2018.

"Andres Iniesta concedes that he has been unhappy with his form for Barcelona this season, despite receiving praise for his role in killing off Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League this week. The Spaniard played a pivotal part in setting up Neymar for the opening goal in the Catalan club's 2-0 second-leg win over PSG on Tuesday night at the Camp Nou, running from his own half before laying the ball on a plate for the Brazilian forward. Iniesta was typically modest about his fourth assist in Europe this season, preferring to focus on what has been a disappointing domestic campaign for the World Cup winner, in which he is yet to score or create a goal. Andres Iniesta is kept under close watch by the Paris Saint-Germain defenders during Tuesday night's game . Iniesta perfectly times his pass through to Neymar for the first goal against PSG at the Camp Nou . Barcelona's No 8 goes to celebrate with Neymar after killing off the French side in the opening half . 'I'm happy with the way it worked out,' Iniesta told AS in reference to his latest assist. 'The truth is that it was a nice, fast and improvised run, but it's good that it resulted in a goal for Neymar. 'Personally, though, I think I have room for improvement. I'm unsatisfied with my form right now.' Despite Iniesta's qualms with his own personal contribution, the 30-year-old is content with how the rest of Luis Enrique's side are currently performing, with Barcelona top of La Liga by two points and adding a Champions League semi-final berth to the Copa del Rey final date with Athletic Bilbao on May 30. 'We're feeling very good going into the decisive stretch of the season,' the World Cup winner stated. 'We could have 10 games left and we will play them all with a positive attitude.' Barcelona face city rivals Espanyol at the Estadi Cornella-El Prat on Saturday looking to extend their lead at the top of La Liga, and Iniesta anticipates a difficult task at the home of their neighbours. 'I do not think that the derby is a war,' the 30-year-old added. 'But it will be a special and tough game.

"West Bromwich Albion had just produced a typical Tony Pulis performance to beat his former club Crystal Palace 2-0 when he claimed he will never change. The 57-year-old’s gritty, resilient playing style is well reflected in the touchline attire he insists on wearing at every game; cap, track suit and shiny white trainers. James Morrison headed in within two minutes and Craig Gardner added a stunning 30-yard strike in the second half, but Alan Pardew’s side dominated the remainder of the game only to be met by West Brom’s stubborn doggedness.

West Brom midfielder James Morrison (right) dribbles with the ball away from Palace's Jason Puncheon (left) All viewed by Pulis beneath the peak of that cap. ‘I’d never take my cap off during a game they’d have to put it in my contract,’ he explained. ‘I watched the first game for Albion and sat upstairs in a suit. I came down after 10 minutes because I’d had enough of sitting there. That’s just the way I am. I want to be close to the action.’ West Brom ended their run of 10 away games without a victory, drawing five and losing five. Pulis will turn up to the stadium in suit and tie, then return to that again straight after the match to address the press before he leaves. Pardew was resplendent in full suit and tie on Saturday. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted last week that he started smartening up on the sideline after his chairman Daniel Levy told him to. ‘I’ll leave it for all the sophisticated lads,’ Pulis added. ‘I’ve always done it and I don’t see no reason not to just because we’re in the Premier League with all the TV cameras and everything. I’ve done it right from my days at Bournemouth.’ Why change a ritual that works? The three points moved West Brom to 36 points which virtually guarantees them safety.

"Beaten FA Cup semi-finalists Reading lost again as they were defeated by Birmingham in a scrappy Sky Bet Championship game at the Madejski Stadium on Wednesday night. Although Reading dominated most of the match, they wasted several chances in the closing stages of the first half. Birmingham held firm and grabbed the winner seven minutes from the end, when Clayton Donaldson nodded in his 16th goal of the season. Clayton Donaldson (left) scored a late headed winner for Birmingham City as his side defeated Reading 1-0 . Donaldson, who signed from Brentford in the summer, scored his 16th goal of the season . READING: Federici, Gunter, Cooper, Hector, Ake, McCleary (Appiah 63), Karacan, Chalobah, Obita, Mackie (Stacey 63), Blackman (Novakovich 81) Subs not used: Kelly, Norwood, Akpan, Andersen .

Referee: Lee Mason . Attendance: 14,604 . Reading were involved in a dramatic 2-1 defeat against Arsenal, after extra-time, in the last four of the Cup at Wembley on Saturday. Goalkeeper Adam Federici, whose fumble led to Alexis Sanchez's winning goal, was retained against Birmingham - as were six of his fellow starters from Wembley. At least Reading had no pressure on them, the last lingering doubts of relegation having been removed when Millwall lost 2-0 at Blackburn Rovers on Tuesday night. Birmingham had little to play for either, apart from trying to improve on a poor recent record of just two wins in eight league matches. A predictably dour opening, with neither side keen to force the pace, ended when Wes Thomas aimed at Federici. But it was a weak effort that did not trouble the Australian goalkeeper. Reading, with only two wins in 13 league games behind them and no wins in six, responded swiftly as the game warmed up. Garath McCleary, scorer of Reading's equaliser against Arsenal, fired wide after a long pass from Jake Cooper. A Cooper header lacked the power to test Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph, Jamie Mackie shot wide after Jem Karacan had been blocked out, and Mackie and Nick Blackman had close-range efforts cleared to safety. Randolph made a flying save to keep out a fierce McCleary shot and the keeper also had to stop two decent long-range attempts from Nathaniel Chalobah. Reading fans showed their support for Adam Federci following his blunder at Wembley on Saturday . Donaldson goes one-on-one with Federici, who was hoping to make amends for his mistake against Arsenal . Birmingham threatened only rarely, Paul Caddis blazing over from a Diego Fabbrini cross, which Donaldson had missed, and Jonathan Grounds heading straight at Federici from a Caddis corner. Reading kept up the momentum after the interval but, as Birmingham defended stubbornly, the home side spoiled good approach work with poor final touches. Nathan Ake did manage to fashion a chance when wriggling clear of his markers but drove straight at Randolph. Reading lost their second game in as many matches as their poor Championship form continues . Birmingham continued to sit back, inviting the pressure. Jordan Obita missed with a powerful drive and then drilled over a low cross that no team-mate was able to reach. Andrew Shinnie was off target from distance but Reading regained the upper hand with efforts from Chalobah, a 20-yard shot saved by Randolph, substitute Jack Stacey and Ake. Birmingham rallied late on, with Federici having to make two smart saves to deny substitute Demarai Gray. And the visitors broke the deadlock in the 83rd minute. Stephen Gleeson delivered a corner from the left and Donaldson rose unchallenged to glance a header past the helpless Federici.","Reading are 18th in the Championship while Birmingham City sit in 15th .

"Wolves striker Benik Afobe kept their fading promotion hopes alive as his 31st goal of the season salvaged a 1-1 Sky Bet Championship draw against play-off rivals Ipswich at Molineux. Afobe, who scored 19 goals on loan at MK Dons before joining Wolves from Arsenal in January for £2million, pounced after 50 minutes to cancel out a 21st-minute own goal from Richard Stearman. It was a vital strike from Afobe as the Black Country side were heading for a third successive defeat which would have all but ended their play-off hopes. Wolves striker Benik Afobe volleys home an equaliser for the home side at Molineux to keep them in the Championship play-off hunt . Wolves (4-4-2): Ikeme; Iorfa, Batth, Stearman, Golbourne; van La Parra (Henry 64), Edwards, McDonald, Sako; Dicko, Afobe . Subs not used: Doherty, McCarey, Doyle, Price, Ebanks-Landell, Jacobs .

Scorer: Stearman OG 21 . Booked: Parr, Tabb . Referee: Stuart Attwell . While Wolves are just about still alive in the promotion race, Ipswich remain well placed for a top-six finish despite failing to hold on to the advantage they were presented by Stearman. Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy, who was in charge at Wolves for almost six years before being sacked in February 2012, has steered them to 75 points and knows that winning their final two games of the season would secure a place in the play-offs. Molineux manager Kenny Jackett had wanted a frenetic start and he got that through quick striker Nouha Dicko. Dicko had been left out of the starting line-up for the previous game at Middlesbrough and he looked like he had a point to prove following his recall, with pace which tormented Tommy Smith and his central defensive partner, Wolves old boy Christophe Berra. However, the hosts failed to make the most of his efforts and Ipswich were able to ride out the storm before taking the lead. New Zealand international Smith rose above the Wolves defence and met a corner from Teddy Bishop that was glanced goalwards and deflected into his own net by the luckless Stearman. Wolves took time to come to terms with falling behind and when they finally did force an attack of note Dicko saw his 33rd-minute shot blocked by Berra. That sparked Jackett's team back into life and they were unlucky not to draw level six minutes before half-time when Ipswich failed to clear their lines. The ball fell invitingly on the edge of the area to Dave Edwards, whose volley looked set to sneak just inside the post before Bartosz Bialkowski tipped it away for a corner. Wolves took that freshly found momentum into the start of the second half and, after Dicko flashed a header from a Bakary Sako cross just wide, Afobe continued his prolific spell in front of goal. Rajiv van La Parra's low drive was deflected into the path of Afobe, who reacted brilliantly to force the ball home at the far post. With parity restored, Wolves carried more of a threat and Berra found himself working overtime to try and keep the dangerous Dicko in check. Ipswich were penned in their own half for long spells and when they did break out, Freddie Sears failed to test goalkeeper Carl Ikeme as he dragged his 73rd-minute shot wide. Tommy Smith's header (right) rebounds off Wolves defender Richard Stearman for an own goal to hand Ipswich the lead on Saturday . However, the hosts were by far the dominant force and Dicko looked set to make that pressure pay in the 76th minute - only to again be denied from six yards by another well timed block from the hard working Berra. Failing to make the most of that pressure almost came back to haunt Wolves four minutes from time when substitute Chris Wood picked up the ball on the left flank and surged towards goal, only to see his shot curl agonisingly wide of Ikeme's far post. And the hosts' frustration was capped in stoppage time when Dicko just failed to connect with a bouncing cross-shot from Kevin McDonald.

'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.'

Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'","Blackpool fans protested against owners, the Oyston family, before their 1-1 draw against Reading on Tuesday night .

"English football is hurtling towards what promises to be a record-breaking campaign for managerial sackings. Micky Adams became the 42nd manager to be dismissed this season when he was fired on Sunday by Tranmere, rock bottom of the Football League. Forty sackings were recorded by the League Managers’ Association before the end of March, which was an all-time high, and the trend is set to smash its previous record of 46, set in 2006-07. Micky Adams left his role with Tranmere, who are bottom of the Football League, on Sunday . Gus Poyet is one of five Premier League manager to be sacked during this season . 2005-06: 25 . 2006-07: 30 . 2007-08: 29 . 2008-09: 28 . 2009-10: 23 . 2010-11: 34 . 2011-12: 28 . 2012-13: 36 . 2013-14: 32 . 2014-15: 40 . The Championship remains the most dangerous terrain. Malky Mackay, fired by Wigan this month, was the 17th to go in the second tier, where the average tenure is less than a year, thanks partly to trigger-happy clubs like Leeds. There have been 10 sackings in both League One and League Two, while the Barclays Premier League has been relatively safe, with five dismissals, not including those who quit — Alan Pardew from Newcastle and Tony Pulis from Crystal Palace. Amid the chaos, Arsene Wenger remains the longest serving boss with more than 18 years at Arsenal, followed by Paul Tisdale, who has been at Exeter for nearly nine years, and Karl Robinson, close to five years at MK Dons. Malky Mackay became the 17th Championship manager to be sacked this season earlier in April . YEARS/MONTHS . A Wenger (Arsenal)                            18/7 . P Tisdale (Exeter)                               8/10 . K Robinson (MK Dons)                       4/11 . D Smith (Walsall)                                 4/9 .

Robinson’s longevity at Milton Keynes is intriguing since he has resisted interest from several other clubs but he and chairman Pete Winkelman have forged a close bond. ‘There were times when I could have gone and I chose to stay,’ said Robinson. ‘And the chairman will tell you there were times when he could have moved me on, and had to think twice, because results haven’t always been great. ‘It’s increasingly difficult for managers and I’m very fortunate with my chairman. We have an amazing relationship and I’ll always be indebted to him for this opportunity. I would have felt a bit of a fraud if I’d walked away.’ Robinson joined MK Dons in 2007, initially as a coach under Paul Ince. He has seen the club evolve and his team are one point from the automatic promotion places with three games to play in League One. MK Dons are at home to Doncaster tonight and fans will have an eye on Preston, one point better off, who are playing at Notts County. As other managers look longingly at Winkelman’s patience, Robinson explains how the unique nature of MK Dons has encouraged continuity at the top. ‘This is a very controversial club,’ he said. ‘We’re growing an identity within an industry that was reluctant to accept us and I think that is harder to achieve if you chop and change your manager.’","The most managerial sackings in a single season stands at 46 in 2006-07 .

"Groups of football fans are responsible for thuggish behaviour on trains on a weekly basis, a senior police officer has said. The warning by British Transport Police (BTP) Chief Constable Paul Crowther came ahead of a summit organised to determine the scale of the problem, which has come under scrutiny in recent months following a number of high-profile incidents. The latest figures for this football season show that BTP has recorded 630 football-related incidents so far, including a number with a racial element. Five Chelsea fans were caught on film directing racist abuse towards a black passenger in France . Fans appeared to be chanting on the Paris Metro train: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' Mr Crowther said: 'Sadly this type of casual thuggery is occurring just about on a weekly basis on our trains, with a sizeable minority who are behaving in a threatening, loud and sometimes racist way to the great terror of people who are using the system to get about and do their day-to-day business.' He said the impact on ordinary passengers is 'unacceptable', adding: 'We are in danger of saying those types of experiences are OK. 'Is that the sort of society we really want? I don't think it is. We haven't solved this type of behaviour and we need to work together to change it. 'We are saying 'Why do people think this is acceptable on trains?' You don't see this sort of behaviour on an aeroplane, for example.' Police believe the scale of football-related crime on the transport network may be higher than the figures show. Mr Crowther said: 'We think it is under-reported and we think that might be because people are intimidated or frightened.' Supporters have come under scrutiny (none of the fans pictured are necessarily referred to in the story) He said the problem was a 'very complex issue' and required a cultural change. 'What I am not looking for is more of the same,' he said. 'I don't think it is an issue we can arrest our way out of.' Representatives from football, police and other organisations, as well as those affected by football thuggery, are attending the summit, which is the first of its kind. In February a storm erupted after Chelsea supporters were filmed allegedly singing racist chants as a black man was prevented from boarding a train in Paris.","British Transport Police are clamping down on 'casual thuggery' on trains .

"Tim Sherwood wants to make Swindon Town midfielder Massimo Luongo one of his first summer signings at Aston Villa. Sherwood sent Luongo, an Australian international, to the County Ground on loan during his spell as development director at White Hart Lane. Luongo was player of the tournament during Australia's successful Asian Cup in January and the 22-year-old creator has decided to play in the Barclays Premier League next season. Aston Villa have priortised Swindon Town midfielder Massimo Luongo as one of their first summer signings . Sherwood, who took his team to the FA Cup final after beating Liverpool at Wembley last Sunday, is already planning for next season. Swindon are currently fourth in League One with three games to play and Luongo will be needed for the end of season play-offs. Luongo joined Spurs as a youngster and moved to Swindon as part of a relationship between the two clubs. Sherwood is close to Swindon chairman Lee Power after their spell together as players at Norwich City. Sherwood is being backed in the summer to bring in his own targets and many of them are the players Spurs did not think were good enough to make the grade in the Barclays Premier League. 22-year-old midfielder was player of the tournament during Australia's successful Asian Cup in January . YOUTH CAREER . The Sydney-born star joined Tottenham in January 2011 after impressing on trial from Australian semi-professional outfit APIA Leichhardt Tigers FC. TURNING PRO . After featuring for the Under 18 side, Luongo made his only appearance for the Tottenham first-team during a 7-6 penalty shootout defeat by Stoke in the third round of the League Cup in September 2011. However, breaking into the Spurs squad on a regular basis proved a tough task for the midfielder, who subsequently spent a spell out on loan at Ipswich in 2012 before two stints at Swindon Town a year later. Luongo made his move to the County Ground a permanent one in August 2013 for a fee of £400,000. This season he has made 36 appearances in all competitions for the Robins - scoring six goals. SOCCEROOS STAR . Luongo was eligible to represent either Australia by birth, Italy due to his father or the Indonesia courtsey of mother - but chose the former option. The Swindon midfielder made his debut for the Socceroos on March 6, 2014 as a second-half substitute in a 4-3 friendly defeat by Ecuador at Millwall's The New Den. His international rise continued just months later as he selected in their 23-man World Cup squad later that summer. Despite not featuring in any of their three World Cup group matches, the 22-year-old shone on the international stage at the turn of the year as Australia hosted the Asia Cup. Luongo played a pivotal role throughout the competition and in the final against South Korea he scored the opener in a 2-1 win - doubling his tally for the tournament. He was named Most Valuable Player of the Asia Cup too after also providing four assists for head coach Ange Postecoglou's side.","Tim Sherwood worked with Massimo Luongo at Tottenham Hotspur .

"Another day at Melwood, another awkward conversation with Brendan Rodgers for Raheem Sterling. This time, rather than a chat about a contract spurned it will be a noxious but legal substance once tried and tested by our own Prince Harry that will be under discussion. If Sterling has any sense, he won’t use the distinguished list of those who have previously tried nitrous oxide as an attempt at mitigation. Once again the 20-year-old Liverpool forward has been rather stupid. For Sterling the life lessons are arriving thick and fast. What will perhaps stand rather more impressively in his favour is some of the football Sterling produced in this rather important win for Liverpool. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener in the first half at Anfield . LIVERPOOL (4-3-3): Mignolet 7; Johnson 6, Lovren 5, Can 6.5, Moreno 6; Henderson 7, Allen 6.5, Lucas 7; Ibe 6 (Borini 58, 6), Coutinho 7.5 , Sterling 7 (Lambert 89).

Ratings by Ian Ladyman at Anfield . Raheem Sterling cuts in from the left to score. Click here for more from Match Zone . There was a moment, just before the hour, when Sterling actually contributed one of the misses of the season. It was one of those he would probably have struggled to do again if he tried. Much earlier in the piece, however, when his team were desperate for a good start, Sterling scored the kind of goal that few can score. It is this that motivates Rodgers as he tries to navigate a way through the current difficulties of the contract negotiations. It is this, and other moments like it, that convince managers like Rodgers that players like Sterling are worth the trouble. For be assured, this was an important win for Liverpool and an important performance. Newcastle may be among the Barclays Premier League’s most compliant current opposition but Liverpool’s own football has been patchy recently. They have an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday and needed victory here to bring momentum and to take them to within four points of Manchester City, the team now occupying the final Champions League position. When the stakes are high, then, you need your best players and here, after some modest recent form of his own, Sterling pitched in early and emphatically. Both sets of players stand for a minute's silence to remember the 96 Liverpool fans who died in 1989 . The minute's silence was impeccably observed by both sets of fans before the match . Captain Jordan Henderson supplied the ammunition with a crossfield pass struck arrow straight to his team-mate over 40 yards. Sterling’s first touch was perfect but then we expect that in the Premier League these days. What followed was even better, though, as he eased inside Ryan Taylor and Daryl Janmaat before striking a perfect right-foot shot to Tim Krul’s left with his instep. Sterling was in total control of events from the moment Henderson’s pass arrived and it was terrific to watch. With centre forward Daniel Sturridge injured again, Sterling once again was crucial to his team’s attacking play. This time he was stationed on the left of a front three that featured Jordan Ibe on the right and Philippe Coutinho through the middle. For a while — for about 30 minutes — Liverpool were excellent and Newcastle struggled to cope. Coutinho was his team’s best player, as he was all night, and he could have scored twice while Sterling brought a low save from Krul from an angle, as indeed did left back Alberto Moreno. The key to it was that Liverpool were playing football that was relaxed and for that they owed much to Sterling’s goal. They should have scored at least one more — maybe two — during this period of dominance. Coutinho was a menace while at the base of the midfield formation Lucas Leiva was playing well enough to make Steven Gerrard fret over the team selection when he is freed from suspension at Wembley this weekend. Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead . Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as a hapless Krul picks himself up from the Anfield turf . Newcastle's defence begin their inquest Lucas runs over to celebrate with the England man . Liverpool players celebrate in unison as they looked to close the gap on Manchester City . When goals don’t arrive, though, things can go wrong and, for 10 minutes either side of half-time, that suddenly looked as though it might happen here. In the 10 minutes before the break Newcastle should have had a penalty when the dreadful Dejan Lovren tripped Ayoze Perez, while the Newcastle forward brought a superb save from Simon Mignolet. Midfielder Mehdi Abeid also threatened twice from 18 yards. Into the second half and, briefly, this surprising pattern continued. Lovren almost disabled his own team-mate Emre Can by standing on his foot and then slashed wildly at a clearance. Mignolet, meanwhile, punched a corner clear under pressure and was happy to see a low drive from Abeid hacked clear by a defender. Dejan Lovren, who was lucky not to give away a penalty, challenges Newcastle forward Ayoze Perez . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (centre), suspended for the match, watches on from the stands . Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball . Sterling inexplicably skews his shot wide in the second half when it looked easier to score . Sterling can't believe he has missed as Krul gets up to gather the ball for the restart . Sterling shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers after he was substituted for Fabio Borini in the second half . At this point the game, despite early indications, was in the balance and it was then that Sterling fluffed his lines when handed the chance to settle it. Happily for him, Joe Allen did manage to convert the vital second goal not long after. Sterling’s miss really was spectacular. Another raking cross from Henderson was miscued by Taylor in front of his own goal and when the ball broke for Sterling on the six-yard line it seemed he couldn’t miss. Remarkably he did and, on another night, Krul may have been tempted to offer him a high five in the tunnel. As it was, Allen’s subsequent goal was timely. Newcastle failed to clear a corner properly with 20 minutes left and when Allen’s weak header came back to him off Taylor the Welshman hooked the loose ball high into the corner of the net. Joe Allen watches as his second-half effort beats Krul to double Liverpool's lead and earn them some breathing space . Allen is mobbed by his team-mates after securing three points for Liverpool that closed the gap on Manchester City . With the result settled there was still time for Newcastle’s Moussa Sissoko to get himself sent off. Riled by a spat with Glen Johnson, Sissoko clattered into Lucas and received a second yellow card. In truth, he was lucky it was not a straight red and, as club captain, he will doubtless face a few harsh words from his manager on Tuesday morning. It appears that Sterling, in that regard, will not be alone. Moussa Sissoko lunges in on Lucas Leiva with an ugly late challenge to earn a second yellow card .

"Gareth Bale has been urged to ignore a return to the Premier League and persevere at Real Madrid by former Wales manager Mark Hughes. The world's most expensive player has endured a difficult second season at the Bernabeu. Despite starring in both the 2014 Copa del Rey and Champions League finals, the 25-year-old has become a figure of frustration for fans this term. The Welshman has been linked with English clubs including Manchester United and Chelsea but Hughes, who regrets only spending a single season in Spain, believes Bale should stay with Los Blancos. Gareth Bale has come under fire from fans in his second season at Real Madrid . The Welshman missed the Champions League quarter-final return against Atletico after picking up an injury . Bale, who won the Champions League in his first season, has been urged to stay at Real by Mark Hughes . 'He's done everything right up to this point and having a huge impact over there but if he can, stay as long as you can,' Hughes told the BBC. The Stoke manager played with former England striker Gary Lineker under Terry Venables for one season at Barcelona in 1988. Hughes struggled at the Nou Camp before being loaned to Bayern Munich, although that has not prevented him from advising his countryman to stay. Javier Hernandez celebrates after scoring a late winner to send Real into the Champions League semi-finals . 'It's such an opportunity,' he said. 'From my own personal experience I made the mistake of thinking 'I'll just go for a couple of years and I'll be back home and continue my career' which is totally the wrong approach. 'When you get the opportunity to go to a club such as Barcelona or Real Madrid you've got to go with the intention that you're going to try and stay there for as long as you can until they actually kick you out of the door. Hughes believes that Bale has the advantage of having a good family support unit with him in Spain . 'I went there when I was 23 but I was a young 23. I wasn't married and I'd only just met my wife-to-be a couple of months before. 'It was difficult - I was out there on my own at times. 'If you have a good support network, which by all accounts Gareth has over there, I'd say stay as long as you can because you'll look back and think what a great experience that was.","Gareth Bale has endured a difficult second season at Real Madrid .

"Daniel Sturridge's season of frustration looks set to continue as he faces a race to be fit to lead Liverpool’s attack at Wembley. The England striker failed to train again on Thursday as Brendan Rodgers stepped up preparations for Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, meaning Sturridge hasn’t been involved in any outdoor work since before the quarter-final replay against Blackburn. Liverpool still have two more sessions before they travel south but Sturridge, who missed Monday’s 2-0 win over Newcastle United with tightness in his hip, would have to involved in at least one to stand any chance of starting at Wembley. Daniel Sturridge faces a fight to be fit for Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Sunday . Striker Sturridge was left out of the squad against Newcastle on Monday after being taken off at Blackburn . It would even appear touch and go as whether Sturridge will be fit enough to make Rodgers’ 18-man squad, given how tormented he has been with fitness issues this season. Liverpool will give Sturridge every chance to prove his fitness but the signs at present are not encouraging. The injury is a continuation of the problem he sustained in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on March 22. Sturridge missed England’s games against Lithuania and Italy with what England manager Roy Hodgson called ‘a small tear’ in his hip. Sturridge admitted last week he will not be back at his sharpest until next season and he will be glad to see the back of this campaign, having missed more than five months with a combination of thigh and calf problems. Steven Gerrard could return at Wembley after seeing out the last game of his suspension against Newcastle . Liverpool captain Gerrard holds a '96' balloon at the Hillsborough memorial service on Wednesday . If, as appears likely, the 25-year-old is forced to play a minor role, it would leave Rodgers a decision to make with regards his starting line-up, as Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is available having served a three-match suspension. Gerrard, whose 35th birthday falls on the same day as this year’s FA Cup final, missed several games in February and March with a hamstring problem but when he was fit for matches against Swansea and Manchester United, Rodgers decided to use him from the bench. He will be desperate to play at Wembley and Rodgers, who will be without cup-tied winger Jordon Ibe, must decide whether to keep faith with his current midfield of Lucas Leiva, Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen or alter his system to fit Gerrard back in. Rodgers will be without Jordon Ibe who is cup-tied having represented Derby in the FA Cup this season . Joe Allen says playing in these type of games is why he joined Liverpool from Swansea . Playing at Wembley will be a new experience for a number of Liverpool’s squad and Allen says a positive result against Villa is required to enhance their development. Liverpool are favourites to reach the final but the Wales international maintains there is no complacency in the group. ‘It’s the reason you join a club like this — the dream of competing for the top prizes and potentially getting some silverware,’ said Allen. ‘There’s a huge incentive for every player here. Villa had a great result on the weekend so they will be raring to go just like we will be. ‘That will make for a great game at a historic venue. Every single player wants to ensure we get ourselves back there for the final. Everyone is ready to make that leap. We are generally a young squad who are gathering experience and getting better all the time.’","Liverpool face Aston Villa in FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday .

Eckersley begun his career at the Red Devils but after failing to make an impact in Manchester, he rejected the offer of a new contract and signed for Premier League newcomers Burnley.

"Inter owner Erick Thohir had warned both sets of players before the game that the 'eyes of the world' would be fixed on the 214th Derby della Madonnina. By the end of the first half, the gaze had probably focused elsewhere. While a rivalry like this one can capture the imagination of a city - and there is no doubting by the build up that Milan had been hit by derby fever - it takes a concoction of quality, intensity and passion to hold the attention of the average neutral. Not all elements were present at the San Siro. A goalless first half had produced the odd burst of quality, but little intensity. A goalless second provided little more. Former Chelsea defender Alex sees his attempt blocked by Inter keeper Samir Handanovic, in one of the game's few clear-cut chances . Philippe Mexes thought he had scored an own goal, as did his keeper Diego Lopez, but it was ruled out and the game remained goalless . Suso steps away from Inter forward Rodrigo Palacio as both sides showed endeavour, but very little quality . Suso jumps for the ball as Juan Jesus watches on, as the two sides struggled to create clear chances . Inter: Handonvic, Jesus, Vidic, Ranocchia, D'Ambrosio, Kovacic (Shaqiri 77), Medel, Gnoukouri (Obi 67), Hernanes, Palacio, Icardi . Booked: Jesus, Medel, D'Ambrosio, Hernanes . Milan: Lopez, Mexes, Abate, Antonelli, Alex (Paleta 70), Poli (Cerci 81), Van Ginkel, De Jong, Menez, Suso (Destro 73), Bonaventura . Booked: De Jong, Abate . There was plenty of passion on show, but that was largely displayed by both sets of supporters. That both sides are struggling was obvious from the pre-match build up. The painstaking effort put into pre-match choreographies of both Inter's Curva Nord and Milan's Curva Sud emphasised that this was no ordinary derby. There was much riding on it. This was their season in a nutshell. And so it proved on the pitch. A wayward pass from former Cardiff City man Gary Medel after just 51 seconds set the tone, his searching long ball falling straight into the hands of Milan keeper Diego Lopez, with umpteen other options on. There were glimmers of the potential Roberto Mancini's Inter possess. Hernanes almost lit up the occasion with a wicked left-footed shot that had to be beaten away by Diego Lopez as it threatened his top corner. Mateo Kovacic attempted something similar three minutes later, only his effort failed to find the target. There was insight into why both sides are languishing in mid-table this season too. Juan Jesus' momentary blip saw him almost turn Jeremy Menez's cross into his own net, while Lopez was almost caught on the ball by Mauro Icardi. These are the unnecessary nervy moments that the top teams tend to avoid. Milan's chances were few, Suso providing Samir Handanovic with his first action of the game after 20 minutes, a routine stop from a stinging shot after the Liverpool loanee cut in from the right. At the other end Inter's front two of Rodrigo Palacio and Icardi huffed and puffed, but to no avail. Philippe Mexes and Alex continued to trump the hosts' attack with their experience, last ditch tackles and interceptions halting them at every turn. Both under-pressure managers, Filippo Inzaghi (left) and Roberto Mancini, gesticulate as their sides struggle to find a way through . Despite the disappointing seasons both sides are experiencing, the atmosphere was electric in the San Siro . As expected though, there was no lack of enthusiasm on the pitch. Gary Medel hasn't mellowed a bit since his move from Cardiff to Inter last summer. He continued to fly into tackles, picking up a booking for a foul on Suso. Another usual suspect joined him in the book just after the half hour mark as Nigel de Jong was cautioned after scything down Kovacic as the Inter midfielder tried to launch a counter attack. Jesus continued to prove a source to be exploited for Milan, his lack of concentration allowing Suso to nip in and start another foray into the Inter area, this time Handanovic dealt with Menez's low cross. There was no lack of bite from either side, and it proved a baptism of fire for 18-year-old Assane Demoya Gnoukouri, the midfielder making his first ever start for the Nerazzurri following just 11 minutes against Hellas Verona last week. He did himself no harm, showing plenty of nice touches and never looked overawed by the occasion. His warm reception as he came off just after the hour mark was well-deserved. He'll have plenty more derby days ahead of him. Inter fans light fireworks in the stands as they two sets of fans attempted to inject some life into the game . The fans produced an array of stunning banners which were shown off before kick off . An Inter flag is waved  as fans geared up for a derby that may mean less this year in terms of league position, but still matters to the locals . Inter cranked up the pressure after the break. Palacio was presented with the best opening off the match when he rounded Lopez, but having already seen a goal chalked off for offside, he was denied by the body of Alex who had raced back to clear off the line. Palacio then broke down the centre and fed Hernanes down the left. His cross was turned into his own goal by Mexes and Inter thought they had the lead. Referee Luca Banti and his official thought otherwise as the goal was ruled out for offside. It was the third disallowed of the game. In stoppage time Icardi flashed wide and Alex's acrobatic effort at the far post almost stole the points for The visitors. But by then, the rest of the world had switched off.

"Injury-ravaged Bayern Munich beat Hoffenheim 2-0 on Saturday, shrugging off a string of absences and their midweek Champions League defeat at Porto to close in on the Bundesliga title. Sebastian Rode scored in the 38th minute and Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck added an own goal in stoppage time as Bayern, with youngsters Mitchell Weiser and Gianluca Gaudino in the lineup, opened a 13-point lead over second-placed VfL Wolfsburg, in action against Schalke 04 on Sunday, with five matches left. The German champions, who host Porto on Tuesday in the Champions League quarter-final second leg after Wednesday's 3-1 loss, were without half a dozen starters, including Philipp Lahm, Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Thomas Muller celebrates after Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck scored a stoppage time own goal . But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was in top form, spectacularly denying Anthony Modeste at point blank range after a defensive blunder by Brazilian Dante. Rode then made the most of Bayern's second chance of the game, curling his shot from the edge of the box past keeper Oliver Baumann. Rode was lucky not to be penalised for bringing down Eugen Polanski in the area a minute later but there was no denying the dominance of Bayern, who came close again when Robert Lewandowski scraped the bar at the start of the second-half.

"After Chelsea forward Eden Hazard had scored give his side a 1-0 lead against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, the Sky Sports punditry team were convinced that there had been a foul in the build-up. Chelsea captain John Terry had come in with a strong challenge from behind on United striker Radamel Falcao which sent the Colombian hurtling to the ground. Blues midfielder Cesc Fabregas then collected the loose ball and released it to Oscar before his back-heel sent it into the path of the oncoming Hazard to slot home.

Souness said, 'It's a decent forearm smash. I mean he does stick his elbow in the back of Falcao's head and that's a foul.' He added, 'If that elbow's not there he's not going down like that.' Former Arsenal captain Henry, meanwhile, felt sympathy for Falcao as a fellow striker. Asked if he would have wanted a foul in that position as a player, the Frenchman responded, 'Yes, all day long.' Finally, Redknapp admitted that while Falcao could have possibly done better to stay on his feet, Terry's challenge from behind shouldn't have gone unpunished.

"If the Borussia Dortmund players had been shocked by Wednesday's news that manager Jurgen Klopp will quit the club at the end of the season, they showed no sign that it had affected them on Saturday. Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Shinji Kagawa were on target as Dortmund returned to winning ways with a comfortable victory against relegation-threatened Paderborn at Signal Iduna Park. The win moved last season's Bundesliga runners-up to eighth in the table and leaves them with a realistic chance of qualifying for Europe, which would be a remarkable achievement for a club that was flirting with relegation themselves earlier in the year.

Subs not used: Kutschke, Strohdiek, Bruckner, Luck . Manager: André Breitenreiter . Referee: F Brych . Much of the pre-amble to this fixture understandably centred on Klopp's surprise announcement - coming at a press conference on Wednesday - but Dortmund are slowly creeping back up the table and with victory here moved to within three points of sixth-place Augsburg. Dortmund had lost their two previous Bundesliga matches against Borrusia Monchengladbach and Bayern Munich and, after being held by the visitors for the opening 45 minutes, cruised to victory with plenty to spare. After a frustrating opening 45 the hosts had to wait just three minutes after the interval before taking the lead. Aubameyang delivered a perfect cross from theright and Armenia international Mkhitaryan powered a near post header past Lukas Kruse. Dortmund, clearly wary of their poor defensive record this season, continued to press and increased their advantage just eight minutes later when Aubameyang got his name on the scoresheet after providing the first.

The visitors stunned Klopp's side by coming from two down in the reverse fixture earlier this season to earn a point, but there was to be no repeat this time around. Former Manchester United midfielder Kagawa made absolutely sure of that when he latched on to Mkhitaryan's ball with 10 minutes to play before escaping a challenge and firing past Kruse to complete a routine win.

DIDIER DROGBA 5 -Worked hard but that lost yard of pace cost him a lot of the time. Running battles with Smalling and McNair. Booked. SUBS . RAMIRES (67, for OSCAR) 6 - Came on to act as a runner from midfield but didn’t really work as planned. JOHN OBI MIKEL (90, for FABREGAS) WILLIAN (90, for HAZARD) Veteran forward Didier Drogba worked hard against United but has lost a yard of pace . MANAGER: JOSE MOURINHO 7 - It wasn’t pretty but he found a way to stop United, a task which many others have tried and failed with in recent weeks. Unused subs: Cech, Luis, Cuadrado, Solanke. De Gea did not have the busiest day in London but could have been sent off for handling outside the box . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3) DAVID DE GEA 6.5 - Little to do as Chelsea were happy to wait for their opportunities. Could have been sent off for handling outside the box. ANTONIO VALENCIA 6 - Strong up against Hazard but it’s very difficult to stop the Player of the Year certainty in this kind of mood. CHRIS SMALLING 6.5 - The senior centre back, looked calm and continued his recent good form under Van Gaal’s guidance. United left back Luke Shaw (right) tussles with Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic . PADDY MCNAIR 6.5 - Given plenty of room and was allowed to play out from the back. Twice tested Courtois from distance. LUKE SHAW 7 - Great penetrative work early on and his cut-back should have set up Rooney for an opener. Every bit as penetrative as Blind. WAYNE ROONEY 6 - Back in midfield, and it blunted his influence. Missed an excellent chance in the opening exchanges and should have scored. ANDER HERRERA 7.5 - Dictated from deep, excellent as United took initiative. Booked for diving in stoppage time as he hooked his leg on Cahill's. Wayne Rooney's attacking influence was blunted by his midfield role against Chelsea . MAROUANE FELLAINI 6.5 - Always a presence but Chelsea doubled up on United’s unorthodox dangerman to stop the threat. JUAN MATA 5 - Set-piece delivery rarely found its intended target and game passed him by a little as United focused attacks down the left. RADAMEL FALCAO 4 - Bullied out of the game by Terry. This isn’t the striker that terrorised Chelsea in Monaco in 2012. Hit the post late on. United's struggling striker Radamel Falcao endured a tough day at the office against Chelsea . ASHLEY YOUNG 5.5 - Worked well but couldn’t match his exploits of late and was withdrawn as United looked for an equaliser. SUBS . ANGEL DI MARIA (70, for YOUNG) 6 - Almost set up a chance down the left but tough to break down Chelsea. ADNAN JANUZAJ (70, for MATA) 5 - Little impact after replacing equally ineffective Mata. TYLER BLACKETT (80, for SHAW) MANAGER: LOUIS VAN GAAL 6 - His side started confidently and strongly but he couldn’t find a way past Chelsea. Yet to beat his student Mourinho. Unused subs: Valdes, Rafael, Van Persie, Pereira. REFEREE: MIKE DEAN 6 - Huge call at the end to deny Herrera penalty. Just about right.

"Daryl Janmaat has likened Newcastle's Premier League encounter against Swansea on Saturday to playing in the World Cup semi-final last summer. Newcastle host Garry Monk's side at St James' Park on a wretched run of form that has seen them contemplate the threat of relegation. The Magpies have lost their last six league matches in a row - including a 3-1 home defeat by Tottenham on Sunday. Daryl Janmaat has compared Newcastle's upcoming match vs Swansea to playing in the World Cup semi-final . Newcastle sit seven points clear of relegation - having lost their last six Premier League games . That result leaves John Carver's men just seven points clear of the relegation zone with five games remaining. And Janmaat who came off the bench in Holland's semi-final penalty shootout loss to Argentina in Brazil, reckons the significance of Newcastle's match at the weekend could rival that. 'It's a big game,' the 25-year-old defender told the Evening Chronicle. 'I have played in the semi-finals of the World Cup, that was big but this is close for me. 'We have to win it. We are staying focused. 'Taking three points will be enough to be safe at the moment. That is our only focus.'

"FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein has made a formal rotation of the World Cup between the continents one of the key elements of his manifesto and says he can see a tournament being jointly hosted by several different nations. Prince Ali, a current FIFA vice-president from Jordan, said he could envisage a World Cup being played in different countries - or even in different confederations - in a similar way to Euro 2020 which is being played in 13 nations. In his manifesto, which he launched on Monday, Prince Ali has also warned against any decision on expanding the World Cup from its current 32 countries, or a re-allocation of places, being taken for purely political reasons to try to drum up votes for the FIFA presidency.

Prince Ali is standing for FIFA president alongside former Portugal and Real Madrid player Luis Figo . He is standing against current president Sepp Blatter, Michael van Praag from Holland and former Portugal international Luis Figo. In terms of World Cup rotation, Prince Ali said the confederations should take turns hosting the tournament. 'The principle is that it should be rotated among the confederations but it still has to be based on the best bids,' he said. 'But we have to be open-minded. I think it is also possible that two countries from different confederations could co-host the World Cup. Look at Europe in 2020 - a number of different regions or countries could host the World Cup - it's in the past now but potentially the Gulf could have had a World Cup due to its close proximity.' FIFA has announced it will make a decision on the allocation of World Cup places at an executive committee meeting the day after the presidential election on May 29. Prince Ali said much more consultation was needed before any decision should be made. He added: 'I am very hesitant about people playing politics with the most important flagship event of FIFA and possibly of sport in the world. 'We need to speak to all the stakeholders, including the sponsors. People are making promises to enlarge the World Cup but in 2022 they are making the World Cup shorter in terms of time frame. We cannot end up with a situation where mistakes are made again.' Prince Ali has also promised greater transparency, including making public the salary of the FIFA president and executive committee members. He also believes that the minutes of FIFA executive committee meetings should be made public. He also wants an investigation into how the US television rights for the 2026 World Cup were awarded to Fox without a tender process or any discussion with the FIFA executive committee. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has said FIFA 'did what it had to do' to prevent any possible legal action from the broadcaster in relation to the 2022 rights after the Qatar World Cup was moved to the winter. Prince Ali, who insists there is a real appetite for change among FIFA associations, said large sums of money for football had potentially been lost. 'Unfortunately I was not made aware of it and I have been trying to find out what is going on,' he said. Michael van Praag (right), from Holland, is the remaining presidential candidate . 'Something went wrong and we need to get to the bottom of it. 'It needs to have a proper tendering process which is good practice in any organisation in the world. 'We are talking about a large sum of money that future generations will potentially have lost because of decisions or misadministration taking place at the moment by people who will probably not be around at that time.'","Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein launched his election manifesto on Monday .

"The avocado tree is 'transgender' and has overnight sex changes, a botanist has discovered. Professor John Warren discovered avocado trees switch from male to female in a matter of hours. Professor Warren, based at the University of Aberystwyth, Wales, said the avocado tree displays 'unique flowering behaviour'. He found that during the day the trees, which grow in tropical and Mediterranean climates, flower with their 'female parts' ready to be pollinated by bees. Professor John Warren discovered avocado trees switch from male to female in a matter of hours . The flowers close for the night and then the next morning they reopen - but now they use their 'male anthers' to spread their pollen.

"Eden Hazard and Harry Kane appear set to contest the PFA Player of the Year award after the six-man shortlist was unveiled. Hazard is hot favourite thanks to his consistently brilliant form for Chelsea, runaway leaders at the top of the Barclays Premier League, but Kane is the homespun hero after a fabulous breakthrough season at Tottenham. The 21-year-old Spurs striker has 29 goals in all competitions to date and forced his way into Roy Hodgson’s squad, scoring within 79 seconds of his England debut against Lithuania last month. Harry Kane's prolific form for Tottenham has seen him nominated for PFA Player of the Year . Eden Hazard (left) has propelled Chelsea to the top of the Premier League with his brilliant displays . Diego Costa (right) scores for Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final victory over Tottenham at Wembley . Alexis Sanchez has had no trouble adapting to the Premier League, scoring 20 times for Arsenal so far . Eden Hazard - Chelsea . Diego Costa - Chelsea . Harry Kane - Tottenham Hotspur . Alexis Sanchez - Arsenal . David de Gea - Manchester United . Philippe Coutinho - Liverpool . Kane, the only English player up for the main award, has scored 19 in the Premier League, the same number as Diego Costa, who is also on the shortlist, along with Alexis Sanchez, Philippe Coutinho and David de Gea. Manchester City’s miserable demise is perhaps summed up by the fact none of their players made the cut, including Sergio Aguero who also has 19 Premier League goals and is locked together with Kane and Costa in the race for the Golden Boot. Hazard, 24, is heavily odds-on with the bookmakers after leading Chelsea’s charge for a first title in five years and 17 goals in all competitions. Goalkeeper David de Gea (left) has been Manchester United's most impressive player of the season . Philippe Coutinho (left) has enjoyed his best season yet for Liverpool and is also up for Player of the Year . The PFA Young Player of the Year nominations are: . Eden Hazard - Chelsea . Harry Kane - Tottenham Hotspur . Philippe Coutinho - Liverpool . Raheem Sterling - Liverpool . David de Gea - Manchester United . Thibaut Courtois - Chelsea . Arsene Wenger plumped for Hazard when asked to name his winner, without voting for anyone from his Arsenal squad. Sanchez made an explosive start to the campaign but his form has faded during the spring, when the votes are cast. The same could be said for Costa, who scored 13 of his 19 Chelsea goals before the turn of the year. De Gea’s early-season form was strong, too, keeping Manchester United in contention for the top four as Louis van Gaal struggled to find the right formula. Hazard (left) poses with former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez (right) after last year's award ceremony . John Terry voted for Coutinho but the Brazilian is an outsider because Liverpool have been unable to match last season’s success. Four of the six - all but Costa and Sanchez - are also on the shortlist for the Young Player of the Year with Thibaut Courtois and Raheem Sterling making up the numbers. Kane is the favourite to win the Young Player award.","Harry Kane nominated for PFA Player of the Year after prolific season .

"German football has certainly had better days. Still coming to terms with the morning resignation of their most gifted and charismatic coach, Jurgen Klopp, the Bundesliga then saw its champions humbled, embarrassed even, at a feverish Estadio do Dragao on Wednesday night. Not since the days of Jose Mourinho more than a decade ago have FC Porto seen anything quite like this. Porto remain one of Portugal’s eminent teams – they have been champions in three of the last four seasons – and won the Europa League four years ago. But nothing quite feels the same as bringing a genuine European superpower to its knees and Porto and their rapturous supporters went home knowing that they now have a more than a decent chance of squeezing through to the semi-finals of the Champions League when the teams reconvene in Bavaria next Tuesday.

Missing key players, Pep Guardiola’s team were also missing balance, cohesion and an ability to defend properly. Only the cruel would say that in a week when all the talk has been about Guardiola moving to Manchester City in a year’s time, he oversaw a performance rather familiar to those who have been watching the fallen English champions recently. Guardiola’s team started badly and got worse. In the middle of the game they improved a little but as the second half wore on they failed themselves once again. This was a defeat by two goals that they can have no complaints about at all. If they don’t improve markedly next week then they really will go out. Beforehand, there was little to suggest this would happen. Yes, Bayern were without Sebastian Schweinsteiger, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery but Porto are a team with little recent Champions League pedigree. As kick-off approached you could find odds as long as 4-1 on a home win. A couple of minutes in to the game, however, the ground shifted significantly beneath Bayern’s feet and it was, it must be said, entirely their own fault. No doubt expecting a bright start from Porto, Bayern simply had to ride it out. After all, it happens to them wherever they go. They are used to it. Here, though, calamity befell the Germans immediately. Xabi Alonso dithered under pressure from Jackson Martinez on the edge of the penalty area and when the Spanish referee deemed the Porto forward’s challenge legal the Colombian eased clear and was felled by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The German number one could have been sent off but wasn’t. He received only a yellow card. Porto playmaker Ricardo Quaresma, meanwhile, moved forwards to put the penalty to Neuer’s right. An awful start for Bayern and perfect for Porto, the pattern continued and in the tenth minute the visiting team contributed another absolute horror show. This time it was the Brazilian central defender Dante who erred, giving the ball away to Quaresma 40 yards from goal, allowing his opponent to race away and score comfortably with the outside of his right foot as Neuer advanced.

The Porto fans react with joy as Quaresma sprints towards them in celebration of his quick-fire double . There were many people here who perhaps couldn’t believe what they were seeing. On the touchline Guardiola would have been one of them but, outwardly at least, he appeared calm. Robert Lewandowski had already shaved the bar with a header between the two Porto goals and perhaps he was confident that his team would improve sufficiently to save themselves. Certainly the game’s third goal was always going to be important and it was Bayern who scored it. As the first half had worn on they had begun to impose themselves a little and it was therefore no great shock when Jerome Boateng’s low cross from the right was driven in by Thiago Alcantara from close range at the far post in the 28th minute. With an hour of the game – and two and a half hours of the tie – remaining, Guardiola perhaps felt that things were now under some semblance of control. As it turned out, he was wrong. Bayern started the second period almost as badly as they had started the first and would have slipped two behind once more had Neuer not produced the save of the night, acrobatically turning over Hector Herrera’s close range shot.

Porto's head coach Julen Lopetegui (left) shouts instructions to his team during the Champions League first-leg . It was a save that few goalkeepers in Europe perhaps would have made but still Bayern’s problems wouldn’t go away. Porto were too quick and too hungry for them in the middle of the field and the Germans simply couldn’t keep hold of the ball long enough to impose themselves on what should have been inferior opposition. Throughout the whole of the second half, Bayern hardly created an opportunity and when what could yet be the decisive third Porto goal arrived with 25 minutes left it represented another act of self-harming from the visitors. The long ball down the inside left channel really shouldn’t have caused Bayern any problems but Boateng for some reason chose not to head it clear and Martinez then displayed a terrific turn of speed to round Neuer – who left his line as slight favourite - and score from a tight angle. Bayern still had time but they had not the wit to get back in to the game. They will have to do their work at the Allianz Arena in five days’ time. This was Porto’s night and if Portuguese football has something of an inferiority complex these days – and it really has – then evenings like this will go some way to helping.

"An online campaign set up to raise money for a Blackpool pensioner who is being sued by the club's owners has reached its £20,000 target. Frank Knight, 67, posted an apology on his Facebook account last week to Blackpool and the Oyston family, who run the Fylde coast club, over allegations he made on his social network account last year. In that statement, addressed to the 34 Facebook friends he had at that time, Knight said he had agreed to pay damages of £20,000 to the Sky Bet Championship club, which prompted fellow Seasiders supporter Joe Atherton to set up an account on the website gofundme.com where fans could pledge donations. Blackpool fans vent their disgust at the Oyston family before their Championship game against Reading . Supporters have been protesting against the Oystons before matches and then not attending the games . Over 1,000 supporters did just that, ensuring the target was met in only three days, and the account will now be kept open to provide more financial aid to fellow supporters such as Steven Sharpe, who Blackpool announced they had taken legal action against in January following posts he made on a forum regarding Oyston and the club. An update on Knight's campaign page read: 'WE'VE DONE IT! £20,000 reached in 3 days. Phenomenal stuff. Thank you to all Blackpool fans for digging deep, and football fans of other clubs throughout the land (and world!).

Blackpool became the first Football League side to be relegated when their demotion into the third tier was confirmed on Easter Monday, and they still need one point to equal the lowest ever points total in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. The day after that relegation was confirmed, disgruntled supporters threw eggs at the back of directors' boxes before their game with Reading and hurled a firework, flare and smoke cannister into the cordoned-off area in front of the main reception area in angry protests against chairman Karl Oyston. Over the weekend, actor-turned-activist and West Ham fan Russell Brand even asked what he could to do 'help' the situation on his official Twitter account.

"A fumble from Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time handed Arsenal a 2-1 victory and a place in the FA Cup final. The Royals keeper, who had made some fine saves earlier in the match, allowed Alexis Sanchez's low shot to squirm between his legs and over the line on 115 minutes, which was enough to see the Gunners return to Wembley on May 30 to try to defend the trophy. Sanchez had swept the Gunners into the lead on 39 minutes. However, Reading were level when Garath McCleary's volley was deflected past goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who could only palm the ball back over the line. Sami Mokbel rated the players' performances at Wembley. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici . READING (4-4-2) Adam Federici 6 .

And how did he miss that chance to score in the final five minutes? Mesut Ozil 8 . Unlocked the door with an excellent pass to set up Sanchez's first goal. Probed and probed.

"Thirty years ago this month something as basic as two men hitting balls around a table with a stick gripped the nation by the throat. It was as iconic a moment of the Eighties as Duran Duran, yuppies, football hooliganism and Mrs Thatcher handbagging the unions. It was Steve Davis — lean, robotic and unsmiling — versus Dennis Taylor — tubby and splendidly bespectacled. ‘And so the lights go down,’ whispered commentator Ted Lowe to 18.5million viewers. ‘The players shake hands. One of these lucky chaps will pick up the title, the trophy and £60,000.’ Steve Davis (left) and Dennis Taylor pose with the trophy before their World Snooker final in 1985 . Davis was leading the final 8-0 when he missed a shot on the green that he has rued to this day . Taylor pounced upon the error from Davis to overturn the difference and lead 9-7 overnight . The 1985 final was watched by 18.5million, a BBC2 record, but it is way behind the most-watched sporting events: . 1. 1966 World Cup final 32.30m . 2. 1970 FA Cup final replay Chelsea v Leeds 28.49m . 3. 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony 27.3m . 4. 2012 Closing Ceremony26.3m . 5. 1984 Winter Olympics Torvill and Dean23.95m . 6. 1998 World Cup England v Argentina 23.78m . With those words the biggest British television audience for a post-midnight programme and BBC2’s biggest for anything ever, settled down to watch the 35th and final frame of the 1985 World Championship, a torture of edgy, error-ridden, nerve-frayed snooker lasting 68 minutes. Before reliving those late agonies, we should go back a little further because Davis remembers the turning point of the match not as the black he overcut with his last, disastrous shot of the tournament, but something as innocuous as a green ball in the ninth frame. He was leading 8-0 while Taylor, as Davis put it, was ‘struggling to find the end of his tip with the chalk, never mind the pockets’. Davis says now: ‘If ever I was going to have therapy, it would not be about the black. Anybody could miss a ball under pressure. The green was a different story because I didn’t need to play it. I should have played safe and waited for a better chance. ‘If there is one shot in my whole career I want to go back and play again, it is that one. I missed it and it let Dennis in.’ From being on the verge of 9-0 down, Taylor fought back to 9-7 overnight. ‘I woke up screaming every hour,’ recalls Davis. He was the world No 1, winner the previous two years, and had made the perfect start. ‘What could go wrong?’ he muses now. ‘The green.’ Taylor performs his famous finger-wagging celebration after sinking the final black . To rake up that final with Davis even now is to intrude into a type of personal grief. ‘While I am happy to talk about it, I’m slightly aggrieved that nobody celebrated the 25th anniversary of me beating John Parrott 18-3 in 1989,’ he says, three-quarters joking. ‘Dennis loves it, of course. We say that every opportunity he gets in the commentary box he somehow manages to turn the conversation around to the ’85 final, even when we are discussing a free ball.’ Davis’s lead went from 14-11 to 15-12 to 15-15 to 17-15. Then all square at 17-17. Snooker was in its heyday, with cartoon-book characters such as Hurricane Higgins and Whirlwind White putting it second only to football in national popularity and this frame was the zenith. Davis sipped his water sparingly throughout. Taylor frequently muttered to his mother, who had died, aged 62, a few months before. It provided him with a welcome distraction from watching Davis dominating the table. But the championship came down to the final four balls. Taylor needed them all. He potted a great long brown, a difficult blue and a tricky pink. Taylor went over to kiss the little lady on the trophy before taking on the black. Davis led again 14-11 but the pair were eventually all square at 17-17 in Sheffield . The final came down to four balls left on the table and Taylor needed them all to claim victory . Taylor looks to the trophy for inspiration before taking an important shot in the final against Davis . Davis missed a black that seven out of ten times in competition he would have converted . ‘I don’t know why I did it to this day,’ he said. ‘I think it was either I am going to win you with this shot or lose you with it. I had made my mind up I was going to go for it.’ Taylor tries to double the black into the middle pocket. ‘The crowd opposite the pocket were in a better position than me to see it and they started cheering,’ says Taylor. ‘But it missed by a fraction.’ Davis then plays a superb safety shot, doubling the black from one end to the other. Taylor tries to double it again, this time up and down the table. It falls safe. Davis fluffs his next shot and lets Taylor in — a long black through the blue and green spots and his first genuine chance to take the title. ‘I twitched on it,’ recalls Taylor. ‘It was the biggest twitch ever seen at the Crucible. My head came up and the cue jerked at it. I missed it by so much the black came back and I almost fluked it at the other end.’ Now here was Davis’s chance: a cut into the bottom corner pocket. ‘I walked away thinking there was no way he would miss it,’ says Taylor. Thirty years on, Davis reckons he would have potted this shot nine times out of 10 in practice and seven out of 10 in competition. ‘It was tough but gettable and I was meant to be the man who got everything,’ he says. Referee John Williams calls for silence. Davis approaches the table. ‘I remember that walk was surreal, an out-of-body experience. My legs had gone. It did not feel as if any part of my anatomy was playing that shot.’ He crouches in total silence but overcuts the ball. Davis: ‘I knew I’d lost it at that moment.’ He put his hand to his head. He was white. The black he had left was straight forward. Only nerves could cause Taylor to flunk it. There were more cheers. Taylor, the underdog, was anecdotally most people’s choice to win, though ironically it turned out that his future wife, Louise, was supporting Davis as she watched the match at home. Taylor remembers: ‘I couldn’t believe I was coming back to the table. As I took the shot, I didn’t even grip the cue; I let it rest in my hand, so I would have to let go of it and it wouldn’t deviate.’ It worked, and the black was sunk. Taylor potted a straight forward black to win the final after 14 hours and 50 minutes of snooker . Davis looks at the ground after losing the final he had never been behind in until the last ball hit the pocket . Taylor kisses the trophy after finally emerging victorious after his lengthy duel with Davis . And so after 14 hours and 50 minutes of snooker, for every second of which Taylor had been behind, he was the champion of the world. He held his cue aloft in both hands above his head and pumped it over his head. He wagged his finger. It was an ‘I told you so gesture’ aimed at his friend Trevor East, head of ITV Sport, who had watched all but one session of Taylor’s entire championship campaign. It was 12.19am and time for bed. ‘Interesting’ by Steve Davis is published by Ebury Press, priced at £20.","Snooker's most dramatic final gripped 18.5million viewers in 1985 .

"Mauricio Pochettino insists Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood will be shown respect on his return to White Hart Lane - 11 months after he was shown the door by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. 'I expect a very good reception for him,' said Pochettino, whose Spurs side entertain Villa on Saturday afternoon in the Barclays Premier League. 'He is a manager that worked here and spent a lot of time here as a player and a manager. He helped develop young talent too. Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino gestures to his players at Burnley last weekend . Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood (centre) takes a training session at Bodymoor Heath on Thursday . 'I hope it's a very good reception from the supporters as he deserves that.' On Thursday, Sherwood revealed he is still in touch with Tottenham chairman Levy and went as far as to thank the club for ending his five-month spell in charge last summer, as it meant he had the chance to take over at Villa Park. Spurs occupy sixth place in the Barclays Premier League, seven points off the Champions League qualification places. Villa, meanwhile, travel to London on the back of a thrilling 3-3 draw against fellow strugglers QPR on Tuesday. Sherwood wildly celebrates during Aston Villa's 3-3 draw with QPR in Birmingham on Tuesday night . Sherwood (right) salutes Emmanuel Adebayor during his time in charge of Tottenham Hotspur last year . Sherwood will be eager to prove a point - or three - at White Hart Lane, but Pochettino was quick to acknowledge the work the former Spurs midfielder did during his time in North London. 'I think that we share the same idea. We believe in young talent - this is great. Tim, Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand deserve credit for the young players that have arrived in the first team.' Sherwood trusted in the likes of Harry Kane and Nabil Bentaleb last season, and those players have continued to thrive under Pochettino. Asked if it was a gamble by Sherwood to give those youngsters a chance, Pochettino joked: 'The big gamble was to play Ryan Mason against Arsenal... I remember people said Pochettino is crazy for giving him his debut against Arsenal. 'But yes, I think their work was great. Tim deserves credit for that.' Pochettino predicts a difficult game, particularly given the form of Benteke. The striker was sent off in the last fixture between the two sides, a 2-1 win for Tottenham, but he was the saviour this week for Villa against QPR, and now has seven goals in his last five. Tottenham Hotspur star Harry Kane charges forward as Burnley goalkeeper Thomas Heaton grasps the ball . Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke celebrates after scoring the second of three goals against QPR . 'He (Benteke) has great momentum. He is a very good player. A strong player. We need to be careful with him. 'Aston villa have a very good side and tomorrow we expect a tough game.' Pochettino confirmed goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and right-back Kyle Walker will play no part against Villa due to respective knee and foot injuries, while centre-back Jan Vertonghen is a doubt with a virus.","Tottenham Hotspur manager expects a good reception for Tim Sherwood .

"All eyes were again on Jimmy Anderson as England on Thursday night began their push for victory here but instead the limelight was seized by Chris Jordan with his second stunning catch of the first Test. A day that featured a fourth Test century in only his ninth match for Gary Ballance ended with the leader of England’s attack still waiting for the wicket that will bring him level with Sir Ian Botham’s Test record. So well did Ballance and England bat that Alastair Cook was able to set West Indies a target of 438 in just over four sessions that would even surpass their own world record successful Test chase. Yet so solidly did West Indies begin their attempt to emerge unscathed from this first of three Tests that it became pertinent to remember that record was set in none other than Antigua and featured a century by a certain Shiv Chanderpaul. It remains highly unlikely that West Indies will today surpass the 418 for seven they made to defeat Australia at the old St John’s Rec 12 years ago. Cook, though, will be grateful for the athleticism of Jordan and the off-spin of Joe Root for the wicket that means England remain firm favourites to secure today what would be a highly valuable victory for them. When West Indies grafted their way to 90 for one on this fourth day it was possible to believe that they would at least be able to escape with a draw from this match and head to Grenada next week still all square. Yet When Jordan dived to his right at wide slip and grasped the chance offered by Darren Bravo’s flailing bat in Root’s second over a second West Indian wicket had fallen and England ended the day with a spring in their step. They still have much to do and all results remain possible but England will be much the happier with West Indies finishing on 98 for two, still a massive 340 short of recreating Antiguan Test history. For Anderson, however, there was just more frustration as he could not strike a blow in the seven overs he has so far bowled in the second innings. Botham remains in the wings, with a nice bottle of red at the ready, to congratulate Anderson if and when the big moment comes today. England timed both the pace of their batting and their declaration to perfection, scoring quickly enough to set West Indies that world record breaking target and giving themselves 130 overs to bowl them out. And at the centre of their batting effort was Ballance who has made a start to his Test career that can genuinely be described as great. Darren Bravo nicks Joe Root's delivery as Chris Jordan gets ready to pounce . Bravo can only watch on as Jordan makes a stunning dive to seize the loose ball . Jordan shows tremendous reflexes to cling on to dismiss the West Indies batsman . Gary Ballance plays a shot during day four of England's first Test against West Indies on Thursday .

Joe Root formed a solid partnership with Ballance and made big inroads against the home side . Root salutes the stands after he brought up his half century earlier in the day . Jos Buttler also impressed for Peter Moores' side with an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls . It is extraordinary, really, that Ballance should have been perceived to be under any sort of pressure going into the second innings of this first Test. Yes, he had a poor World Cup after being thrown into the England team with little preparation ahead of their opening match against Australia. And, yes, Ballance looked tentative in the first innings here at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium, pushing at a ball with hard hands he could have left alone. Yet memories are short these days and it should be remembered that Ballance had an extraordinary summer last year having been asked to bat in a position at No 3 he was unaccustomed to by coach Peter Moores. This was the Ballance of last season, the white shirt seemingly a much better fit than the blue of limited-overs cricket, and he is quite simply a run machine in the ultimate form of the game. Root was furious with himself when he again got an inside edge to be bowled when a century was there for the taking but his partnership of 114 with Ballance came at a crucial time for England with West Indies still in the hunt. It says everything about Ballance’s 122 that the only time he looked in trouble was when Jos Buttler hit Sulieman Benn straight back at him and struck his batting partner a nasty blow on the elbow. Other than that it was pretty much plain sailing for England, with Jos Buttler also returning to form with an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls. Stuart Broad (centre) celebrates with his England team-mates after taking the wicket of Kraigg Brathwaite . Root (right) gets the plaudits from his team-mates after he took the wicket of Bravo late on day four . The openers, of course, are much more of an issue but a win here on Friday would buy Cook a bit of time for both him and Jonathan Trott to get things right in Grenada next week and Barbados in the final Test. With Anderson in the form that saw him take only two of the four wickets he needed at the start of this Test to surpass Botham’s tally of 383 in the first innings it was left to Stuart Broad to strike the first blow for England. An absolute brute of a delivery saw Kraigg Braithwaite fending to short leg and Broad quickly pointing to the dressing room to salute the role that bowling coach Ottis Gibson, who knows West Indies inside out having been their coach until earlier this year, played in the dismissal. James Anderson unsuccessfully appeals for the wicket of Bravo earlier in the contest . He is one of the best slip fielders England have found in years but Jordan will be annoyed he could not pouch another chance offered by Devon Smith before the close. Smith lived to fight another day on 59 and he too was in West Indies’ side that famous day in 2003 when history was made. If he is part of history again then it will have been an extraordinary last day. Any hopes of a West Indies collapse quickly faded and all was quiet until Jordan’s intervention to replicate his similar diving effort in the first innings. The West Indies side await a decision from the third empire on the fourth day of action in the Caribbean . He is clearly one of the best slip fielders England have found in years but Jordan will be annoyed that he could not get a hand to another sharp chance offered by Devon Smith off Root before the close. Smith lives to fight another day on 59 and it should be pointed out that he too was in West Indies side that famous day in 2003 when history was made on this island. If he is part of history again then it really will have been an extraordinary last day.","Gary Ballance is now averaging in excess of 60 for England .

"ISIS has released a chilling new propaganda video warning there is 'no safety for any American on the globe' and claiming the U.S. will burn in another 9/11-style attack. Titled 'We Will Burn America', the video calls on supporters to attack the U.S. on its own soil, while claiming its citizens' sense of safety is a 'mirage'. The 11 minute-long video also forms a showcase of some of the militants' bloodiest atrocities - it features the beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley, as well as several mass beheadings and the horrific burning of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh. The video, titled 'We Will Burn America', includes footage of the 9/11 terror attacks and several recent ISIS-inspired atrocities . The video's subtitles claim America 'thinks it's safe' because of it's geographical location . It goes on to state that for this reason, the U.S. believes it can invade 'the Muslim lands' Previous jihadis managed to carry out the 9/11 attacks with 'less resources' than what ISIS currently has, the video claimed. Pictured is Osama bin Laden in a still image taken from the group's propaganda video . Subtitles added to the footage claim that previous 'mujahideen' - a term used to describe someone waging jihad - managed to carry out the 9/11 Twin Tower attacks with little resources. In broken English, it goes on: 'By Allah's willing, the fear will spread among them again soon. 'Here it is America now losing billions still to make sure their country is safe. But today, it's time for payback. 'By the grace of Allah, today the mujahideen are much more stronger and they have more resources (than) before. Thus they are able to burn (the) United States again.' As well as detailing some of the group's acts of savagery, it also shows footage of the planes hitting the World Trade Centre in September 2001. Others incidents to feature in the video include the killings carried out by Amedy Coulibaly, the French-born gunman who massacred four civilians and a police officer in Paris over two days in January. It was after he was killed in a shootout with police that a video surfaced of him pledging allegiance to ISIS, while sitting in front of the group's now notorious black flag. Canadian Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's murder of corporal Nathan Cirillo, at Ottawa's Parliament Hill, is also included. As well as showing footage of ISIS militants in combat, the video shows news footage of the Twin Towers attacks . It also shows news footage which emerged in the wake of French gunman Amedy Coulibaly's deadly rampage, in which he pledged alleigance to ISIS . Another incident which featured in the propaganda video was the October 2014 attack on Ottawa's Parliament Hill . Authorities later said his attack was ISIS-inspired, although Zehaf-Bibeau was said to have mental health issues and a drug addiction. The video is not the first  in which the group threatens the U.S. In January, ISIS militants threatened to behead Barack Obama and turn the U.S. into a Muslim province in another gruesome video that emerged from their self-styled caliphate. The footage showed a black-clad jihadist standing over a Kurdish soldier who, in a sickening climax to the video, has his head cut off. Before the hostage was executed, the ISIS fighter warned the U.S. president: 'Know, oh Obama, that we will reach America. 'Know also that we will cut off your head in the White House and transform America into a Muslim province.' The video's subtitles threatened the U.S. with another 9/11-style attack and claimed its citizens were no longer safe anywhere 'on the globe'. Pictured is a still image from the video . 'America thinks it's safe because of the geographical location. 'Thus you see it invades the Muslim lands, and it thinks that the army of the Jihad won't reach in their lands. 'But the dream of the American to have safety became a mirage. Today there is no safety for any American on the globe. The mujahideen before although they had less resources, attacked New York and bombed the Twin Towers in September Eleven attacks. That blessed incursion was a fatal blow. All praise is due to Allah, the American economy was shaken. In such way Americans lived, and by Allah's willing the fear will spread among them again soon. Here it's America now losing billions still to make sure their country is safe. But today, it's time for payback. By the grace of Allah, today the mujahideen are much more stronger and they have more rescources.

"A piano teacher awaiting a jury's verdict on charges claiming he sexually assaulted an underage student has shot himself outside a New Hampshire courthouse, court officials say. Authorities say 75-year-old John Goodwin, of Atkinson, went on trial this week on six counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault. Prosecutors said that Atkinson, who pleaded not guilty, repeatedly sexually assaulted a student, who is now 24 years old, according to SeaCoastOnline. John Goodwin, 75, shot himself outside of Rockingham County Superior Courthouse on Friday morning while jurors were deliberating claims that Goodwin had sexually assaulted an underage student . The former student testified he didn't come forward until 2013 because he was embarrassed, according to WMUR. The station reports Goodwin's lawyer acknowledged his client was 'touchy-feely,' but he didn't commit a crime. Court officials say the jury was deliberating when Goodwin shot himself late Friday morning near his car in a parking lot outside Rockingham County Superior Courthouse. He wasn't in custody. Court officials say Goodwin was airlifted to a hospital with life-threatening injuries from the self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to WPTZ. His health status has not been immediately disclosed. As of Friday afternoon, jurors were still deliberating, but court officials would not say if the jurors knew about the shooting. The New Hampshire Attorney General's Office is expected to release more information about the incident Friday evening.

"A Florida community has voiced objection to plans of a forensic research 'body farm' in which human bodies will be left in Florida elements for extended periods of time. The body farm, which would be located in Lithia, is a joint project between the University of South Florida Institute of Anthropology and the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. It has the potential to offer forensic scientists and law-enforcement investigators a chance to see what happens to the bodies when they are left in Florida elements. Five to ten bodies from USF's After Life Body Donation Program would be buried or placed on two acres of the Walter C. Heinrich Practical Training Center in Lithia, which is a 230-acre plot of land bordered by a landfill and county property. Scroll down for video . University of South Florida, in a joint project with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, have proposed building a 'body farm' in Lithia for research into how Florida elements affect cadavers . If the research is approved by the Hillsborough County Commission, the information gathered at the site could help investigators solve crimes and cold cases. Hillsborough County Commissioner Stacy White has taken a stand against the facility, while state Attorney General Pam Bondi and Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee have supported the project. 'Just the reputation alone of having a quote 'body farm' in your community could have a drastic impact,' White told WFTS. 'Our perception has always been in East Hillsborough County that we get, for lack of a better term, the junk that no one else wants.' Other areas in the training center are used to teach deputies how to safely drive during chases, shoot a gun and subdue airplane hostage takers, according to the Tampa Bay Tribune. Erin Kimmerle, associate professor of anthropology at USF, said that this research could potentially help solve the more than 500 cold cases in Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties . Hillsborough County Commissioner Stacy White has taken a stand against the facility, fearing strong odors and the reputation it could bring to his community . The nearest houses are about half a mile away from the site, and officials from the sheriff's office said the bodies would be surrounded by a seven-foot fence, so no decomposing bodies would be visible to passersby or from houses. A deputy who lives at the site would provide 24-hour security for the bodies. But residents of Lithia are still reluctant to support the project. Some fear that unwanted animals might happen upon the site, including coyotes, panthers and other predators. Resident William Rayburn, whose five acres of land border the training facility, fears the bodies might bring with them an unpleasant smell. 'You say you can contain the smell, but what's it going to do when the heat gets up and the wind starts blowing and we're sitting on our porch swing we've worked hard to have in our retirement and those bodies get rancid?' Rayburn told the Tampa Tribune. 'I can smell the dump 10 miles away.' As of now, there is no timeline for the project, which has been in the works for more than a year, though it was just announced to residents a few weeks ago. Erin Kimmerle, associate professor of anthropology at USF, said that there are more than 500 cold cases in Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties, and the facility could help change that. Kimmerle said that no taxpayer money would be used to fund the project, but rather grants and donations would be used. She added that there would be no odor or affect on the soil and water in the area . 'Improving on our current methods helps solve long-term open cases and that's what this is ultimately about,' Kimmerle told the Tampa Bay Tribune. 'It's a tremendous gift to give these remains back to a family.' She added that the body farm would not draw taxpayer money and wouldn't contaminate soil or water or create an odor. It would operate solely on donations and grant funding. White told the Tampa Bay Times that a dialogue had not been engaged with 'any local officials', though Kimmerle said she's been working with the Sheriff's office since March 2014. 'How in the world would someone think people are going to react when they hear that a 'body farm' might be coming into the community? This is an ivory tower academia mind-set at its finest,' White said.","The body farm would be located in Lithia in Hillsborough County .

"This may just be the best photo-bomb ever. An adorable green sea turtle made quite the unexpected appearance in tourist Diovani de Jesus's group photo. 'We were posing at Apo Island when this sea turtle surfaced to breathe and photo-bombed,' de Jesus wrote on his blog. An adorable green sea turtle pulled off the ultimate photo-bomb, crashing this group photo in the Philippines . The shallow water in Apo Island, Negros Oriental, Philippines is a feeding ground for sea turtles, so spottings aren't uncommon. However, it is rare that one of the endangered animals would come so close - or look so intently into the camera. Posting the photo on Earth Day, de Jesus adds: 'Just like what my friend Genesis said, this is a reminder that humans and creatures like this gentle pawikan can co-exist.' This particular island is one of the world's best known community-managed marine protected areas. The turtles are traditionally found in tropical and subtropical waters, travelling long distances between feeding areas and the beaches where they are hatched.

"The mother of a baby born with deformed hands and feet in China is pleading for her husband to come home – four months after he told her he was going out to earn money for the girl's surgery. Worried Jiang Min says she has now run out of cash and can’t even afford food, let alone medical treatment, for baby Mengyu and their older daughter. She told People’s Daily Online: ‘Doctors said it’s best for Mengyu to have her operation between the age of four to six months. ‘But she is now six-and-a-half months and we simply do not have the money for her to have the operation - and her hands have started to fester.’ Desperate plight: Jiang Min. pictured with her daughter Mengyu, hasn't seen her husband for months . The family's plight has attracted the attention of local media in Binzhou City, who have cruelly compared Mengyu's webbed hands and feet to ‘pigs’ trotters’. Her father, who has not been named, left the family home in Lao Jun Tang Village in Shandong Province at the start of the year - telling them he was heading to Binzhou City to find work. He has not been heard from since. Little Mengyu's hands are severely deformed and doctors have recommended corrective surgery . Her feet are webbed, and local reporters have cruelly dubbed the deformed extremities as 'trotters' His wife phoned a restaurant where he previously worked but was told he had left his job a while ago.

She says she can't understand why she hasn't heard from her husband - pictured with her on their wedding day a decade ago . Jiang said Mengyu's father took her to a local hospital soon after she was born but its doctors told him they did not have the facilities to help. They advised him to take Mengyu to the larger Wei Fang Mou Hospital. Her parents phoned specialists there, who said Mengyu would require surgery. Her father left home shortly afterwards and the family are now in poverty. ‘Even buying milk powder is a problem for us,’ said Jiang. ‘We are so poor that my oldest daughter asked me for 5 yuan (50p) to buy books for her class the other day and I couldn't even afford that.’ She said she continued to hope that her husband would return home.","Infant's extremities have been called 'pigs' trotters' by local reporters .

"This too-close-for-comfort video shows a swirling 'landspout' tornado tearing up the Texas countryside from just 100 yards away.

He said: 'Perhaps 10 years in Iraq and Afghanistan, my danger meter needs to be recalibrated'. Landspouts - the scientific term for tornadoes which are not part of a thunderstorm - can be difficult to capture on film. The wind formations tend not to last much longer than 15 minutes, and are too small-scale to appear on weather radars. Other landspout photographs emerged Wednesday night from the area around Loraine. Various social media users posted images of a clearly-defined spout working its way through fields - though it is not clear whether that was the same spout captured in Cole's video.

"Pablo Mandado and Ilze Zebolde have no plans, no agenda, no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry – the couple simply has a dream to ‘discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time.’ And, after quitting their restaurant jobs in Manchester, the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can. Spanish Pablo, 27, and Latvian Ilze, 31, who met in Riga in 2011, are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road. In 356 days so far they’ve covered almost 7,000 miles (11,131.92km by their measurements) and been through 16 countries. Ilze Zebolde, 31, takes in her surrounds as she and Pablo Mandado take a break in their cycle journey around the world . Pablo, 27, and Ilze, 31, stop for a picture in Bosnia, one of the 16 countries they've been through since leaving London last year . Latvian Ilze sets up camp, the most common means of accommodation for her and Pablo, on the stunning Lake Bled in Slovenia . Ilze points at the winding road that she and Pablo had climb in Spain's Sierra Nevada with their 130kg of gear (including bicycles) With no plans or agenda, Ilze and Pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views, such as this from a roadside in the French Alps . In that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day, or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre. They keep costs down by relying on free accommodation, along with not needing a budget for transport – their legs have that covered. Usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp (161 nights of the 256) but also use hosting websites such as Couchsurfing (66 nights) and Warmshowers (44 nights). Sometimes, they get a good night’s sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers. Showers are ‘sometimes daily, sometimes weekly,’ admits Pablo. This leaves food as their only major expense, and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay. Ilze often stars in their images with Pablo the designated photographer, but she doesn't seem to mind after another hill climb . Pablo gives up his camera for a moment, though, as Latvian Ilze captures her Spanish boyfriend taking a rest on the road . While they often pitch their tent in stunning settings, this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through Turkey isn't one of them .

England 5.11 . Croatia 4.48 . France 4.11 . Per person, per day . When asked on their blog, TheCrazyTravel, how they can possibly live like this, Pablo answered simply. ‘Pasta, bread, rice, eggs, milk, seasonal fruits and vegetables. Often we get invited for a meal, or for some free veggies or fruits,’ he said. ‘We pick up wild fruits occasionally as well, and dumpster diving was an option in Western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin.’ Pablo and Ilze started in London before heading south-east and working their way through France, first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through Spain and Portugal. Pedal power then took them through the north of Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, Greece and into Turkey. Ilze walks with her bike while Pablo trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in Turkey, which they traversed the entire north of .

Pablo shows off the huge amount of gear he and Ilze need to carry as they work their way around the world . ‘Cycling over the bridge at the border between Greece and Turkey was symbolic,’ Pablo says. ‘Riding away from Europe, finally crossing into a different continent. Finally going further away and into the unknown.’ They traversed the entire northern coast of Turkey, before riding through Georgia and their latest destination, Armenia, and they plan to ‘continue into Asia, across the Pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the American continent.’ ‘We are going to be on the road for the following years,’ they say.","Pablo Mandado and Ilze Zebolde left London last year on a quest to explore the world on bicycles .

"This is the moment the pop star daughter of a Mexican drugs lord broke into court in the middle of the night with gun-toting bodyguards – to shoot a music video. Singer Melissa Plancarte, whose stage name is Melissa: Cartel Princess, was filmed doing her midnight flit in the Mexico's Michoacan state courthouse for her pop video 'Since You Left'. Seen by half a million fans, the clip shows glamorous pop star - one of Mexico's most beautiful women, dancing the tango at the bottom of the courthouse staircase. Scroll down for video . Break-in: Singer Melissa Plancarte is pictured dancing on the stairs inside the courthouse in her music video . Lavish lifestyle: Melissa Plancarte lives in a mansion in the town of Nueva Italia and has three pet tigers . Father: Enrique Plancarte was in charge of a drugs cartel known for hanging its victims by the neck from busy motorway bridges . And Melissa would have got away with it - had it not been for eagle eyed fans who spotted unmistakeable murals at the state capital Morelia building. Furious officials say the star didn't have permission to film at the courthouse. Supreme Court President Juan Antonio Magaña blasted: ‘It’s not possible to hire out these buildings for any price. At least not legally.' Speculating how the pop star got in, state governor Fausto Vallejo said he suspected the guards may have received bribes. Melissa's father, Enrique Plancarte, headed one of Mexico's biggest drugs cartels which was infamous for hanging its victims by the neck from motorway bridges. Plancarte made millions before he died in a shoot out with the Mexican Navy last year. He owned Melissa's record label, PlanRecords - which has just two other acts on its books - Melissa's brother and sister  Kike and Jazet. The stunning singer, who owns three pet tigers and boasts about her lavish lifestyle on Instagram, only recently admitted who her father was. She was outed in a social media campaign by Michoacan self-defence groups, who are waging a war to rid the state of drugs families. Mobster Plancarte was responsible for numerous deaths across Mexico. He headed the Knights Templar cartel, which smuggled crystal meth into the US. The mob boss was killed after a bounty of £435,000 was placed on his head by the government. His shooting sent shockwaves through the Knights Templar. ‘We knew this was going to happen but nothing can prepare you for it,' Melissa revealed after attending her father’s funeral.

She bosted of her mob roots when she posed in an outfit bearing the insignia of her father’s gang - a red cross on a white background - on Instagram. And last April, the Cartel Princess posted photos on social media from inside a property that had been seized by the Knights Templar through an illegal extortion racket. To hit back, she published a music video called ‘Me Vale’ ('I Don’t Care’) filmed in the house with her crime family. Melissa owns a large mansion in the town of Nueva Italia – the centre of Knights Templar heartland - and shares them with her three big cats, which is a  status symbol in Mexico. ‘I like them because they’re exotic and unique’, she told Mexican showbiz magazine TvNotas.

"Ben Stokes pulled his shirt across his mouth before smiling at Marlon Samuels, as if to declare a truce in their feud. There was little else for England to laugh about as the second Test stuttered towards another stalemate. England go into the last day here, just as they did in Antigua, needing eight wickets to have any chance of the victory they so badly need in this series. One of them belongs to their old nemesis Samuels who, along with the obdurate Kraigg Brathwaite, saw West Indies into credit and within sight of another draw with only the final Test in Barbados next week to play. Marlon Samuels had the chance to renew his feud with Ben Stokes but the pair buried the hatchet on a day the West Indies dominated . Joe Root leaves the field after being left stranded on 182 not out after a stunning display of batting on the fourth morning in Grenada . The 24-year-old looks dismayed following Anderson's careless mistake in between the wickets cost him a shot at a double century . England's rising star had been in imperious form as he built yet another 'daddy' hundred while wickets fell around him . Before his error, Anderson had played his part as a No 11 with intelligence, supporting Root sensibly and keeping off strike . Root plays the ball away for another boundary as West Indian captain Denesh Ramdin on his way to yet another big score . 110 . Root has a Test average of 110.1 in the last year. He has converted four of his six tons into 150s — the fourth best record in Tests . If that is a frustrating scenario for England then at least they seemed to decide on Friday there was no point in further antagonising Samuels. The eccentric Jamaican had put one over on Stokes with his salute on the third evening, and England stopped sledging and concentrated on trying to get Samuels out. So far they have failed. Alastair Cook brought Stokes back when Samuels arrived at the fall of West Indies’ second wicket, but his four-over burst failed to earn a breakthrough. The rest of England’s attack toiled, too. West Indies ended this fourth day on 202 for two, a lead of 37, with Brathwaite unbeaten on 101, and the only winner on day five looks likely to be the lifeless pitch unless England make big inroads with the second new ball. England were all out when Anderson strolled back to his wicket which led to his run out following a fine catch by Jason Holder . West Indies star Holder leaps in the air before hitting the stumps to end Root's chance of scoring 200 runs . Holder takes the bails off while Anderson makes his way to the crease without sliding his bat on the floor . Earlier, Jimmy Anderson had left Joe Root stranded with one of the doziest pieces of cricket imaginable as England threw away their chance of reaching 500. It may seem harsh to criticise a tail-ender who had hung around valiantly in a last-wicket stand of 34 as Root moved majestically to his latest ‘daddy’ hundred. Yet it beggared belief that any international player could be run out in quite such a dopey way. Root had reached 182 and been imperious as one team-mate after another got themselves out softly before the third and most frustrating run-out. Anderson was ambling back for a second run and broke the first rule of schoolboy cricket by taking his eye off the ball. He seemed convinced it was going to the other end, or that the throw would pass over the head even of the giant Jason Holder. Instead, Holder leapt to take it and had time to remove the bails with Anderson making no attempt to ground his bat. So, Anderson would have been delighted with his 387th Test wicket as he swung the ball in at Devon Smith and saw the local boy became the latest batsman to drag the ball on to his stumps on this slow pitch. It gave England a crucial early breakthrough as West Indies, 165 behind on first innings, began their attempt to bat for four of the five remaining sessions that would effectively save this Test. Yet any thoughts England had of a collapse and even a four-day victory were dashed as the match reverted to type, with wickets hard to come by on a pitch showing little sign of decline. Brathwaite is a batsman who needs little invitation to dig in and the solid Barbadian was in his element as he frustrated England in a stand of 142 with Darren Bravo that wiped off the bulk of West Indies’ deficit. It was a display of old-fashioned application that has been sadly lacking in Caribbean cricket but it was one that left Cook devoid of options. When another wicket came it was a surprise, Bravo getting a thin edge to a delivery from Stuart Broad when he had made 69. Yet with Moeen Ali looking rusty on his return, there was little mystery nor imagination in England’s attack. At least they could savour Root’s fourth score of 150 plus in his six Test hundreds. The last four have all finished unbeaten, one of them on 149. There were also four sixes as Root became the second youngest Englishman, after Cook, to reach 2,000 Test runs, an achievement that has come in 43 innings, one fewer even than Sachin Tendulkar managed it. How England needed Root at his best because after his stand of 165 with Gary Ballance had been ended on the third day, the lower middle order and tail all hurried themselves out. Root and Anderson made up as they returned to the pavilion for lunch during West Indies' second innings . Chris Jordan was one of three English batsmen run out in their second innings, despite a despairing dive to make his ground . Anderson began to make amends almost immediately when he bowled Devon Smith, off yet another inside edge on the slow wicket . Stuart Broad's woes with the bat continued, as he found a new way to get out, edging a sweep into the air without scoring . It looked like being a frustrating day all round for Broad, as the West Indies set about nullifying England's lead on a dead pitch . Broad eventually found England's second breakthrough of the day, removing Darren Bravo who edged a good delivery behind . Moeen Ali looked rusty on his return from injury, and Root's bowling was often preferred to the nominally first-choice spinner . Bravo cuts the ball through the field as the West Indian batsmen closed the gap on England quickly during the afternoon and evening . Bravo and Kraigg Brathwaite were relatively untroubled for a long period of the day, as they put on 142 for the second wicket . Jos Buttler got over-excited and was stumped, before Chris Jordan also ran himself out after showing a few glimpses of the batting quality which will surely one day earn him a Test century of his own. It was no surprise when Broad failed again as his batting has seemed in steep decline since he was hit in the face at Old Trafford last year by a ball from Varun Aaron of India, however much he tries to convince himself it is not. There was a time when Broad, who hit a brilliant hundred against Pakistan at Lord’s in 2010, looked like a genuine all-rounder but now there is even an argument that Anderson should bat above him. As long as he does not run himself out quite so soppily. England's two fast bowlers, Broad and Anderson, discuss tactics with skipper Alastair Cook as they look to take wickets . Brathwaite cuts away for more runs as the young opener made England's attack toil in the West Indian heat . Brathwaite acknowledges the crowd after reaching his half-century, and the West Indies batsman would go on to make three figures . Anderson wipes the sweat from his forehead on another difficult day for England's bowlers on a tour featuring flat pitches . Ben Stokes looks back as the ball passes him on its way to the boundary, as the West Indies retook the lead on day four . Chris Jordan appeals vociferously, but unsuccesfuly, as England found wickets hard to come by on day four .","Joe Root is left stranded on 182* after James Anderson is run out, seemingly not paying attention .

"Daniel Sturridge's status as Liverpool’s No 1 striker is under threat after Brendan Rodgers revealed his intention to sign a top forward who can “play every week”. The England international will be absent once again on Saturday at The Hawthorns, as he continues to be plagued by a hip problem and Rodgers admitted he is “unsure” as to whether Sturridge will play for Liverpool again this season. It has been a nightmare year for Liverpool in terms of goals. They had 88 after 32 matches last season but now, at the same stage, their total is 47 and not one of their players feature in the top 25 leading scorers in the Barclays Premier League. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is in danger of falling down the pecking order due to his poor injury record . Sturridge (left, pictured with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard) has played just 12 league games this season . England international Sturridge has been hampered by injuries during the course of the campaign . Sturridge has also endured a nightmare campaign. He missed five months due to calf and thigh issues and has struggled for consistency in the games he has managed to play. His length of time out has been extreme but history shows absences are not uncommon in his career. If Liverpool are to get back to where Rodgers wants them to be, they need goals. Divock Origi will arrive this summer, while they are trying to sign Danny Ings from Burnley and have registered a firm interest in PSV Eindhoven’s Memphis Depay. But they are not going to be the peak of Liverpool’s ambitions and Rodgers is searching for a proven attacker who will be able to call on consistently. When asked how many strikers he wanted to sign, Rodgers said: ‘I’m not sure but I need one that is going to be playing at a top level every week. It can make a huge difference. If you look at teams who are successful they have that – a consistent striker. ‘What that gives the rest of team is crucial. You saw it here with Suarez, the impact that kind of striker can have. But it is something that is not easy to find. We have to find a way to attract them here. We will fight hard to do in the summer. We are on course to be 60 goals down on last year.’ Sturridge picked up this latest injury on March 22 against Manchester United. England manager Roy Hodgson described it as “a small tear” after he was ruled out of games against Lithuania and Italy and it was a source of frustration to Liverpool that he missed last Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final. Liverpool boss Rodgers is keen on signing Burnley striker Danny Ings (left) and PSV's Memphis Depay (right) Belgium striker Divock Origi, pictured during his loan spell at Lille, will return to Liverpool in the summer . Rodgers was asked if he felt the stage had been reached where he no longer considers Sturridge to be his first choice striker and he said: ‘Listen, that’s entirely for you to write. He’s not fit and once he can show that consistency and fitness, you can see in his performance level that it’s a high one. ‘But he has missed lot of the season, so we need to assess it. Either way if he’ s not available, we need to have that support. There always is that risk with those type of players, with their speed and body type, but we have to hope with Daniel this year was just an unlucky season. ‘We hope he can come back super-fit and super-strong because he has an immense talent. You can’t argue with that – he can be as good as any striker in the world with his talent.’","Brendan Rodgers has stated his intent on purchasing a forward .

"Louis van Gaal expects Ryan Giggs to succeed him as Manchester United manager when the time comes. Giggs has been Van Gaal's assistant since the Dutchman took over at Old Trafford last summer. The former United midfielder had a spell in temporary charge of the 20-time English champions following the dismissal of David Moyes last season and Van Gaal believes the Welshman would be the natural choice to succeed him when he departs. Louis van Gaal expects Ryan Giggs to succeed him as Manchester United manager when he leaves the club . Giggs has a word with United captain Wayne Rooney as the Dutch manager watches on at Anfield last month . 'I expect that he (Giggs) will be the next manager after I am gone,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'Now I have the responsibility. He has tasks that he has to perform like the players. What he has to do, for me, he does it very well.' The Welshman made a record 963 appearances for United during his glittering playing career, which stretched to 25 years. The 41-year-old won a remarkable 25 trophies, including 13 Barclays Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues. Just last week Van Gaal spoke of his admiration for the former winger, admitting there was a likeness between him and his own former assistant Jose Mourinho. Van Gaal has previously likened Giggs to his own former assistant - now Chelsea manager - Jose Mourinho . Giggs and Van Gaal sit side-by-side on the United bench, and the Dutch coach trusts his assistant a lot . 'I have to admit, I could not imagine when I spoke with him in May, that he would work so very hard,' Van Gaal said at a press conference on the eve of United's defeat to Mourinho's Chelsea. 'As an ex-player, you are not used to working hard. He is a very hard worker. 'He reads the game very good, like Jose. But to manage a group you have to learn. What I can see is that he is also learning quickly.' Giggs described taking charge of United for four games last year as 'the proudest moment of my life'. Giggs described taking charge of United for four games last year as 'the proudest moment of my life' The former Wales international took charge of matches against Nowich, Sunderland, Hull and Southampton . The former Wales international added: 'I have supported Manchester United all my life, I have been a part of the club since I was 13. I am proud, I am happy, a little nervous.' Giggs was given a near-deafening reception when he walked down the touchline and took his place in the home dugout at Old Trafford prior to his first match - a 4-0 win over Norwich. He was brought back down to earth a week later when his team lost at home to Sunderland, but United bounced back with victory over Hull and rounded off their season with a 1-1 draw at Southampton.

"Britt McHenry is back to work. The disgraced ESPN sports reporter has been suspended for a week since footage emerged showing her unleash a vicious verbal attack on a single mother-of-three at a towing firm. Her car had been towed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Virginia, where she left it overnight on Easter Weekend. When she picked it up, infuriated, she resorted to insulting the employee's looks, intelligence, and social status. But despite viewers' calls for harsher punishment, the network has reinstated the 28-year-old to her role with a spot on SportsCenter this weekend. Confirming the news to Sports Illustrated, senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said: 'She knows she made a mistake. She’s owned up to it. I think she is just really anxious to get back to work.' Scroll down for video . She's back! Britt McHenry (left) has been reinstated as an ESPN sports reporter after being filmed attacking tow clerk Gina Michelle (right) for her looks and social status in a video the sparked mass outrage . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry was suspended for one week after the April 6 video surfaced . Markman insisted 'she has a lot of potential as a reporter', adding, 'she is young, she’s learning some things, but I really do believe in her.' He continued: 'We had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard. She knows that, and especially at the beginning. 'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn’t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office, where clerk Gina Michelle was stood behind the counter. 'I’m in the news, sweetheart, I will f*****g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying  in the video. Michelle can be heard warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding: 'That’s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . Warning: Since Britt McHenry's outburst, this sign has been placed on the door of the Chinese restaurant . Scene of the tirade: This is the towing yard in Arlington, VA, where McHenry's abusive rant happened . Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money… with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Although she issued an apology on Twitter, the sportscaster did not approach Michelle directly. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further . At first, McHenry tweeted insisting she had been in the right. But that post was deleted within hours. Employees at the beer hall-cum-Chinese-restaurant Hunan Number One told Daily Mail Online the sports reporter left her car in the parking lot overnight despite clear signs on the door that cars will be towed, warning bar-goers that the restaurant would not be responsible 'if your car is towed from the parking lot'. The venue, which features 'happy hour' from 11am until 9pm, was described by enthusiastic patrons as a prime 'pre-game' spot and online reviewers as a beloved dive bar. Hunan Number One, offers sushi, hot-wings and other bar food, along with 32oz draft beers for around $8, five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine, served up in front of big screen TVs playing sports. When the bar shuts at 2am, the private towing company, Advanced Towing, within minutes began removing cars in concurrence with a rule on the private lot. The firm showed magnanimity, saying it did not want McHenry to suffer. In a statement Advanced Towing said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature. At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry. 'As a small regulated business, we saw no benefit to releasing the video, except to highlight personal attacks employees in jobs like towing, public parking enforcement and others sometimes encounter.

"A morbidly obese man who piled on the pounds thanks to a twice-daily takeaway habit and 'hated leaving the house' because of his looks has lost 19st in just one year. David Rush, 33, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, felt that he 'shouldn't go out' because of his size but lost the weight after plucking up the courage to start cycling. At his heaviest, he weighed 34st and was forced to order specialist XXXXXL clothes on the internet - the result of topping up his takeaway-heavy diet with six bags of crisps and two bottles of full-fat Coca-Cola a day. Shedding the pounds: David Rush, 33, used to weigh 34st but has shed an incredible 19st in just one year . Super slimmer: Mr Rush now weighs a slimline 15st 4lbs - down from 34st at his heaviest (right) Embarrassed by his size and afraid of cruel comments or being forced to squeeze past people, Mr Rush says he never left the house - and never had a girlfriend. 'I hated leaving the house and going out anywhere because I didn't know if the places I would be going to were tight for space,' he explains. 'I was that big it made me feel like I shouldn't be out. My eating was awful - I would have takeaways every night for my dinner and eat junk all through the day.' But when his weight began to prevent him from walking easily, he decided to take action and ditched the takeaways in favour of a healthy meal plan. Mr Rush, who now weighs a healthy 15st 4lbs, began shedding the pounds at the rate of a stone a week but, determined to speed up the process, took up cycling. Overindulging: Mr Rush's old diet consisted of twice-daily takeaways topped up with six bags of crisps . Mobility: He plucked up the courage to make a change after having problems walking around . He combined bike rides with 10 mile jogs and vigorous gym workouts and as a result, managed to shed a substantial 18st 10lb in just one year. A newly slimline Mr Rush says he now feels confident enough to ask women on dates and is training for a half-marathon and a 115-mile charity bike ride. 'Since my weight loss my life has changed so much,' he enthuses. 'I started off with walking but once I started to cycle the weight just came off and I was able to join the gym. 'I've got my social life back, I'm out with my friends and I've got myself a new small car I can fit into.' Mr Rush says he has always been big but really began piling on the pounds in his twenties after moving out of his parents' home. Unhealthy habits swiftly crept in, with Mr Rush frequently eating crisps for breakfast and takeaways for lunch and dinner.

Breakfast - Porridge or natural yoghurt with branflakes and fruit . Lunch - Cous cous with chicken breast and vegetables . Dinner - Fruit and yoghurt . Snacks - Fibre bars or fruit . Enjoying himself: Mr Rush, in the red jacket on the left, cycles up to 85 miles a week . All that changed when his mother Margaret began suffering from heart problems, which, combined with Mr Rush' own mobility issues, provided the wake-up call he needed. Determined to beat the bulge, he joined Slimming World and gave his diet a makeover, eating healthy porridge for breakfast and snacking on fruit and yoghurt. Mr Rush, who works in a storage unit facility, is now saving up for cosmetic surgery because he still has more than a stone of excess skin that he can't shift. 'It really gets me down,' he admits. 'I've lost all this weight and I'm still wearing baggy clothes cause I don't feel confident . 'It does get me down but at the same time I'm really happy with myself for what I have achieved on my own with no help.

"According to a woman who is apparently against the preachings of Andrew Caldwell, the St. Louis man got his just desserts. The 21-year-old became somewhat infamous late last year for video of him screaming 'I don't like mens no more - I like women, women, women!' after a pastor at an evangelical megachurch claimed to have cured his homosexuality. Caldwell hit headlines in November after the footage surfaced of him being 'delivered' by God. But he says he was attacked by an employee at a FroYo in Delmar on Wednesday after the cashier recognized him. He ended up completely doused in his own dessert at the counter. 'I filled (the bowl) all the way up to the top - I had some Kit Kats, I had some Reese's on it,' Caldwell told STL Today. 'It was all all in my face, on my clothes, in my shoes.'

However Diaz said he demanded a discount and called her a 'dog' Heated confrontation over frozen yogurt: Caldwell was covered in FroYo, and said his bowl was extra large . Megachurch star: Andrew Caldwell in a still from a video of him speaking during a Church of God in Christ Convention in St. Louis last year, where he infamously said he 'don't like mens no more' Caldwell claims the employee recognized him from his video at the Church of God in Christ's 107th Holy Convocation. He said the woman called him a gay slur, said that it was impossible for God to 'turn' gay people straight, and then picked up the extra large bowl from the scale at the counter and aggressively threw it in Caldwell's face, according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. However the employee, Stephanie Diaz, says Caldwell is a liar. In an interview with the same TV station, Diaz said Caldwell demanded a discount for his yogurt. When she didn't relent, he called her a 'dog' and a 'b----', Diaz said. Diaz, who is openly gay, said it had nothing to do with the viral video. 'I threw the ice cream at him,' she said outside of the store Thursday. 'He called me a dog. … I lost it.' 'I lost it': Stephanie Diaz, who is openly gay, admits to throwing the yogurt at Caldwell, but said he is lying about his story . Scene: The incident occurred Wednesday at his FroYo store in Delmar, St.Louis . Comfortably straight: Andrew Caldwell, seen here in a recent photo from his Facebook page, happily announced last year that God had cured his homosexuality and that he had been 'delivered' CCTV footage released of the incident shows Caldwell throwing money at Diaz. That is when Diaz throws the yogurt. The FroYo store released the footage to show Caldwell was lying. Diaz said she had never seen the church video or heard of Caldwell. She has been charged with third-degree assault. However Diaz has not been fired. FroYo have said any punishment that should occur from the incident will be handled internally. Stylish: Caldwell is pictured here dressed in head-to-toe designer clothing on his Facebook page . Caldwell says he is considering suing Diaz and FroYo. In he video of Caldwell being 'delivered' that went viral, he announces into the microphone: 'I’m not gay no more! I am delivered! I don’t like mens no more! I said I like women! Women, women, women! I said women! I’m not gay! I will not date a man! I will not carry a purse! I will not put on makeup! I will love a woman.' The megachurch audience can be heard screaming and cheering in the background, congratulating Caldwell on no longer being gay. The pastor then hands him $100, saying the Lord told him to. After the video spread, Caldwell - who was extravagantly dressed in a paisley suit, purple shirt and mustard bow tie - did a series of interviews, where he said he meant what he said, but was unhappy the video became so popular. He said he did not want to get in front of the church to begin with, but believes his homosexuality no longer exists .","Andrew Caldwell, 21, went viral in November after footage from a St. Louis megachurch showed him screaming 'I don't like mens no more'

"Sunderland have been branded ‘disgraceful’ following their shock decision not to suspend Adam Johnson despite the player facing child sex charges. The 27-year-old has been charged with three offences of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl and one of grooming and could face a prison term of up to 14 years if found guilty. But Sunderland — just one point above the Premier League relegation zone — announced on Friday that Johnson will remain available for selection and he is set to feature at Stoke. Sunderland midfielder Adam Johnson leaves Peterlee police station on Thursday after being charged . The 27-year-old has not been suspended by his club Sunderland despite the child sex charges .

The fact the football club aren’t doing so sends a very poor message. 'Most of the clubs put money ahead of morality and I think it is disgraceful because it just sends a message out to people that, actually, all they’re interested in is their results, all they’re interested in is winning.’ However, Jim Gilling, secretary of the Coxhoe Supporters’ Group, believes Johnson should be free to play. ‘It’s the right decision,’ he said. ‘We have to remember he is not guilty of anything yet. ‘But the club have left their decision open and it may well be that they reverse it should circumstances change.’ Manager Dick Advocaat supports the club’s stance and admits Johnson is ‘an important player’ as they fight relegation. But many fans are concerned that the decision has been taken on footballing grounds given the threat to their top-flight status. Steve Dean, secretary of the SAFC Liaison Group, told Sportsmail: ‘I am very surprised the club did not suspend him. ‘Going out of the Premier League would cost the club millions of pounds and that is often the first consideration these days.

He’s going to get hammered.’ Advocaat was not consulted over the issue. He will decide whether Johnson is in the right frame of mind to start on Saturday.

"Manchester United have identified Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan as the leading contender to fill Michael Carrick's midfield role. United are eyeing a £20.5million deal for the central midfielder, and reports emanating from Germany on Friday indicated a deal is now close - though those claims were later denied. United will seek to sign Carrick's successor this summer as part of another huge spending frenzy. Manchester United are closing in on a deal to sign Borussia Dortmund ace Ilkay Gundogan . Gundogan vies for the ball with Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal in the Champions League . Dortmund's ball-playing midfielder Gundogan has been watched extensively by United and has emerged as their primary target. Van Gaal has an intrinsic knowledge of the Bundesliga and believes the 24-year-old has the ability to take over from Carrick on a long-term basis. Carrick, who recently signed a new 12 month extension, will continue to be part of Van Gaal's plans next season - but the club are planning for life without him. Louis van Gaal believes the midfielder is the perfect replacement for current midfielder Michael Carrick . Van Gaal has been hugely impressed with Carrick's contribution at Old Trafford this season. The England international's passing range and ability to dictate the pace of a match has been a key feature for United this season. But at the age of 33, the Dutchman knows the midfielder is in the twilight of his career, while the amount of time Carrick has spent injured this season is also a worry.

"Wladimir Klitschko has recalled his dramatic rise to the top on the eve of his world title defence against undefeated Bryant Jennings. The Ukrainian superstar will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years when he takes on the slick Philadelphian at the iconic Madison Square Garden in New York. The 39-year-old Klitschko, though, has been reminiscing about how it all started for him when he won Olympic gold in Atlanta in 1996, instantly catapulting him into a hero in his home country over night. Reigning heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko (right) faces up to Bryant Jennings on Friday . 'I remember before I went to the Olympics and former Olympic champion in track running, [Valeriy] Borzov, he was Minister of Sports in the Ukraine said, 'Guys, you're going to the Olympics and one of you is going to win gold. That's going to change your life.' 'He was really right about it. I remember by winning the gold at the Olympics, when I came back home it completely changed my life. 'Sport definitely has power to change one's life and the world, as Nelson Mandela said. When I became champion of the world in the heavyweight division, that was 15 years ago, in 2000, and it was an amazing moment. Klitschko poses on the scale for the official weigh-in at Madison Square Garden in New York on Friday . 'I do remember clearly how it was and it was additional motivation to keep doing what I was doing. I was only 24-years-old. I mean, very, very young, but I took it seriously and I was working up to it and I believed that my work was appreciated with my success in the ring and that I became champion.' WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion Klitschko hasn't shown any signs of decline in recent times despite being just a year short of his 40th birthday. Still dominant and sitting high at the top of boxing's glamour division Klitschko believes age has no bearing on how long he can go on for. Klitschko will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years at Madison Square Garden . 'I definitely think that age is just a number. Actually, it's a big advantage instead of disadvantage because with the age you're getting better. With the right lifestyle there's nothing that can go wrong,' he added. 'I'm really happy about the preparation [for this training camp] and I'm happy that I'm an athlete and I can get in the peak of my performance thanks to my experience. I'm looking forward to Saturday night. 'My sparring partners were 23, 25, 27, 29-years-old. It's amazing and interesting that considering my age, I used to be the youngest in the gym all the time, and now it seems my sparring partners are much younger than me. I see myself in them and we work very well. Former heaxyweight boxing champions Evander Holyfield (left) and Lennox Lewis were in attendance . Jennings, with a record of 19-0 with 10 knockouts, has been working on ways to nullify the well renowned Klitschko jab which he has utilised so effectively against past opponents. 'He has a great jab but I have an exceptional jab compared to his as well. He is one of the best athletes I've seen for that,' he said. 'There are definitely plenty of ways to actually get inside of a jab. Like lateral movement, head movement and relentless effort will definitely penetrate and make a change. 'I have 100 per cent confidence in everything that I do. I had a great training camp. The way that we actually prepare to manoeuvre around the jab, I feel is effective and I have 100 per cent faith in what we practiced. All I'm going to have to be is patient and be smart.'

"Manchester United have offered to make David de Gea the world’s best-paid goalkeeper on £200,000-a-week to keep him at Old Trafford. Fears are growing at United that De Gea will return to Spain and join Real Madrid on a free transfer when his contract runs out next summer. So far there has been no breakthrough in negotiations and manager Louis Van Gaal admitted yesterday that the club have made De Gea a huge offer to persuade him to stay. Manchester United have offered goalkeeper David de Gea £200,000-a-week to stay at the club . There has been speculation that the 24-year-old will move back to Spain to join Real Madrid this summer . ‘We have offered him a lot of money,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It takes a long time now. So it can always happen. I want him to stay but I am not the boss. The player is the boss, he can say yes or no. You will have to ask David De Gea not me. He has to sign.’ United’s offer of £180,000-a-week plus bonuses would eclipse the salaries of Manchester City’s England international Joe Hart, Gianluigi Buffon at Juventus, Bayern Munich keeper Manuel Neuer and Real Madrid’s Iker Casillas. But the feeling inside the Old Trafford dressing-room is that De Gea will leave to replace Casillas at the Bernabeu next summer, five years after joining United from Atletico Madrid for £17.8m. Having overcome a difficult start in English football, the 24-year-old Spaniard has been United’s most outstanding performer this season and was nominated for PFA Player of the Year earlier this month. United would demand £30m if Real try to sign him this summer and Van Gaal has already prepared for the prospect of De Gea leaving as a free agent next year by bringing in former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes. Louis van Gaal admitted, during his press conference on Friday, that De Gea has been offered 'a lot of money' If De Gea moves to Real Madrid, it is likely he will be a replacement for Iker Casillas .","David de Gea has been linked with a move to Real Madrid in the summer .

"Manchester City wanted Isco when he left Malaga two years ago but he chose Real Madrid over Manuel Pellegrini. It was a tough decision coming after his admission that the coach he had worked with on the Costa del Sol was like a footballing father to him. Judging from comments made after Real’s midweek win over Atletico Madrid, he still harbours some regrets over that decision to not follow the manager who really gave him his big chance. Pellegrini allowed him to star in the Champions League campaign that took Malaga all the way to the quarter-finals, where they felt only refereeing incompetence prevented them reaching the semis. ‘I am not very content, I thought I was playing well,’ was his message to Spanish television on Wednesday night after the win over Atletico. It was strange sentiment to convey with so much positivity around the club after their safe passage to the semi-finals. Spanish midfielder Isco is unhappy with his current role and playing time at Real Madrid . Isco rarely starts for Real Madrid when all of Carlo Ancelotti's main options are fit . He later tweeted: 'If we all stick together we will go further.' The show of solidarity was an attempt to gloss over the gut reaction after the match that revealed his sense of injustice at always being the player who sits out when everyone else is fit. Carlo Ancelotti’s first choice front three is Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema and his preferred midfield is Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez. Isco is the seventh man in that front six. And if Ancelotti persists with Sergio Ramos in midfield in Modric’s absence, Isco could even sit back on the bench when Bale returns. If Pellegrini stays at City and Isco remains unhappy about how he only fits in at Real Madrid when there are injuries, the Premier League could appear on his horizon again. Isco joined Real Madrid from another La Liga side Malaga in the summer of 2013 . The 23-year-old had a choice of Real Madrid or Manchester City, and chose the Spanish giants . It would be too much to ask him to fill Yaya Toure’s boots. Toure's great strength is the way that huge stride of his takes him up and down the pitch so quickly. Isco is more Smart Car than juggernaut and he tends to scurry more than maraud. He would have to play as City's No 10, he wouldn't be able to drop back into the middle two as Toure can. But at just 23 years of age, he also happens to be the player Vicente del Bosque intends to build his new Spain team around. He’s also the player the Real Madrid supporters adore perhaps more than any other, and he would be on the same wavelength as David Silva, who needs a like-minded player in a City team that has put brawn over brains with recent midfield signings. Isco is one of Spain's new generation and Vicente del Bosque is looking to build the team around him . Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini worked with Isco during their time at Malaga . Isco could still play a big part in what is left of Real Madrid’s season but with the European Championship on the horizon at the end of next season he will not want to have spent the previous campaign on the bench watching Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo, Kroos, Modric, Rodriguez and whoever else Florentino Perez signs this summer. It would be interesting to see his response if he was asked for the second time in his career – do you want to come to Manchester City?","Isco unhappy with his role at Real Madrid .

"Arsene Wenger insists he isn’t haunted by his decision to back out of signing Eden Hazard in 2012 – even if he does accept the Chelsea attacker is getting better every year. It might prove to be a stunning oversight on Wenger’s part, having pulled out of a deal to sign the 24-year-old from Lille. Talks got to such an advanced stage that Hazard’s agent discussed the move with Wenger in the Arsenal manager’s house, but the Frenchman ultimately ruled he could not compete financially with Chelsea, who landed this season’s standout player for £32million. Eden Hazard joined Chelsea for £32million in 2012, an amount Arsenal could not afford to fork out . Hazard, who has had a standout season for Chelsea, even discussed terms in Arsene Wenger's house . Belgium star Hazard joined Chelsea in May 2012 after impressing in Ligue 1 for French side Lille . That is looking like a tremendous bargain as Chelsea close in on the title, but Wenger said: ‘I have no big regrets because - at the time - there was so much financially, so much money involved we could not afford it. And (I could) not defend it, honestly. ‘It was linked with all the environment. It was not feasible for us financially.’ Hazard is the frontrunner to be named player of the season after a stunning campaign. Going into Sunday’s clash at Arsenal, he has scored 18 and assisted 10 goals in only 43 starts. Wenger believes the gong will be a shootout between Hazard and Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez. He said: ‘It’s very close. Let’s not forget that for Eden Hazard it is not the first season but for Alexis Sanchez it is. So he will give him a fight and if Alexis doesn’t make it this year, he will give him a fight as well for next season. ‘I think everybody would agree Hazard had a great season. He has found maturity that he did not have before. I believe his final ball is better, his personality on the pitch is stronger, the finishing aspect of his game is much better than before. ‘He can turn games when it’s 0-0 and when it’s tight. That’s always a sign of top quality.’ Wenger insists that his forward Alexis Sanchez (centre) will run Hazard close in the Player of the Year vote .

"Jose Mourinho relishes the pre-match press conference. For the Chelsea manager, it's where the game begins, especially ahead of a match like Sunday's at Arsenal, where his side could move three points away from securing the Premier League with a victory. It was a surprise, therefore, to see him stumped at a question posed to him at the end of his media conference on Friday. Rarely, if ever, does the Portuguese coach not know what to say. But after going to great lengths to insist there are 'no problems' with Arsene Wenger after the pair clashed on the sidelines at Stamford Bridge last season, Mourinho was stumped by the question that followed. Jose Mourinho was visibly surprised by a question he was asked at his Chelsea press conference . He was asked how hard Arsene Wenger pushed him, referring both to the title race and their clash last year . Mourinho praised the 'top question' before composing himself and giving an equally ambiguous answer . Wenger (left) pushed Mourinho when Chelsea beat Arsenal 6-0 at Stamford Bridge last season . Sport analysts BSports are predicting a tight match, with Arsenal slight favourites to beat Chelsea . 'Jose, you said you've been pushed very hard this season, how hard did Arsene Wenger push you?' Mourinho burst into laughter, covered his mouth in shock before turning to Chelsea's media officer, swearing and saying 'it deserves a proper answer.' He eventually regained composure, before marvellously disguising his opinion in a deliberately transparent manner. 'It is a top question, top question... but because I am always honest in my answers, I cannot answer you,' Mourinho replied, cunningly.","Jose Mourinho was speaking ahead of Chelsea's visit to Arsenal .
