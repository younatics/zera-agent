"One of the less celebrated aspects of Richie Benaud’s remarkable career were his regular appearances in that part of the press box which houses the written journalists. Benaud was first and foremost a television broadcaster, a man of unusually wry wit who once responded on air to colleague Chris Broad’s malapropism (‘Honestly, you run out of expletives when describing the fielding of Jonty Rhodes’) without skipping a beat: ‘Which particular one did you have in mind?’ But Benaud also penned a regular column for the News of the World, taking his place among the hacks – not all TV men take the trouble – to craft his copy whenever a Test match was going on. Richie Benaud, pictured  in January 2013, has died  at the age of 84 after a battle with skin cancer . Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Tributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing . It was said he would regularly file 700 or 800 words, of which maybe 150 or 200 would see the light of day. But, a professional to his core, Benaud kept on filing. He loved cricket, and he loved conveying his love, by visual means or verbal. That much was evident during his playing days. He won 63 Test caps between January 1952 and February 1964, collecting 248 wickets with his leg-spin (at a very good average of 27) and scoring 2,201 runs at 24. But it was the style as much as the stats. It was often an understated era, typified by Jim Laker’s steadfast refusal to celebrate any of the 19 wickets he took against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956 (Benaud c Statham b Laker 0; Benaud b Laker 18). Benaud did his best to change all that. Sport was fun, emotional and human: if he got a wicket, he’d do more than hitch his trousers up, Laker-style. He’d whoop and skip and jump: take a look on YouTube at him enjoying Bob Simpson’s slip catch at Old Trafford in 1961, where his leg-breaks spirited Australia to a come-from-behind win. These days players go further than that. But Benaud was their spiritual forefather. He loved not just cricket, but cricketers too. Not everyone was enamoured by his involvement in Kerry Packer’s rebellious World Series Cricket in the late 1970s. But WSC eventually forced the Establishment’s hand. Cricketers were soon paid a living wage, not the honorariums they had previously endured. Benaud’s involvement and influence were central to that. It was as a TV commentator that Benaud came into his own. When Wisden asked him in 2003 to dispense some advice to aspiring broadcasters, he suggested: ‘Put your brain into gear before opening your mouth.’ That style – laconic, considered, dry – would become his hallmark, together with an unfailing greeting: ‘Good morning, everyone.’ When Benaud welcomed viewers, they were able to relax: the cricket was about to begin. There were times when you might have longed for him to express himself more trenchantly, to air his opinions more clearly. Surely, you wondered, he must have felt strongly about subjects other than the front-foot no-ball law. But it was not his style – and he remained true to himself. ‘Above all,’ he told Wisden, ‘when commentating, don’t take yourself too seriously, and have fun.’ Benaud was Australia captain and  the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . After his playing career, Benaud forged an incredibly successful career as a cricket commentator . Benaud (right) in discussion with England's Michael Vaughan ahead of a Test match in 2004 . That last tip has been cheerfully taken on board by the current generation of Channel Nine commentators in Australia. And if they have been less adept at putting their brains into gear before opening their mouths, then that also reflects the almost impossibly high standards set by Benaud himself. His successors were always going to pale by comparison. Behind it all was a quiet, imposing strength. The first time I met him, Benaud almost broke my fingers with his handshake. As a friend noted: ‘You don’t get to captain Australia with a limp wrist.’ Good night, everyone.","Richie Benaud has died at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer .

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.","Man United beat Man City 1-0 in Saturday's under 18 encounter .

'Submissions and evidence were also presented by the tournament disciplinary officer. 'In upholding the citing complaint, the judicial officer determined that the offence was reckless and warranted a red card, and that it was at the low end (two weeks) of World Rugby's sanctions for offences of this nature. 'There were no aggravating factors, and he reduced the suspension by the maximum amount of one week due to the player's guilty plea, early expression of remorse, good conduct during the hearing and clean disciplinary record.'

"He played in 64 Tests as a leg-spinning all-rounder and captained Australia to world dominance in the 1950s but to millions of fans Richie Benaud, who died last night aged 84, was the voice of cricket. The great commentator, who had been receiving treatment for skin cancer since November, began broadcasting for the BBC while still a player in 1963 and carried on until a car crash forced him out of the commentary box in 2013. It was hoped he would still be able to commentate on the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand earlier this year but ill-health sadly ended hopes of one last masterclass. Richie Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Benaud was the voice of cricket for generations, commentating in his native Australia and for the BBC . Benaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his time as Australia captain . Benaud, quite simply, was the voice of summer, both in his native land and in England, as much for what he did not say as what he did. Always understated, Benaud knew when to let the pictures do the talking before entering our living rooms with just the right words. He took 248 Test wickets and hit 2,201 runs, with three centuries, and reclaimed the Ashes for Australia as captain before successfully defending them twice. His commentary rules should be required reading for anyone entering the commentary box today. They included these: never ask a statement; there are no teams in the world called we or they; avoid cliches and banalities; remember that the Titanic was a tragedy and the Ethiopian drought a disaster and neither bears any relation to a dropped catch and, most importantly, don’t take yourself too seriously and have some fun.

Summer 1963: First television commentary for BBC . February 1964: Final Test against South Africa at Sydney Cricket Ground . September 2005: Final commentary in England after 42 years . In becoming one of the leading figures of Kerry Packer’s World Series revolution in the 1970s Benaud gave the fledgling breakaway group the voice of authority they required. Yet any suggestion of his being anti-establishment has long since been forgotten and the leading figures in Australian cricket and life queued up to pay tribute to arguably the most famous Aussie of them all last night. ‘There would hardly be an Australian over the last 40 years who hasn’t listened to Richie Benaud,’ said Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and that could also apply to English men and women. ‘He certainly will be very, very much missed.’ Today Abbott offered Benaud's family a state funeral for him, if they wish it. Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said: ‘Our country has lost a national treasure. After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous or more influential than Richie Benaud.’ Benaud never lost the ability to say absolutely the right thing and that was never more in evidence than in what will go down as his last significant public words. An evocative 30 second tribute to the late Phillip Hughes was prepared for Channel Nine by Benaud when, as ever, he captured the mood perfectly. Benaud (front left) leads Australia off at Old Trafford in 1961 as England collapsed against his side's spin . Benaud, pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book My Take on Cricket, was widely respected and loved . Benaud pays tribute to Australian media mogul and cricket pioneer Kerry Packer after his death in 2005 . 'A boy just beginning, 25 years of age, baggy green number 408,' read Benaud in what were still his unmistakable tones when the cricket world had to endure what really was a tragedy with the death of a young player at the SCG. 'His father's best mate, son, brother, fighter, friend, inspiration. Phillip Hughes, forever rest in peace son.' The whole cricketing world will be echoing those sentiments for the greatest commentator of them all. Richie Benaud, who was made an OBE in 1961 for services to cricket, left a wife of 48 years in Daphne and two children from his first marriage. He will forever set the standards for others to follow. Tributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing aged 84 . ON COMMENTATING . 'What I want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that, when I say something, I am talking to friends.' 'My mantra is: put your brain into gear and if you can add to what's on the screen then do it, otherwise shut up.' 'The key thing was to learn the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see.' 'Out in the field, you haven't got anyone whispering into your ear saying all sorts of things, you've got to do it yourself.' ON CAPTAINCY . 'The hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss, at the right time.' 'Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don't try it without that 10 per cent.' ON BATTING . 'Bruce Reid is not the worst batsman there is at international level but those who are worse would not need to hire the Myer Music Bowl to hold a convention.' 'Glenn McGrath dismissed for two, just ninety-eight runs short of his century.' 'He's not quite got hold of that one. If he had, it would have gone for nine.' ON BOWLING . 'A bleeding ring finger at the end of every training session was not only normal but essential for my development as a wrist spinner.' 'Your wrist must be cocked, but not stiffly cocked.' 'You must always look where you want to land it. If I offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can, you'd never take your eyes off it.' ON TWENTY20 CRICKET . 'If any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it's great for the sport. I think it's wonderful.' 'As long as the people who run the game have brains and keep three forms of the game I think it will be terrific.' ON SHANE WARNE'S 'BALL OF THE CENTURY . 'Gatting has absolutely no idea what has happened to it. Still doesn't know.' ON 1981's 'UNDERARM BOWLING' SCANDAL . 'A disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong. It should never be permitted to happen again. One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field.' MISCELLANEOUS . 'The slow-motion replay doesn't show how fast the ball was really travelling.' 'A cricket ground is a flat piece of earth with some buildings around it.'

"Richie Benaud has passed away  at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer but the man who spoke with an unrivalled blend of insight, authority and wit from commentary boxes at cricket matches across the globe will always be remembered. Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer . 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY . Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL . Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND . Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER . Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES . Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL . Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR . Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM . Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.","Richie Benaud died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer .

The uncapped Wasps centre, 22, scored two tries in March as the Coventry-based club maintained on course for a Champions Cup spot next season. Equally comfortable at full back, Daly's form at centre has him pushing incumbent England No 13 Jonathan Joseph hard for his place. Elliot Daly is handed his player of the month award by Wasps director of rugby Dai Young . He looks certain to be included in Stuart Lancaster's England's World Cup training squad named next month. Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said: 'If England are going to go out and win the Rugby World Cup, he’s the type of player you’ve got to have in the team so I’d certainly like to think he’s pushing for a place in the squad.' BT Sport analyst Austin Healey added: 'For a good couple of years now us rugby watchers have known of the potential of Elliot Daly. Daly is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring a try against Saracens at the Ricoh Arena . 'Over the last few months we have seen him realise it and perhaps with plenty still to come.' A talented sportsman educated at Whitgift School in Croydon - who also produced England internationals Danny Cipriani and Marland Yarde - Daly was offered a contract with Surrey Cricket before opting for a career in rugby.

Faulkner will join up with the county side following his Indian Premier League commitments . 'While he is better known at the moment for his performances in white ball cricket his record in first-class cricket is fantastic.

"Michael Vaughan has confirmed that he has held talks with the ECB over becoming England’s new supremo as the governing body’s new regime move closer to replacing Paul Downton. The 2005 Ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three-man shortlist compiled by the ECB at Thursday’s management board meeting ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart, who have both registered their interest. Vaughan spoke with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman-elect Colin Graves at Yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket . Vaughan spoke to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No 1 choice . Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday . ‘I had a good chat with Tom which was just about general stuff,’ said Vaughan. ‘We had a one-hour conversation. I have not got a clue what the role is, what the parameters are or what they are looking for. ‘It was the first time I have met him since he was made chief executive because I’ve been away at the World Cup. I knew him from his IMG days and back in the day when he played for Derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time,’ Vaughan told the Daily Telegraph. ‘It was just a chance to meet up and have a chat and try to kick around a few ideas. It was away from England stuff. It was about the game, the structure and Twenty20. Everything. ‘I like the way he works and his vision for the game and he and Colin Graves will be the perfect partnership. But nothing has changed as far as I’m concerned. I am keen to talk to them when I understand more about the role and what skills are required. 'There will be many others, really good guys, keen to talk who are the type of guys needed to move English cricket forward. ‘I am certainly not in a position to be anywhere near being appointed because I don’t know what the job is. Until we know what it entails I, like all the other candidates, have to look at it and see whether it is for me.’ Former England stars Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators . Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role . That may be so but the ECB are keen to make a quick appointment and Vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Peter Moores, who is preparing to coach England in their Test series here in the Caribbean, said on Thursday he could work with Vaughan even though the pair had an uneasy relationship when they were captain and coach in 2007. Vaughan has also been a strong critic of Moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests Vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment. ‘I am loving my job at the moment,’ said Vaughan. ‘I really enjoy the media work and I am now looking forward to getting to the West Indies to watch England win a series they should win and continue where they left off in Test cricket against India last year.’ It will be fascinating to watch Vaughan commentate for BBC’s Test Match Special on a team he may well soon be in charge of. England coach Peter Moores has said he could work with Vaughan despite their uneasy relationship . Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket .

REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out.

SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer.

"Toby Alderweireld is ignoring the background noise about his future, such is the on-loan defender's determination to complete Southampton's 'special season' by securing European qualification. Eyebrows were raised last summer when the 26-year-old moved to St Mary's on a season-long loan, just months after playing for Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final. Alderweireld's form on the south coast has attracted interest from the likes of Manchester City and Tottenham, but Ronald Koeman's side have the option to make the deal permanent for just £6.8million. Toby Alderweireld has been in superb form this season at Southampton since joining on loan from Atletico . The Belgium international has expressed a desire to stay at Saints, but the waters are muddied by Atletico's ability to nullify the buy-out clause by paying them £1.5million. Jose Luis Perez Caminero recently indicated the Primera Division club would invoke that clause, saying Diego Simeone's men were counting on him for next term, but Alderweireld is unclear whether he will be at St Mary's, the Vicente Calderon or elsewhere. 'I saw something in the Spanish papers,' said Alderweireld. 'I don't know, I didn't hear from them. We will see. 'It is not (frustrating) because it does not matter what they say, what is in the papers. 'I am just focused on Southampton and we are playing for a European spot, so it is going to be a special season. 'I am focused, I am happy here, so, yeah, no problem for me.' Alderweireld has been one of Southampton's best players in a remarkable season. Many predicted a relegation battle for Koeman's men, yet Saturday's 2-0 win against Hull saw them equal the record Premier League points tally of 56 set last year. Last season Alderweireld was playing in the Champions League final for his parent club, and he could return . 'It is has been a very nice season,' Alderweireld said. 'We like to play football, we have a good team and we have good results. 'We are playing for the European spots so I am happy.' The win over Hull was unconvincing but gave Southampton's faint top-four hopes a boost. Bettering the fifth place of 1985 looks a big ask but not impossible after James Ward-Prowse's penalty and a late Graziano Pelle strike. 'We just have to look to ourselves and not to look to other teams,' Alderweireld said. 'We know we have six games left, so it is going to be a hard sprint. 'The games are all tough, like next week Stoke away. It is a very difficult game, but we are going to try and win our games. The Belgian defender tackles Stephen Quinn, and says he is ignoring rumours about going back to Spain . 'We know we have Tottenham at home so we can do good business, but first we have to go to Stoke and that is going to be difficult.' The result leaves Hull further in the mire given they face an unenviable run of fixtures from now until the end of the season. City have a two-week break before their next match at Crystal Palace, where Michael Dawson knows they need to put Saturday's disappointment behind them. 'It is a massive disappointment,' the Hull skipper said. 'The first half, I thought we got right at them and I think Harps (goalkeeper Steve Harper) probably made one save. 'We were hoping to do the same in the second, but goals change games, big decisions in games. Alderweireld is focused on European qualification, and Saints took another step towards that goal against Hull .

"Kevin Pietersen will make his long-awaited return to domestic cricket this weekend as he begins his attempt to force his way back into the England reckoning. The controversial batsman has been named in Surrey's 13-man squad for the three-day warm-up against an Oxford University side at The Parks, which gets under way on Sunday. A short statement on Surrey's official website said: 'Kevin Pietersen is named in the squad as Surrey head to The Parks for their final pre-season game before their opening first-class fixture against Glamorgan next week.' Kevin Pietersen has been named in Surrey's 13-man squad to play Oxford University . Pietersen lines up with his Surrey team-mates ahead of his long awaited return to domestic cricket . The former England batsman unsurprisingly got the lion's share of attention from photograhpers . The 34-year-old has played almost exclusively Twenty20 cricket in various leagues around the world since being axed by England following the humiliating Ashes whitewash defeat last year. Indeed, he has not played a first-class match since January 2014, when Australia sealed a 5-0 thrashing of England in Sydney, while his last appearance for Surrey in the LV= County Championship was in June 2013. But he has given up a lucrative deal with Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad in order to come back to Surrey as he bids to win back his England spot. Pietersen hopes he can add to his 104 Test caps and much-storied international career with successful performances for Surrey, who have been only too happy to welcome back the South African-born batsman. The 34-year-old has not played first-class cricket since being axed by England after last year's Ashes . Piestersen jokes around by taking a picture of photographers from his phone . Meanwhile, Pietersen has thrown his support behind former team-mate Michael Vaughan as the right man to 'change the brand of cricket currently being played' in England. Ten years on from his career-defining captaincy in the 2005 Ashes, Vaughan is the hot favourite to be appointed as director of England cricket, a streamlined version of the managing director's job which was abolished with Paul Downton's sacking on Wednesday. 'He (Vaughan) is close enough to the game to make changes which need to happen for the good of English cricket,' Pietersen said. 'The way he captained shows he'll change the brand of cricket currently being played, which we need.'

"Shane Warne hailed Richie Benaud as the 'godfather of cricket' following the former Australia captain and broadcaster's death at the age of 84. Benaud was as well known for his commentary as his cricket after moving into a career in the media in 1956 which saw him become the voice of the game in both England and his homeland. But he was also a trailblazing all-rounder who took 228 wickets and scored 2,201 runs in 68 Tests while never losing a series in charge of his country. Tributes are seen at the statue of Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing aged 84 . A tribute of a microphone with Benaud's Test cap number of 190 is left at the statue . The flags atop the Sydney Harbour Bridge can be seen flying at half-mast as a tribute to Benaud . The Australian flag at the SCG is lowered at half mast for the Australian cricketer and commentator . One of Benaud's most famous commentaries was on the 'ball of the century' - Warne's first delivery in Ashes cricket which dismissed Mike Gatting - and the 45-year-old fellow leg-spinner paid an emotional tribute to his mentor on Instagram. 'Dear Richie,' he wrote. 'I've known you & Daphne for close to 30 years & to everyone you were a legend on all levels & rightly so too. As a cricketer, commentator & as a person, you were the best there's ever been & to top it off, an absolute gentleman... 'For me it was an honour & a privilege to call you a close friend & mentor, we had so many wonderful times together, talking cricket & in particular, our love & passion of leg spin bowling. I will cherish our entertaining dinners & all the fun times we shared over a long period of time. 'I would also like to thank you & Daphne for all your support & time you made for me as a young cricketer & leg spin bowler trying to make his way as an 18 year old, your tips & advice along the journey meant so much !!! 'Richie, you were loved by everyone, not just the cricket family, you were the godfather of cricket & you will be missed by all... R.I.P my friend.' Shane Warne paid tribute to Benaud, calling him the 'godfather of cricket' Current Australia Test captain Michael Clarke believes it was Benaud's spirit as well as his prowess with bat, ball and microphone that made him one of the most popular figures in the game. 'I think that everybody involved in the game of cricket: supporters, players, the media, everyone, Richie is known for a lot more than bowling a few leg-spinners and hitting a few cover drives,' he told Today on Channel Nine in Australia. 'I think that's probably why he's such an idol to so many current cricketers because he's been such a gentleman on the field, an amazing player and a lot of current players probably don't realise what a good player he was. 'But, what he's done off the field, he's an amazing example to a lots of sportsmen. I think all of us look up to Richie so it's a really sad day. 'He was a great player and a great captain, a wonderful leader of men and I think he's continued that off the field. He sets a great example, he's a gentleman, he played the game in the right spirit. 'He loved winning and I think he helped the Australian team have that attitude that they wanted to win but he played the game the right way.' Benaud took a break from commentary in 2013 after being involved in a car accident and just over a year later his comeback was put on ice as he began to receive treatment for skin cancer. Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . A floral tribute lies at a plaque at the SCG . He never did return to the microphone full time but his legacy was long since secured and Australia coach Darren Lehmann hailed him as 'one of the game's greats'. 'The fact that Australia never lost a series under his captaincy says so much and those standards were just as high when he turned his attention to calling the game,' said Lehmann. 'We loved listening to him commentate when the team was together in the dressing room. When he was on air, we always had the TV volume turned up because his comments were so insightful. 'He spent a lot of time talking to players of all ages, passing on his great knowledge and love of the game. What stood out more than anything about Richie is that he always put the game first. 'There will only ever be one Richie Benaud. Our thoughts go out to Daphne, John and the entire Benaud family at this sad time.' His family have been offered a state funeral by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Benaud at one point was Australia's leading wicket-taker with his leg-spin before his record was surpassed by Dennis Lillee and eventually Warne. England coach Peter Moores was also among those to express their sympathy at Benaud's passing, saying: 'Richie sums up all that is great about our sport. 'He was a true gentlemen with a real insight into the game, he made heroes of the players he commentated on and his enthusiasm for the sport made you want to get off the sofa and play. 'He will be sorely missed.' The tributes continued to pour in as the rest of the world awoke to the news. Australia batsman Steve Smith, currently in India playing in the Indian Premier League, wrote on Twitter: 'Sad to wake up and hear of the loss of Richie Benaud. True gentleman and The Voice of cricket. Will always be remembered RIP Richie £190.' The number 190 refers to Benaud's Test cap number for Australia. A three-part post from India great Sachin Tendulkar read: '#RIPRichie Wonderful personality who was always warm and encouraging. Had great insights on the game. 'Fondly remember our discussion on the art of leg spin along with Official @ShaneWarne in Sharjah. Last spoke to him late last year. 'Was not well but full of enthusiasm. Great loss to the world of cricket. Heartfelt condolences to Richie's family and friends.' Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara added: 'So sad to hear about the passing of Richie Benaud. The great voice of cricket is no more. He defined an era with conviction and sincerity'. David Morgan, MCC President, said: 'I came to know Richie and his wife, Daphne, well over the course of my career, and I am deeply saddened to hear of his passing. My thoughts go out to Daphne, and the rest of Richie’s family and friends. He was a kind, generous and supremely talented man. 'As a cricketer he was a fantastic leader and one of the finest exponents of the art of leg spin the game has ever seen. As a commentator his skill was unrivalled – charismatic, engaging and informative. 'He truly was the master of the pause. He is irreplaceable as a broadcaster and his passing will leave a void in the J.P.

"Unsurprisingly, the Champions League  and Europa League draws have dominated the headlines on the Continent - especially in Spain and Italy who make up six of the last eight teams remaining in both European competitions. In Italy, Juventus' semi-final with Real Madrid has been likened to a pair of films with Tuttosport comparing the clash to 'Star Wars' complete with Cristiano Ronaldo and Mauro Icardi brandishing lightsabers, while Corriere dello Sport confidently claim it's 'Mission Possible'. La Gazetta dello Sport are equally bold in their conviction that the Old Lady can overcome the holders and have even mapped out how the tie can be won, which seems to pin hopes on former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez.

"It has been revealed the blue-eyed, Australian doctor who's been hailed the 'new face' of the latest Islamic State propaganda videos was reportedly a 'womaniser' who was thought to be a 'pretty normal guy'. In  ISIS's most recent video, a young doctor, identified as Tareq Kamleh, called on foreign medics to travel to the ISIS stronghold in Raqqa to help launch the ISHS (the Islamic State Health Service). The video of Kamleh, who refers to himself as Abu Yusuf, showed him handling babies in a maternity ward while wearing western-style blue surgical scrubs and a stethoscope. Scroll down for video . The blue-eyed Australian doctor who features in the latest IS propaganda video has been identified as Tareq Kamleh . Calling himself 'Abu Yusuf', Kamleh introduces the launch of the Islamic State Health Service . Once the propaganda video went viral, people from Kamleh's past started to recognise the previously unidentified doctor. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University. Upon completing his degree he reportedly worked as a paediatric registrar at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital until 2013. Kamleh then moved to north Queensland where he worked at Mackay Base Hospital, the Age reported. He completed his final stint in the Australian medical system working in Perth until late 2014. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University . 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests' A university student who knew Kamleh, but did not want to be named, said he showed no signs that he would defect to the radical militant group. 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests,' she told news.com.au. She said the 'clean cut' doctor was well known in her social circle as a 'womaniser' who didn't shy away from drinking alcohol. Kamleh was also recognised by Dr Stephen Napoli, co-owner of the Mannum Medical Centre in South Australia. He told the Age the 'intelligent' doctor had interned with him for 10 weeks back in 2010. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge,' Dr Napoli said. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge' Kamleh was known to practice medicine in Adelaide, Mackay and finally in Perth before he took up working for IS . Dr Napoli agreed that Kamleh had shown no signs of holding extreme Islamic views. 'There was no indication I'd be worried about his other associations when he was with us. 'There was nothing that I saw of his work as a medical practical that would suggest he would have any of these sorts of views.' The video's poster shows a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an western-style blue surgical scrubs which appear to mimic Britain's National Health Service . A former college from Adelaide Hospital also came forward reporting that he recognised Kamleh in the footage immediately. 'I was taken aback as much because I certain certainly wouldn't have associated him with an association like IS. His principle seemed to be sound and focused on the care of his patients,' he told the Age. The collegue, who also chose not to be identified, said Kamleh's behaviours were not consistent with the Islamic State's conservative views on drinking or dating. 'I know he dated a few nurses and other doctors over the years… he was heterosexual and certainly interested in the ladies, with some success.' Yusuf  is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients . The video featuring Kamleh, which is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group, shows the doctor interviewed inside the paediatric ward of a Syrian hospital. 'My name is Abu Yusuf. I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah,' he says. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' He claims to be sad he delayed travelling to Syria for so long. 'It is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary from a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.' The vision is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Yusuf urges foreign Muslims with medical training to come forward and join the latest caliphate initiative. 'We really need your help. It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones confirmed the authenticity of the video to Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm familiar with IS propaganda and this is certainly legit,' he said. Abu Yusuf al-Australi calls upon foreigners with medical training to join the Islamic State's new medical initiative . 'The video is interesting because it's trying to communicate a sense of normalcy within the caliphate. The babies, ambulances and modern medical equipment are a far cry from the barbarity of their other videos.' 'In reality, the conditions are not accurate: Syria remains a very hostile environment. But it communicates a major shift in their recruitment.' Dr Jones believes the group are trying to attract more sophisticated demographic than in the past, when they targeted disillusioned youths. 'They are asking for foreigners with medical training and an education, and they aren't trying to lure them for militant purposes. This poses an interesting question: is this still considered radicalisation?' Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Pictured from left to right: Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah, Lena Maumoon Abdulqadir and Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah . The four women and five men apparently kept their plans secret from their families and fled to Syria .             Left to right: Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Sami Ahmed Kadir and Ismail Hamadoun .

The footage, which appeared on social media on Thursday, comes after nine Brritish medical students travelled to Syria last month, claiming they were going to help treat victims of the civil war. The students are all believed to be of Sudanese origin and were studying at a medical school in Khartoum, Sudan. The students have been named as Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir, Nada Sami Kader, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tasneem Suleyman Huseyin, Ismail Hamdoun, Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah, Mohammed Osama Badri Mohammed, Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah and Sami Ahmed Kadir. In February, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis announced an $18 million initiative to battle extremist propaganda. The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of technology experts to assess the impact of online extremist propaganda.

"A year since the death of former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova, his memory lives on at the club where he played an integral part in the most successful era in its history. Vilanova died aged 45 on April 25 last year after a long battle against parotid gland cancer that cut short the life of a coach in his prime. The way he steadfastly attempted to carry on despite his illness in his typically understated manner drew much admiration and there was a considerable outpouring of sadness at his passing. It is one year since Tito Vilanova, the beloved Barcelona coach, died aged 45 after a long battle with cancer . Vilanova's memory lives on at the club where he played an integral part in its most successful era . People from the sporting world and many others attended a memorial service at Barcelona cathedral to pay tribute. Vilanova was Pep Guardiola's assistant during a golden spell for the club when they won three La Liga titles and two Champions League trophies from 2008-12. While Guardiola was the public face, Vilanova worked hard behind the scenes as Barca not only won trophies but did it by taking apart opposition teams with their brand of short-passing football that became known as 'tiki-taka'. Vilanova would take charge of preparing the strategy and advise on potential signings as Barca went on to win 14 out of a possible 19 trophies. While Pep Guardiola's assistant, Vilanova was part of a golden spell for the club including three La Liga titles . Barcelona players were among hundred who gathered at Barcelona Cathedral to pay tribute to Vilanova . A banner reads 'Tito forever eternal' while a Barca fan with a shirt saying 'Thanks Tito, always eternal' leaves a gift during a memorial at the Nou Camp . The pair knew each other from passing through Barca's youth system but Vilanova was let go in 1990 and played for several lower league teams before finally getting his chance in the Spanish top flight with Celta Vigo in the mid-1990s. It was as a coach that he really made his mark though and after Guardiola left, he took charge of the Barca first team. Barcelona went on to make a record start to a La Liga season with 18 wins from 19 games but in December 2012, Vilanova was diagnosed with cancer for a second time. It meant his assistant Jordi Roura took charge of the team on those occasions when he was undergoing treatment. Barca won the league but at the end of the season, Vilanova announced he was resigning to concentrate on his recovery from the illness. He is fondly remembered at the club for not only being a Barcelona man but also his unassuming manner and in February this year a pitch at their training ground was named after him.","Tito Vilanova died aged 45 on April 25 last year after a long cancer battle .

"Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini insists that reports Xherdan Shaqiri is set to leave the club this summer are 'completely made up'. The Switzerland international joined the Italians from Bayern Munich in January for a fee in the region of £12million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract. The 23-year-old made a fine start to his Inter career but has tailed off in recent weeks and has found himself dropped to the bench for the previous two Serie A matches. Xherdan Shaqiri joined Inter Milan from Bayern Munich in the January transfer window . And it has been suggested that Inter are looking to offload the attacking midfielder at the end of the season, but Mancini has rubbished the speculation insisting Shaqiri can have a big future in Italy. 'This Shaqiri thing is completely made up,' he told reporters. 'We bought Shaqiri last January because we think that he can have a big future at Inter. Then during the season, there might be a moment when a player's form drops, and there are other players that in that moment are able to step in. So that's the only situation going on right now. 'Shaqiri has our full confidence. He is our player. Then he has also changed his team, so it's normal that he might struggle at a certain stage. Shaqiri has been dropped to the bench by Roberto Mancini in recent matches . 'It's not that he can join a new club and altogether be the one that single-handedly wins games by himself. 'He will always have a drop in form at a certain stage so in that moment there are other players ready to step in - they are normally there for that reason.

"They played in grey and duly put in a dull and uninspired performance, these really are dark days for Newcastle United. Still, at least they returned a club record profit of £18.7million last week and retail gain was probably behind the bizarre decision to ditch their black-and-white stripes. But on Sunday they set another record as losers of the last five Tyne-Wear derbies. John Carver looks on as his Newcastle United struggle against rivals Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby . Head coach John Carver said before the game he had a secret motivational tactic up his sleeve and would only reveal what it was following victory. Well, we'll never know what he used in a forlorn attempt to rouse his players. But we do know it didn't work. Phil Neville was scathing in his assessment of Newcastle a fortnight ago when he said that their application during the 3-0 defeat at Everton was reminiscent of a set of players with one eye on their summer holidays. Neville was at the Stadium of Light on Sunday and, rather than prove him wrong as a livid Carver promised his men would, they played like a side with their flip-flops on. Carver was in a rage again on Sunday night, but this time it was his players feeling the fury. 'I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not working hard enough. I was wrong,' he said. Jordi Gomez and Remy Cabella do battle on the Stadium of Light pitch as Sunderland snatch victory . 'The performance hurts more than the result. We were second best. It's a funny thing pressure, some players can handle it and some can't. Some of ours perhaps can't after losing five in a row. 'I am absolutely embarrassed to be part of it.' Newcastle's problem is a sad attitude of acceptance that has been allowed to permeate a squad lacking in ability and character. The Magpie mandate is survival and, to that end, their season finished the minute they were more or less assured of as much. Not even a derby can rally this lot. There was one incident in the second half which captured their passive approach. With the play dead, Mike Williamson had to scream at team-mate Daryl Janmaat in a desperate effort to return the ball with some sense of urgency. Sunderland, in contrast, hassled, harried and hounded their opponents. They had won the previous four derbies because they out-worked Newcastle and wanted it more. They won a fifth for exactly the same reasons. Jermain Defoe earns Sunderland all three points with a sensational volley at the Stadium of Light . This was billed as 'The Desperation Derby' given the alarming form of the North-East rivals going into the game – four goals between them in 18 hours with six points taken from a possible 36. But there was only one team desperate to win this. It wasn't until the final 15 minutes that Newcastle drew a save from Costel Pantilimon. But it was too little, too late. Far too little, in fact. These are dispiriting times on Tyneside. The disconnect between supporters, players and hierarchy has never been greater. On full-time, the Toon Army spat as much venom towards their own team as they did the red-and-whites goading them nearby. They had just witnessed a dour display of nothingness, sadly lacking in energy, imagination and pride. Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul can only look on in horror as the striker's effort cruises in . There was one shining light amid the darkness. Cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez was starting his first game in 20 months and was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause, and that he rightly received. His shirt was soaked near-enough black come the end such was his effort. It failed, however, to inspire his team-mates, one of which, Tim Krul, was criticised by fans on social media when it appeared he congratulated Jermain Defoe for his stunning match-winner shortly before half-time. But to demonise Krul alone would be wrong. The problems at Newcastle run from top to bottom. They are a club without ambition, happy to renew their Premier League pay packet come the end of the season. That message from above means you end up with performances such as this – grey, with little sign of light.

"Manchester United winger Ashley Young is adamant that the club will be challenging for the Premier League title once more next season. The Red Devils have endured two mixed campaigns following the retirement of legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson in May 2013. After finishing seventh last season, their lowest position since in the Premier League era, United currently sit third in the table this term - 11 points behind leaders Chelsea. Manchester United winger Ashley Young believes the club will be challenging for the title next season . Despite their large deficit to the Blues, current United boss Louis van Gaal has restored some of the club's old vigour under Ferguson that was lost during David Moyes' ill-fated reign. Prior to their 1-0 defeat at Chelsea on April 18, the Old Trafford outfit had reeled off six successive league victories - including impressive triumphs over top four rivals Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City. And Young believes that after a slow start under Van Gaal the fruits of his labour are finally paying off at United - which will see the club compete for their first league title in three seasons, next year. 'You don't manage the team he has managed without having that big, bold personality. He wants to be successful. He wants every detail spot on,' Young said about the 63-year-old in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. The 29-year-old (right) has played a prominent role for United this season under Louis van Gaal . 'As players, you want to be challenged and that's exactly what he does; he challenges us every single day. It was always going to take time, but it is all starting to come together. 'If you look at the last run of games, even last week against Chelsea when on another day we would have scored two or three goals, we will definitely be back challenging for the title next season.' Young's United career has been revitalised under Van Gaal this season - with the 29-year-old playing a prominent role in the Dutchman's starting line-up. Young has praised Van Gaal's (right) managerial style and desire to bring back success to the club . The England international has combined brilliantly of late with Daley Blind and Maraoune Fellaini, down the left-hand side of the United team - something the former Aston Villa star admits he has relished. 'Thats's been brilliant, the three of us playing in those triangles and the same the other side with Antonio [Valencia], Ander [Herrera] and Juan [Mata],' Young added. 'There are some cool heads there, and a lot of players who are now playing with more composure, not scared to give each other the ball, or play it in tight spaces.' Young (front) also believes United are playing with more composure than they were at the start of the season .","Manchester United are currently third in the Premier League standings .

"Sleepless nights leading to the general election appear to have affected  David Cameron's memory after Prime Minister made an embarrassing gaffe by forgetting which team he supports. Speaking at an event in south London, the PM claimed to be a West Ham supporter - despite previously stating that he followed Aston Villa. 'You can support Man Utd, the West Indies and Team GB all at the same time - of course I'd rather you supported West Ham,' he said during a speech on ethnic minorities. Prime Minister David Cameron had brain fade after getting his claret and blue teams mixed up . The Conservative Party leader told an audience he was a West Ham fan, despite supporting Aston Villa . The Tory leader has since apologised, blaming a bout of 'brain fade' - perhaps he became confused since both sides wear claret and blue colours. 'I had what Natalie Bennett described as a brain fade,' he said. 'I'm a Villa fan ... I must have been overcome by something ... this morning. But there we are, these things sometimes happen when you are on the stump.' West Ham were quick to respond after tweeting Cameron to vote for his favourite player with the message: 'don't forget to vote in another important election! Who is your Hammer of the Year, Prime Minister?' Cameron said: 'I'm a Villa fan ... I must have been overcome by something ... this morning.' The PM was overjoyed when Christian Benteke (left) helped Villa reach the FA Cup final . Cameron attended his first match at Villa Park as a 13-year-old after being taken by his uncle, former Villa chairman Sir William Dugdale. In a TV interview in 2008, Cameron told GMTV: 'The first game I ever went to was an Aston Villa game and so I am an Aston Villa fan.' And, the Conservative leader was enthusiastic after Aston Villa defeat Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-finals. 'It was a tremendous game with Benteke and Delph doing Villa proud, against the odds. I can't wait to watch the final at the end of May,' he said.","David Cameron claims he is a West Ham fan during a speech .

"Chelsea are set to be without star striker Diego Costa for Sunday's trip to Arsenal after he failed to recover in time from a hamstring injury. Blues manager Jose Mourinho said on Friday that he would make a late decision on Costa’s fitness, but his leading scorer is not in a condition to play at the Emirates Stadium. Costa suffered the latest in a string of hamstring injuries against Stoke City three weeks ago but Chelsea are wary of risking him while they hold a comfortable lead in the Barclays Premier League. Costa has not featured for Chelsea since going off injured against Stoke on April 4 . Costa is not even likely to be named on the bench for Chelsea at the Emirates on Sunday . The Spain striker is unlikely to even make the bench for Sunday’s top-of-the-table clash and he could also miss the potential title clincher at Leicester City on Wednesday night. Mourinho confessed on Friday that Loic Remy was not ready to return from an injury suffered in training two weeks ago, leaving Didier Drogba as the only senior striker available to him. The Chelsea manager had hoped that Costa would be able to train with the rest of the squad this week but his participation has been limited by his injury. Chelsea’s 17-year-old forward Dominic Solanke – who has played just 17 minutes for the first team - will deputise on the bench. Loic Remy is also out of the match leaving Didier Drogba as Chelsea's only fit senior striker . The young hitman has scored 35 goals at youth level this season but was left out of the Under 21 side’s 3-0 win over Everton on Thursday. ‘Didier for sure is fine, Remy is out for sure and with Diego we will make a decision tomorrow,’ Mourinho said on Friday. ‘Diego is a very important player for us but the reality is we are coping with the difficulty of every match without him. Chelsea's 17-year-old striker Dominic Solanke (centre) is set to be named on the bench . ‘The team is adapting to play in a different way. In the last period we are more strategic and less artistic but we are getting results.’ Chelsea are 10 points clear in the Premier League title race and wins against Arsenal and Leicester would see them crowned champions before the end of April. Costa has been sidelined four times this season with his hamstrings, which also gave him trouble at the tail end of his last campaign with Atletico Madrid.","Chelsea face Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday in the Premier League .

"Charged with four offences: Sunderland footballer Adam Johnson arrives to answer bail at Peterlee police station in County Durham yesterday . An England footballer was yesterday charged with grooming and sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Adam Johnson, 27, who plays in the Premier League for Sunderland and has represented his country 12 times, faces a lengthy jail term if he is convicted. The £10million winger was arrested seven weeks ago and learnt his fate during an arranged appointment at Peterlee police station, Durham. Johnson, the father of a three-month-old daughter, has been accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child under 16 and one of grooming. The £50,000-a-week player is due to appear before Peterlee magistrates on May 20 and the case will then be transferred to crown court. His team is playing Arsenal away that evening in the penultimate game of their league battle against relegation. The case threatens to put an end to the talented attacker’s glittering career. Last night, it was not clear if he will be allowed to continue playing before his case is dealt with. Gerry Wareham, of the Crown Prosecution Service, announced the decision to charge Johnson. He said it was in the public interest to charge the footballer and there was a ‘realistic prospect’ of a conviction. Johnson was told of the charges he will face during a 20-minute meeting with detectives. Dressed in a navy tracksuit and white trainers, he emerged grim-faced and walked swiftly out of the police station without commenting before being driven away. He stands accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child, contrary to Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences are said to have taken place between December 30 last year and February 26. He has also been charged with meeting a child following sexual grooming under Section 15 of the Act. Johnson was arrested on March 2 at his six-bedroom, £1.9million home in Castle Eden, near Hartlepool. Court date: Premier League winger Johnson (centre) will appear at Peterlee Magistrates’ Court on May 20 . Winger: Johnson (left, with long-time girlfriend Stacey Flounders, and right, in a match against Newcastle United on April 5) has made 31 appearances for Sunderland this season, scoring five goals . He became a father for the first time on January 8 when his girlfriend Stacey Flounders, 25, gave birth to their daughter Ayla Sofia. The alleged sexual activity offences cover a period while she was pregnant and after she gave birth. Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough’s youth academy as a 12-year-old. He made his Premier League debut for the club in 2005 and was sold in 2010 to Manchester City. Sunderland signed him for £10million in 2012. Initially the player was suspended after his arrest. But two weeks later, he was allowed back to training and returned to the team under Sunderland’s new manager Dick Advocaat. Home: The Premier League winger was arrested at his mansion (pictured) in County Durham on March 2 . Former Middlesbrough star: Adam Johnson has represented England at senior level 12 times . Adam Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough, where he made his debut in a Uefa Cup game in 2005, aged just 17. Almost six months later, he turned out for the first time in the Premier League, taking part in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal. He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, scoring 12 goals in his three-month stay at the Hertfordshire club. On his return to Middlesbrough, he again showed strong form, then made a £7million move to Manchester City in February 2010. In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the speedy winger made 97 appearances, helping win the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield. In August 2012 he moved back to his native North East, to Sunderland, in a £10million deal, and highlights of his time there have included a hat-trick on January 11 last year in a 4-1 away win over Fulham. He said after taking the match ball as a memento: ‘These days don't come along too often unless you're Messi or Ronaldo, so it was nice for me to get that ball as a souvenir to look back on. ‘This is up there with one of my best days of my career along with playing for England, scoring for England.’ He was awarded the Barclays Player of the Month award that month. The 27-year-old has represented England at under-19 and under-21 level, and at senior level 12 times, the last of them in a friendly victory over Italy in August 2012. He has struggled to reproduce his best form on a sustained basis at Sunderland, but endeared himself to the fans with goals in each of the club's three derby victories at Newcastle in as many seasons, including a late winner at St James' Park on December 21 last year. Derby win: Winger Johnson scored a late winner against Newcastle United at St James' Park last December .

"Jack Grealish will decide his international future at the end of the season after overtures from Republic of Ireland and England. The situation is described as 50/50 at this stage, with the 19-year-old having taken time out from national duty seven months ago. Grealish has met Ireland manager Martin O’Neill and held a friendly chat with Roy Keane after winning the country’s Under-21 player of the year award in Dublin last month. Jack Grealish put in a dazzling performance as Aston Villa beat Liverpool in an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday . Grealish has played for the Republic of Ireland's youth teams but England will hope to turn his head . Jack Grealish could end up playing for Republic of Ireland against England in June... but would still be able to switch allegiance to line up for the Three Lions afterwards. That is due to a FIFA ruling stating friendly match appearances do not commit a player to one country. High-profile examples of the clause being used are Diego Costa, who played two friendlies for Brazil before choosing Spain, Jermaine Jones switching from Germany to the USA, while Thiago Motta had three caps for Brazil and now represents Italy. Gareth Southgate made contact about a year ago and last October made public his desires to include Grealish in his England Under-21 side. Formal discussions with all parties are planned once Aston Villa’s season is completed, after the FA Cup final on May 30, suggesting the friendly between Ireland and England at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on June 7 may come too soon, should O’Neill wish to fast-track Grealish into his senior side. O’Neill offered Grealish the chance to train with the first-team at the start of this season but the Villa academy graduate wished to concentrate on preforming for his club and sorting his new contract. Grealish’s last international appearance came for Ireland’s Under-21s on September 5 in a 2-0 loss to Germany in Halle. The following month he withdrew from Noel King’s squad to play in a Villa first-team friendly and continue contract negotiations. Grealish did join up with an England youth team when he was 14, but, Sportsmail can reveal, he was sent home after falling ill and fainting. Ireland became aware of his heritage – his father Kevin’s parents are from Kerry and Galway – after scout Mark O’ Toole, based in London, spotted him playing at the Nike Premier Cup. England have monitored Grealish’s situation throughout the past four years and former Under-19s coach Noel Blake, along with ex Villa player Kenny Swain, made contact when he was 17. But King offered Grealish the chance to play for the Under-21s, and he made his debut at that level in August 2013. He has had an Irish as well as British passport for a number of years. Villa have had a strong connection with the Republic over the years and that was strengthened during Keane’s spell as assistant manager to Paul Lambert. Keane, who quit Villa at the end of last year, is also assistant to O'Neill at senior level. Before the FA Cup semi-final Shay Given said he had spoken to Grealish about the issue and suggested he was ready for first-team action. Grealish celebrates with Fabian Delph (left) and Gabby Agbonlahor (right) after the game at Wembeley . The youngster has met Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill and could play this summer . Grealish takes on Emre Can at Wembley during the impressive 2-1 victory on Sunday . ‘I was just joking that he’s taken a year out like a student or something,’ he said. ‘He should really be involved in the first team squad at the minute with Ireland I think. He is a young guy, you don’t want to rush him into these decisions. But in an ideal world we’d love him to play for us.’ England have been watching Grealish and it is believed a number of attempts have been made to persuade the rising Villa forward that his future is with England. But with Raheem Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ross Barkley among the young players in Roy Hodgson’s senior squad standing in his way, it is a difficult pitch. In October Southgate said: ‘Jack is somebody we have spoken to over the years, him and his family. He has been in our younger development teams. ‘Up to this point they have preferred to remain with Ireland. These things are quite fluid at younger ages. You are allowed to switch once when you are a young player and Jack is someone we are monitoring and we’ll keep our eye on that situation.’ The internal debate for Grealish is that he has been treated very well by Ireland over the years and feels loyalty, but was born in Birmingham to English parents. He has only made a handful of appearances for Villa, but his career has taken a massive uplift since the arrival of new manager Tim Sherwood in February.","Jack Grealish impressed as Aston Villa beat Liverpool 2-1 on Sunday .

"Ann Price, the creator of the world famous Ghetto Burger, has passed away. She was 72. According to 11Alive.com, Price was the owner of Ann's Snack Bar in Atlanta. Back in 2007, the Wall Street Journal named her signature 'Ghetto Burger,' a double cheeseburger with bacon, grilled onions, ketchup, mustard and chili, the best in America. Ann Price, the popular figure behind the 'Ghetto Burger,' dubbed best burger in America by the Wall Street Journal, has died at the age of 72 . The 'Ghetto Burger' is a double cheeseburger with bacon, grilled onions, ketchup, mustard and chili . Price, who was a popular figure in the community, started the restaurant back in 1971. According to an online obituary, funeral services will be held at Gregory B. Levett and Sons Funeral Home. Syracuse notes that Price's restaurant was no stranger to long lines, and that she was as famous for her burgers as she was her no-cursing policy. Customers were known to call her 'Miss Ann.' Price was known for her no-swearing policy and care in cooking up every plate of burger and fries herself . Only eight people could be seated at the counter at a time, meaning the wait for a spot could run as long as two hours, but people were still willing to hang around if it meant getting to that famous patty. Price personally cooked up the burgers and fries.","Ann Price was the woman behind the 'Ghetto Burger,' called best in America by the Wall Street Journal in 2007 .

"Having gone all the way to last year’s Wimbledon final Eugenie Bouchard has shown she knows how to handle etiquette, including the anachronistic task of having to curtsey. Yet something as straightforward as a sporting handshake at a low-key draw ceremony, before representing Canada in a Fed Cup match at the weekend, seems to be beyond her. Her refusal to shake hands with Romanian opponent Alexandra Dulgheru turned out to be the precursor of a dreadful few days for the world no 7. It beings to symbolise a season fast unravelling for last year’s shooting star of the women’s game. Eugenie Bouchard was mocked at home and abroad over the handshake controversy . Bouchard refused to shake the hand of Alexandra Dulgheru before Fed Cup match at the weekend . Bouchard ended up suffering not just the humiliation of losing to far lesser ranked opponents in front of her hometown crowd in Montreal, but of being mocked by the opposing Romanian team after they had inflicted defeat. Moreover, having previously been able to do little wrong in the eyes of her compatriots, she brought upon herself the scorn of fair-minded Canadians in the media, social and otherwise. Even Romania’s world number three Simona Halep, a shy and retiring type, weighed in by casting aspersions about the kind of upbringing Bouchard has had. Bouchard explained away her graceless act as merely being true to herself, but the truth is that such brattish behaviour is neither principled nor smart. She would be well-advised to avoid this sort of bravado until she starts winning again. It is not the first time that Bouchard has declined the traditional shake of hands that takes place at the draw prior to matches in the Fed Cup, the women’s incomprehensible equivalent of the Davis Cup. She did the same last year to Slovakia’s Kristina Kucova in front of the cameras which have, again, spread the footage all over the internet. The 21-year-old Canadian broke into the world's top 10 after a superb 2014 . She lost both her singles matches to world No 69 Dulgheru and Andreea Mitu, ranked 104th . Romania's Dulgheru said the handshake snub had given her extra motivation for the match . “It wasn’t personal, I just don’t believe in wishing my opponent good luck before a match,” said Bouchard this time. Already bereft of confidence, she set herself up for a fall which duly came, losing both her singles to players ranked 69 and 104. After Dulgheru beat her in straight sets she celebrated with her team-mates by theatrically pulling away her hand before it could be shaken. Dugheru said afterwards the incident had added to her motivation and gleefully declared that it was ‘nothing personal’. The watching Halep told Romanian reporters : “I would never have done it but this is how she (Bouchard) is raised or it’s a habit.” A superb 2014 saw Bouchard fly into the top ten at a rate few expected, the highlight being her run to the final of SW19. But by the same token this was never likely to be an easy year for the Canadian. A sympathetic view would be that the pressure of backing up two Grand Slam semis and a final is enormous, and that it is clearly starting tell. Bouchard reached last year’s Wimbledon final, where she lost to Petra Kvitova . There is also a sneaking admiration for the way she refuses to get involved in the sometimes phoney mateyness that permeates the men’s locker room. Not for Bouchard the guff that she is ‘pleased’ for her opponents when they do well. She happily declares with a smile that is half-angelic, half-steely that she is not interested in being friends with her rivals. That is just one reason she is often compared to Maria Sharapova. At times she appears to take the Russian ice queen as her ultimate role model but whether she can ever be technically as good as her is much more open to question. After making a decent start to this year by reaching the quarter finals of the Australian Open Bouchard has now lost six matches out of eight and five straight. While going down to Ukrainian qualifier Lesia Tusrenko at Indian Wells from 4-1 she was in tears. She also struggled to control her emotions later in March at Miami, when losing to world number 113 Tatjana Maria, whose main claim to fame is that she is the highest ranked mother on the tour. Bouchard has enjoyed success off the court with her model looks . Bouchard has often been compared to Russian ice queen Maria Sharapova . Bouchard made a couple of big decisions in December that may have added to the pressure. She curiously failed to renew her agreement with respected veteran American coach Nick Saviano that had worked so well, with one source suggesting he became aggrieved by her side’s high handed negotiating stance. She is now with Sam Sumyk, former coach of Sharapova’s fellow shrieker and ex world number one Victoria Azarenka. After eight years Bouchard also switched management companies to WME/IMG, which has offered her the chance to work with the IMG Models division and take commercial advantage of the looks she is so blessed with. Bouchard also has a strong work ethic, and has shown herself to be ruthless, intelligent and articulate (more shades of Sharapova). Her emergence has undoubtedly boosted the women’s game and at 21 everyone makes mistakes. After this weekend a period concentrating on avoiding them, and focussing on repairs to her tennis game would seem a wise move.","Eugenie Bouchard refused to shake hands with rival Alexandra Dulgheru .

"Eden Hazard must make himself a killer or a bully to defenders if the Chelsea winger is to be considered among the best in the world, insists Gary Neville. Hazard is poised to win PFA Player of the Year as Chelsea storm towards the Barclays Premier League title, but Neville says Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are 'in outer space' by comparison. The former Manchester United right-back feels Hazard is on par with Arjen Robben, Thomas Muller, Neymar, Gareth Bale and James Rodriguez, but that he is not as ruthless as the rest.

Hazard is poised to win PFA Player of the Year as Chelsea storm towards the Premier League title . Cristiano Ronaldo pictured during a Real Madrid training session this week ahead of their La Liga match . Neville says Ronaldo and Barcelona star Lionel Messi are 'in outer space' by comparison to other players . 'Hazard needs to bully defenders more, become a killer, somebody who gives full-backs nightmares before they play against him,' Neville wrote in his Daily Telegraph column. 'And at 24, now is the time for him to make those improvements. First of all, he needs to add ruthlessness to his game because he still lets too many defenders off the hook. 'As a right-back, I confess that Hazard would have been a nightmare to play against because he has a low centre of gravity, loads of skill and trickery, two strong feet and the ability to spin in behind you. 'But he is not a bully in the manner of Muller, Neymar or Robben, somebody who will keep coming at you, time and time again. I do not believe that Hazard is capable of having a 46-goal season like Ronaldo, but he can certainly hit the mid-20s.' Hazard is preparing to face Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, when Jose Mourinho's men can go one step closer to clinching the title. Real Madrid's Gareth Bale comes at defenders time and time again, according to former right-back Neville .

"Chelsea left the north London with the draw they came for, which takes them a step closer to the title. Arsenal were unable to break down their opponents in an attritional game, while Jose Mourinho's side rarely troubled David Ospina. Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel gives his verdict from the Emirates Stadium... Arsenal . David Ospina - Lucky not concede a penalty after clattering into Oscar - but produced a good stop to deny Ramires. 6.5 . Hector Bellerin - The youngster was preferred to fit again Mathieu Debuchy and justified his manager's faith. 7 . David Ospina was fortunate to get away without conceding a penalty when he clattered Oscar . Hector Bellerin does well to clear the ball off the line to prevent Oscar's lob putting Chelsea ahead . Laurent Koscielny - Cruised through the first half owing to Chelsea playing with no striker. Had more to think about following's Drogba's introduction. 7 . Per Mertesacker - Patched up after sustaining an ankle injury last weekend. Showed little sign of the problem in a strong performance. 7.5 . Nacho Monreal - Steady game for the Spaniard. Looks to be edging ahead of Kieran Gibbs for position as No 1 left-back. Booked. 6.5 . Francis Coquelin - Had to walk a disciplinary tightrope after a first-half booking - but remained industrious as ever.7 . Francis Coquelin breaks up a Chelsea attack but his holding role was made more difficult by a booking . Santi Cazorla - He's had more influential days, but kept Arsenal's midfield ticking over. Booked. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey - Utilised, once again, in an unfamiliar right-wing role. It didn't throw him off his stride too much. Booked. 6.5 . Mesut Ozil - Not quite £42.5million, but he's getting there. Heavily involved for the Gunners but couldn't find a breakthrough. 7 . Alexis Sanchez - Fresh from his Wembley double, the Chilean wasn't quite at his best against Chelsea. 6.5 . Olivier Giroud - Endured a titanic battle with Terry. The Frenchman put himself about against the champions-elect. 6.5 . Olivier Giroud shields the ball from a masked Cesc Fabregas, but the Frenchman had little joy up front . Subs: . Danny Welbeck (on for Coquelin, 76) - Injected pace into Arsenal's attack. 6.5 . Theo Walcott (on for Giroud, 84) - Thrown on late as the Gunners searched for victory. 6.5 . Subs not used: Szczesny, Debuchy, Gibbs, Wilshere, Flamini . Manager: Arsene Wenger - His Mourinho hoodoo continues - but the French manager can be happy with his side. 6. Chelsea . Thibault Courtois - Made some routine saves but has had much more eye-catching afternoons. 6.5 . Branislav Ivanovic - Solid and steady as ever from the Blues right-back. Excellent tussle with Sanchez. Booked. 7 . Gary Cahill - A mature display from the England central-defender. Kept his cool in the heat of battle. 7.5 . John Terry - Played a crucial role in quelling Giroud's aerial threat. A typical all-action display from the Chelsea skipper. 8 . John Terry and Gary Cahill did well to prevent Giroud from becoming a threat as Chelsea kept things tight . Cesar Azpilicueta - Been one of Chelsea's most consistent players this season. Was so again at the Emirates. 7.5 . Nemanja Matic - Shielded his back-four with the expertise we've come to expect. Didn't put a foot wrong. 7 . Cesc Fabregas - Booed on his return to Emirates and booked for diving. Wasn't how he'd dreamed it last night. 6 . Ramires - Missed a glorious chance to put Chelsea ahead in the first half. Defensive instincts were vital for Chelsea. 6.5 . Ramires carries the ball past Arsenal left back Nacho Monreal in the top of the table clash . Willian - A willing runner in attack and defence for the Blues. Showed some quality on ball, too. Booked. 6.5 . Eden Hazard - He's had more productive days, but his defensive discipline was important for the visitors. 6 . Oscar - Playing in an unfamiliar role as central striker, he should have won Chelsea a penalty. Did little much else. 6 . Eden Hazard was unusually quiet, with Arsenal keeping a close eye on him, but still showed flashes of quality . Subs: . Didier Drogba (on for Oscar, 46) - So often Arsenal's tormentor. Could replicate past heroics. 6 . Kurt Zouma (on for Fabregas, 90) - Brought on to see out the final few minutes. 6 . Juan Cuadrado (on for Willian, 90) - Came on for the final few seconds. 6 . Manager: Jose Mourinho - Starting with no striker said it all. Came for a point - and got it. Job done. 7 . Referee: Michael Oliver - Could easily have awarded three penalties on busy afternoon four the official. 6.5 .

"West Ham's season tickets will cost as little as £289 when they move to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford. The Hammers will have the cheapest pricing strategy in the Barclays Premier League in a bid to fill the 54,000 capacity stadium when they make the switch for the 2016-17 season. Co-chairmen David Gold and David Sullivan are using the boost of the enhanced television revenue, which coincides with their move away from Upton Park, to pass on savings to fans. The new TV deal starts in 2016 after Sky and BT agreed to pay more than £5billion for domestic rights and there will be another auction over the summer with overseas broadcasters.

Co-chairmen David Gold (right) and David Sullivan (left) will use enhanced TV revenue to pass  savings to fans . According to a document that will be issued to West Ham fans on Wednesday, every season-ticket band will be reduced when the club move. The lowest priced basic adult season ticket will cost £289, the price for under 16s will be cut to just £99, and a family of four will be able to watch all 19 home games in the top flight for £776. Disabled season-ticket holders will also see a huge reduction, with prices dropping by up to £205. The news comes just one day after Sportsmail revealed massive price hikes at Manchester City. Supporters in City’s East Stand have been been told they will have to fork out £1,750 to watch their team, almost double the £885 they currently pay. West Ham's vice-chairman Karren Brady said: 'We have always said that the move to our magnificent new stadium would be a game changer for West Ham; a chance to increase revenue, invest in the team and improve our performances on the pitch, but crucially without putting an extra financial burden on the supporters who already come to watch every home match. 'Today's announcement proves that we have kept our promise.' Football Supporters Federation backed the club's drive and Chair Malcolm Clarke  said: 'The FSF strongly believes that top-flight clubs should use their newly-signed media deal to cut ticket prices for both home and away supporters. 'We hope that other clubs follow suit and reduce ticket prices across the board, as West Ham United have done.' The club also announced a new VIP area in homage of the club's most famous sons. With 2016 marking 50 years since since Bobby Moore, Sir Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters lifted the World Cup for England, the '1966 seats' will offer fans impressive views from the halfway line. In addition, West Ham will donate a seat each to the families of Moore, Hurst and Peters for them to use for a charity of their choice. The Hammers will be under pressure to fill their new stadium after taking the huge decision to leave Upton Park, where they have played since 1904. Gold and Sullivan have taken a 99-year lease on the Olympic Stadium.

Real Sociedad boss David Moyes, Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic, a former West Ham player, and Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp have been linked with the job. But on Tuesday vice-chairman Brady hit out at suggestions that Klopp — who will leave Dortmund this summer — is set to replace Allardyce. ‘It is just nonsense,’ Brady told Sky Sports News. ‘Sam is the manager, we have talked to him about sitting down at the end of the season, which we will do. We have to see what he wants to do. That’s how these things work. We’ve done that since he joined and we’ve done that when his contract has run out before.’ (lowest adult season-ticket price on website, excluding family zone) *current price; next season not available .","West Ham will move to the Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 season .

"Any defender who saw Jack Grealish glide around the Wembley turf with composure beyond his years should think twice before deciding that kicking him off the pitch is the way to limit his effectiveness. Between the ages of 10 and 14, Grealish played Gaelic football to a high standard, even appearing at Croke Park five years ago in a match during half-time of a Dublin v Kerry senior game. On his debut for John Mitchels, a GAA club in Warwickshire, he received a mighty blow and appealed to the referee. ‘This isn’t soccer, Jack,’ he was told without pity.

After progressing through the Villa youth ranks he had to give up the sport where opponents would kick him and stamp on his fingers, but the toughness remains. The 19-year-old was clobbered by two fouls against Liverpool in Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final win, picking himself up each time. He wears his socks rolled down to show he is unafraid of taking ferocious hits. As a 15-year-old he watched a Sky Sports special dedicated to George Best and saw the Manchester United great dribble through a forest of tackles to score. Best wore his socks round his ankles in defiance, and Grealish decided to do the same. Now there is an aspect of superstition to the practice although he does buy kid-sized shinpads to meet safety regulations. Grealish wears his socks around his ankles but has to buy kid-sized shinpads to meet safety regulations . Man United legend George Best also wore his socks round his ankles with Grealish deciding to do the same . ‘It’s just his style,’ said Villa manager Tim Sherwood. ‘If he performs how I think he can, he can dress how he wants. It’s not a fashion show. He is good and perhaps he knows he’s good. You know what he said to me when I told him he was playing? He just said: “Bout time!”’ Grealish, on Chelsea’s radar until agreeing a new deal earlier this season, recorded Sunday’s game and celebrated Villa’s win by going home to watch it twice more.

But had Nottingham Forest not been under a transfer embargo on deadline day in February, this would be a different tale. Left out of squads by former boss Paul Lambert, Grealish was looking to go out on loan to continue his development. The Forest deal was in place but fell through. When Sherwood arrived things began to change. Grealish was selected for the huge relegation clash with Queens Park Rangers, and again at Tottenham.

"Manchester United players  Wayne Rooney and David de Gea made the time to meet some sick supporters alongside manager Louis van Gaal on Monday. The trio, along with other squad members such as Ashley Young and Michael Carrick, met the fans at their training complex as part of the Manchester United Foundation 'Dream Day'.

The Manchester United Foundation says it 'works in some of the most disadvantaged areas across Greater Manchester and uses the passion for Manchester United to educate, motivate and inspire young people.' The fans who made it to the United's training ground were clearly overjoyed to have the opportunity to meet Rooney, captain for the club and England. They also took the chance to engage with Van Gaal, who was obviously much more welcoming than he was towards the media after United's 1-0 loss to Chelsea on Saturday. The Dutchman felt aggrieved at what he perceived to be a foul on Falcao by John Terry in the build-up the Eden Hazard's decisive strike at Stamford Bridge. 'For me, it was a foul.

"Ronnie O'Sullivan found himself in more bother at the Betfred World Championship after making a rude gesture during his second-round match against Matthew Stevens. On the table the five-time world champion enjoyed a successful day, firing two rapid centuries in establishing a 12-4 lead, needing just one more in Monday's closing session to the match to reach the quarter-finals. But O'Sullivan was also spoken to by the referee Olivier Marteel towards the end of the afternoon session - and warned about his behaviour.

O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Marteel in his second round match against Stevens at the Crucible . Marteel approached O'Sullivan as he walked to the table when Stevens missed a red, telling O'Sullivan he had noticed his hand gesture, which was thought to have been self-directed. O'Sullivan avoided a fine in the first round when he briefly played without shoes after a new pair proved uncomfortable, breaking the rules but not sufficiently to warrant any punishment, after he accepted a substitute pair of size eights, loaned by tournament director Mike Ganley.

The warning from Marteel could be the end of Sunday's matter. Yet any repeat of the incident would see O'Sullivan docked a frame, a tournament spokesman confirmed. Armed with a 5-3 lead from the opening session, O'Sullivan took the opening two frames on Sunday to pull further in front. The next went against the 39-year-old, but breaks of 110 and 139 in consecutive frames suggested O'Sullivan was in unstoppable form, as sweeping through the subsequent three testified.

"Supporters of ISIS have 'declared a caliphate' in Yemen through a bizarre video showing a group of masked fighters a barren desert. The video, allegedly shot near the capital of Sanaa, sees some 20 men wearing desert camouflage uniforms carry out a carefully choreographed rifle routine in the sand. The 'establishing' of an ISIS-related group in Yemen comes after months of conflict which has seen Iran-backed Houthi rebels fight both the government and the local Al Qaeda affiliates. Scroll down for video . Declaration of fear: The video shows a group of ISIS supporters, calling itself Soldiers of the Caliphate in Yemen, announcing that they have established a 'caliphate' in the country . The group in the video, which calls itself Soldiers of the Caliphate in Yemen, began to emerge late last year and it is believed that their aim is to take over Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which has strongholds in the south and south-east of Yemen. Last month, the ISIS-related group claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks at two mosques in the Houthi-controlled capital of Sanaa. Four bombers wearing explosive belts targeted worshippers in and around the crowded mosques during Friday prayers killing 137 people and wounding 357. Although the location of the video, released on Friday, has yet to be confirmed, it is claimed to have been filmed near the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which was captured by the Houthis last September. The nine-minute clip is similar to propaganda videos released by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, appearing to be shot and edited using professional equipment.

It starts with a masked man in sandals, sticking a black ISIS flag into the ground to 'declare the caliphate'. He announces that the 'soldiers of the Caliphate will cut the throats' of the Shi'ite Houthis, and 'take back the land they have occupied'. It then shows the two dozen men undergoing military training in the desert, and the fighters can be seen holding rifles and a grenade launcher, before firing some of the weapons in the sand. The possibility of ISIS gaining power in Yemen in the country's current state of chaos is particularly dangerous as one of the world's busiest oil shipping lanes is located off its coast. Yemen is currently on the brink of outright civil war, with several sides battling each other since the conflict began last year. Houthi rebels, backed by Shi'ite Iran, began their advance across Yemen by capturing the capital of Sanaa in September, later forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . into exile. Fighters loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh have been battling alongside the Houthi rebels, with the Houthis, Saleh-loyalists and Hadi-loyalists all battling al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula(AQAP) in the south. Last month, an intervention led by Saudi Arabia was launched with the aim to restore Hadi and . prevent Yemen disintegrating as a state.

Moving in: Although the location of the video, released on Friday, has yet to be confirmed, it is claimed to have been filmed near the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which was captured by the Houthis last September . Yesterday saw at least five air strikes on military positions and an area near the presidential palace compound in Sanaa, while warships pounded an area near the port of the southern city of Aden, residents said. Last Friday, Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yaseen rejected a . call for peace talks issued by former president Saleh on Friday and said the . Saudi-led military operation had not ended.

"Abby Bishop's (right) life completely changed when she took in her niece Zala (left) Most professional athletes are used to having their lives centred on themselves and their sport. But when basketballer Abby Bishop was just 24, her life completely changed when she took in her two-day-old niece Zala. It was August 2013 and Bishop suddenly found herself caring for a newborn, juggling training with sleepless nights and adjusting to her new life. Now Zala is 20 months old and she follows Bishop as she travels the world playing for professional teams, and will go with her to the U.S. this May when she starts playing for the Seattle Storm in the WNBA. Bishop, now 26, said it was a big decision at the time but she wouldn't change anything. 'My sister wasn’t very well,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I pretty much brought Zala home and started pre-season training with the Canberra Capitals straight away. 'It was tough with no sleep and adjusting to having another little human with me 24/7, but I have amazing friends who help me and my mum helped me when she could. 'I'm not going to lie and say it was easy but I just got through it.' Bishop had planned to spend a few years living in Europe full-time playing basketball, but she had to adjust her plans to do what was best for Zala. She chose to base herself in Canberra, sometimes flying interstate with Zala for weekend matches. Bishop was also able to take Zala with her to Hungary, where she played for local basketball teams for a couple of months in February 2014 and again in February this year. 'There are a few things I've missed out on, but I don't feel like I've missed out I've made the best of the situation,' she said. The basketballer, who lives in Canberra, has looked after her niece since she was two days old . Now Zala is 20 months old and she follows Bishop as she travels the world playing for professional teams . 'All the teams I've been part of have just been amazing in terms of taking me and Zala on. 'My European teams paid for my nanny's flights and they had cots and car seats and toys and everything there. 'I just can't thank the Canberra Capitals enough for putting childcare in my contract and letting me take Zala on road trips.' But it hasn't all been smooth sailing. Bishop had to miss out on playing for the national Opals team in the world championships in Turkey in October last year because of issues with their policy, which would have required her to cover the cost of travelling with a nanny. 'Taking on Zala I knew I was going to have to deal with some things within sport and for me that was not being able to go to world championships because of the policy they put in place,' she said. Bishop was able to take Zala with her to Hungary, where she played for local basketball teams for a couple of months in February 2014 and again in February this year . Bishop said Zala loves travelling and acting as team mascot. They are pictured here together in Hungary . Zala will go with Bishop to the U.S. this May when she starts playing for the Seattle Storm in the WNBA . 'I'd just taken on a baby that wasn't mine and they weren't as understanding as all my other teams have been. 'I understand it's the highest level, playing for Australia, but it's a unique situation and needs to be looked at differently than another mother's situation with a husband and a biological child.' Bishop is glad she will be able to take Zala with her when she goes to the U.S. to play with the Seattle Storm in May. 'In Seattle their rules in terms of contracts are very strict but in their own little way they have helped me,' she said. Bishop said Zala loves travelling and acting as team mascot. 'The plane trips are always the tricky part, just because she's so active, but in terms of being over there she loves it,' Bishop said. Bishop has had to make a lot of adjustments to her life – including getting used to a lack of sleep . ‘I think the biggest thing was it wasn’t all about me anymore, my life turned to being about this little human’ 'Everyone loves her and treats her like she's part of the team. 'She loves the attention - all they like is attention at that age.' Bishop has had to make a lot of adjustments to her life – including getting used to a lack of sleep and the fact that she is now responsible for someone else's life. 'I think the biggest thing was it wasn't all about me anymore, my life turned to being about this little human,' she said. 'And just for social things, my friends say ""Let's go out for dinner or drinks"" and I have to say ""Nah sorry I can't I've got a child now.""' Bishop knows that she will need to take a step back from the world of professional sport once Zala starts school. Bishop, now 26 years old, said it was a big decision at the time but she wouldn't change anything . Bishop said she will need to take a step back from the world of professional sport once Zala starts school . 'I've got a couple more years to do my basketball and do all that and then obviously I'll have to think about school and where we want to settle,' she said. When her basketball career comes to an end Bishop wants to become a police officer. But until then she is trying to maintain a balance and get back some of her social life – and she hopes to have more kids one day. 'I didn't think about it the day I was taking her,' she said. 'But since taking her I've thought hopefully I can find the right person and have my own kids. 'I'm a person who doesn't need someone but it's something I want in the future.

"Javier Hernandez is undroppable on current form, says Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti. The on-loan Manchester United striker made it six goals in eight games as he scored twice in Real's 4-2 win over Celta Vigo on Sunday night. Hernandez's double means he has now scored a goal every 83 minutes - a ratio that is only two minutes short of Lionel Messi, who nets once every 81 minutes. Javier Hernandez scored two more important goals for Real Madrid in their battle for the La Liga crown . Hernandez salutes the fans after scoring as Real moved back to within two points of Barcelona at the top . 'He's enjoying the period that he's in, it's a really good one,' said Ancelotti of Hernandez. 'The whole team worked well. If Chicharito is in this form he's non-negotiable, like Cristiano [Ronaldo], [Karim] Benzema, James [Rodriguez], [Gareth] Bale, [Sergio] Ramos, Isco, [Raphael] Varane, Pepe… I have a team of non-negotiables, but only eleven can play and the rest stay on the bench.' Hernandez, who faces an uncertain future with doubts over whether Real will make his loan permanent and seemingly no future at Man United, says he is focusing on enjoying his football rather than where he will be playing next season. He said: 'I feel good and am enjoying the moment. I am a Real Madrid player. I'm not sure if that will be for a long or short time so I want to make the most of the minutes I'm given with the best team in the world. The Real Madrid players surround striker Hernandez after his first goal brought the visitors back into the lead . 'I am enjoying doing what I love most, which is playing and I want to give it my all on the pitch. I've been taught that you can control having a good attitude and being determined. Everyone I love would tell me to continue working because all the good things would eventually transpire' The win keeps Real two points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona and Ancelotti remains hopeful that his side can catch their great rivals with five games to play. He added: 'Our objective is to force Barça to win every game. That's what the statistics say. At this moment in time we're not thinking about other teams, but about what we have to do. We're doing well and we'll try to fight for La Liga until the final day, which is our objective.'","Javier Hernandez scored twice to make it six goals in eight games for Real .

"Andrea Pirlo scored a stunning free-kick for Juventus, but couldn't stop his side from sinking to a 2-1 defeat at local rivals Torino. Juve could have wrapped up their fourth consecutive Serie A title with a victory on Sunday and looked on course to after Pirlo's masterful set-piece from 25 yards gave them the lead in the first-half. However, Matteo Darmian equalised for the home side just before the interval and Fabio Quagliarella completed the shock comeback around the hour mark. It was the first time Torino had beaten Juve in the derby for 20 years. Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo puts his side in front against rivals Torino with a stunning free-kick .

"Boxer David Haye was arrested at Dubai airport and held in a police cell over a £341,000 bounced cheque, it has been reported. Former two-weight world champion Haye, 34, was stopped by officials on his arrival at Dubai International Airport and accused of fraud by writing a cheque as payment for a new property which bounced. The boxer also handed over his passport to authorities, and has been unable to leave the United Arab Emirates - forcing him to miss a mixed martial arts event in Birmingham at the weekend. Former heavyweight boxing champion David Haye was stopped at Dubai International Airport and questioned over allegations that he wrote a £341,000 cheque which bounced. He is pictured during his trip to Dubai . The cheque, worth 1.8million Emirati Dirham, was intended as a final payment on a newly-built property, as part of a deal with developers Emaar, which is part-owned by the Dubai government. Haye has said the 'bounced' cheque was down to an administrative error. He told The Sun's Michael Hamilton: 'The cheque was presented to the bank four days before I landed. It was not due to be presented until final completion of my property, which is due in a few weeks. 'This was an administrative error which is being rectified. I explained to the police and presented documents as proof. But I can totally understand these mistakes can happen.' Writing a cheque that later bounces is a crime in Dubai, and can be punishable with jail, a fine, and being ordered to pay the amount. Haye, 34, was stopped by officials after his arrival at Dubai International Airport for a holiday . Haye was reportedly taken to Bur Dubai police station, which has a department for bounced cheque suspects, and was released the same day . Police give suspects one month to pay the value of the cheque, before taking the case to court. Figures released last June showed that Dubai police dealt with almost 80,000 bounced cheques in 2013/14, worth 9.4 billion Dirham, or £1.7 billion. According to The Sun, Haye was held at the airport as he arrived for a holiday earlier this month after he was flagged up on a wanted list. He was reportedly taken to Bur Dubai police station, which has a department for bounced cheque suspects, and was released the same day. Haye had been due to attend a mixed martial arts event in Birmingham on Saturday, but was unable to leave Dubai. Instead he went to a Robbie Williams concert in Abu Dhabi . He surrendered his passport, as did two of his associates. The Foreign Office is understood to have had no involvement in the case. During his stay in Dubai, Haye has reportedly been staying at the luxurious Palm Jumeirah development, and has been tweeting photographs of himself enjoying the sunshine, as well as meeting fans. He posted a video to his Instagram account today thanking fans for their concern over an 'administrative issue' as he walked along a beach in the sunshine. In the video, which he captioned 'Don't worry about me too much!!!', he said: 'Thanks for all your worry and concern but don't get too stressed about me, things aren't that bad. 'A little administrative issue has left me in Dubai for a few days longer than anticipated but it's getting smoothed out as we speak and I'll be back - probably in London or Las Vegas soon.' Haye has not been seen in the boxing ring since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012. He is pictured after the fight at Upton Park with the WBA and WBO International Heavyweight Championship belts . Haye had been due to attend a BAMMA mixed martial arts event in Birmingham on Saturday, where he was to present a live broadcast for channel Spike TV, but was forced to cancel due to his extended stay in Dubai. Instead, his place on the commentary team was taken by former WBA super-middleweight champion Carl Froch. In an Instagram message which was also posted to the event's Facebook page, Haye said: 'Sorry I can't be there tonight for BAMMA 20, I'm gutted, I'm stuck here in Dubai but I'll be there on June 13 in Birmingham for BAMMA 21.' 'Enjoy the action tonight, it's going to be great.' While he should have been in Birmingham, Haye instead told his 1.05 million Twitter followers that he had been to a Robbie Williams concert in Abu Dhabi, writing: 'Rluctantly came to @robbiewilliams concert Abu Dhabi, as not my style of music. But I'm a fan now, pure old school!' [sic]. Haye has not been seen in the boxing ring since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012, while two planned fights against British rival Tyson Fury have fallen through, the second as a result of shoulder surgery. Despite being advised by doctors to give up boxing, he is said to be planning a comeback and hopes to fight again within the next 18 months. Since his last fight he has also appeared in the twelfth series I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, finishing third in the television contest in November 2012. MailOnline has contacted Emaar for comment.","Haye, 34, stopped as he arrived at Dubai International Airport for a holiday .

"Six Chelsea players have been named in the Professional Footballers' Association Premier League team of the year. Jose Mourinho's men are on the brink of a first title since 2010 and their dominance over the past nine months was highlighted by a cluster of blue shirts in the XI announced by the PFA on Sunday. The entire back four started the season as Blues players, with centre-back pairing John Terry and Gary Cahill joined by Branislav Ivanovic and Ryan Bertrand, the latter of whom signed permanently for Southampton in February having joined on loan last summer. Eden Hazard, favourite for the main individual award after a superb season in which he has notched 18 goals for the Stamford Bridge outfit, was in midfield along with club colleague Nemanja Matic, Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez. Tottenham forward Harry Kane - tipped to be crowned young player of the year at London's Grosvenor Hotel later on Sunday - was the only English attacking player, chosen up front alongside Chelsea's 19-goal striker Diego Costa. Some Chelsea fans may feel aggrieved that there are not seven players in the team with Cesc Fabregas a notable exception. The midfielder has made 16 league assists this season, 12 more than Coutinho. The PFA Premier League Team of the Year for the 2014-15 season was announced on Sunday . GOALKEEPER - David de Gea (Manchester United) Appearances: 33 . Clean sheets: 10 .

Eden Hazard's impact for Chelsea this season prompted his boss Jose Mourinho to say, rather lightheartedly, this week that the 24-year-old is worth £100m for each leg plus Cristiano Ronaldo.

"Most 25-year-old's would prefer to receive clothing or some of the latest DVD's and video games but not Daley Blind, who was given a large self-portrait of himself and former Holland international father Danny. The Manchester United star, whose birthday was in March, posted a picture of the impressive painting on his Instagram, which includes images of the father and son together. The caption read: 'My late birthday gift just arrived! But it was worth waiting for! Amazing! Thanks mom & dad!! #inspiration.' Daley Blind showed off the impressive portrait that his parents gave him as a late birthday present .

With Champions League qualification close to be secured, the Red Devils return to Europe's elite competition is welcoming after their disappointing season last time around.

"By the time Cesc Fabregas was replaced in the final minute, the mask had gone and the jeers had melted into applause. The appreciative majority overwhelmed the vocal minority to offer a tribute to the Phantom of the Emirates, one of the finest creative midfielders to have worn an Arsenal shirt in the modern era. It’s true they had booed his every touch and perhaps the loudest cheer of the game followed his yellow card for a dive but for Arsenal it is time to stop being haunted by those they have lost or failed to sign and support those they have.

There have been genuine signs of promise in N5 and reasons for optimism in 2015, even if Arsene Wenger was unable to add what would have been a significant other by ending his winless run against Jose Mourinho. It is 13 games and counting, and while the Arsenal boss insists it matters not a jot, it is much to Mourinho’s amusement. ‘It’s about our club and our team, not about me,’ said Wenger. ‘We wanted to win the game for the club. What is important is what happens on the football pitch. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . ‘We want to finish the season well. Every game is difficult but we need to keep the focus until the end of the season. We want to secure the top four, then the top three and the top two, before the FA Cup final.’ To finish as runners-up, for the first time in a decade, and successfully defend the FA Cup, can be framed as progress. More significant is the development of Hector Bellerin, Francis Coquelin and Nacho Monreal. Together with a philosophical tweak, it has made Arsenal a more solid defensive unit, capable of taking points from Manchester City and Chelsea and winning at Manchester United in the FA Cup. Coquelin and Monreal were both ready to make smart fouls at the expense of yellow cards to stop the visitors as they sought to counter quickly. This is not a typical Arsenal trait. Bellerin has been outstanding and few have contained Eden Hazard this season as effectively as the teenager did on Sunday, but Arsenal need more defensive protection and plan to prioritise a defensive midfielder and a new goalkeeper in the summer. ‘We have closed the gap since the start of the season,’ said Wenger. ‘But what happened is that they had the experience at the back and could close the game down. ‘The build-up was quick and sharp but the final ball wasn’t there.’ With five to play, Arsenal trail the champions-elect by 10 points and must concentrate on catching Chelsea in the knowledge their rivals from the capital’s west will strengthen again in the summer. Amid the progress, there remain reasons for concern. Despite the flair overload of Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla, they could not break down a Mourinho team determined to protect their clean sheet. Spanish defender Hector Bellerin (left) has come on leaps and bounds for the Gunners this season . Francis Coquelin of Arsenal evades Fabregas of Chelsea during the 0-0 draw at Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Ozil had glimpses of goal, but Branislav Ivanovic did to Sanchez what Bellerin did to Hazard. Chelsea finished the game with a midfield trio of Nemanja Matic, Kurt Zouma and Ramires, which together with their usually resolute back four amounted to a seven-man defensive shield. In the Sky Sports studio, Arsenal legend Thierry Henry questioned the quality of 18-goal striker Olivier Giroud. ‘Wenger has to strengthen,’ said Henry. ‘In order to win the league you need great players. I don’t think you can win the league with Giroud. Nacho Monreal (left) is among the Gunners players who have impressed recently and did so against Chelsea . ‘Chelsea struggled last year but they went out to buy (Thibaut) Courtois, Cesc, Matic and (Diego) Costa. You see today the difference between a team that did and a team that didn’t strengthen. Arsenal still need four top players.’ Those four would be straight down the spine of the team. Imagine Arsenal if you threaded Courtois, John Terry, Matic and Costa through the centre of their fast and fluent side. Arsenal do not long for a Fabregas. They have players who can offer his vision and passing range. Perhaps the supporters who applauded him from the pitch have come to accept this. Thierry Henry said Arsenal will not win the Premier League if they do not buy another striker . But Chelsea do have individuals who would offer extra physical presence and match-winning know-how which would provide a platform for those like Ozil, Sanchez and Cazorla to deliver. Henry must realise this is not the Wenger way but time for nurturing is running out. The Arsenal manager has two more years on what could be his final contract. If he is to close the gap, catch Chelsea next season and end this hoodoo against Mourinho, then it must be done in the summer transfer market.","Arsenal legend Thierry Henry says ‘Wenger has to strengthen’ the Gunners .

"Ronnie O’Sullivan took off his shoes mid-match at the Crucible on Tuesday — but still socked it to debutant Craig Steadman. The Rocket raced into a 7-2 lead in his first match at this year’s Betfred World Championship in Sheffield. But five-time champion O’Sullivan, 39, could now face a fine after breaching snooker’s strict dress code against the 32-year-old from Manchester. Ronnie O'Sullivan was forced into borrowing a pair of shoes from a member of the Crucible audience . O'Sullivan played a frame of his encounter against fellow Englishman Craig Steadman in his socks . O'Sullivan leans across the table as he lines up a shot during the first round of the World Championship . O’Sullivan almost made a 147 maximum break in the first frame — missing the 14th red on a run of 104. But he played the sixth frame in his socks after removing some new shoes, complaining about a painful big toe. O’Sullivan saw his lead pegged back to 4-2 after losing that frame — and tried to hand his footwear to a fan. He also asked: ‘Does anyone in here have some size eight or nine shoes I can borrow. I’m serious?’ But tournament director Mike Ganley summoned him out of the arena and lent him his own shoes for the last three frames of the session. The WPBSA dress code reads: ‘Each member shall ensure that their dress and appearance is smart and appropriate for a professional player.’ O’Sullivan was given dispensation to wear casual shoes last year at the UK Championship after breaking his ankle. O'Sullivan claimed he was in discomfort during the match due to an injury he sustained in November . The five-time world champion talks with referee Brendan Moore after borrowing a pair of shoes .

UK Championship (5): 1994, 1998, 2002, 2008, 2015. World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn said: ‘The one thing you can be sure of with Ronnie O’Sullivan is that you have absolutely no idea what he is going to do next. ‘I would rather he played with his shoes on if it all possible though. And what happens if his trousers are a bit tight in the next session of his match?’ Meanwhile, Ding Junhui blew the chance to win £30,000 and become only the seventh player to make a maximum at the Crucible. He incredibly played for the blue after the 13th red following 12 blacks and only gasps from the crowd alerted him to the blunder. Ding looked stunned before a doomed long-distance attempt on the black failed. However, he shrugged off the setback to claim a 10-7 victory. Ding, who now plays John Higgins in the second round, said: ‘I was concentrating so hard I forgot. I had been 4-0 behind and doing everything to get back into the match, and already thinking about trying to win the next frame. ‘I only realised what I had done after playing for the blue because the crowd reacted. Then I checked the scoreboard. Hopfully one day I will get another chance to make a 147 at the Crucible, but it was a bit embarrassing.’ Ali Carter, a two-time Crucible finalist, looked in good touch in his first match at the venue since being given the all-clear from lung cancer. O'Sullivan took to Twitter to post a picture of his inflamed left ankle back in November 2014 . Following a 10-5 win over Alan McManus to set up a clash with Neil Robertson, he said: ‘This is where I feel comfortable and most enjoy playing. I have done everything here except win it and that’s what I am here to do. I didn’t want to come here, get some applause, play like an idiot and go home.’ Mark Allen won an incredible nine frames in a row from 3-1 down to blow away Ryan Day 10-3. The 29-year-old from Northern Ireland, who now plays Barry Hawkins, said: ‘That doesn’t happen very often at this level. But that was my C game. Ryan gave the chances rather than me earning them. I will need to play a lot better to be in the mix for the title.’","Ronnie O'Sullivan had to borrow pair of shoes from audience member .

"Manchester United legend Gary Neville has slammed their performance against Everton as 'toothless' following their 3-0 defeat on Sunday. Goals from James McCarthy, John Stones and Kevin Mirallas condemned United to their third successive Premier League loss at Goodison Park as well putting their hopes of a top-four finish at risk. After the match, Red Devils manager Louis van Gaal accused his players of lacking desire. Gary Neville has slammed Manchester United's performance against Everton as 'toothless' on Sunday . Kevin Mirallas scored Everton's final goal in their 3-0 triumph over United at Goodison Park . West Brom (home) - May 2 . Crystal Palace (away) - May 9 . Arsenal (home) - May 16 . Hull (away) - May 24 . Van Gaal admitted he was worried after watching United go through their pre-match warm-up - and those fears were shared by his assistants, Ryan Giggs and Albert Stuivenberg. And speaking on his podcast, Neville concurs with Van Gaal's assessment - adding that it was the Old Trafford outfit's worst performance in the last five or six weeks. 'It was a strange game, and you would have thought that both teams had nothing to play for in some ways,' the 40-year-old said in The Gary Neville Podcast. 'United were toothless, and that is being kind. I didn't really see them try and dribble past a player, make any forward runs. Ashley Young, pictured battling Aaron Lennon, had been in fine form for United - like many of his team-mates - but Neville branded the Red Devils' display against Everton as their worst for five or six weeks . 'At times they were not getting enough men in the box and the final pass was poor. It is the worst I have seen United play for five or six weeks. 'They have been playing so well. Even in defeat at Stamford Bridge last week they played really well. 'Today [Sunday] it wasn't there. It was Everton who had the cutting edge. It was through [Aaron] Lennon, [Romelu] Lukaku and Mirallas when he came on who looked the ones most dangerous to break through either defence.

"Louis van Gaal accused Manchester United’s players of lacking desire after a 3-0 defeat at Everton put their top four hopes back in the balance. The irritation that United’s manager felt following the worst day he has experienced in the Barclays Premier League was obvious and he did not attempt to make any excuses for a performance that was toothless and meek from the outset. Goals from James McCarthy, John Stones and substitute Kevin Mirallas did not flatter Everton and Van Gaal claimed the difference between the two sides came in the attitude and approach they adopted, as United could not match Everton’s commitment. Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao look dejected as they wait to kick off after the third goal . Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal said that his players could not match Everton's motivation .

Van Gaal admitted he was worried after watching United go through their pre-match warm-up at Goodison Park and those fears were shared by his assistants, Ryan Giggs and Albert Stuivenberg, both of whom expressed their concerns to Van Gaal about the squad’s sharpness. ‘When you have a lot of time on the ball, you can lose the ball also easily and then you have to be very sharp in the duels that counts,’ said Van Gaal. ‘When you see the goal after four minutes, three duels in a row we lost and that is an example. ‘This is the first time that I have seen that our motivation, inspiration and aggression was not so high as the opponent and in sport you shall always be compared to your opponent and that was the reason (we lost). ‘I had already the feeling and my colleagues, Ryan and Albert, had the feeling because the warm up was not so good as usual. Then you say that in the last minutes before the game, you hope you can recover and stimulate your players but by then it is too late. Defender Chris Smalling admitted that United were second best from the first minute to the last . Van Gaal fears the defeat has allowed Liverpool to apply pressure to United in the race for fourth . ‘You have to prepare the match already two or three days before and Everton has done that and they have won because of that In the first half we created a lot of chances, five I think, but we never scored. When you see the shots on the goal it is also without conviction. That is not good.’ Chris Smalling said United were 'second best from first minute until last' but Van Gaal maintained preparations in the build-up had gone smoothly. He now recognises Liverpool, who play twice before United’s next game, have a real chance to apply pressure in the race for a Champions League spot. ‘The training sessions were all right,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It is a process because we are playing so well that players think “ok, it shall come” – but it shall not come. You need inspiration, motivation and aggression to win second balls and fight to the end. We’ve given a light to (Liverpool).’ Two former Everton players – Marouane Fellaini and Wayne Rooney – both endured wretched afternoons, with Van Gaal revealing he substituted Fellaini to prevent him being sent-off, while Rooney suffered a knee injury that needs assessing.

The home supporters, however, were not concerned about them and instead basked in their best afternoon of the campaign: Everton have now taken 16 points from the last 18 available and Roberto Martinez saluted a ‘complete’ team performance. ‘There has been a big difference after the amount of time we had to cope with the demands of Europe and the league,’ said Martinez. ‘By the end of January, we got into the right mentality to cope with both competitions. It has been difficult. ‘We were not able to get any momentum in the league in the first half of the season. Our performance today was very similar to our performance against Wolfsburg in the first half of the season. Today I hope the players get the credit they deserve. It has been a tough season. ‘Six games ago we had 28 points and we had to win games. I do feel we were better in every department of the game. We coped with the transition and making the dynamic.

"With broadcasters demanding hefty fees to watch Floyd Mayweather take on Manny Pacquiao next Saturday, many boxing fans could turn towards social media to illegally watch the richest fight in history for free. The recent explosion of live video streaming apps such as Periscope and Meerkat have raised the realistic prospect that Sky and US broadcasters Showtime and HBO could miss out on millions as viewers stream the content between their devices without paying. Launched by Twitter, Periscope allows users to broadcast a live stream to their social media followers. The video is then available to replay for up to 24 hours and can also be saved to the user's phone. Broadcasters could miss out on millions if viewers stream the mega-fight between Floyd Mayweather and Many Pacquiao for free using recent live streaming apps such as Periscope and Meerkat . Twitter's Periscope app allows users to broadcast live video and audio online but has copyright pitfalls . This opens up the possibility of live sports being streamed across social networks for free, despite broadcasters paying millions of pounds to obtain the rights. In the US, viewers are being charged between $89.99 (£59) - $99.99 (£66) to watch the fight while in Britain Sky is offering the bout for £19.99. In America, the NFL recently reminded journalists that 'any unauthorised use of any transmission, picture or other depiction or description of game action, game information, player interview or other arena activity is prohibited... without prior written approval.' And away from sport, HBO, which will broadcast Mayweather vs Pacquiao in America alongside Showtime, issued take down notices last week after the season five premiere of hit show Game of Thrones was streamed. 'We are aware of Periscope and have sent takedown notices,' an HBO spokeswoman said in a statement. 'In general, we feel developers should have tools which proactively prevent mass copyright infringement from occurring on their apps and not be solely reliant upon notifications.' The WBC title belt that will be presented to either Pacquiao or Mayweather at the MGM Grand next Saturday . Periscope has come under fire after the new series of HBO's Game of Thrones was shared online . Periscope allows users to stream live video from their phones to their Twitter accounts with the click of a button. The live streams can be filmed on iPhones and iPads and watched through smartphones, desktops or laptops either through the app or on Twitter's site. Periscope saves the video streams once you are finished, so that they can be viewed for up to 24 hours - while rival Meerkat's live video disappears once you choose the broadcast to end. Existing Twitter users can download the app via the App Store for free before being offered the option of subscribing to their followers' Periscope broadcasts. CLICK HERE to read Periscope's terms of service . Periscope 'lets you share and experience live video from your mobile phone' and is 'a perfect complement to Twitter, which is why we acquired the company in January,' Twitter's Kevin Weil said in a blog post. 'It may sound crazy, but we wanted to build the closest thing to teleportation,' claim the Periscope team. 'While there are many ways to discover events and places, we realized there is no better way to experience a place right now than through live video.' However, its terms of service claims it does not support copyright infringement, but currently relies on reports from users alerting the company to the infringement. 'We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect Periscope users to do the same,' the TOS read. 'We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.' The company has a team dedicated to content review, has the right to remove any illegal content and shut down a person's account if they are found to be violating the TOS. One possible precedent is the use of another app, Vine, which allows users to upload six-second clips. The Premier League was last year forced to remind people not to post copyrighted material after fans started recording goals and sharing them with their friends over social media - with many unaware that what they were doing was illegal. The most popular Vine football accounts have hundreds of thousands of followers, despite Twitter stating: 'Vine users may not post content that violates the rights of a third party.' Mayweather (left) trains with his uncle Roger during a media workout in Las Vegas . In an interview with the BBC, director communications Dan Johnson said: 'You can understand that fans see something, they can capture it, they can share it, but ultimately it is against the law.' 'It's a breach of copyright and we would discourage fans from doing it, we're developing technologies like gif crawlers, Vine crawlers, working with Twitter to look to curtail this kind of activity.' He added: 'I know it sound as if we're killjoys but we have to protect our intellectual property.' Pacquiao takes on the pads with trainer Freddie Roach in front of the watching media . Meanwhile,  Meerkat, which allows users to turn their mobile phones into a portable webcam that lets them live stream whatever their handset is pointing towards, has had its access to some Twitter services cut. Twitter was not impressed when the app imported all of the user's followers and details of who they were following and have limited Meerkat's access, although the company has since has found a way around this by adding a search feature that lets users find their favourite Twitter users. Founder Ben Rubin claims that while other live video services had been available before, they did not take off because of a lack of network capacity and enough people using smartphones for video. 'This truly feels like a beginning of a new era,' Elman said. Premier League goals and highlights are already being made illegally available as Vine posts . Nonetheless, Periscope and Meerkat may not immediately threaten to steal sports broadcasters profits, but they serve as a form of 'grass roots competition,' said John Vrooman, a Vanderbilt University sports economist, told CNBC. 'Streaming apps that allow simultaneous media consumption and production are not in themselves a clear and present danger to sports leagues,' he added. The biggest problem is that watching streamed video from a mobile phone can be a frustrating experience with quality far removed from modern high-definition TV screens -not to mention pop up ads, potential viruses, picture freezes and buffering. A Twitter spokesperson told Sportsmail: 'Periscope will review all reported broadcasts against its content policy, which expressly prohibits the broadcast of copyright-protected material. 'After investigation, Periscope will take down any reported streams that are deemed to infringing. Users who are found to be repeat infringers may face account suspension or termination.' Broadcasters Showtime and HBO in the US and Sky in the UK have bought the rights to the fight, meaning that anyone who streams it in the respective countries will be breaching their copyright. Individual users may have a legal defence if they show small parts of the fight with credit on their Periscope stream, but showing it in its entirety would be illegal. The copyright holders would be entitled to bring legal action against those in breach. However, due to ephemeral nature of Periscope - if users choose not to save their broadcast - and the difficulties in tracking down individuals, the likelihood is that broadcasters would choose to bring a lawsuit against Periscope for facilitating the breach of copyright. At the beginning of the 2014/15 season, the Premier League warned social media users that it was illegal to share clips from games, and claimed it was developing technology to sift through millions of Vines and gifs to target those in breach. Last week HBO in the US issued takedown notices to Twitter, which owns Periscope, over the illegal streaming of the season premiere of Game of Thrones. In its terms of service, Periscope encourages anyone with a copyright complaint to come to them, with evidence of the breach. It also states: 'We reserve the right to remove content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, Periscope will also terminate a user's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.'","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao meet in Las Vegas on May 2 .

"Jose Mourinho has launched a fresh verbal attack on Arsenal, branding their 11 year wait for the Premier League title as 'boring'. Led by skipper John Terry - whose performance was described as his best ever by Mourinho - the Blues produced a defensive master class in a goalless draw at the Emirates Stadium to take a step closer to the championship. Frustrated at what they perceived as the visitors' lack of attacking intent, home supporters chanted: 'Boring, boring Chelsea' throughout Sunday's clash. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has hit out at Arsenal and branded their 11-year wait for the title 'boring' Didier Drogba posted this picture on Instagram  of Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, Cesar Azpilicueta, Eden Hazard, John Terry and Cesc Fabregas after the PFA awards .

West Brom (away) - May 18 . Sunderland (home) - May 24 . Their views were shared by Arsene Wenger, who said Chelsea 'came to defend' after the final whistle. But Mourinho, who started the game without a recognised centre-forward, hit back, insisting Arsenal's 11 years without winning the league is truly mundane. 'Boring, I think, is 10 years without a title. That's very boring,' said the Portuguese. 'You support the club and you're waiting, waiting, waiting for so many years without a Premier League title, so that's very boring. 'But maybe they weren't singing to us. Maybe, when you want to win a game and you're at home and you take your No 9 [Olivier Giroud] off, maybe the home fans want to see Danny Welbeck and Giroud up front. Chelsea are 10 points clear of second placed Manchester City at the top of the table with five games to play . 'The boring team is the second team with most goals in the Premier League, the best goal difference. Only Manchester City have scored more goals than us. 'If you tell the truth, people will fall in love with it. But you have to tell the truth. If you say the truth, you will walk in the truth and people will blow kisses at you.' 'So I think we scored a lot of goals and, in a period where we don't have Diego Costa or Loic Remy and have only one striker, we need to work in a way where he can help ourselves with all the matches we are having. 'We changed a bit our dynamic and we are not scoring so many goals as before. Mourinho, whose side need five points to secure the title, hasn't needed much encouragement in criticising the Gunners since arriving in England in 2004. He labelled Arsene Wenger a 'voyeur' in 2005, before branding the Frenchman a 'specialist in failure' last season. The Special One was much more positive on the performance of his captain at the Emirates Stadium. 'I told John Terry in the dressing room that he made some fantastic performances with me but this was his best,' said Mourinho.

Mourinho believes that Terry's performance against Arsenal was the best of the defender's career . 'It was the best JT has ever played. It was absolutely amazing. One performance at Highbury, I think in my first season, that was a fantastic performance, too. 'But I think today everything was clean: reading the game, giving cover, the defensive line, interceptions, reading the game so well, interceptions with a pass. 'The team was phenomenal, but John was one step ahead of every other player.' Midfielder Oscar, who was taken to hospital with suspected concussion after a heavy collision with David Ospina, started the game at centre-forward. In explaining his decision not to start with a recognised striker, Mourinho, who confirmed Costa and Remy are likely to miss the clash at Leicester, added: 'First of all, Drogba didn't work with us until Saturday so we'd developed the game-plan tactically, on the pitch, for the whole week without [Didier] Drogba. 'We knew that with Oscar we would get behind them like we did so many times in the first half. 'In the second half we played with a target man [Drogba], more on the counter-attack, but every time we recovered the ball on the counter, they made a tactical foul.'

Ribery missed the game after failing to recover from a recent ankle injury while former Roma defender Benatia faces another two weeks out with a groin problem. Robben was unavailable for the encounter with an abdominal injury. David Alaba, meanwhile, is set for a month on the sidelines having partially ruptured knee ligaments playing for Austria at the start of April. Bayern had just 14 fit players to choose from against Porto in the first leg but tore the Portuguese giants apart at the Allianz Arena to progress.

"Cristiano Ronaldo didn't have too much joy with his trademark free-kicks during Real Madrid's victory over neighbours Atletico this week - but it didn't stop him from showing his compassionate side. The Portuguese star has devoted hours on the training field to mastering the art of the perfect set-piece, but even the best in the business occasionally get it wrong. In the white-hot atmosphere of the Santiago Bernabeu prior to Wednesday night's second-leg Champions League quarter-final, when every minute of preparation is key, there was still time for Ronaldo to display a small but heartfelt act of kindness. Cristiano Ronaldo shows his delight after Real Madrid finally broke the deadlock against rivals Atletico . But it was a different story before the game as Ronaldo expressed his concern after his shot hit a supporter . After completing his warm-up routine Ronaldo went over to the touchline and lifted off his training shirt . After receiving the forward's shirt the young supporter was clearly overcome with emotion at the kind act . As the former Manchester United forward trained his sights with long-range attempts, one effort flew wide of the target and into the crowd, striking a young supporter in the front row. Ronaldo winced as he realised the extent of the damage his shot had caused but was ordered to continue preparing for the crucial tie with the rest of Carlo Ancelotti's group. Video courtesy of Sport1, The Netherlands . Once the final sprint drill had been completed, however, the 30-year-old made a dash for the supporter and removed his training shirt. In a classy gesture, Ronaldo offered the young boy the warm-up garment as a consolation for being on the receiving end of his venomous shot. Unsurprisingly, the young Madridista was star-struck by the warm deed, becoming teary-eyed at the unexpected turn of events. Madrid made hard work of a well-drilled Atletico side, but it was poster-boy Ronaldo's pass into Javier Hernandez that killed off the valiant attempts of Diego Simeone's 10 men in the 88th minute of the local affair - much to the delight of the stricken fan and the majority of those at the Bernabeu. Ronaldo's training shirt can be seen scrunched up in the hands of the star-struck supporter on the sideline .","Cristiano Ronaldo's practice shot flies into the crowd hitting young fan .

"UEFA have sensationally charged Pep Guardiola for wearing a t-shirt demanding justice for a journalist who died at last summer’s World Cup. Argentine Jorge Lopez was killed in a suspicious road accident while in Sao Paulo in July. Guardiola was sporting the top - which read ‘#JusticiaParaTopo’ - during his pre-match press conference before Bayern Munich emphatically dumped Porto out of the Champions League. The message appeared to support a campaign to investigate Lopez’s death. UEFA have charged Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola after he wore this t-shirt in a press conference . Guardiola wore the top demanding justice for Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez who died in a car crash at the World Cup . UEFA say Guardiola has been disciplined because of an ‘incident of a non-sporting nature’ Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was killed when a taxi he was travelling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car . Lopez was killed when a taxi he was traveling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car being chased by police. UEFA revealed that the Spanish manager had been disciplined because of an ‘incident of a non-sporting nature’, in a move likely to cause public outcry. The European governing body’s disciplinary regulations read: ‘A breach of these principles is committed by anyone who uses sporting events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature.’ They are to review the case on May 21. On wearing the shirt, Guardiola said: ‘Last week, the family has given me the T-shirt. I woke up this morning and knew that I would put it.’ Lopez was a highly regarded journalist in South America and his passing drew huge outpouring from the very top of the game. Last year Atletico Madrid boss and former Argentina midfielder Diego Simeone tweeted that Lopez was ‘not only a great journalist’ but ‘also a friend’ after hearing of the news. Lionel Messi dedicated Argentina's World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old, who died in Sao Paolo . FIFA, Diego Simeone and Javier Mascherano have also paid tribute to Lopez (pictured with Alfredo de Stefano) Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was working for La Red Radio at the World Cup in Brazil, as well as Ole and Spanish publications AS and Sport. Married to Marca's Argentina correspondent, Veronica Brunatti, López was well connected in Spain, where he arrived to follow the career of Javier Saviola in 2001. Saviola and Topo Lopez remained close friends and he was Ole's correspondent in Barcelona, a newspaper he had worked with since its launch. He had worked as a journalist for two decades, covering River Plate and Argentina for Ole while collaborating with Spanish daily Sport while spending time back in Buenos Aires. In 2010 he became AS's correspondent in Argentina was the journalist closest to Lionel Messi and the many of his team-mates. Lionel Messi also dedicated Argentina’s World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old. ‘Big hug to all the Argentina fans and a very special memory for Jorge “Topo” Lopez,' wrote Messi after their penalties victory against Germany. 'This victory is especially for you, my friend. A big hug to the family, lots of strength.' Earlier this month Javier Mascherano devoted the launch of his new book to Lopez, while he and Messi were both pictured holding placards with the message on late last year. So too did legend Diego Maradona. Both Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have posed in front of a board during team photographs. FIFA also paid tribute to the journalist, with head of media Delia Fischer saying they 'would like to send our sincerest condolences to the family, colleagues and friends of Argentine journalist, Jorge Lopez'.

"Tottenham striker Harry Kane capped off an 'unreal' season as he beat off stiff competition to land the Professional Footballers' Association Young Player of the Year 2015 on Sunday. Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season despite starting the campaign as third-choice striker, netting 30 goals in all competitions for the club while also scoring on his senior England debut. It's been a memorable breakthrough year for Kane, who spent time on loan at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich City and Leicester City before breaking into the Spurs first-team under boss Mauricio Pochettino. Harry Kane capped off an 'unreal' season to land the PFA Young Player of the Year 2015 on Sunday . Kane has scored 20 Premier League goals for Tottenham this year in a dream breakthrough season . The 21-year-old arrived on Sunday having also been shortlisted for the PFA Player of the Year award .

Kane came through the White Hart Lane club's youth ranks and he made his Premier League debut for Spurs during the 2012-13 season but it wasn't until this season that he broke into the first-team. He struck a free-kick winner from the bench at Aston Villa in early November and was then given a run of games by Mauricio Pochettino, with fellow frontmen Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor failing to deliver. And he has not looked back since. 'It is amazing. It is a very proud moment for myself and my family - hopefully the first of many to come,' Kane said of his award. 'I have got to keep working hard, but to be recognised by your fellow players is something special and it is a night I wont forget. It is incredible, an incredible feeling. 'It is amazing. It is a very proud moment for myself and my family - hopefully the first of many to come,' Kane said of his award.

Kane tweeted before the ceremony: 'All set for the big night, big thanks to @paulsmithdesign for the suit!' In what has been a memorable breakthrough season, Kane also scored on his senior England debut . The England international also scored a brace in Tottenham's 5-3 victory against Chelsea on New Year's Day . The Tottenham striker was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year on Sunday . 2 - Player of the Month awards won back-to-back by Kane, making him only the fourth player to do so in the Premier League. 3 - He scored his first Spurs hat-trick in the Europa League in 2014, and even finished the game in goal after a red card for Hugo Lloris. 4 - Kane spent spells on loan at four different clubs before making his mark at White Hart Lane: Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester. 6 - The striker had scored just six goals for Tottenham before a remarkable 2014-15 campaign. 8 - The age Kane was when he spent a year with the Arsenal academy. 20 - The number of goals hit by Kane in the Premier League alone so far this season. 21 - His age when he made his senior debut for England. 49 - Despite making this number of appearances this season, Kane wants to represent England in the Under-21 European Championships this summer. 79 - The number of seconds it took Kane to score in an England shirt after coming off the bench for a debut against Lithuania. 2015 - Kane has scored 16 goals since the turn of the year. 'It is incredible, an incredible feeling.' Asked to sum up his season in one word, Kane went for: 'Unreal.' Never doubting himself, had he been told 12 months ago this was his destiny, Kane said: 'I'd have said let's do it - let's get it on. 'A lot has changed since then but I have always believed in my ability and have been waiting for a chance to express myself. I didn't think it would go as quickly as it has done but I have managed to ride the wave and the season has got better and better. 'I got the opportunity with the gaffer and I have really enjoyed my season so far - I have taken my chance and this is why we are here.' Kane has been the shining light of the Tottenham side, and said: 'We have worked hard and I have worked hard to get to where we are now. It is going great and hopefully it is the start with more to come.' His stand-out occasion of the season came not in a Tottenham shirt, but when Roy Hodgson ushered him into the England side, Kane scoring after 79 seconds of his debut off the bench against Lithuania on March 27, in a European Championship qualifier. Asked for his favourite moment, Kane said: 'Making my England debut and getting that goal - it was a very proud moment. It made it even more special. 'For a footballer, to represent their country is the pinnacle, and I'm very proud. I was able to do that and it was a moment I won't forget.' Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino tipped the Chingford-born forward for even bigger things after he scored in the recent 3-1 win at Newcastle, to become the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to reach 30 club goals in a season. Kane beat off stiff competition from Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea (pictured) to win the award . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (right) was joined by team-mate Philippe Coutinho at the awards bash .

'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' Kane captained the north London outfit for the first time in a goalless draw at Burnley earlier this month.

Arsenal winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chelsea defender Gary Cahill pitted themselves against  Jack Nowell of Exeter Chiefs and Bath's George Ford at England Rugby's training centre in Pennyhill Park, Bagshot. Oxlade-Chamberlain, who used to play scrum-half himself, impressed the rugby stars by taking a quick word of advice before 'nailing' his opening attempt at kicking a conversion - while Cahill seemed more concerned by wearing an oversized shirt.

"Chelsea were forced to substitute Oscar during the derby against Arsenal after their creative midfielder suffered 'possible concussion' in the first half. The Brazilian collided with an onrushing David Ospina in the 16th minute at the Emirates Stadium and was sent to hospital at half time for checks. It looked as if the Arsenal goalkeeper had given away a penalty, but referee Michael Oliver waved away Chelsea's protestation following the painful clash. Oscar was clattered into by Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina during Sunday's London derby . Sky Sports revealed that Jose Mourinho said the Brazilian was taken off due to 'possible concussion' Oscar was knocked back by the goalkeeper but Michael Oliver didn't award Chelsea a penalty . Didier Drogba replaced Oscar at the break, with Sky Sports revealing that Jose Mourinho had told them the decision was taken because of concussion concerns over the latter. It means Oscar played on for half an hour before being properly assessed, potentially bringing the concussion debate into the public domain again. 'He went to the hospital at halftime,' Mourinho said. 'We are waiting. We don't know yet (if it's concussion).' Television pundits Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness and Thierry Henry were all in agreement that it should have been a penalty. Carragher said: 'It was a definitely penalty. It could even be a red card.’ Henry said: 'The adrenalin will sometimes bring you back to the field. Maybe he thought he could not go back on after sitting in the dressing room for 15 minutes.’ Oscar appeared in a bad way immediately after being poleaxed by the Gunners' goalkeeper . He attempted to get up but his arms fell back down to the turf in direct response to the hit . The collision was in the 16th minute but Oscar still manage to play on until half-time .","Chelsea weren't awarded a penalty for David Ospina's clash with Oscar .

"Hard-hitting Chris Hala'ufia flattened a streaker and was then sent off for a brutal attack on Leicester forward Laurence Pearce during Saturday's Aviva Premiership clash. The Tongan number eight, who has been warned in the past over his ill-discipline, halted Pearce in his tracks with a shoulder charge and left him prone on the ground. After studying replays on the big screen, referee Tim Wigglesworth showed Hala'ufia a yellow card and then changed it to red after he had seen him shove Pearce's head into the ground. London Welsh forward Chris Hala'ufia  tackles a streaker during Saturday's Aviva Premiership match . Hala'ufia halted  Laurence Pearce with a shoulder charge and then shoved his head into the turf . Leicester number eight Pearce was left prone on the ground after the challenge by Hala'ufia . Hala'ufia then grabbed Pearce's head and rammed into the turf, earning him a red card . Watch Chris Hala'ufia's brutal assault on Laurence Pearce . The dismissal of Hala'ufia helped Leicester Tigers boost their hopes of a top-four finish with a workmanlike bonus point 38-17 win. Leicester fought back from a shock 10-7 half time deficit to score 31 points in a one sided second half against the relegated Welsh. Captain Ben Youngs scored Leicester's first try in the third minute and five more followed after the interval from Laurence Pearce (two), Sam Harrison, Jamie Gibson, and Tom Youngs. London Welsh's tries came from Koree Britton and Opeti Fonua. Leicester, however, left the field at half time to boos and whistles from a section of the Welford Road crowd who were unhappy with a lethargic, error-strewn performance from their team. It was the first time the Welsh had led at half time in the Premiership this season and, while they did not play well, they fought for everything and scored a well-deserved try in the 38th minute. It came moments after a male streaker had enlivened proceedings by running across the pitch. He was flattened by a flying tackle from Hala'ufia before being escorted from the ground by two stewards . Some were not sure where to look when the streaker ran on to the pitch during the first half . Imposing number eight Hala'ufia took exception to the interruption in play by the naked fan . Hala'ufia decided to take matters into his own hands and help remove the streaker . Whether that proved a distraction to kicker Chris Elder is a moot point but the winger then missed a relatively easy penalty before the Welsh took the lead with a try after a surging run from Hala'ufia. Hala'ufia found hooker Britton who dived under the posts, with replacement Will Robinson adding the conversion. It seemed a lot longer than 35 minutes since Leicester had started the match with a bang, scrum half and captain Ben Youngs sauntering over for an easy try in the fourth minute from a line-out with the Welsh defence having gone missing. Freddie Burns' conversion made it 7-0 and the crowd sat back and probably expected an avalanche of points against a side already relegated, having gained just one bonus point all season and shipped 869 points before this match.. The pitch invader managed to get back to his feet despite the hit from Hala'ufia . The streaker was finally escorted from the ground by two stewards . But the rout never came as Leicester made error after error, particularly at the breakdown, and after Elder had missed a 16th minute penalty he put the visitors on the board with a beauty from a metre inside his own half. The Exiles' lead did not last long because Leicester, probably after a half time rollicking, scored three minutes after the break, No8 Laurence Pearce getting the touchdown after a rolling maul, the decision coming from the TMO. Burns missed the conversion. Pearce got his second seven minutes later, finishing off a lovely outside break by Mathew Tait to make it 17-10. Burns hit a post with the conversion attempt. Things got worse for the Welsh in the 55th minute when Hala'ufia was sent off after he halted Pearce in his tracks with a shoulder charge and left him prone on the ground. After studying replays on the big screen, referee Tim Wigglesworth showed Hala'ufia a yellow card and then changed it to red after he had seen him shove Pearce's head into the ground. The bonus point try came in the 65th minute after a brilliant counter from full-back Niall Morris. Although hauled down just short of the line, replacement scrum half Harrison dummied before stretching over a pile of bodies to get the touchdown which Burns converted. Flanker Gibson got the fifth, his strength taking him over in the right corner, which replacement Tommy Bell converted. With seven minutes left giant replacement Fonua got the Exiles second try from a tap penalty near the line. Robinson converted. Replacement hooker Tom Youngs scored Leicester's sixth with two seconds left. Bell converted.","Chris Hala'ufia flattened a streaker with flying tackle at Leicester .

"Arsenal Fan TV favourite Claude Callegari may well have been speaking for a number of Gunners fans when demanding for the Cesc Fabregas flag to be taken down from the side of the Emirates Stadium.

"Sportsmen will go to extreme lengths to mend their battered bodies ahead of the next challenge, and that includes inserting multiple needles into their necks. English golfer Ian Poulter is an acupuncture convert who often uses the painful-looking alternative medicine technique to recover from the various strains that come with the sport. The 39-year-old posted an Instagram picture of back of his head with eight needles stuck in his neck, accompanied by the caption: 'I feel like a pin cushion'. Ian Poulter shared an Instagram picture of what looked like a painful acupuncture session . The English golfer has used the alternative medicine technique to aid his recovery in the past . Poulter has just come off a strong finish at the US Masters where successive final rounds of 67 saw him finish tied sixth at Augusta, while sending a strong message to impressed Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke. 'I was proud of the way I played over the weekend - I only missed four greens in regulation in the final two rounds, which is a bit special around here,' Poulter said. 'I gave myself so many chances, and I could have even gone lower over these last 36. It makes the first couple of days even more frustrating, because I left far too many spots in really bad places - and I should know better at this place.' Clarke, who partnered Poulter at the event told Sporting Life: 'That's the best I have ever seen him play. It was a 67 that could have been a 63 standing on his head.' Poulter is confident of winning a first tour title since the HSBC Champions in 2012, saying: 'I know I will.

Poulter is not the only leading sportsman to seek out unorthodox treatments to aid recovery. World boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jnr. recently shared a video of himself receiving a SubZero recovery cool down in Las Vegas ahead of his $300million mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao in May. The treatment known as kriotherapy (or cryotherapy) involves exposing the body to freezing temperatures of -200C for between 1-3minutes  to assist muscle recovery as well as decrease inflammation and soreness after a training session. Kriotherapy has also been used by the Wales rugby union team as well as Tottenham players including Andros Townsend, Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen - while Real Madrid superstar has had his own 'ice chamber' installed at home. Head of sports science at Manchester City (and formerly with Spurs), Dr Sam Erith, has said: 'Kriotherapy means you can train more, to get fitter more quickly.

Other alternative treatments including that used by NBA player Amar'e Stoudemire are even stranger. The New York Knicks star revealed he's been taking red wine baths over the past six months to help rejuvenate his body. The 31-year-old, who has had long-standing problems with his knees during his career, believes the remedy has helped him recover much better after games and revitalised him. He said of the treatment: 'The red wine bath is very important to me because it allows me to create more circulation in my red blood cells. 'Plus, it's very hot, so it's like a hot tub. But it's also the red wine ... it just kind of soothes the body. NBA star Amar'e Stoudemire takes a selfie of himself taking a red wine bath to help with his recovery . Robin van Persie is one of several players who have used horse placenta massages to aid recovery . But, perhaps the most unusual alternative treatment is that carried out by Serbian housewife/therapist Marianna Kovacevic who uses the placental fluid from a horse to massage strained muscles. Manchester United striker Robin van Persie is one of several Premier League players who has used the left field method after he attempted to speed up his recovery from an ankle injury picked up during international duty in 2009. 'I am going to try. It cannot hurt and, if it helps, it helps,' he said ahead of the treatment. Manchester City players Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany and Nigel de Jong were reportedly so impressed by the treatment that they asked for Kovacevic to join the club's medical staff, an offer which ultimately refused.","Ian Poulter often uses acupuncture to help his recovery .

"Jockey Blake Shinn rode his pants off in the opening race of a meeting in Sydney. Literally. The 27-year-old bared all to those at the Hyland Race Colours Plate in Canterbury, Austalia as he attempted to ride Miss Royale to victory. During the final turn in Race 1, Shinn stood up on his horse to gain momentum as he tried to overtake leader Tommy Berry with the finishing line in sight.

Shinn's (right) elastic in his pants gave way as he attempted to ride Miss Royale to victory on Thursday . However, unfortunately for Shinn the only thing sight that took the gaze of those watching was his naked behind. Atop Miss Royale as it tore down the home straight, the elastic in Shinn's pants gave way, exposing his backside to punters track-side. 'I was more worried about winning the race. They [the pants] went just after the start and there was nothing I could do,' he said afterwards. 'I think a lot of people are going to have a bit of fun with this, but they can't say I wasn't focused and went to the line.' The 27-year-ol Shinn was forced to ride more than 200 metres to the finish line with his pants down . Despite his embarrassing mishap, Shinn was in good spirits after the race when he jokingly compared his situation to that of beauty queen Jennifer Hawkins. Back in 2004, Hawkins' skirt slipped off her waist during the Westfield Miranda catwalk fashion parade. And Shinn saw the funny side of his own untimely reveal by tweeting: 'Now I know how Jen Hawkins feels. Tried to give my fellow jocks a bum steer but unfortunately backfired. Should of had my @BondsAus on.' Australian beauty queen Jennifer Hawkins embarrassingly revealed her backside during a catwalk in 2004 . Acting chief steward Greg Rudolph said he had never seen anything like it in his time in racing. 'He needed a belt at the 200-metre mark,' Rudolph said. 'We usually report gear malfunctions, but we are leaving that one alone,' Mr Rudolph said, according to Fairfax Media. Unfortunately for the champion jockey, he wasn't able to win the race, but he proved once and for all he always has a crack.","Jockey Blake Shinn lost his pants while riding down the home straight .

"This gruesome video shows how a man popped a huge cyst in his arm with a needle, screwdriver and a pair of pliers. The man, known only as Jason, from Vancouver, uploaded the clip to YouTube after his wife filmed the stomach-churning moment. It begins with him explaining exactly how he will pop the grape-sized growth on his wrist. He says: 'We have the pliers, they're going to hold onto the needle which will then be smashed into my cyst with the end of a screwdriver. 'It should be pretty cool.' The man, known only as Jason, uploaded the video to YouTube of his unique way of popping a cyst - using a needle, a pair of pliers and a screwdriver. Pictured is his sister in law putting the needle into the swelling . As Jason's sister in law hammers the needle deeper into the cyst with the handle of a screwdriver, he emits loud cries of pain . First, he lays his left arm down on some kitchen roll on a table so the lump is easily accessible. His sister-in-law then inserts the needle into the cyst and holds it in place with a pair of pliers as he winces. She then begins the horrifying process of hammering the needle deeper into the growth. Sharp cries of pain are heard from Jason with each hit. Astonishingly, though the process seems too agonising to bear, Jason says: 'I think we can go a little deeper'. After one last hammer – which was once again met with a loud moan – he says: 'It's in there pretty good. Now we've got to pull it out. Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, condemned Jason's method of popping his cyst with a needle, pliers and a screwdriver. He told MailOnline: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. 'They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'It’s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels. Traditionally, ganglions would be 'bashed with the family bible', but doctors do not advise this . 'From a hygiene point of view you’ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force by using a screwdriver, and that’s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. 'If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating. 'There used to be a myth that you should bash a ganglion with a family bible to burst it. 'That’s caused problems with the fluid going into the wrist joint, causing carpel tunnel syndrome: swelling inside the wrist. 'If we did treat it, we’d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as ""aseptic"", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection. 'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand. 'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it’s best to be left alone. 'Then it will be followed up and receive proper after care.' 'I'm going to see if we can get the fluid squirting out if it does.' Moments later, he takes the needle out and asks the camera to zoom in on his arm. As he squeezes the cyst, sticky, translucent jelly comes rushing out and gathers in a pea-sized ball. 'Let's see what the consistency looks like,' he said as he rubs the gluey substance between two fingers. He adds: 'This is probably the grossest thing I've ever seen – since the last time I've done this. 'This will probably do the trick for three or so months until I have to pop it again.' Uploading the video to YouTube under the name 'The Wrist Cyst', he promises to upload another video in another three months time when he pops the cyst again. Unsurprisingly, medical professionals do not advise using Jason's method to treat lumps found on the body. Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, explains that Jason's cyst is a ganglion, a fluid-filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon. They are made up of a thick jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them during movement - and occur when this fluid leaks out and collects under the skin. Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most commonly found on the wrist, hand and fingers. Generally harmless, if they do not cause any pain, they can be left alone and will disappear without any treatment. Dr Ghosh said: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'A ganglion is a fluid-filled sack. If you start the drainage process, the bigger and bigger the sack will fill. 'This is the issue this gentleman has caused, he’ll need to drain it more often.' Traditionally, ganglions were treated by being 'bashed with the family Bible', but this is no longer recommended, as this could cause the fluid to disperse and cause carpel tunnel syndrome - a swelling in the wrist - he added. Dr Ghosh added Jason's method was also not advisable either. He told MailOnline: 'It’s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels. It’s unhygienic, you can’t control the force and you could damage the nerves in the hand. 'From a hygiene point of view you’ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force by using a screwdriver, and that’s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating.' He removes the needle and squeezes the cyst, and a ball of sticky, see-through jelly-like fluid emerges . Jason rubs his fingers together to show the sticky consistency of the fluid that comes out of the growth, which doctors explain is synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them . At the end of the video, Jason says the cyst will need draining again in three months. But doctors strongly advise against his method - and say ganglions do not normally require treatment . If the cyst needs treatment, the fluid should be drained out with a needle and syringe by a doctor, or cut out in a surgical procedure. Dr Ghosh added: 'If we did treat it, we’d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as ""aseptic"", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection. 'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand. 'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it’s best to be left alone.

"Tiger Woods has had to face some huge challenges during his career, but not many will have been larger than 7ft 6in former NBA star Yao Ming. The 14-time major winner has played just three tournaments so far this year, which included a return to some form at the US Masters, but took a break to offer the retired Chinese basketball star a few golfing tips.

The 39-year-old announced on Twitter that he will tee it up at TPC Sawgrass for the tournament often labelled as the 'fifth major'. 'Looking forward to going back to THE PLAYERS this year, hoping for a repeat of 2013,' he said. Woods' confirmed return will dampen fears over a wrist injury he appeared to suffer during the final round at Augusta when he hit a tree root. 'A bone kind of popped out and the joint kind of went out of place, but I put it back in,' he said. Woods, pictured with Rory McIlroy, found some form on his return to the US Masters . Woods will be back at the TPC Sawgrass, allaying fears over a wrist injury picked up at Augusta . Speculation over Woods' return had been circulating ever since the Masters when, following rounds of 73, 69, 68 and 73, he refused to confirm when he would be back in action. 'Not going to be for a while,' he said. 'I have a little time off, and go back to the drawing board, work on it again, and refine what I'm doing. 'I really like what I'm doing, I got my distance back, and everything is good.' Jack Nicklaus said this week that Woods would feature at the Memorial at Muirfield Village beginning on June 4 but he will now be back earlier than that at a tournament that he won in 2001 and 2013.","Tiger Woods gave former NBA star Yao Ming a few tips on his swing .

"Brendan Rodgers has vowed to do 'what is best' for Daniel Sturridge as the Liverpool striker's injury misery shows no sign of relenting. Sturridge will again be absent for Tuesday night's trip to Hull and while Rodgers will not take the drastic step of calling time on his campaign, he remains unsure whether the England international will play again this season.

"Early in the build-up to Aston Villa’s winning goal on Sunday, Steven Gerrard challenged for successive headers in the centre circle and lost both. That doesn’t mean he was at fault for what happened in the subsequent 20 seconds but it was illustrative nevertheless of a long, sapping afternoon for Liverpool and their fading captain. Gerrard’s time at Liverpool will now end in anti-climax. The chances are that he will say his farewells via a series of short cameos, many of them as a substitute. Steven Gerrard was denied the chance of a happy ending as Aston Villa beat Liverpool at Wembley . Liverpool captain Gerrard reacts as Tom Cleverley celebrates Aston Villa's victory on Sunday . Gerrard looks on dejected as his Liverpool career draws to an antic-climatic close at Wembley . By the time the FA Cup final rolls around next month his thoughts will already have turned to a new life in California. His manager Brendan Rodgers said after his team’s defeat that Gerrard had been excellent. Sadly, that isn’t true. Gerrard was poor throughout, unable to shift the momentum of a Liverpool performance that will rank as one of the great disappointments of the club’s recent years. If Rodgers had hoped for a display from Gerrard that would fit the rather romantic narrative of him returning to Wembley on his birthday then he was disappointed. Gerrard’s efforts fitted not the occasion but instead a Liverpool team showing that was low on energy, wit or strategy. For the latter, of course, Rodgers himself must take the blame. Gerrard was disappointing in midfield, as he has been all season, but Brendan Rodgers must take the blame . Gerrard was deployed in a number of different roles by Rodgers (right) throughout the contest . Without a trophy for the third season running and unlikely to qualify for the Champions League, this is a campaign that must now be labelled a failure. As such, Rodgers will head in to the summer under gently increasing pressure at Anfield to produce something tangible next time round. Certainly, Rodgers failed spectacularly here at Wembley and, as such, his sense of regret will mirror that of his captain. 0 . Brendan Rodgers is the first Liverpool manager since Phil Taylor in 1956-59 to not win a trophy in his first three seasons. 3 . Dejan Lovren had the joint-most shots for Liverpool in this game (three, level with Steven Gerrard). 4 . Mario Balotelli was flagged offside four times, more than any other player in the game, despite only coming on at half-time. 3 . Liverpool managed just three shots on target in the game. 12 . Liverpool have won 12 of 31 games (39 per cent) when Steven Gerrard has started this season, compared to 13 of 21 (62 per cent) when he hasn’t. 18 . Despite playing the full 90 minutes, Raheem Sterling managed just 18 passes in the match — the fewest of any player in the starting 22. Rodgers changed his formation after 20 minutes on Sunday. Villa had begun the game strongly and Liverpool couldn’t get the ball. Then, at half-time, he rolled his dice again, sending on Mario Balotelli and moving Raheem Sterling from a centre forward role that always seems so alien to him. Rodgers pointed out that he has done this before, stressed that his changes weren’t indicative of his own errant planning. It was hard to agree, though. The Irishman can be a clever coach but on Sunday he didn’t appear so. Rather he looked a little muddled, unable to turn a game that only ever looked as though it may go Liverpool’s way for the six minutes they spent in the lead following Philippe Coutinho’s first half goal. Facing a team and a young manager with a firm game plan that centred on the muscularity and threat of centre forward Christian Benteke, Rodgers seemed not to have one of his own. Missing Daniel Sturridge through injury once again, Rodgers chose to overlook his three alternatives – Balotelli, Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert – in favour of a front three featuring Sterling in the central role. It was a familiar look but equally it is a system that rarely appears to suit Liverpool. It asks too much of Sterling as well as taking him from the wide position from which he always looks most dangerous. When Villa had the ball and moved forwards energetically through the excellent Fabian Delph and Jack Grealish, they did so in great number, flooding the final third of the pitch with claret and blue. Liverpool, on the other hand, couldn’t replicate it, their full-backs too deep and Sterling too often drowning in a sea of Aston Villa shirts. To play without a focal point is very difficult, especially in a game where the stakes are so high. As Sturridge continues to struggle for health, Liverpool’s problems in that area – given the complete lack of faith in his supposed understudies – are very real and to solve that in the transfer market without the promise of Champions League football to use as bait will be some challenge for Liverpool’s much-discussed transfer committee.

Gerrard begins to say his goodbyes as his Liverpool career edges closer to an anti-climatic end . Gerrard leaves the pitch following his side's 2-1 FA Cup semi-final defeat by Villa at Wembley . For a time at Wembley – a very short time – it looked as though Coutinho and Jordan Henderson may haul Liverpool to where they needed to be. Their goal came on the back of a short period of better play when it went in off the knee of Villa substitute Jores Okore and it seemed as though Rodgers’ players would build off that platform. But as Rodgers conceded himself afterwards, too many of his team fell short. It’ s a problem that has shown itself before in key games – namely against Chelsea at the end of last season and at home to Manchester United last month. “It looked as though the occasion got to us,” said Rodgers. “That can happen and we’ve come up short in a few games. “The focus can go awry. We were too passive.” A startling admission from a Liverpool manager, it was nevertheless hard to disagree. Villa had the edge from the get-go, they had brightness to their play, they played only with ambition and optimism. There was not a hint of fear. On the touchline in the second half, Rodgers was unable to change things. The Balotelli substitution did not work, Emre Can’s deployment at full-back gave Liverpool nothing while Lambert’s introduction in the 90th minute came so late as to be rather pointless. Belatedly there was some pressure but it lacked conviction. There was no cavalry charge and Gerrard’s late free-kick – his one chance to make an impression – was as limp as it was by then rather predictable. For Liverpool’s titan, the season’s end cannot now come quickly enough. Delph and team-mate Westwood celebrate their FA Cup win over Liverpool at Wembley .

The Uruguayan has struggled in the shadow of Zlatan Ibrahimovic during his time in the French capital, and continued to toil at the Camp Nou, as Laurent Blanc's side went down to a comfortable 2-0 second-leg defeat.

"Brendan Rodgers insists Liverpool’s transfer ambitions will not be compromised by their inability to offer Champions League football – as they step up their pursuit of Memphis Depay. While Manchester United remain favourites to land the exciting Holland international, Liverpool were given permission by PSV Eindhoven to hold with Depay. Paris St Germain have also spoken to the 21-year-old, who scored 21 goals in the Eredivise this season. Brendan Rodgers is hoping Memphis Depay will choose Liverpool as his next destination . PSV are looking for £25million for Depay, who has also been linked with Bayern Munich, and while Rodgers would neither confirm nor deny Liverpool’s interest, he did acknowledge it is players of Depay’s quality he is aiming to attract. Rodgers does not intend to be as busy as last year when he made eight new signings – Burnley’s Danny Ings and James Milner of Manchester City are prime targets, while Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke could be an option – but Depay is a marker of their ambitions. How, though, will they lure targets from outside the top four? Liverpool’s recent history is littered with moves for big players that collapsed – Alexis Sanchez are Diego Costa are prime examples – and taking a backward step this season will not have helped them. Rodgers, who saw similar failings hinder his side in a tepid 0-0 draw with West Brom, accepts there is a big challenge facing Liverpool this summer but is confident they will be able to bring in the required quality.

There will be a raft of players that will be looked at. Then it will be up to the club to see if they are affordable and available. There are targets that have been identified as a priority. We will have to see if they are available.’ Inevitably, there will be players who Rodgers would like to sign that won’t consider joining Liverpool simply because they are not in the Champions League but the manager believes they have done enough since he arrived to withstand this season’s setback. ‘If we are not in the Champions League, players will still maybe want to come,’ said Rodgers, who could be without Steven Gerrard at Hull tomorrow night after he picked up a “knock”. ‘But if it’s right for the players, and the project is right for them to learn and develop, I think if they have watched us over a few years, if we can regroup and get some quality starters in, we can go on another great adventure and get back in there. ‘If we are looking to regain what we had last season, we need that tempo to our game and our approach play.

"He loves fast cars, big houses and flash clothes so Floyd Mayweather isn't one to hold back in the kitchen either, given that he pays up to $1,000 per plate when the food is cooked by Chef Q. The boxer invited compatriot Adrien Broner for a feast at his mansion, as he continues his preparation for the $300million mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao. Broner, a three-time world champion, took to Instagram to show off the food on show. Floyd Mayweather is willing to splash the cash in the food department by paying over $1,000 per dish .

The fight is at the welterweight limit of 66.7 kg, with the 38-year-old adopting an all-organic diet to be in the best shape of his life. Adrien Broner and Mayweather are known to be close friends with both training at the same gym . With the fight tickets selling out in under 60 seconds, it's poised to be one of the most memorable and iconic clashes in the history of sport.

"St Mirren skipper Steven Thompson has apologised to team-mate John McGinn after accidentally spearing him with a training ground pole. The Scotland Under 21 player is now on crutches and will miss the rest of the season after a prank at Saints' Renfrewshire training ground went badly wrong on Thursday. Gary Teale's first-team squad were doing a dribbling drill when veteran Thompson lost possession to McGinn and stumbled into two poles which were intended for the players to run through. St Mirren's Steven Thompson acidentally speared team-mate John McGinn with a pole in training last week . McGinn (left) will miss the rest of the season after being stabbed in the leg by the pole . Thompson threw one at McGinn in jest – and to his horror it stabbed him on the leg, leaving him requiring hospital attention. Thompson subsequently scored two goals in Saints 4-1 win over Kilmarnock on Saturday and is believed to have given his win bonus to his stricken team-mate. But on Sunday night the striker was still coming to terms with injuring one of the club's brightest talents in such a bizarre manner. 'The whole thing has been a complete nightmare,' Thompson said. 'John is going to be okay but I'm mortified that it happened in the first place. I was having a carry-on and it turned sour. 'It was a stupid prank, something silly, and it ended with John being injured. I can't apologise enough.' Thompson netted his 50th goal for his boyhood heroes at the weekend. But he insists it's been impossible to get the training ground incident out of his mind. Thompson celebrates the first of his two goals against Kilmarnock in Saturday's 4-1 victory . 'It's all I've been able to think about since it happened on Thursday,' he added. 'I feel so bad. It was an accident but it's still something I regret. 'We were doing a drill where, to score goals, we had to dribble between two poles which were sticking in the ground as gates. 'When I got to a set of poles John tackled me and one of the poles got stuck between my legs. 'It sounds stupid now but for banter I grabbed one of the poles and pretended I was doing some kind of Ninja move. 'I threw it into the ground behind John who, by this point, was running away and facing in the other direction. 'But as I did that, he did a Cruyff turn and the pole stabbed him in the leg. We were only a few feet apart. It wasn't as if I launched it 10 metres like a javelin. He was right next to me. St Mirren boss Gary Teale shakes hands with his captain Thompson on the touchline at St Mirren Park . 'I just hadn't counted on him changing direction when he did.' Thompson could only watch in horror at what unfolded. 'It was just horrendous,' he said. 'It was the worst thing I have seen in my life. Since then it's all I've been thinking about. 'It popped in and out of his thigh instantly and for a few seconds his leg was black. But then blood started pouring out of the hole. 'John was obviously in agony. A few of us carried him inside and he got treatment. It was horrendous. 'I've been shocked by it and really down. I like a laugh and a joke in training but for this to happen is just unbelievable.

"The distinctive head bop was still there and the white socks pulled up over the calves but plastered across her face was something we are not used to seeing during Paula Radcliffe’s races – a beaming smile. When she set the World Record of 2:15.25 in the London Marathon in April 2003 – a time no woman has threatened 12 years later – there was no grinning until after she crossed the line. Similarly in 2005 when she recorded her third and final victory over the 26.2mile course from Blackheath to The Mall, emotions were kept in check until the end. The crowd lining the London Marathon course cheers for Paula Radcliffe as she wraps up a stellar career . Radcliffe breaks down at the end of the London Marathon on Sunday, her final competitive race . The world record holder for 12 years, Radcliffe said the time was irrelevant in her final London Marathon . Radcliffe runs down The Mall hand-in-hand with a fellow runner as she  takes in the atmosphere . But a time of 2:36.55 in her final competitive marathon is not to be sniffed at for a 41-year-old with a left foot as flexible as a rod of iron who described herself as ‘unfit and unprepared’ for the race. It is well inside 2:42.00, the IAAF qualifying standard for the Rio Olympics next summer. The British Athletics standards – which are likely to be sterner - have yet to be announced but it is immaterial as Radcliffe maintained this was it for her elite running career. ‘My body can’t train at this level any more,’ she said, ‘In Kenya [where she did a winter training camp] I pushed myself too hard and I broke down. I’m sure the magic of London helped me run faster than I would or should have been capable of.’ Radcliffe was due to give a BBC interview on Tower Bridge with Denise Lewis but the former heptathlete could not keep up. ‘She ran alongside me for a little bit but it was too loud and I didn’t want to stop because I was worried my foot wouldn’t be able to start again.’ Instead of running with the elite women, Radcliffe chose to take off with the 37,000-strong mass field . Radcliffe smiles at the front of the mass group as the elite men prepare to set off on their run . The 41-year-old sets off with the main field after having barely run since February due to injury . Radcliffe was in nowhere near the condition she was in when she set the 26.2mile world record in 2003 . Radcliffe began strongly, running at 2:30.00 pace for the opening 10kilometres. ‘I ran the first mile in 5min30sec which was way too quick but every time someone shouted in the crowd it boosted me up again,’ said Radcliffe, . ‘I felt the achilles twinge at 7 miles then backed off. As much as my body wanted it to finish I didn’t want it to end.’ In the women’s elite race, the attention pre-race was centred on four Kenyan women but Tigist Tufa broke away from the pack to become only the third Ethiopian to win the London marathon, after Derata Tulu in 2001 and Aselefech Mergia in 2010. Tufa, who the bookmakers judged a 25/1 shot before the race, crossed the line in 2:23.22 with two-time winner Mary Keitany 18 seconds behind. Ethiopia’s Tirfi Tsegaye was third in 2:23.41. Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge, a World Champion over 5,000m, triumphed in the men’s race in 2:04.42, five seconds ahead of his compatriot Wilson Kipsang.

"This time there was no man in a Grim Reaper costume waiting for the Manchester United manager behind the dug-out at Goodison Park. The dark days of ridicule for the Barclays Premier League’s most successful club have now gone. Nevertheless, there was a reminder here for David Moyes’s successor at United that the task before him remains vast. Moyes lost 2-0 here just over a year ago and it transpired to be his last game in charge. This result for Louis van Gaal was a goal worse, the performance just as disappointing. James McCarthy finishes past David de Gea to put Everton ahead in just the fifth minute, following a blistering counter-attack . McCarthy celebrates his strike in front of the Goodison Park crowd as Everton began brightly against Manchester United . John Stones (second left) watches as Ashley Young can only divert his header into the net via the underside of the crossbar . Stones celebrates after his superb header had doubled Everton's lead and put Roberto Martinez's side in control before half time . Kevin Mirallas slots home Everton's third to round off a brilliant display of counter-attacking football, with De Gea well beaten . Mirallas celebrates scoring to put the result beyond doubt, after United had appealed for offside against Romelu Lukaku . The Dutchman’s biggest defeat as United manager, this setback has arrived just when the optimists were beginning to talk as though the repair job at Old Trafford was complete. There has been talk of a title challenge for next season and hope that United would once more finish above Manchester City this time round. Consistency remains an issue for United, however, and last week’s rather unjust defeat at Chelsea has now been followed by a failure that was altogether more comprehensive. Louis van Gaal could scarcely believe what he was seeing as his side found themselves well beaten down despite dominating possession .

With Liverpool threatening to end the season lamely, United really should finish the season comfortably in the Champions League places, even if the gap between the clubs could be a single point by the time United face West Bromwich on Saturday evening. Nevertheless, on Sunday there were signs of weakness in this United side that Van Gaal perhaps presumed he had banished. The renaissance man Marouane Fellaini, for example, was awful and hauled off at half-time. Juan Mata — never one to influence a game when his team are struggling — was replaced by Angel di Maria. United’s left defensive flank, meanwhile, represented a permanently half-open door as Paddy McNair and Luke Shaw struggled to deal with the rather predictable threat from Everton’s surging right back Seamus Coleman. United enjoyed enough possession throughout to get something from the game. They were porous at the back, though, and were put to the sword by an Everton team who have been anything but ruthless for the previous eight months of the season. Afterwards, Van Gaal claimed his staff had identified complacency during the warm-up. If that is true then maybe the United manager should have said something in his pre-match address to halt it. Regardless, his suggestion that his team lost three individual duels in the build-up to the first goal was telling and James McCarthy’s strike illustrated how the afternoon was to play out for both sides. It came in only the fifth minute and set the tone. England midfielder Ross Barkley tracks Manchester United's Spain international Juan Mata as the visitors dominated possesion . Daley Blind (right) and Paddy McNair both pulled out of a tackle inside their own box, to allow McCarthy in to score . Roberto Martinez celebrates as his side take the lead, thanks to McCarthy's calm finish, with an enthusiastic fist pump . Marouane Fellaini clatters into the back of Gareth Barry as he endured a difficult return to Goodison Park on Sunday afternoon . Fellaini was booked early on, as well as blazing an excellent chance over the bar, against the team he represented for five seasons . United had begun reasonably well. They passed the ball well at Chelsea last weekend and began this game in a similar groove. As soon as the ball broke loose 10 yards inside the Everton half, though, it seemed as though United were already in trouble. Seeing green grass ahead of him, McCarthy strode forward to feed Coleman to his right. The Everton defender tried to find Romelu Lukaku breaking through the centre but it was when the ball broke from a red shirt that United really failed. McCarthy, following up the move he had started, was first to the loose ball but still had much to do. His first touch was not perfect but the attempts to halt his progress from McNair and Daley Blind were weak and McCarthy was able to break through and score from just six yards. From an Everton point of view, it was a superb, counter-attacking goal. It should have been stopped at source, though, and United’s attempts to gain parity over the next 30 minutes similarly lacked conviction. Blind could have scored with a shot from the edge of the area and so could Fellaini, while Chris Smalling headed a Mata free-kick straight at Tim Howard. With so much of the game still to run, there was no sense of panic from United. The next goal was always likely to be crucial, however, and once Everton scored it 10 minutes before half-time the road back already looked too long for Van Gaal’s team. England defender Stones was left almost entirely unmarked, and got up higher than Antonio Valencia or Marouane Fellaini to score . Young, stationed on the line, did his best to head the ball away, while David de Gea could only watch on helpless as it ended up in the net . Once again the danger started down Everton’s right. On this occasion the United defence cleared for a corner but when Baines delivered, John Stones arrived to head his first Everton goal. Two ahead now, Everton were truly in command for the first time. Van Gaal responded at the break by benching Fellaini — who had been booked — and sending on Radamel Falcao. Once again, United enjoyed possession. Wayne Rooney was denied by Howard as he shot on the turn following a corner in the 47th minute but at the other end Shaw had to be quick to stop the breaking Ross Barkley. De Gea looks exasperated after seeing his side fall further behind, as he could not repeat his heroics against Everton from earlier in the season . Fellaini, who was replaced at half time, prepares to kick off after Everton's second goal, as Wayne Rooney looks on dejected . Radamel Falcao came on at half time for Fellaini, but was unable to have much of an impact as United continued to struggle for penetration . Luke Shaw slides in hard on Ross Barkley but it was the Everton man who came out on top in the battle between the England starlets . Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata look to break down the Everton defence but without joy as Gareth Barry and Leon Osman close them down . Phil Jagielka slides in brilliantly to stop Rooney's progress as Everton limited United's chances while capitalising on the break . EVERTON . Aston Villa (away) - May 2 . Sunderland (home) - May 9 .

Barkley was, in truth, having a mixed afternoon. Eventually, however, the 21-year-old got it right, playing the ball smartly over the top towards substitute Kevin Mirallas with 16 minutes left. Lukaku, breaking through the middle, looked yards offside and probably was. However, the ball had been played in the direction of Mirallas, and as the United defence looked for a flag, the Belgian eased clear to beat David de Gea comfortably and intelligently with his right instep. In the visiting dug-out, Van Gaal was already preparing his fiercest post-match shellacking of the season. He now has six days to elicit a reaction. Ashley Young is forced to wrestle Everton's on-loan winger Aaron Lennon, who put in another excellent display, to the floor . Mirallas slots home to finish off United with a cool finish after the visiting defence had completely switched off . It was a difficult day for England captain Rooney, who was replaced late on after appearing to be injured, against his former club . Falcao managed to find the net late on, slotting past Tim Howard, but the whistle had long gone with the Colombian comfortably offside .","James McCarthy puts Everton ahead after 5 minutes as Everton counter-attack at speed .

"Thomas Muller became the leading German scorer in the Champions League on Tuesday night and engaged in a raucous exchange with Bayern Munich supporters as Pep Guardiola's side celebrated a famous win. Muller, 25, netted the fourth goal of Bayern's 6-1 demolition of Porto in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final at the Allianz Arena to secure their place in the last four. It was the World Cup winner's 27th Champions League goal, taking him past former Bayern team-mate Mario Gomez and making him the highest-scoring German since the tournament took its current shape in 1992.

It was a night to savour in Bavaria as the home side blitzed their Portuguese opposition, who had sprung a surprise in the first leg by inflicting a 3-1 defeat on the Bundesliga champions. But five first-half goals by Thiago Alcantara, Jerome Boateng, Robert Lewandowski (two) and Muller ensured Bayern's safe passage into the semi-final. And after the match the Bayern players remained on the pitch for some time as they celebrated with supporters behind the goal. As the squad lined up linking arms in the penalty area Muller scaled the fence to reach the first row of fans, and with a megaphone in hand stirred up a frenzy as he led the chants. The supporters followed before Muller climbed down to join the rest of the team as they danced on the pitch while fans sung in celebration.

"The president of the MGM Grand is making a solemn promise to the hundreds of thousands of party-goers already flocking to Las Vegas for Saturday's Fight of the Century. 'They have my guarantee we will not run out of beer this weekend,' says Scott Sibella. That is a reference to how Ricky Hatton's trans-Atlantic army of 30,000 fans drank the Strip dry when he fought Floyd Mayweather eight years ago. With 10 times that number expected to descend on this oasis in the Nevada desert – just so they can say 'I was there' on the night Mayweather finally fights Manny Pacquiao – the MGM food and beverage department are taking no chances. The MGM Grand is getting ready to host Floyd Mayweather's showdown with Manny Pacquiao . The hotel resort on the Las Vegas strip will host the biggest boxing contest ever on Saturday night . Advertisements for the fight on Saturday night are all over the MGM Grand hotel ahead of the contest . The MGM Grand expect 50,000 people each day to pass through for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's fight . 1993 - Year opened . 280ft - height of the four 30-storey towers . 2,500 - slot machines and video poker . 7,000 - Rooms and suites . 9,000 - employees work at the hotel . 16,000 - Garden Arena capacity . 100,000 - people expected for the event . 170,000 - Square feet of gaming . A convoy of trucks is already delivering the first consignments of half a million bottles of Budweiser, Miller Lite, Corona and Tecate, who are paying more than $5million (£3.3m) to be one of the fight's sponsors. Many early arrivals are busy now stock-piling cases of their preferred foaming nectar in their rooms at the hotel, which will cost them $1,600 (£1,057) a night come Friday and Saturday. Even at those prices, they are the lucky ones. The majority of rooms on the Strip are reserved for proven high-rollers with track records of seven-figure gambling. Sibella says: 'We are taking care of major clients from all over the world.' Many late-comers are being reduced to renting out not only rooms in private houses but the caravans parked in those gardens. Sibella expects 50,000 people to set foot in the MGM each day for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's main event itself, in addition to the near 14,000 occupants of the 7,000 rooms and suites. Merchandise for the fight on sale at the MGM Grand with just days to go before the blockbuster event . A hotel guest looks at a display of title belts belonging to the unbeaten American Mayweather . The hotel is putting the finishing touches on it's preparations for the biggest event in Las Vegas history . Who do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao? Who do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao? Now share your opinion . A hundred thousand hot dogs will be sizzling in readiness in and around the Grand Garden Arena. All this is only the surface of the liquid lake and the tip of the food mountain which will be drunk and devoured at the MGM Grand and the group's 13 other hotel-casinos on the Strip. In its comparatively new incarnation as a holiday resort destination rather than just a gambling mecca, Vegas now generates even more revenue from such sources as accommodation, restaurants, bars and shows than it does from betting. Sibella says: 'At an event like this we want to maximise all our non-gaming revenue.' Nevertheless, the casino drop is expected to at least double the record take at the tables which has been set on New Year's Eve and equalled for Mike Tyson's biggest fights. Projections for the economic impact on the Vegas economy have been revised upwards from an initial $400m (£265m) to well over a billion dollars. This is the fun part of a military scale operation for putting on the mega-rich fight for which the world of boxing and beyond has been waiting for five years. The MGM has an army of 9,000 employees, almost two to every three hotel guests. Many are engaged in security and this is where it gets serious. Mayweather's fight against Pacquiao will take place at the MGM Grand's 16,000-capacity Garden Arena . Fewer than a thousand tickets went on sale to the public with the rest to be distributed privately . As well as being a hotel, the MGM Grand is a world-famous resort with casinos and entertainment . It is a complex task playing host to what will be the biggest single event in Las Vegas history but ask Sibella for his greatest concern and he says: 'The safety of all these people.' Fights this big bring special risks. There will be a melting pot of thousands of Mayweather's fellow American rappers and almost as many Filipino immigrants supporting Pacquiao. But it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts. A number of fight nights at the Grand Garden have ended in pushing, shoving and near-crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave. Fortunately there have been no fatalities but after Mayweather's most recent fight here, against Marcos Maidana, a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment. After 'the last stampede,' as Sibella describes it, he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control. A Grand King Room, which on Monday was being sold on the website for over $1,800 for the night of the fight . The MGM resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it's entertainment experience . Gambling is a huge source of revenue for most Las Vegas hotels, including the MGM Grand . The two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside, lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous. Resorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but Sibella is putting safety first. Although the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance, movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket-holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations. 'The problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people-watchers blocking their movement,' says Sibella. 'We are now working on opening up more exit routes.' Furthermore, this Saturday, the rubber-neckers will be kept at a distance. They will be further discouraged by the celebrities – sports stars and Hollywood royalty among them - using a private, guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng. Metal detectors have been obligatory since Tyson's infamous ear-biting fight against Evander Holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor, with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon. Mayweather's last 10 fights have all taken place at the MGM Grand, including two against Marcos Maidana . The unbeaten American beat Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand in December 2007 . Hatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in May 2009 . Sibella says: 'Like Floyd and Manny, we need a perfect game plan.' More than 50,000 of the out-of-towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot-spot to watch closed-circuit TV transmission on giant screens located in all the MGM properties. Even that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $150 (£99) a ticket. For the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh-in – at the arena on Friday – to facilitate crowd control for that event. Proceeds – at $10 a head – will go to charities nominated by Mayweather and Pacquiao. Come Saturday, MGM corporate security, the Las Vegas police and Nevada State Troopers will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the Strip. Mayweather beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in 2007 in a fight that set pay-per-view records . Those travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop-off and pick-up points. Tyson's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but Sibella expects Mayweather and Pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion. He says: 'The styles of Floyd and Manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype. If it's the great fight I expect, it will help create the happy night we all want.' Just for the record, most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena. No beer or any other alcohol allowed.","MGM Grand Garden Arena will host Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao .

"Liverpool supporters will stage a protest on Tuesday night against the mounting costs of tickets in the Barclays Premier League. The die-hard contingent of fans who travel the length and breadth of the country to watch Brendan Rodgers' side are staying away from The KC Stadium after Hull City charged Liverpool fans £50 for their sets. Last season, the same seats were sold for £35. That price has caused outrage, given that Stoke fans were charged £16 for tickets when they went to Hull in August and Evertonians were charged £35 for seats at The KC Stadium in December. Liverpool fans (seen here at Arsenal) are unhappy at being charge £50 to go to Hull . Liverpool fans are planning a protest a the Hull game over the rising cost of tickets . To put the price of seats at the KC stadium into context, tickets for the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley were available for £33. Liverpool fans have been amongst the most vociferous railing at the spiralling costs and have regularly held up banners at stadiums saying they are 'against modern football'. A statement on the Spirit of Shankly fans' website said: 'We would encourage fans to join us on that night to tell the money men of the Premier League cartel that they cannot continue to charge exorbitant prices, whilst making obscene amounts of money. 'This wealth should be shared and passed back to the lifeblood of the game, the supporters… We will no longer accept these prices when there is more money in the sport than ever before.' Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said at his press conference on Monday: 'I have been made aware of the issue. Fans work hard to get money so they can attend these games. I respect the supporters' right to protest.' Hull boss Steve Bruce has also called for Barclays Premier League officials to act to curb rising ticket prices after admitting he felt sorry for football fans. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he respects the supporters' right to protest . Bruce said: 'I feel sorry for the supporters of big clubs who have to dig deep every week and I hope when the new TV money comes into play the Premier League can remember football does belong to supporters. 'I know how difficult it is for people here at our club to find the money to bring their two kids to a football match and we have to make sure with all the money washing around we give something back to the fans. 'We have to remember the average man in the street because they are the lifeblood of football and I think if the Premier League set certain rules we would all have to abide by them.'","Liverpool fans are being charged £50 for a ticket to Hull City, compared to Everton fans being charged £35 .

"It wasn't quite the Etihad or the Westfalenstadion but Sergio Aguero and Marco Reus went head-to-head in an exciting clash to showcase the new Puma boot being launched. The Manchester City star has been in good form this season despite his injury problems and showed his impressive close control against the Borussia Dortmund winger. The footwear brand are releasing the evoSPEED 1.3 Graphic, which took inspiration from the Japanese dragon. Sergio Aguero (left) and Marco Reus went head-to-head to help the launch the new Puma evoSpeed 1.3 . The Manchester City striker celebrates after scoring to put himself 3-2 up against the German . After the launch, Aguero sat down for a Q&A where he spoke about his side's chances of catching Chelsea. He said: 'You say it is only 5 matches, but a lot can happen in these games. We will work hard to finish as well as possible.' The Argentinian also praised his opponent for giving him a tough game during the unusual encounter. 'I have to admit, that guy is really talented, so my lead lasted unfortunately only a few seconds,' he added. 'I love this pitch and it's really fun, especially when playing against some new players who you don't get to meet every day in training.' The square pitch had four different goals that opened and closed to make it harder for the players . Reus has been heavily linked with a move away from Dortmund and could follow Jurgen Klopp out of the club . Germany international Reus also praised Aguero and really enjoyed playing on the difficult pitch. He said:  'I am sure you can see it in the film, but I can re-assure you that Agüero really gave me a hard time. He is so quick and so ambitious and it was definitely hard to keep up with him. 'The switching goals were challenging in the beginning, but once it clicked, it is a really cool concept, because you can never really anticipate what happens next.

"While Rory McIlroy is no stranger to pumping iron, the world's No 1 golfer will need more than a few extra sessions in the gym to get close to matching American teenager Brad Dalke. McIlroy knew he was beaten even before he  took the strain for an arm wrestle with the ripped high schooler who made short work of a strength test against the Northern Irishman. Dalke posted a video of the light-hearted encounter on his Twitter page with the note, 'Sorry Rory.' 'Look at this ... No chance,' Rory McIlroy says as he prepares to arm wrestle 17-year-old Brad Dalke . Dalke makes short work of the strength test against the world No 1 golfer who was a guest at a junior event . McIlroy is no match for Dalke, the teenager who will join Oklahoma University in the autumn . McIlroy had run a clinic and offered some inspirational words to players on Friday at a junior invitational at the Sage Valley Golf Club in Graniteville, South Carolina, sponsored by Nike. There he met Dalke and the pair agreed to an arm wrestle. As they took a knee, with elbows on a table as is customary, McIlroy couldn't help but be impressed by the 17-year-old's biceps. 'Look at this... no chance,' McIlroy laughed while poking Dalke's arm. 'I shouldn't be a golfer,' Dalke, who listed 'working out' among his interests on his 2014 Junior US Ryder Cup team profile, joked back. Oklahoma University hopes he wasn't serious having had the prodigy lined up via a verbal agreement to play for them since he was just 12 years old. McIlroy, whose long game is one of the best in golf, pumps iron in the gym . The weights work in the gym didn't help McIlroy when he came face-to-face with Dalke . Schooling the world's best golfer in an arm wrestle will do his bragging rights no harm when he arrives on campus to end the institution's five-year wait for him to come of age this year.

"Javier Hernandez made it six goals in eight starts as Real Madrid kept up their pursuit of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 4-2 win over Celta Vigo. Chicharito is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of Leo Messi who nets once every 81 minutes. The Manchester United loanee put his team in the Champions League semi-finals in midweek with the winner against Atletico Madrid and in Baliados on Sunday night he scored twice to keep Real in the title race. And if his goal at the Bernabeu was a tired shot with the goal gaping in the dying minutes, his strikes against Celta Vigo were of the highest quality and will only serve to ramp up the auction for his services at the end of the season – who knows if his goals bring trophies to the Santiago Bernabeu, Real might even be in the race to sign him permanently. Javier Hernandez scored two more important goals for Real Madrid as they look to keep up with Barcelona in the quest for the La Liga crown .

Colombian international midfielder James Rodriguez celebrates his strike and the visitors third goal with Hernandez (left) The Real Madrid players surround striker Hernandez (No 14) after his first goal brought Carlo Ancelotti's men back into the lead . The game was the perfect tonic for anyone who had sat through Arsenal v Chelsea earlier on Sunday. Both sides flew forward from the off and their ambition was rewarded though for Real Madrid the reward was ultimately far greater. They fell behind after nine minutes when former Barcelona player Nolito took advantage of poor Real Madrid defending. Sergio Ramos lost his boot and was reduced to running back towards goal with it in his hand. And without him Rafael Varane, Alvaro Carvajal and Asier Illaramendi all failed to stop Nolito as he tricked his way in from the left-hand channel and shot past Iker Casillas. Real Madrid responded on the quarter-hour when Cristiano Ronaldo crossed from the right. The ball was cleared straight to Toni Kroos who picked his spot well to fire Madrid level with his second goal of the season. On 24 minutes Real were ahead and it was man of the moment in the Spanish capital Hernandez who got the goal. Rodriguez was involed in the build-up but he still had plenty to do when he received the ball cutting in from the right to shoot past Sergio Alvarez. Celta Vigo, hoping to do their former coach Luis Enrique a big favour, did not retreat and they were level on the half hour when 19-year-old Santi Mina raced away from Madrid’s defence on to a pass from Fabian Orellana. The teenager scored from the rebound after his first shot came back off the post.

Double goal scorer on the night Hernandez (right) tries to round a diving Celta goalkeeper Sergio Alvarez (left) Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo (left) fights for the ball against Celta's Augusto Fernandez but was unable to add to his impressive tally . The game was chaotic in every sense and Sergio Ramos and Joaquin Larrivey both needed lengthy treatment after a clash of heads. Ronaldo was linking well with James Rodriguez and Hernandez and almost put Real ahead but saw his shot come back off the post after another fine pass from Chicharito. When the goal that put Real Madrid ahead did come it was again made by Ronaldo. He played in James Rodriguez and his deflected shot beat Alvarez to leave Celta Vigo going down the tunnel at half time stunned to have played so well in attack and yet still find themselves behind. Their front three of ex-Barça B forward Nolito, journeyman centre-forward Larrivey and teenage prospect Mina, aided by Orellana, had run Real’s back four ragged and they kept the pressure up in the second half. It was Orellana who wend down under a challenge from behind from Kroos at the start of the second half but the referee was unmoved by the home side’s appeals. Isco went close for Real Madrid and then Ronaldo raced away on another counter-attack, which ended with a pass to Hernandez, he tried to hit the shot first time and, falling as he made contact, blasted it high and wide. He would get another chance however and this time he would take it. Celta were playing football that made a mockery of the financial gulf between the two sides. Their wage bill is €12m compared with the €17m Real pay Ronaldo but they were inevitable leaving themselves wide open on the counter and they were also tiring badly. It was perhaps the fatigue that meant they allowed Sergio Ramos to bring the ball out from the back without a Celta player anywhere near him. Ramos picked out Hernandez with a long pass forward and he controlled it with his first touch before slotting past Alvarez with an emphatic second. A week ago he was a frustrated squad player. Now with the season approaching its climax he looks like one of Real Madrid's most important players.","Javier Hernandez scored twice to keep Real Madrid in touching distance of La Liga leaders Barcelona .

"Two years ago, Rafa Benitez was in charge of Chelsea and John Terry's glittering career at Stamford Bridge was in danger of fizzling out. In April 2013, the Spanish manager declared that Terry could no longer play two games a week and that controversial decision, twinned with a persistent knee injury, meant the former England international made just 14 appearances for his beloved in the 2012-13 campaign. Fast forward to 2015, the Blues captain has one hand on the Premier League trophy after arguably his most impressive season at the club - during which he has played a part in each of their 33 games so far.

If Terry manages to make appearances in all of Chelsea's remaining fixtures against Leicester, Crystal Palace, Liverpool, West Brom and Sunderland, he will beat the 37 domestic appearances he made during his side's last title-winning season in 2009-10. And he made 36 in 2004-05 and again the following season - his other two Premier League title triumphs.

"Wladimir Klitschko has confirmed that Tyson Fury will be his next opponent and the unified heavyweight champion says he is ready to travel to England to defend his belts. The IBF, WBA and WBO king ended his seven-year American hiatus by clearly out-pointing Bryant Jennings at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night but it was not the dazzling New York display he had promised on his Stateside return. The American boxing public fell out of love with the 6ft6in Ukrainian back in 2008 when he outpointed Russian Sultan Ibragimov in an uninspiring, lop-sided victory in this very Madison Square Garden ring. And, although seven years and 12 fights have passed since then for Klitschko, it was a case of same ring, same story. The watching Fury, who is mandatory challenger to the champion's WBO belt and in line for a summer showdown, will have been encouraged by the performance. Wladimir Klitschko celebrates after beating Bryant Jennings on Saturday night in New York City . Klitschko was awarded a unanimous victory over Jennings by the judges at Madison Square Garden . The fight against Jennings was Klitschko's first in the United States since he fought Sultan Ibragimov in 2008 . Klitschko has confirmed that Tyson Fury will be his next opponents and is willing to fight him in England . But Klitschko has warned Fury that he will relish finally fighting a man taller than him, after his victory over 6ft3in Jennings. He said: 'I look forward to this fight, I think it will be challenging and exciting because I like to fight big men. It is much easier to fight bigger men than smaller. 'I believe that the fight with Tyson Fury will look different to this one because of the size difference – Fury is taller than me. He is definitely the guy who is ambitious and I think it is going to be exciting. I think that he is going to engage in the fight. 'There was not much engagement through Jennings today but I think the Fury fight will be exciting and I'm looking forward to it.' The Ukrainian once again used his height and longer reach to dominate has challenger . Klitschko won 116-111 on two of the judges cards and by a margin of 118-109 on the other on Saturday . Klitschko was happy to travel to America to face an American – and insists he is ready to hit the road again to face the Wythenshawe born Fury. The only confusion appears to be from which governing body the mandatory challenge will come. Fury is No.1 contender for the WBO strap but Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente says the order will actually come from the WBA. Either way, all three of the champion's belts are likely to be on the line. 'We still have to find out when and where the fight will happen but we will sort it out in the next few weeks,' Klitschko added. 'I am absolutely open to fighting anywhere. It depends on negotiations and hopefully we will not need a purse bid.' Victory in Manhattan on Saturday took Klitschko's run of consecutive title defences to 18 and a win against Fury will move him level with Larry Holmes on 19. He remains some way off the record of 25 set by Joe Louis during the 1930s and 40s. He did, however, equal the Bronze Bomber's total of 27 world heavyweight title fights contested at the Garden. The 39-year-old Ukrainian saw off his Philadelphian challenger on points at Madison Square Garden . Brother Vitali watches on as the world heavyweight champion celebrates his victory in America . The 39-year-old wears his WBA, WBO and IBF world heavyweight titles with pride after his win . There is no doubting that Klitschko is one of the most dominant champions of any era but it could be argued that there has been a paucity of genuine challengers during his reign. Take Jennings for example. The 30-year-old, a former handyman in the Philadelphia bank, only started boxing six years ago and this was only his 20th professional fight. Indeed, when Jennings first laced them up, Klitschko was already seven defences into his current hot streak. But he put up a good fight here, although on the few occasions he did get inside Klitschko's defence, he was unable to land anything other than single shots. Despite standing three inches shorter than the champion, Jennings enjoyed an incredible three-inch reach advantage, although it was not really a factor in the end. The American struggled to administer his jab and instead relied upon occasional forward raids. Klitschko, as ever, allowed him to move towards him and tied him up. The Ukrainian is often criticised for his persistent holding and he was deducted a point for that in the 10th round here. Hayden Panettiere was in the crowd at Madison Square Garden to watch her fiancee's latest fight . Madison Square Garden, which has hosted some big fights over the years, pictured on Saturday night . Klitshcko's last fight in the United States was in Madison Square Garden in 2008, seven years ago . Despite that, he was awarded the win by a 116-111 on two cards and an ever bigger 118-109 on the other. However, the wide cards belie a unusual vulnerability about Klitschko at times, which was not in keeping with his most recent victories during which his defence has seemed virtually impregnable. Fury would have noticed. The Klitschko brothers have been ruffled by Brits in the past with David Haye infuriating them by wearing a t-shirt depicting him holding the severed heads of the brothers in each hand. Then, before Dereck Chisora fought older brother Vitali, 'Dell Boy' slapped the champion at the weigh-in then spat water in Wladimir's face. Fury, one of British boxing's biggest characters, is known for being outspoken and could attempt to get under Wladimir's skin. However, the 39-year-old said: 'Antics outside of the ring? You know what, who cares about outside of the ring? It's all about what happens inside.'","Wladimir Klitschko successfully defends his WBA, IBF and WBO belts .

"Chelsea drove themselves one step closer to the Premier League title with another defensive masterclass at the Emirates, shutting out Arsenal just a week after doing the same to Manchester United. Led magnificently by John Terry, Jose Mourinho’s side have proved once again that a solid back four is the bedrock of any title challenge. From the meanest to the most successful, Sportsmail takes a look at the best defences in Premier League history. John Terry (centre), Gary Cahill (left) and Branislav Ivanovic celebrate Chelsea's goalless draw at Arsenal . ARSENAL 1997-98... Lee Dixon, Tony Adams, Steve Bould/Martin Keown, Nigel Winterburn . These rear Gunners might have been getting a little long in the tooth, but it didn’t stop them delivering the Double for Arsene Wenger in his first full season in English football. They conceded 33 Premier League goals along the way as they pipped Manchester United to the title. Tony Adams was the main man in a fiercely solid unit that had been forged under George Graham. They knew each other’s game inside out and few defences down the years could match this one for experience and knowhow. (From left) Steve Bould, Tony Adams, Nigel Winterburn and Lee Dixon celebrate the title . ARSENAL 2003-04... Lauren, Kolo Toure, Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole . Six years on and it was an entirely new Arsenal backline that will forever be lauded for their contribution to the Invicibles, Wenger’s team that amazingly went unbeaten on their way to the title in 2004. The Gunners conceded only 26 goals in the process as they finished 11 points clear of Chelsea. Campbell had succeeded Adams as the kingpin and they had more attack-minded full backs in Cole and Lauren, but the old defensive steel was as strong as ever. Lauren, Kolo Toure, Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole (not pictured) formed one of the league's best defences . Campbell played alongside Toure in the season Arsenal went unbeaten as Cole and Lauren (right) confront Phil Neville after their side's infamous 0-0 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford in 2003 . CHELSEA 2004-05... Paulo Ferreira, John Terry, William Gallas, Ricardo Carvalho . No team in Premier League history has conceded fewer goals than Mourinho’s side in his first season in England after the Portuguese coach moved to Stamford Bridge fresh from his Champions League triumph with Porto. Chelsea’s defence was breached just 15 times as they won the title with 95 points, another Premier League record. Mourinho brought Ferreira and Carvalho with him from Porto and the effect was instant. William Gallas and John Terry celebrate after the latter scored for Chelsea in a 4-1 win against West Ham . MANCHESTER UNITED 1998-99... Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, Ronny Johnsen, Denis Irwin . United’s Treble winners were not the meanest by any stretch, letting in 37 goals in 1999 compared with the 17 conceded by nearest challengers Arsenal. But the attacking instincts of Sir Alex Ferguson’s side always meant it was going to be a case of ‘we’ll score more goals than you’, as was evident in the two 3-3 draws with Barcelona that season. Ferguson has since said that Irwin would be the only certain inclusion in a best XI picked from his time at Old Trafford, while selling Stam was arguably his biggest regret. Either way, this back four deserves their place in the hall of fame on the basis of the club’s Treble achievement. Jaap Staam (centre) and Gary Neville (right), pictured with David Beckham and Dwight Yorke (top), formed half of United's Treble-winning defence. Denis Irwin played at left back with Ronny Johnsen partnering Stam . MANCHESTER UNITED 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09: Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra . This was an altogether more compact United, conceding an average of 24 goals on their way to winning the title three years in a row. Has there ever been a better bit of January transfer business than the two deals United completed in 2006 to sign Vidic and Evra from Spartak Moscow and Monaco respectively? Vidic teamed up with the majestic Ferdinand to forge one of the great central defensive partnerships, playing together in three Champions League finals, while Neville was still going strong at right back. Nani's celebration is overlooked by Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand in the summer of 2007 . Ferdinand's partnership with Vidic helped Manchester United to successive titles in 2007, 2008 and 2009 . MANCHESTER CITY 20011-12: Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Joleon Lescott, Aleksandar Kolarov . Manchester City’s success in conceding only 29 goals was ultimately crucial in snatching the title away from United on goal difference after an unforgettable final day of the season in 2012. Kompany, who lifted the trophy, was well on his way to establishing himself as a City legend, as was Zabaleta. Both players had been signed by Mark Hughes, along with Lescott, but the defensive nous of Italian Roberto Mancini helped turn City into a more solid unit before he brought in the combative Kolarov from Lazio.

"Gerard Pique and chart-topper Shakira were in the stands as Kei Nishikori was crowned Barcelona Open champion for the second consecutive year after a hard-fought 6-4 6-4 victory over surprise Spanish finalist Pablo Andujar on Sunday. It was the ninth career title for the top-seeded Japanese, who again showed his improved endurance as he battled to come out on top against the world number 66. 'I didn't think about winning the tournament at the start of the week because of the strength of the players here, especially the Spanish, but now I am very happy,' Nishikori told reporters. Pop star Shakira and husband Gerard Pique attend the final during day seven of the Barcelona Open . Spain defender Pique holds his son Milan during the final of the Barcelona Open at the Real Club de Tenis . 'I knew that Andujar has a good backhand and my plan was to move the ball around a bit. It worked well in the last few games and then with the final shot I closed my eyes and it went in.' Andujar broke serve in the opening game with Nishikori making uncharacteristic mistakes and the score was 2-2 before either player held serve. Nishikori found himself being dragged out of position by Andujar, who had beaten third seed David Ferrer in the semi-finals but, despite racking up 13 unforced errors, he still managed to break his opponent again at 5-4 to win the first set. Pique played in Barcelona's 2-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday which kept them top in La Liga . The famous couple share a kiss in between points as Pablo Andujar missed opportunities to clinch the first set . Nishikori continued to make mistakes as the Spaniard went into a 2-0 lead in the next and then survived a break point to go 3-1 ahead. Yet the Japanese world number five rallied to level at 4-4 before, in Andujar's next service game, a double fault gifted Nishikori match point and a backhand down the line gave him victory. Nishikori exploded on the tennis scene last year, reaching his first ever Grand Slam final at the US Open and he will be among the favourites to win the French Open next month. Strong from the back of the court, he is well suited to clay courts, also having reached the final of the Madrid Open in 2014 where he had to retire injured against Rafael Nadal. After early mistakes in the first set put Andujar 3-1 up Kei Nishikori rallied to win in straight sets 6-4 6-4 .

"Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack . Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing . Hull (away) - May 4 . Swansea (home) - May 11 . Man United (away) - May 17 . Sunderland (home) May 20 . West Brom (home) - May 24 . Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.'

The French forward suffered the injury during the Swans' 1-1 Premier League draw with Everton earlier this month and has been using his spell on the sidelines to spend time with his family in Lyon.

"Javier Hernandez made it six goals in eight starts as Real Madrid kept up their pursuit of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 4-2 win over Celta Vigo. Chicharito is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of Lionel Messi who nets once every 81 minutes. The Manchester United loanee put his team in the Champions League semi-finals in midweek with the winner against Atletico Madrid and in Baliados on Sunday night he scored twice to keep Real in the title race. READ PETE JENSON'S FULL MATCH REPORT HERE . Host commentator . Real Madrid are now just two points behind league leaders Barcelona. Chelsea may have wrapped up the title in England but it seems like the La Liga race will go right down to the wire. Real Madrid will have Hernandez to thanks for tonight's win as his two goals were decisive in their win over Celta. The home side the better side for large stages throughout the game but Real's quality in the final third made the difference. Yet another sign of respect by Ancelotti towards Celta. The Italian tactician now has six defenders on the pitch following the arrival of Arbeloa. Real Madrid now have three at the back with Carvajal and Marcelo acting as wing backs. Ancelotti's tactical switch shows just how much of a threat Celta have been during the 80-odd minutes or so. Hernandez will not get the chance of scoring a hat-trick as Ancelotti has decided to take the Mexican off. Pepe has been brought on to shore up the back-line. It's that man Hernandez again. Sergio Ramos runs up the pitch before playing a delightful through pass to Hernandez with the outside of his foot. The Mexican then takes one touch to bring the ball down before placing the ball into the net. A fine goal by the Real Madrid loanee. Some great football being played by Celta - and remember their wage bill is €12m compared with the €17m Real pay Ronaldo. But they are inevitably leaving themselves wide open on the counter. An equaliser doesn't look far off as Real fail to get to grips with Celta. The away side continue to counter attack with Hernandez going close after a neat run from the halfway line. Real Madrid are playing with fire. The home side should have been given a penalty as Kroos has just swiped the legs of Orellana, who was racing towards goal. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti may have to freshen his side up during the next 10 minutes or so. They are still look far from convincing. Here's a reminder of who the Italian tactician can call on from the bench. Real Madrid subs: Navas, Pepe, Coentrao, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese . Ronaldo has always scored against Celta Vigo whenever he has faced the La Liga outfit while wearing a Real Madrid shirt. He will be desperate to add to his outstanding tally of 39 league goals. No Bale and Benzema, no problem - Chicharito and James Rodriguez very good in the first half. Celta still in it but to play that well in the first 45 minutes and to go in at half time losing, it will be hard to lift themselves again. Real Madrid are extremely fortunate to be winning this game. Celta have looked assured and have really troubled their opponent's back-line. Nolito opened the scoring before Real took the lead thanks to goals by Toni Kroos and Javier Hernandez. Celta looked to be heading into the interval on level terms after Santi Mina's goal, however James Rodriguez struck before the break to make it 3-2 to Real. Real Madrid's luck appears to be in tonight as James Rodriguez has just scored an extremely fortunate goal. His shot is heading towards the arms of Sergio, in the Celta goal, until his shot deflects into the opposite corner and lands in the back of the net. Real do not deserve to be winning this game. Ronaldo almost puts his side back in the lead. The Portuguese forward races past Celta's defence before unleashing a low shot which looks destined to be heading for the back of the net. However his left-footed drives smashes against the post and rebounds to a Celta player. Remains 2-2. Barcelona will be delighted with the scoreline and Celta Vigo's performance during the opening 40 minutes of tonight's game. The home side continue to look the better side but they must be wary of Real's threat on the counter-attack. Real appear to be struggling in the absence of two members of the famous 'BBC' trio. They seem to be missing the pace of both Bale and Benzema in the final third. Not just because he's just scored, and not just because he scored four in one game two weeks ago, but 19-year-old Santi Mina is going to be one hell of a player. What is going on here? Just as we think Real are starting to find second gear - Celta go and grab an equaliser. This time it is Santi Mina who beats Casillas. He smashes the ball against the woodwork before tapping in the rebound from close range. One man who does seem to have taken confidence from the win over Atletico id Hernandez. He may have had to make do with a place on the bench during the majority of the season but he is now showing his worth. Hernandez shows a burst of pace before finishing past Sergio. I expected Real to come into this match with an extra bounce in their step following their win over Atletico but it has been the complete opposite. They look rattled and have really struggled during the opening 20 minutes of tonight's match. Second big assist in a week from Ronaldo. He's after his 40th league goal tonight. Celta have scored 38 as a team - that's what they are up against. It didn't take long for Real to get back on level terms. Ronaldo goes on a dangerous run down the right but fails to pick out a Real Madrid team-mate. The ball eventually falls to Kroos, who has the easy task of side-footing the ball into the net. Game on. Celta Vigo, who have started the brighter of the two sides, score by hitting Real on the counter attack. Nolito bursts down the left before cutting in between two defenders and shooting low past Iker Casillas. Fully deserved lead for the home side. Bright enough start from Celta. Ancelotti has not won here in any of his previous three visits with three different teams - Juventus, Milan and Madrid last season. Celta have started the match brightly with Real having to sit back and deal with their opponent's attacking threat. It looks like they will not be afraid of the European champions which should make for a good spectacle. Evidence shows that Real Madrid have a better win percentage without their Welsh wizard. Read Ben Nagle's piece on Bale's impact HERE. Manchester United's Javier Hernandez will lead the line for Real Madrid due to the absence of Karim Benzema. The Mexican international will be high in confidence following his late winner in the Champions League against rivals Atletico. Real Madrid XI: Casillas, Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo, Kroos, Illarramendi, Isco, Rodriguez, Hernandez, Ronaldo . Real Madrid subs: Navas, Pepe, Coentrao, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese . Celta Vigo XI: Sergio, Hugo Mallo, Cabral, Fontas, Jonny, Augusto, Krohn-Dehli, Orellana, Santi Mina, Nolito, Larrivey . Attention switches from the Barclays Premier League to the La Liga title race as Real Madrid face Celta Vigo at Balaidos in tonight's evening kick-off. The European champions will be desperate to claim all three points in order to pile pressure on rivals Barcelona. Carlo Ancelotti's side will have to make do without the injured Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric. Real Madrid will be hoping to follow up their late Champions League triumph against rivals Atletico Madrid by picking up all three points against mid-table Celta Vigo. League leaders Barcelona piled pressure on Real by defeating Espanyol 2-0, to leave the Catalan giants five points clear at the top of the table. Carlo Ancelotti will have to make do without the injured Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric for Sunday evening's encounter at Balaidos, however the Italian tactician will be able to call on the services of a rejuvenated Javier Hernandez.","Nolito scores opener after just nine minutes to put his side in unlikely lead .

"Sales of Manny Pacquiao boxing gear and effects have soared as much as 10 times ahead of his May 2 megafight with Floyd Mayweather, with Philippine retailers struggling to cope with demand from fans snapping up any paraphernalia they could find. Online and front-end retailers are seeing record sales of Pacquiao T-shirts, boxing gloves, figurines, caps and jackets, with buyers stocking up on items they believe could at least double in value if he wins what is the highest grossing bout in history. 'Many are buying because prices might rise further if Manny wins. So while the fight is still days away, they are already buying these items,' said 50-year-old Carolyn Yap-Tan, who has been selling Pacquiao items online for four years. A fan looks at boxing gloves signed by Manny Pacquiao on sale for 3,000 Philippine pesos (£45) per pai . Retailers are struggling to meet demand and prices are rising heavily for Pacquiao items in the Philippines . Yap-Tan said her sales via Ebay have jumped 10 times since February when the megafight, which took five years to arrange, was confirmed. Prices of Pacquiao-autographed boxing gloves, the best-selling item, have also risen at least 50 per cent, said Yap-Tan, with buyers coming mostly from the United States, and a few from Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. The Team Pacquiao store, owned by the boxer himself with branches in Manila and the southern Philippine city of General Santos, has seen its sales nearly triple, a record not seen during Pacquiao's previous fights. 'If we only had more stocks, we could report more sales,' said Team Pacquiao sales representative Honey Gervacio. Carlo Libut, an Australia-born Filipino and a Pacquiao fan, bought 4000-pesos (£59.50) autographed boxing gloves for his collection at the Team Pacquiao store. 'First of all, I love the sport, boxing. And my whole family loves it, my dad loves it, and I'm a big fan of Manny Pacquiao,' he said. Hats, shirts, gloves and many other items are on sale ahead of Pacquiao's fight with Floyd Mayweather . Online Pacquiao item seller  Carolyn Yap-Tan says sales via Ebay have jumped 10 times . Even street vendors are making a killing selling lower-priced Pacquiao T-shirts, with vendors in the Divisoria district in downtown Manila saying customers often buy by the dozens. The Philippines widely regard Pacquiao, also an elected congressman, actor, TV game show host, recording artist, and a player-coach in professional basketball locally, as a national idol. Thousands of fans often pack covered gymnasiums and public parks to watch free screenings of his fights on large LED screens throughout Manila and May 2 will be no different. Eight-division champion Pacquiao, 36, is seen as the underdog to 11-times five-division world boxing champion 'Money' Mayweather, 38. Pacquiao's followers, however, are convinced he will make history. 'I believe he will win, he will defeat Mayweather with his speed. Pacquiao is fast on the ring,' Yap-Tan said.","eBay retailer said prices for Manny Pacquiao items have risen 10 times since the fight with Floyd Mayweather was confirmed in February .

"Chelsea may have had six players named in the Professional Footballers' Association Premier League Team of the Year, but they still have some way to go to catch up with Manchester United. The Reds top the table with 75 representatives in the best XI since the Premier League began in 1992, while champions-elect Chelsea are third with 29. Yet having Eden Hazard, Diego Costa, John Terry, Gary Cahill, Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic feature in this year's team has seen them close the gap to second-placed Arsenal, currently on 42. Hazard was named the PFA Player of the Year on Sunday as he and five other Chelsea stars made the best XI . Hazard poses with his PFA Player of the Year award in London on Sunday afternoon as he was named winner . Hazard runs with the ball and escapes Aaron Ramsey during Chelsea's 0-0 draw with Arsenal on Sunday . GK: David de Gea . DEF: Ryan Bertrand, John Terry, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic . MID: Eden Hazard, Philippe Coutinho, Nemanja Matic, Alexis Sanchez . FWD: Harry Kane, Diego Costa . Hazard was named the PFA Player of the Year on Sunday after becoming the poster-boy for Chelsea's push for their first Premier League title since 2010. The Belgium winger has remarkably featured in the Team of the Year every season since 2009 – for both Lille in Ligue 1 and Chelsea in the Premier League. Being named in this year's best XI became Hazard's third in England, yet his hat-trick is nowhere near all-time leader Steven Gerrard. The Liverpool captain has eight to his name, but missed out on a ninth in his final Premier League season before leaving for Major League Soccer with LA Galaxy. Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez starred for Liverpool in last year's best XI when the club fell just two points short of the title behind Manchester City.

Liverpool's Gerrard has been named in the PFA Team of the Year more than anyone with eight to his name . 8 – Steven Gerrard . 6 – Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Alan Shearer . 5 – Rio Ferdinand, Roy Keane . Speaking of the defending champions, City are nowhere near their rivals. They have had just 11 players named since 1992 – the same as Leeds United – with only Shaun Wright-Phillips coming before Sheik Mansour's takeover in 2008. As for their neighbours, David de Gea is the only representative from Old Trafford this year. The Spain goalkeeper joins Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Denis Irwin with two, while Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs remain top with six. With the list stretching back to 1992, we aren't short of blasts from the past. Andy Johnson was named in the PFA Team of the Year for Crystal Palace a decade ago, while Gary Pallister, Denis Irwin, Paul Ince and Eric Cantona all represented Manchester United the year after the Premier League was born.

Even Portsmouth, currently 16th in League Two, feature twice with Glen Johnson and David James. There are also more than a few players who represent two clubs, including Robin van Persie, Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, Alan Shearer, Graeme Le Saux, David Batty and Roy Keane.

"The USA have unveiled their new kits for the women's soccer team ahead of the World Cup hosted by Canada in June. The strips, produced by sportswear giants Nike, have caused a bit of stir across the pond, because of the decision to go with a black and white colour scheme rather than the traditional red, white and blue. But striker Alex Morgan hailed Nike's design as innovative. 'The black and white are different from anything we've ever had before,' she said, before adding, 'You know it's not a lot of red, white and blue in the white one because they wanted a clean look. I think it stands out in the fact that it is clean and just simple and I love that.' Scroll down for video . (Left to right:) Tobin Heath, Alex Morgan and Sydne Leroux of the USA women's soccer team pose . T he USA women's soccer team have unveiled their new kits for the World Cup hosted by Canada in June . There has been some controversy surrounding the decision to use a black and white colour scheme . Nike spokesperson and global creative director Martin Lotti explained, 'We always design home and away as one story, so the focus was on the blue with some of the red (for the away), and then the focus on the home was white. 'If you look at it traditionally, actually, all the home kits are always white. So we're actually not changing the history. In face we are being authentic to the history where it's always a white kit.' Nike have opted to put the focus of the new kit on the feet first and worked their way up. The neon yellow socks or 'volt' in Nike parlance are aimed to draw attention to the bright blue cleats. 'It's the first time as well that (the kit) is fully integrated, so going from the boot right to the sock, then it fades from the volt into the white kit,' Lotti said, 'It's a real head-to-toe look.' The USA women's team kick off their World Cup campaign against Australia on June 8 with a group match in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

"The PFA Premier League Team of the Year was unveiled on Sunday night at a glitzy ceremony at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London. The side, which is voted for by players from across the 20 clubs in England’s top flight, featured six Chelsea players, with Eden Hazard, winner of the individual prize, making the side for the third straight season. But did the professionals get it right? Not according to the EA Sports’ Performance Index anyway. Sergio Aguero nets his 21st strike of the season against Aston Villa. He has scored one more than Harry Kane . Cesc Fabregas, in action against his former club Arsenal on Sunday, and Aguero are in the EA Sports Team . Eden Hazard poses with his individual gong at Sunday's night's PFA Player of the Year awards in London . The system, which measures a player's contribution to the success of his team, sees Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero, scorer of 21 goals this term, replace  Diego Costa up front. Aguero is one of five changes from the PFA Team of the Year. The EA Sports’ side sees two fewer Chelsea players in the line-up with Gary Cahill and Nemanja Matic failing to make the team. Instead Everton defender Phil Jagielka, who has missed just one Premier League game, and Santi Cazorla, one of Arsenal's standout players, are given the nod. The EA Sports Team of the Year (left) and the PFA Team of the Year award, which was announced on Sunday . Cesc Fabregas, a surprise omission from the PFA Player of the Team is included in the EA Sports XI. The Spaniard, who returned to Arsenal for the first time since leaving the Emirates Stadium to join Barcelona in the summer of 2011, has provided assists for 17 goals for Chelsea following his £30million arrival from the Nou Camp - the most of any player in the division. Aaron Cresswell beats Ryan Bertrand to fill the left-back slot after impressing for West Ham. Along with David de Gea, the 25-year-old Hammers defender is the only man to have played every minute of the campaign. John Terry, named in both  line-ups, has started each of Chelsea’s 33 matches, but hasn’t completed every one. The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League.

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has been given the green light to make Gareth Bale his top summer transfer target, after a supporter handed him a list of potential targets at a club fan day. The Dutchman greeted a group of supporters with life-limiting illnesses at the biannual Manchester Foundation Dream Day held at the Aon Training Complex on Monday. And Moshin Tanveer - who suffers from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - used the special occasion to provide the former Holland boss with a star-studded cast of Europe's top property he should sign in order to bring the Barclays Premier League title back to Old Trafford. Scroll down for video . Moshin Tanveer gleefully awaits Louis van Gaal's reaction to the players he thinks he should sign . Van Gaal reads the carefully written document containing the names of who he 'should' bring to Old Trafford . Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) £36m . Gareth Bale (Real Madrid) £120m . Paul Pogba (Juventus) £75m . Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton) £15m . Memphis Depay (PSV Eindhoven) £30m . Jackson Martinez (Porto) £25m . 'I did some homework for you,' the fan tells van Gaal, passing him the dossier seen in a video posted on the Manchester United YouTube channel. The United boss then reads out the names of Mats Hummels, Nathaniel Clyne, Paul Pogba, Gareth Bale, Memphis Depay and Jackson Martinez, before thanking the supporter for his advice. 'I take it in mind,' van Gaal says, before folding the sheet of paper and putting it in his pocket. 'You are smart, and a very cheap manager.' Tanveer told the Dutchman not to follow up the loan signing of Radamel Falcao with a permanent deal, and also suggested that striker Robin van Persie should be sold. The supporter's mentor said he had spent a week writing up his shortlist ahead of the foundation day, and after being warmly received by the manager, the beaming recipient of a signed home shirt said, 'It was really nice of him to do that. It was like a dream come true.' Dutchman reads out the names of Mats Hummels, Gareth Bale and Paul Pogba  among others . Van Gaal jokes that £35 million to prise Hummels away from Borussia Dortmund may be a little optimistic .

The supporter also posed with David de Gea  as part of a day organised by the club's foundation . United are currently third in the Barclays Premier League with 65 points from 33 games - 11 points behind leaders Chelsea ahead of this weekend's trip to face Everton at Goodison Park. But were van Gaal to land all the names mentioned in the supporter's wishlist this summer, he would be expected to bring the Premier League title back to Old Trafford for the first time since 2013. 'Hummels...£36 million...Clyne of Southampton...£15 million...Pogba...£75 million...Bale...£120 million...and Jackson Martinez of Porto...£25 million. He didn't tell me who I have to sell but after a little bit of pushing, I know. So it's easy for me.

"On paper Chelsea’s team sheet looked like an insult, one for the anti-football brigade to get their beaks into after Jose Mourinho went without an orthodox striker. When reality bites, even his biggest detractors must concede that Mourinho’s decision to leave Didier Drogba on the bench until the start of the second half was another tactical masterclass. Chelsea’s manager is staying true to the game — his game — because the end result will be a fourth Barclays Premier League title for this football club. Chelsea's Jose Mourinho gestures on the sideline after going into the game against Arsenal without a striker . Oscar was part of a front three who interchanged roles during the first half to great effect for their boss . At times you are left wondering what Eden Hazard, Willian and Oscar make of it all when Mourinho starts working on team shape six days before a clash with Arsenal. This trio have an element of fantasy about their game, with those delightful touches around the corner and the clever wall passes that they can play at will. The master simply wants results. To start without a striker, to ignore the collective groans around the country by starting Willian in a deeply withdrawn role behind Hazard and Oscar, was a statement of intent. Mourinho was forced into it, of sorts, because he has been deprived of Diego Costa and Loic Remy in recent weeks, and his warrior Drogba could not train all week. Even so, you would not put it past Mourinho — who pulled a similar stunt by playing Andre Schurrle as a false nine at Manchester United last season — to have done it anyway. When it comes to work-rate, discipline and desire, no-one can accuse these players of cheating. Everyone has a job to do in this team. Chelsea mastermind Mourinho surveys the pitch before kick-off having plotted out his game plans . Eden Hazard leads a trio with Willian and Oscar that has fantasy about their play but Mourinho wants function . Strikers Loic Remy (left) and Diego Costa are both working their way back to fitness with leg injuries . To watch Hazard, the PFA player of the year, Oscar and Willian sacrifice their A-game for the greater good of the team demonstrates a unique commitment to Mourinho’s methods. They have bought in. What happened to the style, the swagger and the pomp about the team who won so handsomely at Swansea, putting five past Garry Monk’s side without reply at the Liberty Stadium on January 17? They traded it for Mourinho’s tactics, using the extra time during the week following their Champions League elimination against Paris Saint-Germain for match-specific preparation. With only one game a week since Chelsea went out on away goals on March 11, Mourinho has used the time on the training field to prepare for Premier League matches as a one-off. But Didier Drogba was available to Mourinho and he only used the Ivorian when Oscar went off injured . There is no question who had the upper hand in the managerial tactical battle, and it wasn't Wenger . Willian was exceptional for his manager, pestering the Arsenal midfield when the Blues were without the ball . Ramires comes close after a ball into the box from Willian but is thwarted by Arsenal keeper David Ospina . Against Manchester United he deliberately conceded possession, suffocating Marouane Fellaini and waited to hit Louis van Gaal’s team on the break. They won 1-0, even if it was far from pretty. Here at the Emirates, against a team with eight successive wins in the Premier League, he bewildered their defence by allowing his front three to rotate. Willian was exceptional as he flitted across Arsenal’s back line and pestered Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin when he wanted to win back the ball. The Brazilian forward engineered Chelsea’s best chance, a clever angled ball in the first half that found the feet of Ramires running into the box. Arsenal keeper David Ospina saved well. This was perfectly disciplined, if uncomfortable to watch at times as Mourinho looked on approvingly from the sidelines. When he was forced into a change at the break because Oscar had been ferried to hospital with suspected concussion following his collision with Ospina, he turned to the experience of Drogba. Oscar soars high in pursuit of the ball as Ospina comes out quickly to intercept . The pair clashed with Ospina considered lucky to be on the pitch after viewing the replays . Oscar was substituted at half-time having not recovered from the blow with Ospina . At the age of 37 he served his team-mates well in the second half, chasing 60 yards towards his own goal at one point to stop the forward run of Nacho Monreal down the left. Towards the end of the second half, as this game gravitated towards its inevitable conclusion, Chelsea relied on their captain John Terry’s leadership skills to see it home. A year ago this team was experimental, with various formations on trial as Mourinho assembled his next title-winning team. Here at the Emirates, it has finally taken shape.","Chelsea played out a 0-0 draw with Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday .

"Amid renewed calls for FIFA to overturn the controversial decision to hand the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, new research by the Mail on Sunday has shown just how much the oil-rich Middle East state spent on deals — including legitimate trade deals — in the course of lobbying in the run-up to the 2010 vote. Qatar won the final round of voting 14-8 against the USA in the executive committee ballot. The MoS analysis suggests that Qatar spent an astonishing £17.2 billion directly and indirectly on the way to victory. Much of this outlay was on goods and services for Qatar — including aerospace orders, a football club, sponsorship agreements, land and general exposure. The details are in the accompanying panel. FIFA have been called upon to overturn the controversial decision to hand the 2022 World Cup to Qatar . New research by the Mail on Sunday has shown just how much the oil-rich Middle East state spent on deals — including legitimate trade deals — in the course of lobbying in the run-up to the 2010 vote . There were cash payments made  from secret slush funds controlled by  Mohammed bin Hammam . There were also millions of pounds of cash payments made to a huge range of football officials from secret slush funds controlled by Qatar’s executive committee member Mohammed bin Hammam. These payments and swathes of new detail about how Bin Hammam won the right for Qatar to host the event are detailed in a book published last week, The Ugly Game, by investigative journalists Heidi Blake and Jonathan Calvert. Former FIFA head of security Chris Eaton has called for any new evidence to be considered by FIFA — even though he now works for Qatar. And a high-level group of European politicians — the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe — has approved a resolution calling on FIFA to re-run the ‘illegal’ bidding process. Qatar is the world’s richest country in per capita income and even the £17.2bn is minor compared to the $200bn (£132bn) budgeted for World Cup facilities and supporting infrastructure. WHERE ALL THE MONEY WENT... Voter: Michel Platini (France) - £14.72bn . Spent on: Orders for airliners from France-based Airbus; buying PSG; setting up beIN SPORTS; and buying Ligue 1 TV rights, following a Nov 2010 meeting attended by Qatar’s Sheik Tamin, French president Nicolas Sarkozy and Platini, who admits voting for Qatar and says he was encouraged but not forced to do so. Michel Platini admits voting for Qatar and says he was encouraged but not forced to do so at the 2010 vote . Nicolas Leoz (Paraguay) - £1.33bn . Spent on: Energy infrastructure deal agreed between Sheik Hamad of Qatar and Paraguay’s president Fernando Lugo on Aug 18, 2010 after Qatar’s FIFA executive voter Mohamed bin Hammam’s planned trip to lobby Leoz was replaced with governmental trip. Worawi Makudi (Thailand) - £1.23bn . Spent on: Gas deal arising from meeting, arranged by Bin Hammam, between key aides to Makudi at the Thai FA and Qatar’s most senior energy official on Aug 16, 2010 in Doha. Worawi Makudi saw money spent on a gas deal arising from a meeting arranged by Bin Hammam . Angel Maria Villar Llona (Spain) - £150m . Spent on: Sponsorship of Barcelona by Qatar Airways was one deal brokered via Spain’s voting pact with Qatar, which later became an open secret, even acknowledged by FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Various African and struck-off officials - £99m . Spent on: Bid budget and miscellaneous expenses. This included cash spent on buying exclusive access to influence Confederation of African Football voters ($1.8m); meetings to offer $1m to the son of struck-off voter Adams Adamu for staging a dinner; and costs defending another struck-offer voter, Reynald Temarii of Oceania. Julio Grondona (Argentina) - £59m . Spent on: Allegedly spent clearing the debts of Argentina FA; and unconfirmed sums paid by Qatar firm to sponsor November 2010 Argentina-Brazil friendly in Doha. Unconfirmed sums were paid by a Qatar firm to sponsor the November 2010 Argentina-Brazil friendly in Doha . Marios Lefkaritis (Cyprus) - £27m .

Other voters for Qatar included Chung Mong-joon of South Korea, whom Bin Hammam later helped secure honorary FIFA vice-presidency, and Junji Ogura of Japan, seen as squeaky clean, who voted for Qatar after Japan dropped out. Bin Hammam voted for Qatar and the 14th vote is understood to have come from either Senes Erzik of Turkey, whose PM is a close friend of the Qatar royals, or Hany Abo Rida of Egypt, paid to join Bin Hammam on campaigning trips.","Calls have been made to overturn handing of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar .

"Manny Pacquiao has added another string to his impressive bow by appearing in a hilarious commercial for Foot Locker ahead of his showdown with Floyd Mayweather. The Filipino, who has tried his hand at acting, politics and coaching basketball over the years, stole the show in an advertisement for the American sportswear company back in November by joking about the possibility of finally being able to go toe-to-toe with Mayweather. Pacquiao assumed two fellow gym members were talking about a fight between himself and Mayweather when they said: 'The people wanted it and Foot Locker made it happen.'

The Filipino gets excited when he is told his fight against Mayweather will 100 per cent go ahead . New advert ends with Pacquiao acting confused over possibility of facing his long-term boxing rival . Mayweather's upcoming opponent jumped for joy after jumping to conclusions during the 41-second long advert, which was released before an agreement was reached for the Las Vegas mega-fight. And Foot Locker have released a follow-up where Pacquiao acts as if he is not aware about having actually signed a deal to take on Mayweather. Pacquiao punches the air while running on the spot while the words 'It's really happening' appear on screen after being told the fight is 100 per cent on. The advert ends with Pacquiao stating he is confused over whether his fight against Mayweather is going to take place. Pacquiao, who will be putting the final touches on his preparations for next Saturday's fight over the coming days, was of course joking for the purpose of the advertisement.

"Edinson Cavani's slumbering Champions League performance against Barcelona may well have put to bed any chance of him making a switch to Manchester United. The chances of the Uruguayan filling what would appear to be a looming striker void at Old Trafford have always been slim. For a start, at 28 he would appear to be too old for Louis van Gaal, who prefers to work with young talent he can mould into his type of player. Edinson Cavani falls flat on his face during a limp display for PSG against Barcelona on Tuesday night . Manchester United have been linked with Cavani but the striker hasn't impressed this season . Radamel Falcao has struggled at Manchester United after signing on loan from Ligue 1 side Monaco . And the painful, expensive experience of Radamel Falcao's nightmare loan spell will have made the club's Dutch manager wary of seemingly-fading South Americans. But United, who have cash to burn and gaps to fill, will have kept a close eye on Tuesday night's events at the Nou Camp to see if Cavani still had what it takes. On the evidence of a sterile 90 minutes in an inevitable 2-0 defeat he does not. There is mitigation – Barcelona look unstoppable and few in Europe can live with Luis Enrque's resurgent treble hunters. Questions over Cavani's domestic form, however, still linger. France's Ligue 1 is not the Premier League or La Liga and after making the £55m move from Napoli, where he was almost unplayable, Cavani has not been the prolific force officials at Parc des Princes hoped for. This season he has played 32 times in domestic competitions and has scored 11 goals, although six more have come in the Champions League. Louis van Gaal prefers to work with younger players and may have been put off Cavani by Falcao's spell . The Uruguayan hasn't scored as many goals as he should have done in the French league . PSG will now concentrate on winning a two-horse race with Lyon at the top of the table (they are currently level on points with a game in hand) and will look to Cavani along with Zlatan Ibrahimovic to fire them over the line first. Following the 3-1 first leg defeat by Barcelona on home soil the man himself maintained he wants to see out the remainder of his contract in France. 'There is too much talk about my future but I will remain here,' he told Sky Italia. 'I will respect my contract and I'm only focusing on doing well for PSG.' He may have few options to do anything else. Cavani argues with the referee during PSG's 2-0 (5-1 agg) defeat in the Champions League quarter-finals .","Edinson Cavani struggled in both legs for PSG against Barcelona .

"You'd have thought the celebrations would've stopped  but the New England Patriots are still reveling in February's Super Bowl XLIX win  as they visited the White House to receive congratulations from President Barack Obama. But there was one notable absence from the Patriots squad who visited on Thursday, with quarterback Tom Brady nowhere to be seen.

The Patriots beat Seattle Seahawks 28-24 to win the NFL Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona with Brady named as MVP for the third time in his fourth Super Bowl victory. Although Brady wasn't able to visit the White House with his team-mates, he'll be fondly remembered for his performance in the Patriots' Super Bowl win. He joins the likes of Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw on four rings, and is now the all-time leader with 12 Super Bowl touchdown passes and completions on 37. It was also his record sixth appearance in the NFL’s seasonal showpiece. A spokesman for the Patriots said 'prior family commitments' was the reason why Brady didn't attend the visit .

"It has been described as a durable and scratch resistant smartwatch and is a considerable investment, costing from $349 (£299). But the Apple Watch Sport model has been to shown to shatter easily after being dropped from a height of just under four feet (1.2 metres). Apple claims its watch, which has an Ion-X glass display, is 'protected by a lightweight aluminosilicate glass that's especially resistant to scratches and impact.' Scroll down for video . Smash: The Apple Watch Sport edition is shown to shatter easily (pictured) after being dropped from a height of just under four feet (1.2 metres). The model has an Ion-X glass display which is supposed to be 'resistant to scratches and impact' In a video, TechRax drops the 42mm timepiece from a height of four feet (1.2 metres) to simulate what may happen if a wearer drops their watch while tightening or unfastening the strap. When TechRex dropped the watch ‘not aiming at the display,’ in a test conducted in Sacramento, California, it survived unscathed despite a nasty ‘crack’ noise when the timepiece hit the pavement. However, when the watch was dropped so the display hit the floor first, the screen shattered with beads of glass seen on the ground after impact. In the video he exclaims: 'Are you serious Apple? That wasn’t even that bad. That was about three-and-a-half feet!' Deep impact: When online tester TechRex dropped the watch ‘not aiming at the display,’ in a test conducted in Sacramento, California, it survived unscathed despite a nasty ‘crack’ noise when the timepiece hit the pavement. However, when it landed on its face (pictured), it smashed instantly . The watch has 'high performance' rubber straps and the screen is held in an anodised aluminium case, that's 60 per cent stronger than standard aluminium, but is just as light. The Apple Watch Sport (pictured) has high performance' rubber straps and the screen is held in an anodised aluminium case . The tester added: ‘I found it amazing that the amount of shatter that occurred was so tremendous.' When he threw the watch down with force, the screen came off completely. Damage to the screen, such as chips, scratches or indeed shattering,  is not covered by the watch's warranty and is expensive to fix, MacRumours reports. Damage eligible for warranty service includes debris under the screen, a loose back cover and condensation in the heart rate monitor sensor windows. MacRumours also discovered that in the US owners will have to pay repairs fees of $229, $329 and $2,800 for the Sport, Watch and Edition models respectively to fix a cracked or missing crown, missing buttons,or screen damage, for example. It is not known how much these repairs will cost in the UK and other regions and MailOnline has contacted Apple for comment. By comparison, the Apple Watch, which costs from $549 (£479) and Apple Watch Edition from $12,000 (£8,000) have different screens made of Sapphire glass. In a recent test, repair specialists in Cardiff showed that the 38mm Sapphire screen remained scratch-free after being subjected to being rubbed with sandpaper, keyed and even hit with a hammer.

But some early adopters of the Apple Watch have complained its stainless steel case scratches easily, according to 9to5Mac. The 316L steel used is cold-forged to be 'extra hard', but it seems to scratch in a similar way to the back of an iPod. But it's not all doom and gloom for Apple Watch owners. Another test has shown that the Sport model does live up to Apple's waterproof claims. Unhappy: Some early adopters of the Apple Watch have complained that its stainless steel case (pictured) scratches easily, much like the back of an iPod . Waterproof: But another test has shown that the Apple Watch Sport lives up to Apple's waterproof claims after surviving 15 minutes in a swimming pool (shown above) Apple's CEO, Tim Cook previously said that he showers wearing his Apple Watch and Apple said the Sport edition has an IPX7 water-resistance rating, which means it can be submerged up to 3ft (1 metre) underwater for 30 minutes. And a team at FoneFox in Australia has shown that the watch cannot only withstand a long, soapy shower, as well as being submerged in a bucket of water for five minutes, but can also be left in a swimming pool for around 15 minutes,9to5Mac reported. While the screen couldn't be used while in the pool, because of the capacitive screen technology, when it was fished out afterwards it functioned as normal. The team found that the Crown still worked underwater, allowing them to zoom in and out of apps. The sapphire glass screen in the Apple Watch has remained scratch-free after being subjected to being rubbed with sandpaper, keyed and even hit with a hammer. The test was carried out by Cardiff-based iPhone repairs specialist iPhoneFixed.co.uk, which used a sapphire screen from a 38mm Apple Watch for its experiment. Two out of the three models of Apple Watches have sapphire glass screens - the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition. The glass is made from synthetic sapphire, which is created by applying heat and pressure to aluminium oxide powder, before the crystals are processed to remove impurities. The tiny round disks created are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. Sapphire glass is said to be twice as tough as normal glass and almost as hard as a diamond. To test the durability of the screen, it was rubbed against a stone wall and then with a coin, before being ‘scratched’ by a key. The video capturing the attempts at destruction, shows no scratches were achieved to the screen. It also withstood being rubbed with abrasive sandpaper at some force and hit by a hammer – albeit not very hard. But most impressive, was the screen’s ability to withstand an electric drill being dragged across its surface, without leaving a mark. The test led iPhoneFixed to claim: ‘Sapphire glass is pretty strong and virtually impossible to scratch’.","Apple Watch Sport edition costs $349 (£299) and has an Ion-X glass screen .

"Aston Villa shocked Liverpool to reach the FA Cup final to take on Arsenal in May. Philippe Coutinho fired Liverpool ahead with a smart chip before a long range Chrisitan Benteke strike equalised for Aston Villa. Tim Sherwood's side moved into the lead thanks to a solo effort from Fabian Delph and held on for the famous victory. Here, Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell rates the players' performances at Wembley Stadium. The Aston Villa players celebrate after Fabian Delph (centre) fires Tim Sherwood's side into the lead . Aston Villa (4-1-2-1-2) Shay Given 6.5 . Could not do anything to prevent Coutinho’s deflected goal, in the second-half claimed balls with confidence to sweep away worries. Leandro Bacuna 6 . A better weight of pass to Benteke when Villa had a three on one break-away would have put the game to bed. Gave an attacking edge down right. Ron Vlaar 6.5 . The kind of performance he gave for Holland at the World Cup, strong and no-nonsense when required, booting the ball to safety. Nathan Baker 6 . His race was run by the 26th minute when landing heavily on his left knee and going off injured. He has had knee troubles all season. Aston Villa midfielder Ashley Westwood out muscles Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli in the FA Cup semi-final . Kieran Richardson 6 . May have rued not doing better with his chance on the hour, skying high with the goal beckoning, but cleared off the line in the dying moments. Ashley Westwood 6.5 . Did well overall on his first start since the quarter-final against West Bromwich Albion on March 7. Nothing spectacular, but kept play moving. Tom Cleverley 7 . Provided plenty of bite in midfield, snapping into tackles and covering ground. ‘That’s b******* Michael [Oliver],’ he could be seen saying when a decision went against him. Fabian Delph 8 . Could have done better for Liverpool’s goal but atoned in spectacular style. His drive created the equaliser, and the winner was an excellent finish of poise. Jack Grealish 7.5 . A dream debut at Wembley for this 19-year-old. Incredibly composed, making smart decisions for both goals, and exhibiting beguiling touch and balance. Charles N’Zogbia 6.5 . Good early snap shot to test Mignolet and provided a quick attacking outlet. But annoyed Sherwood with over hit cross to Benteke. England midfielder Fabian Delph fires in Aston Villa's second in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool . Aston Villa midfielder Tom Cleverley closes down Liverpool full back Alberto Moreno at Wembley . Christian Benteke 7.5 . Undoubtedly back to his best. Showed early his strength would be a problem for Liverpool, bullying Skrtel, and his finish was laser accurate. Subs: . Jores Okore (for Baker 26’) 6 . Caught a little cold for goal, deflected off his knee. Got better and made a couple of telling interceptions. Scott Sinclair 5 (for N’Zogbia 75’). Cole (for Grealish 83’) Tim Sherwood 7.5 . Got this spot on. Refused to take a back step despite the blow of Gabby Agbonlahor’s injury and had the confidence to trust Grealish onto this stage. Christian Benteke roars in celebration having scored Aston Villa's equaliser against Liverpool . Liverpool (3-4-3) Simon Mignolet 6 . Produced a fine fingertip save from N’Zogbia early on but could not do anything to affect Villa’s goals. Emre Can 5 . Asked to play three different roles throughout the game – centre back, right back and left wing  - and he never looked settled. Martin Skrtel 5 . Looked uncomfortable dealing with Benteke all afternoon, and got into a tangle in the second-half by the Belgian’s mere presence. Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet vents his frustration having conceded twice at Wembley on Sunday . Dejan Lovren 6 . Vital interception in the 16th minute to cut out N’Zogbia’s pass to Benteke and made a super tackle to deny Grealish. Poor to shoot from distance at the end. Lazar Markovic 5 . Pretty ineffectual as the right wing-back and hooked at half-time as Rodgers looked to change matters. Jordan Henderson 5.5 . Not a match where his emergence as Liverpool’s enforcer-in-chief continued. Lost the battle for supremacy with Delph. Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard attempts to dispossess Aston Villa's Kieran Richardson . Joe Allen 5.5 . A quiet game for the quiet Welshman. Did his usual tidying job in front of defence but little in a positive sense. Alberto Moreno 6 . Overhit a cross in a good position in the first-half, but did well to recover with a sliding tackle to deny Benteke in the second-half. Steven Gerrard 6 . Began in an advanced role but dropped deep once Rodgers shuffled his team. Never really got in the game. His late header was reminiscent of Istanbul, but it was not to be. Brazilian Philippe Coutinho opens the scoring for Liverpool with a smart chipped finish at Wembley . Raheem Sterling 6.5 . Delicate ball to set up Coutinho and fizzed throughout. Caught offside too many times, however. Philippe Coutinho 7 . Super run and finish, even if it needed a nick off Okore to defeat Given. Pressed into good positions early on but influence faded later. Subs: . Balotelli (for Markovic 46’) 6.5 . Had an impact for the second half. Should have been allowed his goal late on. Johnson 5 (for Allen 78’). Lambert (for Moreno 90’) Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling is floored by a challenge from Aston Villa's Fabian Delph (left) Brendan Rodgers 5 . Got his tactics wrong from the off and tried in vain to correct twice as the match progressed. Not a good day for him. Ref: Michael Oliver 6.5 . Allowed the game to flow and got most calls correct. But his linesman failed him for Balotelli’s strike.","Tim Sherwood's side came from behind to beat Liverpool 2-1 .

"When Barcelona midfield maestro Xavi came on as a half-time substitute against PSG in the Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday night he sent records tumbling. The former Spain international played for 148th time in the competition, more than any other player since the tournament changed to its current format in 1992. Xavi also set the record for the most appearances in the knockout phase of the Champions League having now featured in 53 matches in the latter stages. Xavi made his 148th Champions League appearance against PSG on Tuesday night . Former Spain international Xavi shares a joke with his former team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic after the game . They are not records that the 35-year-old is likely to hold on his own for long, however. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas is in line to equal Xavi's total in both Champions League games and knockout matches when Carlo Ancelotti's side take on Atletico in the second leg of their quarter-final on Wednesday night. While, Casillas' team-mate Cristiano Ronald will join Xavi on 53 knockout appearances if, as expected, he plays against Atletico. Former world champion Xavi also became the leading appearance-maker in all European competition with 170. Xavi celebrates with his team-mates after Barcelona won the Champions League in 2009 . Xavi (centre front) lines up for a Champions League clash against Manchester United in 1998 . Barcelona's safe passage to the semi-final was secured with a 2-0 win against the French champions as Neymar Jnr netted twice in the first half at the Nou Camp to give the Catalans a 5-1 aggregate win. Their progression gives Xavi the opportunity to play a further three times in the Champions League this season, should Barca reach the final. This is likely to be the midfielder's last season playing in the competition as he continues to be linked with a summer move to Qatari club Al Sadd, with reports in Spain suggesting he will sign a three-year deal. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas can equal Xavi's Champions League appearances - all time and in the knockout phase - if he faces Atletico on Wednesday night . Cristiano Ronaldo will also draw level with Xavi for knockout stage appearances if he features on Wednesday .

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. 1. Jose Mourinho says injuries to his strikers have made him take a cautious approach to the last few games wrapping up the title, but the defensive side of his team has stayed remarkably settled all season. The 0-0 draw at Arsenal was the 20th time in 33 Premier League games that the Chelsea boss started with his favourite ‘back seven’ of Thibaut Courtois in goal, with Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill, John Terry and Cesar Azpilicueta protected by Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas. No other top-flight manager has come close to that level of consistency in selection. (From left) Gary Cahill, John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic are three of Jose Mourinho's settled back seven . 2. Mario Balotelli’s first start in a Premier League game since the 2-1 defeat by Chelsea in November was as frustrating as all the ones that went before. The Italian produced only one off-target shot at goal before getting hooked after 75 minutes, and defender Martin Skrtel played twice as many accurate passes in the forward half as Balotelli’s nine. His total distance run while he was on the pitch (4.4 miles) was over a mile less than Albion striker Saido Berahino (5.5) who was substituted at the same time. Mario Balotelli failed to impress during Liverpool's 0-0 Premier League draw with West Brom . 3. Mauricio Pochettino, who demands a high-energy pressing game from his teams, must have been delighted that they collectively just outran Southampton to earn their 2-2 draw at St Mary’s. Spurs are currently second behind battling Burnley in the EA Sports Performance figures for the average total distance run per game. That’s a huge contrast to last year under first Andre Villas-Boas and then Tim Sherwood, when they finished bottom of the same table. Mauricio Pochettino points out instructions to his Tottenham players during the 2-2 draw with Southampton . 4. Louis van Gaal blamed a lack of sharpness for Manchester United’s defeat at Everton, saying they lost three duels in a row before James McCarthy’ s fifth minute goal. It didn’t get any better after that. Paddy McNair won five of seven duels but otherwise Daley Blind (5 of 8) and Ander Herrera (5 of 9) were the only other United players to win more than half of their individual battles. James McCarthy slots past David de Gea after avoiding the challenges of Daley Blind and Paddy McNair . 5. Robert Huth was nicknamed the Berlin Wall by Stoke fans and he’s brought the same ‘they shall not pass’ mentality to Leicester’s defence. Since signing for Nigel Pearson on a loan deal at the end of January, the 30-year-old has now played nine games and ended on the losing side only three times. Huth was Leicester’s best defender as they scrapped out the 1-0 win at Burnley, which got them out of the relegation zone, making 14 clearances along the way. Robert Huth (right) has played a major role in Leicester's recent run of positive results . 6. Nathan Dyer took the chance to remind Swansea boss Garry Monk of what he can do after suffering a frustrating few months on the sidelines. The 27-year-old winger, an automatic pick in the first half of the season, made his first start since early February in the 3-2 win at Newcastle. Against a Toon team without a recognised left back he was in his element – winning three free-kicks as he ran at the defence and covering more distance at sprint speed than any other player. Nathan Dyer (left) showed Swansea boss Garry Monk what he'd been missing upon his return from injury . 7. Getting James Chester fit again will be a crucial factor for Hull as Steve Bruce fights to keep his side out of the relegation zone through a tough set of remaining fixtures. The 2-0 win at Crystal Palace was the 26-year-old Wales international’s first 90-minute appearance since dislocating his shoulder at West Ham in January. He was a key factor in keeping in-form Glenn Murray quiet and also composed on the ball giving it away only five times in 90 minutes and winning it back on all but one of those occasions. James Chester (centre) battles for the ball with Crystal Palace forward Glenn Murray on Saturday . 8. Blackburn need to find more goals from the rest of their team if they are to cash in on the prolific form of front men Rudy Gestede and Jordan Rhodes. Rhodes got his 20th of the campaign in the 2-2 draw at Huddersfield while Gestede reached 19 – and if he gets another against Ipswich next weekend Gary Bowyer’s side will join Watford as the only English clubs with two strikers who have got 20 or more League goals. The combination of Troy Deeney (21) and Odion Ighalo (20) has taken the Hornets into the Premier League because the rest of the side have weighed in with enough to make it 90 in total. Blackburn, 13 points outside the play-off places, have scored a total of 63. Jordan Rhodes celebrates his 31st-minute striker during Blackburn's 2-2 draw with Huddersfield . 9. Coventry still need a point at Crawley on the final day to be certain of staying in League One, but either way it’s likely they will immediately be looking for their 10th manager in as many years. Temporary boss Tony Mowbray turned on his team after the 3-1 home defeat by Crewe, accusing some of 'finding it difficult to play'. The former Celtic and Middlesbrough boss has a contract only until the end of next Sunday’s game and has already told friends he plans to be back at his home in the North East the next day. Coventry boss Tony Mowbray (left) turned on his team after the 3-1 home defeat by Crewe on Saturday . 10. Bury stepped in to rescue the career of Tom Soares when he was let go by Stoke in 2012, after starting just five Premier League games in four years following his £1.25million move from Crystal Palace. The former England Under 21 international midfielder couldn’t find another club – and had to play for nothing at first to earn a contract. Three years later he’s close to repaying them by earning promotion. He scored one and made the other in the 2-0 win over Wimbledon which means a last-day victory against already-relegated Tranmere could yet pinch third place from Southend.","Jose Mourinho's defensive set-up has remained settled all season .

"Watford dramatically clinched promotion to the Premier League on Saturday on a typically manic afternoon in the Championship - and insist they're well-equipped to stay in the top flight. Slavisa Jokanovic's men beat Brighton 2-0 at the Amex Stadium in the early kick-off and were hoping that Middlesbrough lost plus Norwich failing to win. Both those results came in during a sensational final five minutes, with Fulham beating Aitor Karanka's Boro 4-3 in stoppage time after Rotherham had equalised against Norwich moments before. Watford have secured promotion back to the Premier League after their 2-0 win away at Brighton . As results from the other games come through, players celebrate wildly on the team-bus . Players can be seen screaming, shouting and singing as Middlesbrough and Norwich both dropped points . Watford will now return to the Premier League for the first time since the 2006-07 campaign . Defender Tommie Hoban has called the club's promotion an 'unbelievable achievement' Watford had won at Brighton and were travelling back home on the team coach when news filtered through on that they had won promotion three hours afterwards. Players and staff erupted on the bus when Ross McCormack scored a 94th-minute winner for Fulham at Craven Cottage. The squad uploaded numerous videos on the internet in the immediate aftermath, with Tommie Hoban labelling it an 'unbelievable achievement'. 'For Middlesbrough to lose like this - it's a magical division. There is no other league like it,' Hoban said. 'Luckily we'd just got into the training ground as Rotherham scored. It is the best day ever, it hasn't sunk in yet. 'I think we can definitely stay up - we have a stronger squad than a few of those teams in the Premier League and will add in the summer.' Watford forward Troy Deeney celebrates after scoring the opening goal against Brighton on Saturday . Twenty-goal striker Odion Ighalo added: 'It is dream to play in the Premier League. 'It was very tense because we were waiting and listening. We're in good spirits now. This is what I came to England for, to play in the Premier League. 'We can stay in the Premier League. We are very calm. It's not going to be easy but the way we are playing now... I think we can stay there.' It ends Watford's eight-year absence from the top flight after suffering relegation back in 2007. The squad were out partying in the town last night. Troy Deeney opened the scoring at Brighton before a stoppage-time Matej Vydra goal sealed the points. Middlesbrough's capitulation at Craven Cottage also means Bournemouth will effectively earn promotion should they beat Bolton tomorrow by virtue of superior goal difference. The Watford players celebrate at full-time as they secure a return to English football's top-flight .","Watford have sealed an automatic return to the Premier League following their 2-0 win at Brighton and Middlesbrough's 4-3 loss at Fulham .

"With tears in her eyes, a grandmother bends down and embraces the seven-year-old granddaughter she has not seen in years. In another scene, a man smiles blissfully as he hugs his emotional father. These pictures show the moving moments men, women and children living in the United States were reunited with their deported relatives after the border gate to Mexico was temporarily opened on Sunday. The steel gate at Border Field State Park in California, which was put in place in the mid-1990s, was unlocked by officials in honor of Children's Day, a Mexican holiday that celebrates youngsters and family. And for selected families, it was a long-awaited, intense experience. Two young boys reportedly fell to their knees as they crossed into Mexico and saw their cherished mother for the first time in two years. Emotional: With tears in her eyes, Yolanda Verona, from Tijuana, Mexico, bends down and embraces her seven-year-old granddaughter, Frida Villagomez - whom she has not seen in years - after the gate at Border Field State Park in California was briefly opened for Children's Day . Reunited: Robert Vivar (pictured in the light-colored top) watches as his daughter, Lelainah, seven, hugs his father Robert Vivar Sr at the gate . Joyful: Mr Vivar smiles blissfully as he embraced by his emotional father on the other side of the California fence, while his daughters Lelainah and four-year-old Willow watch. A Border Patrol Officer (left) also smiles as the family reunites during the event, organized by Border Angels . Tear-jerking: Lourdes Barraza Torres and her toddler daughter, Reyna, are seen hugging Torres's two sons, including Alexis Lopez, 10, as they are reunited for the first time in two years. Alex said he 'felt nervous, but at the same time, excited' at the prospect of seeing his mother again . However, the pair, whose mother had been deported to the country while they were at school, only had two minutes to spend with her - because then it was time for another family to be reunited. One of the boys, Alexis Lopez, now 10, told U-T San Diego that he 'felt nervous, but at the same time, excited' to briefly meet his mother, Lourdes Barraza, in front of other families and photographers. He added: 'We talked about how life was without our mom. About how much we love each other.' Event organizer Father Dermot Rodgers said that while the brief reunions were held for Children's Day, they were also meant to draw attention to what he called a broken immigration system. Many of the families were separated when relatives were deported to Mexico after living in the U.S. without documentation. The gate had only been opened to those affected once before, in 2013. No touching: The gate at Border Field State Park, which was put in place in the mid-1990s, was unlocked by officials for Children's Day, a Mexican holiday that celebrates youngsters and family. Above, Abel, two, speaks to his mom, Yolanda Verona, through the mesh fence . In good spirits: Marisela Augustin holds her two-year-old son Angel after traveling to the border with her husband, Maurilio, to see his mother, Antonia Florencia, who lives in Oaxaca, Mexico. The pair had driven from Washington for the opportunity to meet with deported Ms Florencia . Beaming: Ms Florencia speaks with her relatives through the border fence, which has only been opened to relatives once before - in 2013 . Special event: Many of the families were separated when relatives were deported to Mexico after living in the U.S. without documentation . Aside from then and on Sunday, separated loved ones had only been able to speak to each other through the U.S./Mexico border fence, which has thick, steel mesh and is patrolled by officials. The mesh makes seeing each other nearly impossible - never mind touching. On Sunday, four families - some from as far away as Florida - were given the chance to hug, kiss and share tears of joy. Border Angels organized the event. Founded by Enrique Morones in 1986, the non-profit organization provided toys for children who were reunited with their relatives at the fence. 'It’s only a couple of minutes, but that’s a whole world to somebody who had only been able to see (their family) through Skype, or the wall,' Mr Morones told the news site on Monday. Couple: Hugo Alvarado, of San Diego, California, chats to his wife Guadalupe through the border fence, which is heavily patrolled by officials . Gazing out: Ms Florencia speaks with family members through the border fence. It is not known when the border gate will next be opened . In chage: Enrique Morones (left), the founder of the Border Angels, which organized the event, stands with Border Patrol Officers as he speaks with people who are about to approach the border fence near the ocean. 'It’s only a couple of minutes, but that’s a whole world to somebody who had only been able to see (their family) through Skype, or the wall,' Mr Morones said on Monday as the gate was opened to families . Tight security: Border Patrol Officers are pictured standing by the gate in the border fence, just minutes before four families were reunited . 'To finally put your arms around somebody and realize that love has no borders is very significant.' The pictures from Sunday's event include an image of two-year-old Abel speaking to his mother, Yolanda Verona through the border fence, while being held by his uncle, Albert Villagomez. They also include a photo of Marisela Augustin holding her two-year-old son Angel after traveling to the border with her husband, Maurilio, to see his mother, Antonia Florencia, who lives in Oaxaca.

"Manchester City have told Jason Denayer they want him to spend next season in the English Championship. The Belgian defender has been a revelation during his year-long loan move to Celtic. Already a PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year nominee, the Belgian scooped the same honour at Celtic’s annual awards dinner in Glasgow on Sunday. The 19-year-old had consistently stated he intended returning to his parent club this summer to fight for a first-team place but last week changed his tune to give Ronny Deila some hope of retaining his services for another season. Jason Denayer is set to return to England to spend a season on loan in the Championship . At the time, Denayer said: ‘Of course I would be happy to do that. I’ve had a very good year here so far. ‘I would be happy to come back but I will need to wait until the summer to see what is happening. I prefer just to focus on the present.’ Sportsmail understands, however, that City will block any move by Celtic to instigate another one-year deal. Although they feel Denayer isn’t quite ready to push for a first-team place at the Etihad, they want to see him spend a year in the English second tier in order to complete his footballing apprenticeship. The on-loan Manchester City defender has been in impressive form for Celtic since joining the club . The player recently become a full Belgian international – stepping into the breach when Vincent Kompany was red carded during a 1-0 win against Israel in a Euro 2016 qualifier. With Virgil van Dijk very much on Southampton’s radar, Deila faces the prospect of losing both of his centre-halves before the Champions League qualifiers begin in July. Celtic striker John Guidetti, meanwhile, will discover on Thursday if he is to be punished for singing an allegedly ‘offensive’ song about the demise of Old Firm rivals Rangers. Ronny Deila will be disappointed to lose Denayer and he could lose Virgil van Dijk (right) as well . Guidetti was issued with a notice of complaint last month after giving an interview to Dutch TV show FC Rijnmond. It is not clear if Guidetti will appear before the Hampden panel at Thursday’s re-arranged hearing but Celtic have already backed the player. In a statement issued last month, a spokesman for the Parkhead outfit said: ‘We are very surprised and disappointed that this has even found its way to an SFA judicial panel. John Guidetti will be defending this charge.’ John Guidetti faces disciplinary action after singing an offensive song about rivals Rangers . Guidetti made a sensational start to his Celtic switch, scoring 11 goals in his first 12 games after moving north from the Etihad Stadium. But his form has been patchy since and he was left on the bench by boss Ronny Deila on Sunday as the Hoops took another step towards their fourth consecutive Scottish Premiership title with a 3-0 Tannadice win over Dundee United.","Defender Jason Denayer will not be returning to Celtic next season .

"Just a quarter of voters think David Cameron is hungriest to win the election, a poll reveals today as the Prime Minister tries to step up his campaign passion. After criticism of a dull campaign from the chillaxing PM, Mr Cameron used an interview to insist he was working 'bloody hard' to secure a majority. But only 25 per cent of people think he wants to win most, compared to 43 per cent who believe Ed Miliband is most up for the fight. Scroll down for video . Some 43 per cent of voters think Ed Miliband 'comes across as wanting to win the most' when compared to David Cameron . Opinion polls continue to suggest the result is too close to call, although two surveys yesterday put the Tories ahead, including one which gave them a six-point lead. But while Mr Cameron is frequently seen as the strongest leader when compared to Mr Miliband, voters appear to think he wants to win less. In a YouGov survey for The Times, 43 per cent of voters think Mr Miliband 'comes across as wanting to win the most' when compared to Mr Cameron. Only 25 per cent thought Mr Cameron was hungriest for the job, and 13 per cent said neither of them. Mr Cameron appeared without a tie or jacket again today at Kelvin Hughes in north London as part of a 'sleeves rolled up' strategy designed to show he is fighting hard for a Tory victory. Meanwhile, Mr Miliband is giving a speech on how a Labour government would tackle immigration. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, riding high after strong TV debate performances and a surge in the polls, was judged to be enjoying the fight more than anyone by 34 per cent of voters . Just 7 per cent also thought Mr Cameron was enjoying the campaign the most out of all the main party leaders. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, riding high after strong TV debate performances and a surge in the polls, was judged to be enjoying the fight more than anyone by 34 per cent of voters. Ukip's Nigel Farage was the second happiest leader on 16 per cent, followed by Mr Miliband on 13 per cent. In recent days senior Tories and business backers had begun to criticise the campaign, warning it was dull and suffering from a 'curious lack of energy and belief'. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major warned against relying on dry economic data, when people want to know how their lives will be better. David Cameron appeared without a tie or jacket again today at Kelvin Hughes in north London as part of a 'sleeves rolled up' strategy designed to show he is fighting hard for a Tory victory . More people think Ed Miliband is hungriest for a win and appears to be enjoying the campaign more than his Tory rival . Mr Cameron appears to have taken the criticism to heart, making a series of passionate stump speeches in the last 72 hours. After weeks of criticism that the Conservatives were running a boring campaign, the Prime Minister found the fire in his belly as he declared in London yesterday: 'If I'm getting lively about it it's because I feel bloody lively about it.' In an interview with The Times today he adds: 'The real David Cameron has been standing up and working bloody hard for the last five years. 'I'm feeling pumped up. There's ten days to go, it's a bloody important election and I'm determined to get across the line. The line is victory — and victory is a Conservative majority. I know the polls are tight but victory is doable.'","Poll shows 43% think Labour leader Ed Miliband wants to win the most .

"Selfie queen Karen Danczuk has revealed her ambition to be an MP – insisting she could relate to ordinary women unlike the current crop of female politicians. Mrs Danczuk said women were turned off politics because there was no-one in Parliament like them. The glamorous Labour councillor, who is married to the outspoken MP Simon Danczuk, said Parliament needed people like her ‘to bring it back down to reality’. Scroll down for video . Selfie queen Karen Danczuk told LBC's Nick Ferrari (pictured) in Liverpool today that she aspired to be an MP – insisting she could relate to ordinary women unlike the current crop of female politicians . Mrs Danczuk, 31, who revealed earlier this year that she had suffered sexual abuse, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that she had rebuilt her life after being ‘shattered’ as a child. She said she used provocative selfie pictures on Twitter as a way of saying to others: ‘I will not be ashamed about who I am.’ Mrs Danczuk said she had rebuilt her life after the abuse, but now had the confidence to go into politics. She said: ‘There’s not many women that can relate to women. The women we do have in politics – and I’m not being rude to them because they’re really, really good – are they relating to ordinary women? I think they could relate a bit more.’ Mrs Danczuk became a hit on Twitter after posting a series of provocative photos of herself. She now describes herself as the 'selfie queen' Mrs Danczuk, 31, who revealed earlier this year that she had suffered sexual abuse, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that she had rebuilt her life after being ‘shattered’ as a child . Ms Danczuk was asked if she would go into mainstream politics and replied: ‘Yeah, I would. I think in some ways women like me need to, to bring it back down to reality.’ The mother of two said she didn’t agree with the way women politicians always talked about female issue like childcare. She said: ‘I don’t necessarily think we should assume that because you’re a women, you should focus all your time and effort focussing on childcare. ‘Just speaking a language they understand – you know, dashing to do a school run, to then dash to the supermarket – just speaking about everyday problems.’ She said: ‘Women that I speak to, there’s just nothing there for them to relate to.’ Karen Danczuk, pictured outside Parliament last week, could find herself on the Commons benches with her husband .

Mrs Danczuk also spoke about the sex abuse abuse she suffered as a child and called for anyone who had gone through it to see a therapist. She said: ‘It shatters you – you trust no-one. You have nightmares. You can’t live a normal live.’ But she said therapy had helped. ‘I will not be ashamed about who I am. I used to be ashamed. If anyone says you shouldn’t wear low-cut tops – no, reclaiming your body is a part of the process of recovery. ‘Your body has been taken away from you – they take your body, you lose control of it. It’s not a good place to be.’ She said she used to have ‘horrific nightmares’ every night and couldn’t sleep. Mrs Danczuk said having therapy and ‘dealing with it’ had transformed her life. ‘I don’t think I’m God’s gift to man, but I just have that confidence back because I’ve took control of my life – because that’s what therapy does.’ She said selfies were important to her because they allowed her to be herself. ‘It’s just been happy with you.

"Motherwell have vowed to go to battle with the SPFL over the issue of free entry to the Premiership play-offs for season-ticket holders. And the Fir Park side are set to win powerful backing for their revolt from Championship promotion challengers Rangers and Hibernian. Under existing rules, the SPFL are entitled to take 50 per cent of the gate proceeds from the six play-off ties for redistribution among the clubs. But a bid by the league board to force play-off finalists to charge all fans a minimum price of Â£15 for the play-off ties was withdrawn at a meeting last Thursday. Motherwell will go to battle with the SPFL over free entry to the Premiership play-offs for season-ticket holders . Motherwell general manager Alan Burrows told Sportsmail his club will make a stand if they finish 11th . Expressing unease among the play-off finalists that the SPFL might be using the ties to milk supporters, Motherwell general manager Alan Burrows told Sportsmail his club will make a stand if they finish in the Premiership play-off place. 'All our focus at Motherwell in the next four games is fully on avoiding the play-offs altogether,' said Burrows. 'We fully accept and appreciate that there are rules on this in place. 'But, in the eventuality that we are in 11th place come the play-offs, then it is not our intention to charge our season-ticket holders for the play-off final at Fir Park. 'We believe we have sold them tickets which entitle them to the full story of the season.' Rangers sources said last night that the club have yet to reach a final decision on whether to seek an SPFL exemption which would allow them to let their 25,000 season ticket holders into play-off games for free. The SPFL are entitled to take 50 per cent of the gate proceeds but Motherwell want to offer free tickets . Hibs gained a one-off dispensation to give their most loyal fans free admission to last season's home play-off clash with Hamilton. Sportsmail understands, however, that SPFL lawyers have already warned clubs that attempts to do the same this season will be strongly resisted as it would constitute a breach of league rules. Last week, a resolution by Hibs and Motherwell to have the 50-per-cent levy on play-off gates cut in half was defeated. Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor . Accused of a cash grab to keep more of the play-off cash, Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor for the last two seasons. Asked if he expects a fight on the matter from league chiefs, Burrows admitted: 'Based on what has gone previously, then yes.'

"The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wants dog owners to pick up their pets' droppings and use bins provided (pictured) A London council is to  introduce CSI-style DNA testing for dogs so it can track and fine owners who don't clean up after their animals. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wants dog owners to submit a DNA sample from the inside of the animal's cheek so it is registered on a database. The council would then use stored information to match the animal responsible with any errant mess found on the streets - and issue the owner an £80 fine. The laboratory testing is believed to be 99.9 per cent accurate. The council hopes that the collection of DNA samples would fit well with new national laws requiring all owners in Britain to microchip their dogs by April next year. And while it will mean an expense for the council, they believe it will represent value for money for residents as similar schemes in the US have reduced dog fouling by up to 90 per cent. The move is part of efforts from the council to reduce its £2.3million annual street cleansing bill. Although the methods may seem extreme, Council leader Councillor Darren Rodwell claims they are necessary to clean up the borough. He said: 'We are the first Council in the country to get really tough on dog mess and pet owners who do not act in a socially responsible way. 'The vast majority of dog owners in Barking and Dagenham are socially responsible but unfortunately a selfish few think it's ok to not clean up after their pet. 'Dog mess not only spoils our streets – it's also a health hazard and especially to young children which is why we are using this innovative approach.' The scheme is currently being discussed under the tagline Leading A New Way - but there are no plans as yet to make it mandatory. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, Civic Centre pictured, will become the first in the UK to introduce the plans which will allow them to match dog mess to owners and issue fines . They're currently in discussion with stakeholders including the Kennel Club, Keep Britain Tidy and Streetkleen, the company which will run the DNA testing, on how owners can be encouraged to submit the samples. Streetkleen managing director Gary Downie said: 'I believe the combination of DNA testing and enforcement could be the most effective means of ensuring owners are held accountable for their dog's actions. 'In the US, we have experienced reductions in dog fouling by as much as 90 per cent after introducing the programme. 'For the vast majority of responsible dog owners this should pose no problem at all. 'In fact, we believe that the minimal cost involved in the DNA testing will pose value for money when the selfish minority of dog owners are brought to task.'","Barking and Dagenham to become first council to DNA test dog mess .

"Host commentator . Wow. Real Madrid haven't got going tonight (I was about to write a post about how Barcelona were 5-0 up at this point) but James Rodriguez produces a bit of individual magic to opening the scoring. The ball bounces up to the Colombian who unleashes a stunning left-footed volley, dipping over the goalkeeper and into the top corner at some speed. That was very World Cup-esque, if you don't mind me saying. 39mins: As bad as Real have been, credit must go to Almeria. Their work rate has been exceptional while they are passing and moving, not exactly looking like a side who are  sitting just above the relegation zone. They have completed 184 passes so far today, which is a decent stat given it's not even half time yet. 31mins: But still, it's the visitors who are getting in behind more than Real. There are a few whistles in the crowd, and that's about the only atmosphere there is at this point. Things may get better now though, it's Ronaldo time again with the dead ball... but oh dear. That sums it all up, a limp effort rises way over the crossbar. 27mins: Uh oh. Free-kick time. James is clipped from 30 yards out and Ronaldo is licking his lips. Can he spark this game into life? Nearly! A swerving effort from left to right, the keeper is beaten but the ball doesn't quite dip in time and lands on the roof of the net. 24mins: Again, nice play from Almeria! Thomas, on loan from Atletico, shows his skills down the right before cutting the ball back for Corona, who fluffs his lines. Definitely a half chance for the visitors. Real need to wake up. 19mins: Considering the pace Barcelona were playing at last night this is pretty, er... slow. Real haven't found their rhythm yet while Almeria are just letting them pass from side to side. 15mins: Few more shots for the visitors, but they're both from around 25 yards and Keylor Navas won't be worried by those. Still, they're getting forward while leaving enough men back to fend against what could be a devastating counter attack. 12mins: Better from Almeria. They've won two out of their last three and are trying to bring some of that confidence into this one. Some sloppy passing from Illarramendi almost leads to a chance, as top scorer Hemed looks to get on the end of a cross. 7mins: Three shots already for the hosts, with Ronaldo having the latest two. No goals? Come on Cristiano! First, he runs at the Almeria defence but his left-footed strike is straight at the keeper who flicks it behind - and then from the resulting corner he rises highest but that's ballooned over the bar. 3mins: Almeria have quite a bit of the ball early on but unsurprisingly it's Real who almost force the opening. Javier Hernandez gets space down the left flank and his first time ball is just inches away from Cristiano Ronaldo at the back post. Soon after James meets Arbeloa's drilled cross from the right, but the goalkeeper can watch that one wide. Ominous signs for the visitors with all this space early on though... Away we go! Real Madrid kicking from left to right in the first half. The sun is shining at the Bernabeu, where Odegaard came out prior to kick-off to take a picture. Cute. Minutes until kick-off now, Madrid will be hoping to follow Barca's lead and turn on the style too. Both sets of players wearing 'Todos Con Nepal' t-shirts in support of the victims of the Nepal earthquake, and there will also be a minute's silence. Under the terms set out by Manchester United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid, Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club's 'exclusivity period' to buy the player. So, will he impress tonight? Real Madrid have scored 21 goals in their last four games against Almeria, including an 8-1 victory at the Bernabeu two years ago. Carlo Ancelotti has made nine changes tonight with  Iker Casillas, Dani Carvajal, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo dropping out, though there is still place for Cristiano Ronaldo and Javier Hernandez. And on that note... Real Madrid: Navas, Arbeloa, Pepe, Varane, Coentrao, Kroos, Illarramendi, Rodriguez, Ronaldo, Jese, Hernandez . Subs: Casillas, Marcelo, Nacho, Lucas Silva, Isco, Odegaard, Mayoral . Almeria: Ruben, Ximo, Trujillo, Mauro, Mane, Verza, Thomas, Corona, Dubarbier, Hemed, Edgar . Subs: Julian, Casado, Jonathan, Sanchez, Espinosa, Marin, Azeez . Referee: Ignacio Iglesias Villanueva . It may only be a home clash against lowly Almeria, but tonight could be the biggest night of a 16-year-old's life. Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard has been named on the bench for this evening's La Liga game and may make his debut. Before that though, there is the small matter of Real closing the gap on archrivals Barcelona. Team news coming up. Pressure is on Real Madrid as they aim to narrow the five-point gap Barcelona have opened up at the top of La Liga. Barca hammered Getafe 6-0 on Tuesday to extend their lead at the La Liga summit, but Madrid will hope to reel in their rivals with victory over a struggling Almeria team. Carlo Ancelotti has named Martin Odegaard on the Madrd bench, with the 16-year-old set to make his club debut at the Bernabeu, so follow Sportsmail's coverage of all the action here.","Martin Odegaard may make Real Madrid debut after being named in squad .

"An obsessive Arsenal fan made his girlfriend sit a test quizzing her about his favourite football club. Marking her answers with red pen, she scored an impressive 43.5 out of 50, to which he commented, 'Well done Saskia! As a result, I will not be dumping you! (Lucky you)'. Saskia posted snaps of the test to her Twitter account, @saskiaisabxlla, commenting 'Boyfriend made me take an @Arsenal exam!' with emoticons showing she didn't know whether to laugh or cry. We don't blame her. Saskia's football fan boyfriend made her take an Arsenal test and didn't dump her thanks to her A grade . The test took the form of a school exam, with multiple choice questions, tables to complete, and 'in your own words...' section. There were even 'helpful' instructions including 'Read every question at least twice' and 'Check your answers if you have time at the end'. Oh, and 'calculators may be used'. Saskia scored an impressive 87 per cent, but according to her unnamed boyfriend's feedback she 'could have performed better on Q17', needs to 'Learn ALL player positions' and should understand that 'Tottenham are scum'. What does the 'FC' in Arsenal FC stand for? What is the nickname for Arsenal fans? Who is the current manager of Arsenal? Is the kit below (see picture) Arsenal#s current Home kit or Away kit?

'What player scored the winning goal in the 2014 FA Cup Final?' 'Name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions.' She struggled to come up with the 11th player of the starting  squad (Koscielny, defence, apparently) and thought Ozil was defence and Wellbeck a midfielder, when in fact they are midfield and striker respectively. Tut tut. She scored some decent points for her more creative answers. Asked to explain why Alexis Sanchez is better than Eden Hazard in her own words, she wrote, 'Sanchez is buff, scores lots of goals, Hazard is a p***k, Sanchez is Chilean'. She got double marks for the Hazard comment, but only got half a point for the last one. Saskia clearly knows how to keep her boyfriend happy, as she humoured his question of 'Why are Arsenal the best team to ever grace English football?' with the answer of 'They've won many FA Cups' and 'Thierry Henry is a legend'. However, when she got an answer wrong, her examiner wrote the correct answer in capitals and drew an angry face. This man clearly means business. Doh! Saskia struggled to name all 11 players of the starting squad and got confused on the player positions . Saskia's boyfriend drew an angry face when she got a question wrong - this man means business . Saskia kept her boyfriend happy with creative answers to his questions, and got double marks for some...

"Ousamn Jatta, 45, (right) took wife Beryl, 88, (centre) to a care home while he went to Africa for three weeks but when he returned was not allowed to take her home with him . An African husband who took his elderly British wife to a care home for respite while he went to Gambia is threatening to go on hunger strike after she was not allowed to return to him. Ousman Jatta, 45, married wife Beryl, 88, in Gambia 13 years ago and moved back to the UK with her when she became ill with dementia in 2006. Mr Jatta, who is his wife's carer, had taken her to a care home in February while he returned to Africa for three weeks. But when he went to pick her up he was told social services had intervened and ruled she could not go home with him. Mr Jatta had threatened to go on hunger strike unless Bristol City Council hand over his wife, who he says has pleaded to return home to her husband. 'They have used their power against me to keep my wife in a nursing home against her and my wishes,' said the supermarket security worker. 'I care for her better than anyone and I feel very sad. 'Every time I go to the Gambia I contact social services for respite, but they never told me they were going to keep my wife. 'To me Beryl is not old, she is a human being and no matter if she is old or young she is my wife. 'I would never neglect Beryl. I love Beryl. I'm feeling bad to see her in a nursing home whilst I am ready to look after my own wife. 'As soon as I came to this country I'm looking after her and nothing has happened to her. 'I don't say that the nursing home is bad but to me the belief I have is that you take a person to a home if that person has no-one to look after her but as far as Beryl is concerned, I am ready to look after her until God finalises.' Retired shop worker Mrs Jatta moved to the Gambia more than 17 years ago and met Mr Jatta when he helped translate for her in a local shop. The pair became firm friends and dated for four years before they got married in 2002. But they were forced to come back to the UK when Mrs Jatta fell ill and doctors advised the mother-of-two that she would get better treatment at her home in Bristol. Mr Jatta became her primary carer along with local authority carers who visit during the day while he is at work. Mr Jatta featured in promotional material for Bristol City Council but is now at odds with the local authority over the way he feels he and his wife have been treated . He booked her in for respite care at Avon Lodge Care Centre in Bristol while he went on a break to the Gambia on February 5, telling him he would be back in three weeks. But when he called on February 27 to say he would pick her up the next day, he was told he couldn't collect her and had to telephone social workers for more information. 'I asked why and they said ""contact social services"",' he said. 'It was a weekend so I called social services on Monday morning and the only thing they told me was they thought I was tired and this and that and that I had left her. Mr Jatta had threatened to go on hunger strike unless Bristol City Council hand over his wife, who he says has pleaded to return home to her husband . 'I have said in the past that I am tired and that some time in the future I might need to leave her, but I have never abandoned Beryl. 'I have access to her when I go to the nursing home to see Beryl but as far as I'm concerned it's not the best place for her to be. 'I promised to myself and to God I shall never let her down. Beryl is my first priority. 'I am used to Beryl - we are used to each other. 'When I finish work at 10 o'clock she will not go to bed and tells her carers she is waiting for her husband.' A legal expert who specialises in health and welfare said social workers do not have the power to keep someone against their will. 'They don't have that over-riding say,' said Fiona McGhie from Irwin Mitchell. 'They can form a view and put forward a view of what they think might be in someone's best interested, which may or may not be the same as the family members. 'But ultimately there there's a dispute it needs to go to the Court of Protection, as nobody has got that tight to make a decision either way. 'It doesn't matter how well motivated these decisions or those views are, the rule is for the court to make that final decision.' The authority says it has now agreed an 'appropriate care plan', and are understood to be in discussion with Mr Jatta over the future of his wife's care - but she is currently still in a home. Mr Jatta is confident the council will relent and allow his wife to leave, but is angry at the how he and his wife have been treated. A spokesman for Bristol City Council said: 'We have been in regular contact with Mr Jatta over a period of time regarding his wife's care and are pleased to have agreed an appropriate care plan with him which puts the best interests of Mrs Jatta first.'","Ousman Jatta married to wife Beryl 13 years ago after meeting in Gambia .

"A lonely pensioner left half a million pounds to a builder who once agreed to clean out his gutters for free - but the bequest is now at the centre of a High Court legal battle. Ronald Butcher, a 'private and quiet man', bequeathed his entire £500,000 fortune to Daniel Sharp after he died in March 2013. But his relatives and family friends insist that the will, made just two months before his death, is invalid and say that the builder is lying about his friendship with Mr Butcher. Bequest: Ronald Butcher, pictured, left his £500,000 fortune to a builder when he died in 2013 . Lucky: Daniel Sharp was given £500,000 by Mr Butcher after doing building work for him free . After the pensioner died at home in Enfield, north London aged 75, his body was not discovered for almost two months, the High Court heard. Judge Leslie Anderson QC was told that Mr Butcher's 'family' consisted his elderly cousin, Joyce Gilkerson, plus Evelyn Hutchins and Peter Rogers, the children of a close school friend, who regarded him as their 'uncle Ron'. The three were the equal beneficiaries of a will drawn up by Mr Butcher in December 2011, but after his death they discovered that they had been disinherited. Araba Taylor, for Mrs Hutchins, told the court that the 'odd' nature of Mr Butcher's bequest to Mr Sharp should 'excite suspicion' that he did not fully understand what he was doing. But Jennifer Seaman, for Mr Sharp, said: 'Mr Butcher was a lonely man who found a friend in Mr Sharp. Mr Butcher knew what he was doing when he made the 2013 will and what its effect would be. 'He found a male friend in Mr Sharp, somebody he could chat to. They had a shared interest in DIY and he liked to hear about Mr Sharp's son. That is an explanation why he wanted to make the 2013 will.' Cut out: Evelyn Hutchins, left, and Peter Rogers, right, expected to inherit the bulk of Mr Butcher's fortune . Home: Mr Butcher became friends with Mr Sharp after the builder cleared the gutters of his home in Enfield, pictured, six years before his death . Close: Mr Butcher, left, pictured with members of Mr Rogers and Mrs Hutchins' family . Giving evidence, Mr Sharp described the start of his friendship with Mr Butcher six years before his death, saying: 'When I first cleaned out his gutter he offered me a tenner or twenty quid for it, but I said no, I wouldn't take it. It was a nothing job that took seconds.' Talking of his feelings on learning of his surprise inheritance, he added: 'At the time I was shocked to be given something like that. It's life changing. Nobody gives you nothing in life. 'I didn't think he had people to give it to, or obviously they had had an argument. Something happened and he gave it to me. I can't say the reason why he gave it to me. 'But if I'm the only one who went round to talk to him... I didn't know what's gone on with the others. Obviously there's been a big falling out.' Asked why he did not attend Mr Butcher's funeral, Mr Sharp said it would 'just cause arguments' with the pensioner's family, and refuted Miss Taylor's clim that the two men were not in fact friends. Friendship: Mr Sharp said he did not attend Mr Butcher's funeral because he did not want to upset anyone . Battle: The two sides are locked in a High Court fight at the Royal Courts of Justice, pictured . He said: 'I class a friend as somebody who talks to people. His friends and family hadn't spoken to him in months. At least I was going round whenever I was in the area. 'I'm still shocked today and I can understand why his family are upset about it. But, at the end of the day, there's a reason why he's given it to me. They know it, but I don't. 'We were not good friends, just friends. I never said I was his best mate or whatever.' Mrs Hutchins, 53, told the court that her family had been close to her honorary 'uncle' Mr Butcher. She admitted that she and her brother saw less of him after their mother's death, but denied the suggestion that they had 'slowly lost contact' with him. She said: 'One or other of us would go and see him every break we had. I had tried to pop in around March and had phoned but there was nothing. We were planning to go on a cruise the next year. 'I've never seen Mr Sharp. I would have expected uncle Ron to talk about him.' Mr Rogers, 57, claimed Mr Sharp was 'lying' about being friends with Mr Butcher, adding: 'My uncle had lots of friends and still came to family parties. 'He and Mr Sharp had nothing in common. It just doesn't add up. He would tell us about what was going on in his life and Mr Sharp never ever came up.' The hearing continues.","Ronald Butcher, 75, left his entire life savings to builder Daniel Sharp .

"A senior Indonesian government official has praised the firing squad that executed Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work. 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. Scroll down for video . Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did . Mr Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution . The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March . 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and announced he would withdraw Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' Mr Abbott announced Australia's unprecedented diplomatic response on Wednesday morning, just hours after the Bali Nine duo were put to death despite pleas for their deaths to be reconsidered. 'Australia respects the Indonesian system, we respect Indonesia's sovereignty but we do deplore what's been done and this cannot simply be business as usual,' Mr Abbott said. 'For that reason once all the courtesies have been extended to the Chan and Sukumaran families our ambassador will be withdrawn for consultations.' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect'. 'And I expect to be able to discuss further aspects of our relationship with Indonesia when our ambassador Paul Grigson returns to Australia at the end of this week,' Ms Bishop said. The consul general Majel Hind will formally identify the bodies. Ms Bishop hasn't ruled out cutting Australian aid to Indonesia in protest over the executions of Chan and Sukumaran. Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Australia gives Indonesia about $600 million in aid annually, and is its second largest international benefactor behind Japan. Asked if Australia would respond to the executions by reducing the aid budget, Ms Bishop said it was under different consideration to diplomatic actions such as recalling the ambassador. 'Any announcement to the aid budget will be made at budget time in early May,' she told reporters in Canberra. Mr Abbott stressed that Australia has a 'very important' relationship with Indonesia. 'But it has suffered as a result of what's been done over the last few hours,' he said. 'Whatever people think of the death penalty, whatever people think of drug crime, the fact is that these two families have suffered an appalling tragedy and I'm sure that every Australian's thoughts and prayers will be with those families at this time.' The Prime Minister said he understood people's anger at the executions, but said the government did not want to make a difficult situation worse. 'So I would say to people yes, you are absolutely entitled to be angry but we've got to be very careful to ensure that we do not allow our anger to make a bad situation worse,' he said. 'The relationship between Australia and Indonesia is important, remains important, will always be important, will become more important as time goes by. 'While this is a dark moment in the relationship I am confident that the relationship will be restored for the great benefit of both our countries.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten acknowledged Australians had the right to be outraged but rejected talk of boycotts. 'I don't and we shouldn't hold ordinary or individual Indonesian people responsible,"" he said. 'What Australians need to do is campaign against the death penalty wherever it exists.' Backlash begins: At 6am AEST, hundreds of Twitter users were already pledging to 'boycott Indonesia' Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Now share your opinion . The executions by firing squad occurred at 3:25am AEST on Wednesday evening and came despite months of pressure from the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Senior officials were already angered by a series of snubs from the Indonesians. President Widodo repeatedly refused to return Mr Abbott's phone calls on the issue. Ms Bishop was also angered by the Indonesians' decision to announce the executions were going ahead on Anzac Day, one of Australia's most solemn days of remembrance. The Bali Nine duo's families released a short statement on Wednesday morning. 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. Our sons, our brothers. In the 10 years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others,' it read. 'They asked for mercy, but there was none. They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. We too, will be forever grateful.' Following the executions, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said: 'Indonesia has not just robbed two young men of their lives but robbed itself of two examples of the strengths of its justice system.' Other Labor MPs condemned the killings, with Opposition frontbencher Tony Burke saying 'Lives lost. Nothing gained' and Federal Labor MP Anthony Albanese saying 'RIP Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - a tragic loss of human life on a very sad day.' Greens Leader Christine Milne said: 'The lives of these two Australians have been ended by firing squad at the direction of the Indonesian government. We in Australia must continue to advocate for an end to capital punishment.' Stern words: Julie Bishop has pleaded for the Indonesian government not to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for months . Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak. He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts . Immediately following the executions, parliamentary secretary Steven Ciobo tweeted: 'There are few greater displays of abuse of power and regressive thinking than the death penalty #RIP', tweeted. He was joined by western Sydney backbencher Fiona Scott, who said: 'The death penalty is barbaric and inhumane torture. Murder is murder.' Brazil already recalled its ambassador in January when one of its citizens was executed by Indonesia. But Indonesia forged ahead with more executions overnight, killing six others - including a Frenchman - and shrugging off pressure from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. There is also the potential for other ramifications from Australia. Top human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has suggested Australia could withdraw its $600 million of aid to Indonesia per year and redirect it to Nepal. 'Nepal needs it more,' said Mr Robertson, who accused Indonesia of breaching international law in three instances. Ms Bishop and her Labor counterpart, Tanya Plibersek (right), have been a united force in their opposition to the executions . In an interview with ABC's 730 program on Tuesday evening, Ms Bishop refused to detail the consequences for the Indonesian government. 'I don't intend to focus on the consequences,' she said. 'But of course, should these executions proceed in the manner that I anticipate, of course there will be have to be consequences. I don't want to go into the details.' After months of pleading with the Indonesians - even offering a prisoner swap, paid by Australia - officials still worked on Mr Widodo until the last moment. Late on Tuesday evening, the Australian embassy in Jakarta circulated an extraordinary joint statement with the European Union and French government addressed to Mr Widodo. The statement said: 'It is not too late to change your mind.' But with the exception of Filipino convict Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso - who was spared - Mr Widodo did not.","H.M.

"A former Portuguese detective was today ordered to pay nearly £360,000 to Kate and Gerry McCann after a long-running libel trial. Goncalo Amaral had been on trial over claims he made in a book and a documentary that the couple were involved in their daughter Madeleine's disappearance. In a written verdict, a Lisbon court agreed that Amaral should pay Mr and Mrs McCann €250,000 (£179,000) each in damages and banned further sales of his book The Truth Of The Lie. The couple's lawyer Isabel Duarte also revealed that Amaral had been told to pay interest which she said stood at present at €106,000 (£76,000). Scroll down for video . Kate and Gerry McCann have reportedly been awarded £360,000 in damages from an ex-Portuguese detective who wrote a book claiming their daughter Madeleine had died in an accident instead of being abducted . Police chief Goncalo Amaral (above) ran the initial investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann . Madeleine was three when she went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Mr Amaral, who led the initial investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, released his book three days after the case was closed in 2008. He later took part in a documentary for Portuguese television in which he claimed that Madeleine was dead, that there had been no abduction and the McCanns had hidden her body. The couple, who accuse Amaral of hampering the search for their daughter, had been expected to receive around £1million in damages. Amaral's lawyers have leave to appeal the ruling. The McCanns told the court last summer they were left 'devastated and crushed' by his book, which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief. Mrs McCann, 47, said Madeleine's twin siblings Sean and Amelie, now ten, knew Mr Amaral had written a book but didn't know the detail. Amaral claimed Madeleine (above) had not been abducted, but had died in an accident in Praia da Luz . She told the court last July after applying to make a statement: 'I believe that's what's in Mr Amaral's book and the documentary is very distressing to adults. 'To a child, it could be very damaging.' Asked by the judge how she felt after reading the book, she said: 'I was devastated. 'It made me feel quite desperate because of the injustice I felt towards my daughter and our family as a whole. 'It was very painful to read and I felt sad for Madeleine. I also felt anxious and fearful because of the damage I felt it was doing in Portugal.' She went on to accuse Amaral, thrown off the investigation in 2007 for criticising British police, of 'consistently smearing' them. She also claimed they feared the book may have stopped people coming forward with information about their daughter's whereabouts. A team of 31 British detectives are working exclusively to find the girl. Mystery: British police shift through soil on an area of wasteland during a search for Madeleine McCann in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in June last year during their investigation into her disappearance . The Metropolitan Police was tasked with investigating the disappearance after her family made a personal plea to David Cameron in 2011. Since Madeleine vanished, every possible theory has been explored, including that she was kidnapped by a paedophile or killed during a botched burglary. Others include being snatched by traffickers and sold to a childless couple and that she wandered out of the apartment and died in a tragic accident. However, not one shred of proof of what happened to Madeleine has been uncovered. Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, who took over Operation Grange in December, and her team travelled to Portugal to interview seven suspects and four witnesses, but have not released any information about what they discovered. Portuguese prosecutors also reopened their probe into Madeleine's disappearance last year and are conducting a separate investigation to one led by Scotland Yard.","Goncalo Amaral claimed in book couple were involved in disappearance .

Ronaldo Brown (left), pictured on tour of the Nou Camp in Barcelona, has signed for Oldham Athletic . The 16-year-old  is named after Brazil's former striker Ronaldo, who is pictured scoring in the 2002 World Cup . But he is actually named after the original Brazilian Ronaldo, rather than Portugal star Cristiano. Football-mad mum Denise, 38, chose the name because of her love of the Brazil side - and added that Ronaldo has a twin brother called Rivaldo. Denise, from Fallowfield, Manchester, explained: 'I love football and the boys were born in 1998 - the year of the World Cup. I liked the Brazil side so I named them after Ronaldo and Rivaldo. 'They also have a younger sister called Trezeguet after the French player (David).' Long-suffering Oldham fans, whose team has remained in League One for 18 years, can look forward to one day seeing Ronaldo strutting his stuff at Boundary Park. An Oldham source joked: 'With a new stand about to open we thought we would make a marquee signing to mark the occasion.'

"A furious row erupted today between the Lib Dems and Conservatives over claims David Cameron is plotting to 'slash support for families'. Lib Dem minister Danny Alexander released details of what he claimed are secret plans drawn up in the last government to cut Child Benefit and Child Tax Credits. The Prime Minister 'flatly rejected' the plans, claiming they were drawn up by civil servants on the orders of Mr Alexander. But the Lib Dems hit back, claiming Mr Cameron himself had asked officials to examine ways to curb access to benefits. David Cameron, campaigning in Wetherby, West Yorkshire today, has hit back at claims the Tories have a secret plan to cut child benefit . Conservatives angrily denied the specific proposals set out in the document revealed by the Lib Dems but they remain under pressure to spell out how they will making savings from the benefits bill. According to Danny Alexander, the unimplemented Tory proposals included: . The clash is the worst row between the two former coalition partners and will raise serious doubts about whether they could work together again, if the Tories fall short of a majority. Conservatives angrily denied the specific proposals set out in the document revealed by Mr Alexander. But they remain under pressure to spell out how they will making savings from the benefits bill. Tory Chancellor George Osborne has promised to cut £12billion from the welfare bill after the election, but has repeatedly refused to say where the axe will fall. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg expressed outrage that the Tories could not be 'bothered' to come clean about their plans. The Lib Dems have vowed to block the plan as the price of any future coalition deal after May 7. Mr Alexander, who served as Chief Secretary for the Treasury, has now released details of benefit cuts put to the Quad of senior ministers, which included him, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Osborne. He said he was lifting the lid on the internal coalition discussions because his former government colleagues were 'trying to con the British people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election'. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told LBC's Nick Ferrari that he backed Mr Alexander's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions . Vince Cable has claimed the Tories have a 'nasty streak' as he warned workers had been hit hard by the coalition he served in. The Business Secretary claimed the Conservatives would resurrect plans to allow bosses to 'fire at will'. He told The Independent: 'They have an unfinished agenda. 'There is a very nasty streak [in the Conservative Party]. They are not all nasty as individuals. 'I have worked with them for five years. Some of them are perfectly decent, moderate people.' But he warned the Tories would 'chisel away' at workers' rights. The Lib Dems revealed that in June 2012, the Quad was sent a document called 'Welfare Reform Quad Summer Reading Pack' produced by officials working for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Mr Alexander said the previously dropped plans - including limiting Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit to two children at a cost of £3,500 for a family of three - were a clear signal of where the axe would fall. But he was forced to admit that many of the claims set out in today's document had been made public - and rejected by the Tories - in the past. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'There are lots of ideas that have been doing the rounds for years, so I think it's not credible for the Conservatives to say they do not know what they're going to do. 'If they are proposing £12billion of welfare savings without knowing what they're going to do, that is highly reckless. 'Equally, if they do know what they want to do and they're not telling the British people, that is deceitful. 'And that does frustrate me because I think that this is one of the issues that in the last seven days of the election campaign people would expect the Conservatives to come clean about.' Mr Clegg  backed Mr Alexander's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions saying the Conservatives needed to say where their planned benefits cuts would fall. 'I share Danny's intense frustration verging on anger that the Conservatives think it is okay a week before an election to say that they are going to take the equivalent of £1,500 off eight million of the most vulnerable families in this country and they can't even be bothered to spell out exactly what their plans involve,' he said on an LBC radio phone-in. But the Conservatives dismissed the claim as 'desperate stuff' from the Liberal Democrats and insisted the proposals were 'definitely not our policy'. Mr Osborne told BBC London: 'Well this is a three year old document of policy options that was commissioned by the chief secretary himself. 'We have not put into practice any of these options. We don't support them. We didn't support them. We don't support them in the future.' Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured in Dewsbury today, said the future of child benefit and tax credits is 'on the ballot paper next week' David Cameron will today pledge to cut taxes for the young as he warns Labour would 'reach into your pay packet' by raising them. Young people have been the biggest winners from the increases in the personal allowance since 2010, according to new figures, with five million under-30s gaining an average of £70 a month each from being taken out of income tax. A further 500,000 will gain from the extension of the policy after the election. The announcement is part of a wider offer to young voters today. This includes a target to cut youth unemployment to the lowest level in the G7 group of nations. With just a week to go until polling stations open across the UK on May 7, Mr Cameron told the Guardian it was 'time to throw caution to the winds, let rip and tell people what you really think'. The Prime Minister - who has in recent days deployed a more energetic approach after criticism of a lacklustre pitch to the electorate - said: 'I think we will get there. But the reason it is taking time is, quite rightly, people want to have a good look and a good think.' Tory Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'This is just a desperate attempt by the Lib Dems to try to move their position in the polls, but it's not going to work because these proposals were never proposed or supported by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor and they would never be supported by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor. 'Our principles are very clear when it comes to welfare: it is there to help people, especially to help people get back into work, but also to support the disabled, to support pensioners - and those principles will not change.' Mr Alexander's revelations came as The Times reported growing dissent in Lib Dem ranks over the possibility of entering a second power-sharing deal with the Conservatives if the General Election fails to produce a clear winner. Nick Clegg has based his campaign around the premise that his party would be a restraining influence on either of the main parties. But the newspaper said a number of - mostly unnamed - parliamentarians were increasingly hostile to the prospect of a Tory tie-up, which would have to be approved by a special party conference. Mr Alexander said: 'For five years I won battle after battle to stop the Tories veering off to the right with ideological cuts, and it's been worth it to get the economy back on track while ensuring a fairer society. 'The coalition has delivered savings in a fair way, but the Tories now want to balance the books off the backs of ordinary working families and the most vulnerable in society. 'The Tories have turned their backs on the plan delivered in coalition government. Instead they want to cut £1,500 for eight million households, singling out middle and low-income families to bear the burden - and asking nothing from the best off. 'It's clear from our time in government that the Tories' target will be slashing support for families. I'm lifting the lid on this now because the Conservatives are trying to con the British people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election. 'They now ask the British people to trust them when they make unfunded pledges on health and tax, yet won't tell us how they will cut welfare for millions of families to pay for their plans. They may give with one hand, but they will take away twice as much with the other. 'The Liberal Democrats will take a fairer approach, cutting less than the Conservatives and borrowing less than Labour, to deliver a stronger economy and fairer society with opportunity for everyone.' Labour leader Ed Miliband also seized on the revelation.Speaking ahead of an event in Yorkshire, he said: 'Today we've learnt that child benefit and tax credits are on the ballot paper next week. 'The Tories have drawn up plans to take thousands of pounds away from millions of families. 'The Tories' secret plan has been revealed. 'And they will put it into practice in just seven days' time if they get the chance. 'It's the final proof that working families can't afford five years of the Tories.‎' CONSERVATIVES . LABOUR .

"The Brazilian man shot dead alongside Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in Indonesia was a paranoid schizophrenic who didn't realise he was being executed until his last moments of life. Rodrigo Gularte, 42, asked 'Am I being executed?' as he was being chained up to be transported to the jungle clearing on Nusakambangan island where he and seven other death row inmates were killed by firing squad in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Irish priest appointed to be Gularte's spiritual advisor in his final hours said he talked to Gularte for an hour and a half late on Tuesday night to prepare him for the executions, but the convicted drug trafficker was confused about his fate and complained about hearing voices.

'When they took him out of the cell I was with him and he went to the front place, just to go out to where the car was, and then they put these bloody chains on them,' Father Charlie Burrows told Irish radio station RTE. 'And he said to me ""Am I being executed?"" 'And I said ""Yes, I thought I was explaining that to you"". 'And he didn't get excited because he was a very quiet kind of a guy but he said ""This is not right.""'

'Because he's schizophrenic he said ""Oh, there's a sniper waiting outside to shoot to me"" and I said ""No, you're safe now.""' Father Burrows said once they arrived at the killing fields, all eight death row inmates were tied to crosses with cable ties. All eight men refused to wear blindfolds, choosing instead to face their executioners. Father Burrows said once the men were tied up he was allowed to go and speak to Gularte again, who did not become hysterical but spoke in protest of his imminent death. 'I talked to him and he said ""This is not right, I made one small mistake and I shouldn't be having to die for it,""' he said. 'He was annoyed more than anything else because he's a very soft spoken, quiet and sensitive man.' Gularte was arrested in 2004 on arrival at Jakarta airport with about six kilograms (13 pounds) of cocaine hidden in several surfboards. He was sentenced to death by the Tangerang District Court in February 2005, and spent seven of his 11 years in prison on Nusakambangan. Gularte's family tried without success to obtain clemency for him, saying doctors have classed him as paranoid schizophrenic. Under Indonesian law, a mental health disease can provide for clemency in death penalty cases. Jakarta twice turned down appeals for clemency and the Indonesian authorities told the Gularte family only a government doctor's diagnosis would be considered for Rodrigo's possible reprieve.

Gularte's devastated family always insisted he was mentally ill and fell prey to drugs in his teens and to a Brazilian drug cartel in his early thirties. He was so deluded that when he was arrested he told Indonesian police his two fellow couriers had nothing to do with the scheme. They were sent home. A year later, he was sentenced to death. In an interview with Daily Mail Australia in February, when Gularte's family still had hope he might be spared, his cousin Marlise Gularte de Cavalho said the 42-year-old would tell his family he didn't believe that he would be executed during prison visits. He insisted a manned satellite over Nusakambangan was stalking him and voices in his head told him he wouldn't be executed because 'the voices say the death penalty has been abolished'.

"A 14-year-old girl has died and her mother has been left severely injured after they were thrown off a moving bus following a sexual assault in India. Arshdeep Kaur and her mother Shinder, were travelling from their home in Punjab, northern India, to visit relatives when a group of about half a dozen men began harassing them. The men grabbed Arshdeep and made several attempts to 'molest' her and her mother, but instead of defending them, the bus staff joined in the sexual assault. Scroll down for video . Victims: Arshdeep Kaur, 14, and her mother Shinder, pictured in hospital, were travelling from their home in Punjab, northern India,  when passengers and bus staff sexually assaulted them . The incident took place on a near-empty bus near Moga, some 50 miles from the Pakistani border, in Punjab province. Mrs Kaur, 38, daughter Arshdeep, 14, and son Akashdeep Singh, had taken the bus from their home village to visit Mrs Kaur's parents, Tribune India reports. Shortly after boarding the bus, a group of men had surrounded mother and daughter and tried to grab both of them. Mrs Kaur alerted the conductor about the harassment, he joined in and started abusing them both. After fighting off her attackers, Mrs Kaur ran through the bus to tell the driver to stop the bus, but according to her testimony, he started driving faster. The incident took place on a near-empty bus near Moga, some 50 miles from the Pakistani border, in Punjab province . Vital issue: Officials recently banned a documentary about the 2012 gang rape and murder of an 23-year-old student in Delhi (stock image) The assault continued until the bus slowed down and mother and daughter could break free, however as they attempted to get off the bus, Mrs Kaur says they were pushed. Arshdeep and Mrs Kaur both suffered serious injuries, and the 14-year-old later died in hospital. 'No one helped. They first pushed my daughter off the bus, then me,' Mrs Kaur told NDTV from her hospital bed today. Shortly after the pair had been pushed off, the bus stopped by the roadside and the alleged perpetrators, including the conductor, cleaner and driver fled the scene. The three could later be apprehended and police have launched an investigation into the incident. There has a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India in recent weeks after officials banned a documentary about the 2012 gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary, called India's Daughter, would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators.","Arshdeep and Shinder Kaur were sexually assaulted on a bus in Punjab .

"Francois Hollande has vowed to 'show no mercy' if French peacekeepers are found guilty of sexual assaulting starving children in the Central African Republic. Fourteen soldiers dispatched to restore order after a 2013 coup have been accused of abusing children as young as nine as they begged for something to eat, according to a French judicial source. The investigation has been underway since last year but was only made public yesterday. The French president today said: 'If some soldiers have behaved badly, I will show no mercy.' President Francois Hollande has vowed to 'show no mercy' if French peacekeepers in Central African Republic are found guilty of raping hungry children in exchange for food . The French defence ministry has vehemently denied covering up the scandal following revelations it was made aware of the allegations in July last year when it received a leaked UN report on the subject. The ministry said it immediately launched a probe into the case when it received the news, sending investigators to the former French colony on August 1. A defence ministry spokesman urged 'great caution' because the accusations have not yet been proven, adding: 'There is no desire to hide anything. 'We are not hiding the facts, we are trying to verify the facts.' The abuse reportedly took place at a centre for displaced people near Bangui airport between December 2013  and June 2014. Paula Donovan, co-director of advocacy group AIDS-Free World, saw the report. A French soldier taking part in 'Operation Sangaris' stands guard  at the Boali church as people sit on the floor . She said: 'The children were saying that they were hungry and they thought that they could get some food from the soldiers. 'The answer was ""if you do this, then I will give you food"".' Of the six children testifying against the soldiers, four say they were direct victims of sexual abuse while two others witnessed it, the French judicial source revealed. The UN employee accused of the leak, Anders Kompass, turned the report over to French authorities because his bosses had failed to take action and has since been suspended, The Guardian reported. A UN spokesman confirmed  investigators had conducted a probe last year following 'serious allegations' of child abuse and sexual exploitation by French troops. French soldiers prepare to blow up captured weapons and explosive devices in Bangui on December 4, 2014 . French soldiers patrol in a tank in Bangui amid dust as citizens go about their daily business . They added that an unnamed staff member had been suspended for leaking the report. Florent Geel, head of the Africa desk at the International Federation for Human Rights, said Kompass likely leaked the report because those accused are French. He said: 'When it involves Chad, there is never any follow-up. But here it involves France, where there is an independent judicial system, it could move things on.' The violence in the Central African Republic has largely pitted the Christian majority against mainly Muslim Seleka rebels who led the March 2013 coup against former leader Francois Bozize. The country has yet to react officially, but a government member who wished to remain anonymous said that if true, the allegations were 'horrible and unacceptable'. 'French soldiers cannot behave like this in a country where they came to help civilians,' they added.","14 soldiers have been accused of abusing children as young as nine .

"It has been 40 years since the historic evacuation of the of Saigon as the North Vietnamese army descended upon the city, and among the many stories of heroism and bravery is that of a father who piloted a military helicopter to fly his family to safety. Ba Van Nguyen was able to fly a CH-47 Chinook, the largest helicopter in the South Vietnamese army, with his three young children and wife out of the city and into the South China Sea where they were all ultimately saved by the USS Kirk. This after Nguyen somehow managed to pilot the helicopter while getting out of his flight suit and jumping into the ocean just seconds before it crashed - all on his own. Scroll down for videos . Histo4ric: Ba Van Nguyen piloted a military helicopter (above) on his own to save his family during the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975 . Saved: He flew towards the USS Kirk which was too small to allow the helicopter to land, and so he hoovered over as his family (daughter circled in red) safely jumped out . Helping hand: Sailors on the ship caught the family (above) as they jumped out . In an interview with CNN, some members of the family are revealing what happened on that historic day, and their lives in the years after. They were also part of the PBS special, The Last Days of Vietnam. On April 29, 1975, Nguyen moved his family to his mother-in-law's house, telling them he would be back the next day in the Chinook, and that they would hear him coming when he was close. 'If you hear a Chinook coming, get ready,' Nguyen told his wife. When he arrived later that morning, his family and a few friends got on - as gunfire from the communist forces grew louder and louder as they came closer to the city - and flew out towards the water. Shortly after however, they realized they were running low on fuel, and that is when Nguyen reached out to the Kirk asking for permission to land. 'I must land or crash into the sea,' Nguyen said. 'Please help us.' Bravery: Nguyen then flew back out to sea (above) and jumped from the helicopter . Safe: He managed to avoid the large amounts of shrapnel (above) when the plan crashed . Heading back: A motorboat soon grabbed him from the sea (above) as he wore just a shirt and his boxers . The Kirk however was not large enough to withstand the force of such a large helicopter, which would likely sink the ship and cause the death of everyone onboard. And so it was decided that Nguyen would at least try and save his family. He hoovered over the ship as every passenger jumped onto the deck and were caught by sailors, including his wife and three young children. That is when he went back out to sea and managed to do the impossible and somehow pilot alone, get out of his suit and jump into the water seconds before the helicopter crashed and sent shrapnel flying everywhere. Seconds later, he appeared in the water, wearing nothing but his boxer shorts and a shirt. Hos one possession, some gold he had in his pocket, had fell out and sunk in the South China Sea. 'We couldn't figure out how he did it; he was a Houdini,' said Hugh Doyle, the chief engineering officer. A motorboat was sent out to retrieve him, and moments later he was reunited with his family. The Nguyen family would be part of the 30,000 South Vietnamese refugees ultimately rescued by the Kirk. 'It was a happy ending to a shi**y war,' said Kent Chipman, one of the sailors on the Kirk. Unbelievable: Nguyen somehow managed to operate the plane and it's intricate system (above) alone after everyone jumped . Over: 'It was a happy ending to a shi**y war,' said Kent Chipman, one of the sailors on the Kirk of Nguyen's (above) feat . That was just the beginning for Nguyen though, who now had to start over in America and try to support his family. He did not know the language and he had no money, but he was able to eventually land a job as a technician at Boeing in Seattle. According to his children he was strict, but also self-sufficient and proud, getting the family off government assistance after just a few months and encouraging hard work above all else. 'Your mother and I came to the United States with nothing but my drawers,' he would tell his children. 'Look at where we are today. We are not wealthy. But we are not poor.' He was reunited with the crew from the USS Kirk in 2009, finally revealing his identity after keeping it secret for years, and awarded an air medal for bravery. 'He was staring at me and I was staring at him. He knew and I just knew,' said Chipman of the emotional reunion, this despite the fact that Nguyen was already in the throes of Alzheimer's. It was then that his children were able to see just what their father had accomplished as footage of the day was shared by some of the men who had filmed the incident. Then, three years later, following a remarkable life, Nguyen passed away. He was 73-years-old.","Ba Van Nguyen piloted a military helicopter on his own to save his family during the fall of Saigon on April 29, 1975 .

"This is remarkable moment a teenage boy was found alive in a collapsed building five days after the Nepal earthquake struck. Crowds cheered as Pema Lama, 15, was pulled, dazed and dusty, from the rubble of a guesthouse in Kathmandu after he became 'pancaked' between two floors when the quake hit on Saturday. He was carried out on a stretcher by medics who had placed  an IV drip into his arm and a blue brace around his neck. He appeared stunned and his eyes blinked in the sunlight. His astonishing tale of survival came as a four-month-old baby was reunited with his mother after being rescued from the rubble of their house. Scroll down for videos . Miracle survival: Pema Lama, 15, is rescued from the collapsed Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu five days after becoming trapped in the rubble during the devastating earthquake that struck the country on Saturday . Emergency medical attention: The boy was carried out in a stretcher. His face was covered in dust and medics had put an IV drop into his arm and a brace around his neck . An American disaster response team had been working for several hours to try to free the trapped boy . The rescue was a rare bit of good news in a city that has known little but despair since the earthquake hit on Saturday, leaving more than 5,500 people dead across the poverty-stricken Himalayan nation . An American disaster response team had been working for several hours to try to the 15-year-old boy from the seven-storey Hilton Guesthouse. Speaking shortly before he was rescued, Andrew Olvera, who was heading the team from the U.S. Agency for International Development, said: 'He's not too far down. 'But the floors have collapsed and he'd pancaked between them.' Twisted ropes of steel rebar were all that were holding huge concrete slabs from falling onto the scene. Two concrete floors were hanging down in front like curtains. 'The whole operation is dangerous,' he said. 'But its risk versus gain. To save a human life, we'll risk almost anything.' The boy had been 'pancaked' between two floors, according to Andrew Olvera, who is heading the team from the U.S. Agency for International Development who freed him . Twisted ropes of steel rebar were all that were holding huge concrete slabs from falling onto the teenager . Heroic effort: Members of the Nepalese Armed Police Force carry their officer as they cheer after successfully rescuing earthquake survivor Pema Lama, 15, from the collapsed Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu . Meanwhile, the mother of a baby rescued after being trapped in rubble  has told over her 'overwhelming' joy at being reunited with her child. Five-month-old Sonit Awal was pulled from the ruins of his family home after his heart-broken mother was forced to listen to his cries for 22 anguished hours. Today mother Rasmila Awal thanked 'God and the rescuers' for saving the infant from death. Mrs Awal, 35, tells MailOnline: 'I am so happy to have my baby back. I'm so happy that he is alive.' Sonish was asleep in his cot upstairs when the walls of his home came crashing down around him. His parents and older sister, aged 10, were outside when the tremor struck and desperately tried to reach him. Joy: Five-month-old Sonit Awal was pulled from the ruins of his family home after his heart-broken mother was forced to listen to his cries for 22 anguished hours . Relief: Sister Soniya Awal, 10, father Shyam Awal, 34, mother Rasmila Awal, 35, with baby Sonit Awal in front of their devastated house . Father Shyam Awal worked tirelessly with friends and neighbours to try to free the boy, digging with their bare hands through the rubble. But without the proper equipment it was impossible. The frantic mother could not sleep or eat throughout the 22-hour separation from her young son. She said: 'I could think of nothing else but trying to save my baby. I was very sad. I did not eat. I did not sleep. I could hear him crying from the ruins of our home.' However, following appeals for help, overstretched Nepalese troops arrived to finally embark on a coordinated rescue mission. Mr Awal, 34, a truck driver told MailOnline: 'The baby was saved by a cupboard. He had been lying in his bit by the side of the bed. 'When the walls fell down they knocked a cupboard over and it became wedged by the side of the bed. My son was safe with the cupboard protecting him.' Now the family are homeless and living in the street under a tarpaulin opposite their house. The once smart four-storey structure lies in ruins across the road. Rescued: This is the incredible moment that a four-month-old earthquake survivor was pulled alive from the rubble of his collapsed home following the 7.8-magnitude tremor which shattered Nepal . Saved: The baby boy, who emerged from the wreckage covered in dust, was miraculously found amid the devastation by rescue workers who heard the infant's faint cries . Second chance: The military search team had already scoured the area near to the child's home in Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, in the hope of finding the little boy. But they had moved on after believing he had not survived . Team work: The military team then found the young boy when they returned to the area for the second time . The gap showing the hole where the baby was buried alive for nearly one whole day after his home collapsed . Another survivor who was trapped under rubble next to dead bodies for 82 hours has had one of his legs amputated, it was revealed today. Rishi Khanal, 27, had just finished lunch at a hotel in Kathmandu  when the 7.8-magnitude quake caused the building to crumble around him. He became trapped with his foot crushed under rubble and stayed alive by drinking his own urine. Doctors said they were forced to amputate a leg because of damage from prolonged internal bleeding. Their survival stories are a rare bit of good news in a city that has known little but despair since the earthquake hit, leaving more than 5,500 people dead across the Himalayan nation. Today, rescuers toiled in pouring rain among the debris, but officials said the chance of finding any more survivors was bleak as the death toll neared 5,500. 'I was certain I was going to die': Rishi Khanal is carried out of a collapsed hotel in Kathmandu on a stretcher after being trapped under rubble for 82 hours following the earthquake that struck Nepal four days ago . Relief: Mr Khanal said he was surrounded by dead bodies. But he kept banging on the rubble all around him and eventually this brought a French rescue team that extracted him after an operation lasting many hours . While rescue teams were out in the capital Kathmandu despite the rain, helicopters could not fly to the worst-hit areas in the countryside of the impoverished Himalayan nation. 'There may not be any more survivors,' said Rameshwor Dandal, chief of the disaster management centre at Nepal's home ministry. 'The rain is adding to the problems. Nature seems to be against us.' Anger over the slow pace of the rescue flared yesterday with protests outside parliament. Villagers blocked trucks carrying supplies, demanding the government do more to hasten the distribution of aid that has flooded into the country but has been slow to reach those in need. An official from Nepal's home ministry said the number of confirmed deaths from Saturday's 7.8 magnitude earthquake had risen to 5,489 by Thursday morning. Almost 11,000 were injured, and more than 80 were also killed in neighbouring India and Tibet. Many people have been sleeping in the open after the quake - the United Nations has said 600,000 houses were destroyed or damaged. Workers excavate bodies as they take part in a rescue operation at Kolache-2 in Bhaktapur near Kathmandu . Countries and organisations around the world have rushed to help Nepal, where the massive 7.8 magnitude quake has killed around 5,000 people . A Nepalese woman holds her baby in front of the wreckage of a house destroyed by the quake in Gorkha . Lives ruined: People sort through the rubble of buildings which collapsed in Sathighar, north of Kathmandu . It has said eight million people have been affected, with at least two million in need of tents, water, food and medicines over the next three months. Dandal said foreign rescue teams had told him that their work is almost done because there is little chance of finding any survivors. Nepal is appealing to foreign governments for more helicopters. There are currently about 20 Nepali army, private and Indian army helicopters involved in rescue operations, according to Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a home ministry official. China is expected to send helicopters today, he said. Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has told Reuters the death toll could reach 10,000, with information on casualties and damage from far-flung villages and towns yet to come in. Nepalese soldiers use lime powder as a prevention measure against disease at a  tent site in Kathmandu . People walk past a collapsed building in the UNESCO world heritage site of Bhaktapur outside Kathmandu . That would surpass the 8,500 who died in a 1934 earthquake, the last disaster on this scale to hit the nation of 28 million people sandwiched between India and China. In Kathmandu and other cities, hospitals quickly overflowed with injured soon after the quake, with many being treated out in the open or not at all. Guna Raj, who works for a Kathmandu-based NGO specialising in providing sanitation, said there have been outbreaks of diarrhoea in relief camps because of a shortage of toilets and clean water. 'In the next few days or weeks I am sure there will be an outbreak of epidemics,' said Raj, who is involved in the relief effort. Tensions between foreigners and Nepalis desperate for relief surfaced, rescuers said, as fresh avalanches were reported in several areas. Members of Israeli search-and-rescue group Magnus said hundreds of tourists, including about 100 Israelis, were airlifted out of Langtang in Rasuwa district, a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu hit by an avalanche on Tuesday. But at least two foreigners, whose nationalities were as yet unknown, were found dead, the home ministry said. Fights had broken out there because of food shortages, Magnus team member Amit Rubin said. One of the trekkers said there had also been scuffles over places on the rescue helicopters. The quake also triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 18 climbers and guides, including four foreigners, the worst disaster on the world's highest peak.","Crowds cheered as Pema Lama was pulled, dazed and dusty, from rubble .

"The suspected killer of a teenage CBBC star confessed to his girlfriend before fleeing to Nigeria on his brother's passport, a court has heard. Jeffrey Okafor, 24, of East Dulwich, south east London, is accused of stabbing Carl Beatson-Asiedu to death outside a nightclub in the summer of 2009. The 19-year-old victim, known as DJ Charmz, had been leaving the Club Life Nightclub in Vauxhall's Goding Street, in London, with a group of friends after performing a set when a group of men approached them, the court heard. Carl Beatson Asiedu (left) was stabbed to death outside a nightclub by Jeffrey Okafor (right) who then fled to Nigeria on his brother's passport . Opening the trial, Sarah Whitehouse QC, prosecuting, told Woolwich Crown Court that three people had been specifically targeted in the attack including Mr Beatson-Asiedu, a Francis Xavier College student who appeared in CBBC spy show MI High. Peter Lama, also 19, was stabbed in the buttock by Okafor's friend Abu Mansaray while Jermaine Coker was chased by Junior Ademujimi-Falade but escaped. Mr Lama managed to return to the club, where bouncers locked the doors and called the police. Minutes later, Mr Beatson Asiedu was seen staggering along Goding Street before collapsing in the road. His friends bundled him into the back of a car and rang for an ambulance, but police stopped the speeding vehicle as they struggled to find St Thomas' Hospital. He was pronounced dead at 5.36am, with a post-mortem examination concluding that he had died from a single stab-wound to his heart. Ms Whitehouse said: 'Carl Beatson wasn't so fortunate.' 'The prosecution say that Jeffrey Okafor was the person who drew a knife, stabbed him and killed him.' Okafor, who had no connection with his alleged victim, had been at the club with Ademujimi-Falade and another friend Bolaji Kako-Are. Ms Whitehouse continued: 'Junior Flade and Bolaji Kako-Are had also attended Francis Xavier College - the same college as Carl Beatson and Peter Lama. The 19-year-old victim had been leaving the Club Life Nightclub in Vauxhall's Goding Street, in London, with a group of friends after performing a set when a group of men approached them, the court heard . 'It seems there had been trouble between the two groups in the past. In particular, the other group had targeted Carl Beatson at school and had threatened to hit him. 'However, the two groups had often seen each other at parties since then and, although they did not mix, there had been no further trouble. 'It is not clear, and will probably never be known what led up to this killing of Carl Beatson. 'You might hear that there was some ill feeling between some members of the two groups but there's nothing serious enough in the background to explain why knives should be drawn.' She added that Okafor had been part of a larger group which set upon the victim's smaller group at around 5am. As well as appearing in the CBBC show, Mr Beatson-Asiedu had also helped to form a music group called Kidnplay and was known as Charmz. As well as appearing in the CBBC show, Mr Beatson-Asiedu had also helped to form a music group called Kidnplay and was known as DJ Charmz . The musician, whose group was often booked to play at nightclubs in London and Leicester, performed with his friend at the club that night at an event called Summer Vibz. After their performance, they stayed and had some drinks, but Ms Whitehouse told the jury that the victim had very little alcohol and said it does not appear that drink played any part in the violence that was to unfold when they left the club. Mr Beatson-Asiedu was attacked after leaving the nightspot. Efforts to revive him were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at the scene, the court heard. A pathologist concluded that the cause of death was a single stab wound to the front of the chest. Shortly after the stabbing, Ofakor confessed to his girlfriend before he fled the country on his brother's passport and would remain in Nigeria for five years. 'After the attack, Jeffrey Okafor actually confessed to a girlfriend that he had stabbed Carl Beatson,' Ms Whitehouse said. Within about an hour of the attack, he phoned a girlfriend and told her he had been involved in a 'madness', the court heard. A few days after the attack, Osakor allegedly told his girlfriend that he had stabbed Charmz in the stomach and gave her a pair of black gloves asking her to look after them. Ms Whitehouse said those gloves were passed to police and DNA which may have come from the victim is on one of the gloves. The defendant also phoned and asked the woman to put a t-shirt 'into a plastic bag and put it into a bin in the road', the jury heard. Later that day, when he returned home, Okafor seemed agitated and said 'I'm going down' and 'The Feds are going to be on to me', Ms Whitehouse told the court. 'Okafor then fled from the country, travelling to Nigeria using his brother's passport. After five years on the run in Nigeria Ofakor is now standing trial at Woolwich Crown Court where he denies one count of murder . 'It was not until the end of last year that it was possible for him to be extradited to this country and face his crime. On August 13 police went to his home address, planning to arrest him and to search the house for any evidence relating to the murder. Ms Whitehouse said he laid low for a time and then early on August 17 2009 he took a flight from Heathrow Airport to Lagos, using his brother's passport, the court heard. He was finally arrested on 23 September last year in Asaba, the capital of Nigeria's Delta State, after being on the run and was then extradited to the UK in November. Today he is finally standing trial. Okafor, who has a beard and wore a red checked shirt and glasses, looked emotionless as he listened to the proceedings. He denies murder. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow morning. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Carl Beatson-Asiedu, 19, was stabbed to death outside a nightclub in 2009 .

"Real Madrid failed to activate their first option on Javier Hernandez as the deadline passed on Thursday night. The midnight deadline went by without Madrid making a formal offer to buy the Manchester United striker outright and they must now take their chances with other suitors if they wish to sign him. Hernandez, 26, has impressed in the last few weeks with five goals in his last six games including the decisive strike against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter final and two goals in Madrid's 4-2 win at Celta Vigo last Sunday. Javier Hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at Real Madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . Hernandez (centre) returned to training with his Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday . Hernandez (second left) was all smiles in training, but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . Yet it has followed a largely frustrating season where he has been restricted to just nine starts. United agreed a deal worth around £15million last summer which allowed Real Madrid to first loan Hernandez for the season then buy him outright before other clubs could bid. That exclusivity period passed at midnight though and that will open the door for other clubs to bid.

"Beaming towards the camera as a toothy 10-year-old, Carl Thompson is the picture of health as he poses in his family's back garden. But more than 20 years later the once rosy-cheeked boy is facing death after ballooning to 65 stone to become Britain's fattest man. Consuming 10,000 calories-a-day by gorging on takeaways and whole loaves of bread, the 32-year-old is too heavy to walk or wash himself. He is confined to the ground floor flat where he lives alone in Dover, Kent, kept company by a team of NHS carers who come to bathe him and cook for him every day. Scroll down for video . Carl Thompson, 32, has gained an astonishing 30 stone in just three years and is now bed-bound at 65 stone . Mr Thompson said he has always had problems with food and was even caught raiding neighbours fridges when he was three (left). But aged around 10 he was a normal size and played like a normal child . Living off a combination of incapacity benefits and a disability allowance, Mr Thompson spends roughly £200 every week on takeaways and online food shopping. He has not had a job since he was 17 when he worked in a food factory. At the time Mr Thompson said he ate everything the factory didn't sell. But after the death of his mother in 2012 from a brain tumour, Mr Thompson turned to food as a means of coping with his grief. Breakfast: Four sausages, five fried eggs, fried bread, mushrooms fried in butter, bowl of cereal with full fat milk . Lunch: Bowl of pasta, chips, bacon, pork pies, crisps, pasties, sandwiches and chocolate . Dinner: Chinese or Indian takeaway of up to £25 five nights a week . Snacks: £10 a day on Yorkie bars . With food as his only source of comfort, he doubled in weight from 30 to 65 stone in just three years and became housebound. 'That’s how I put all this weight on. I was very close to my mum,' he said speaking of his mother. 'She was fantastic, and I still haven’t got over it.' Now his days normally begin with a fry-up breakfast of four sausages, five fried eggs, a pan-full of mushrooms and fried bread. Lunch can be a bowlful of pasta, chips, bacon, pork pies, crisps, pasties, sandwiches and chocolate and dinner a takeaway. Since he is unable to leave the house Mr Thompson relies on online shopping deliveries and takeaways. His carers prepare meals with the ingredients he has bought. 'I order takeaways five nights a week, usually spending between £10 and £25 on Chinese, curries, pizza or fish and chips,' he said. 'My carers cook my food during he day and it's always microwaved meals - my favourite is chicken curry.' Alongside takeaways Mr Thompson spends £10 a day on chocolate, typically Yorkie bars. Mr Thompson has put on 30 stone since 2012 (pictured above) when his mother died . He has not had a relationship since his early twenties which ended because of his weight gain. 'My last girlfriend was a girl called Rachel 10 years ago, but we split up after three years because of my weight,' he said. While Mr Thompson said he has always had a problem with food (he was caught raiding his neighbours' fridges when he was three) he said it was made worse by the death of his mother in 2012. Having been admitted to hospital for heart attacks and septicemia in the last three years, he is facing death unless he drastically changes his diet. Desperate to shed 45 stone, Mr Thompson said: 'I could die, that’s the bottom line if I keep going the way I do. 'Because of what I eat I’m missing out on everything in life. 'I cannot go to the park and I cannot go on holiday.' But unlike Paul Mason, previously Britain's heaviest man who tipped the scales at 70 stone, Mr Thompson said he does not want to undergo gastric band surgery. 'I need to go somewhere to lose my weight naturally because I can’t do it on my own,' he said. 'I don’t want a gastric band, they’re dangerous. I’d like the help of a dietician and a psychiatrist to help shift the weight.” While Mr Thompson said he has always had weight issues, he ballooned in size following the death of his mother (pictured together left when he was 15). Now he cannot wash or leave the house . The former factory worker said he has always had a problem with food. He is pictured above aged around four . 'I will go anywhere which will help me lose weight. It’s taken over my life. I can’t move, I can’t cook, and it’s time for that to end.' Earlier this week a woman weighing 60 stone who was once Britain's fattest teenager had to be airlifted out of her home. Georgia Davis, 22, was taken to hospital following the dramatic effort which using a crane to get her out of her specially adapted flat in Aberdare, south Wales. Paul Mason, who was once considered the fattest man in the country after ballooning to 70 stone, has recently told of his ordeal trying to get rid of excess skin following a 46-stone weight loss. The 54-year-old travelled to the U.S. to have the operation carried out after being refused by the NHS. Mr Thompson eats 10,000 calories a day between takeaways, fry up breakfasts, pork pies and microwavable meals . The 32-year-old said he is desperate to lose weight but does not want a gastric band because he thinks they are dangerous .","Carl Thompson has put on an astonishing 30 stone in just three years .

"The mother of a baby rescued after being trapped in rubble for 22 hours following the Nepal earthquake has told of the torture she endured while she heard her little boy cry for help under their flattened home. Five-month-old Sonit Awal was asleep upstairs in the family home when the quake struck, but was saved from death by a cupboard that fell over him. During frantic rescue efforts family and friends used their bare hands to try and free Sonit, but without specialist equipment it was impossible. But today mother Rasmila Awal told MailOnline of her ‘overwhelming joy’ when rescuers finally arrived and pulled Sonit from the devastation, with little more than a scratch to his face. Scroll down for video . Re-united: Mother Rasmila Awal is re-united with her baby boy who was trapped under rubble for 22 hours . Safe: Five-month-old Sonit Awal was heard crying from undernearth the wreckage of his flattened home . Ruined: The family's four-storey house in Bharktapur, Nepal, toppled in Saturday's devastating earthquake . Mrs Awal, 35, said: 'I am so happy to have my baby back. I'm so happy that he is alive.' Sonit was asleep in his cot upstairs when the walls of his four-storey home came crashing down around him. His parents and older sister, aged 10, were outside when the tremor struck and desperately tried to free the little boy from the wreckage, working nonstop through the night with friends and neighbours.. Rescued: Smiling Sonit Awal, aged five months, as he was pulled from the rubble of his home covered in dust . The baby boy, who emerged from the wreckage covered in dust, was miraculously found after rescue workers who heard the infant's faint cries. His mother has spoken of her 'overwhelming joy' that her baby is alive . Sanctuary: Sonit survived only because a cupboard fell on top of him protecting him from the rubble . The family are now homeless and living in a tarpulin opposite the wreckage - but are thankful they are all alive. Sonit's father Shyam Awal lost his brother Azdid in the earthquake . Rasmila Awal said she could hear her baby crying from the ruins of her home. During the 22-hours he was trapped, his mother said she could think of nothing else by trying to save the tiny infant . During the heart-breaking 22 hours that Sanit was trapped, his frantic mother said she tried everything to save her child.. She said: 'I could think of nothing else but trying to save my baby. I was very sad. I did not eat. I did not sleep. 'I could hear him crying from the ruins of our home.' However, following appeals for help, overstretched Nepalese troops arrived to finally embark on a coordinated rescue mission and rescued the boy, as dramatic pictures show. Second chance: The military search team had already scoured the area near to the child's home in Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, in the hope of finding the little boy. But they had moved on after believing he had not survived . Team work: The military team then found the young boy when they returned to the area for the second time . Relief: Sister Soniya Awal, 10, father Shyam Awal, 34, mother Rasmila Awal, 35, with baby Sonit Awal in front of their flattened house. The family have been left destitute by the natural disaster and are living on the street . Areas of Nepal have been completely flattened by the 7.8 magnitute earthquake, which has claimed the lives of more than 5,500 people across the country - and the death toll is expected to rise even further . Mr Awal, 34, a truck driver, had already lost his brother Azdid in the earthquake and said he was thankful rescue workers had managed to lift his son to safety.. He said: 'The baby was saved by a cupboard. He had been lying in his bit by the side of the bed. 'When the walls fell down they knocked a cupboard over and it became wedged by the side of the bed. My son was safe with the cupboard protecting him.' The family are now homeless and living in the street under a tarpaulin opposite their derelict house, situated in the town of Bharktapur, a 30-minute drive from the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu. Despite her family's desperate situation, Mrs Awak says she remains overjoyed that her son survived his ordeal. 'Now God has given me back my boy I want him to lead a good life and do good for others', she said. Mrs Awak said now that her child has been saved by rescuers, she wants him to 'do good' for others . Devoted: Mum Mrs Awak plants a kiss on her baby as he sleeps soundly following his traumatic ordeal . Unharmed: An solider holds baby Sonit after he was plucked to safety from his wrecked home unhurt . Sonit's older sister Soniya added: 'I am so happy my brother is safe. I love my little brother.' One of the Awal's neighbours added: 'We are all so happy that the baby was rescued. Everyone tried to help. It is a miracle he survived. God has blessed him.' The earthquake has destroyed the homes of thousands of Nepalese people, and aftershocks ensue . Rescuers were also rejoicing today after 15-year-old was pulled from the rubble after he had been trapped for five days, . Hundreds of people gathered around to see the teenager, identified by police as Pemba Tamang was pulled out from under the collapsed seven-storey Hilton Hotel building in Kathmandu, dazed and confused, and carried away on a stretcher.

He was trapped under the wreckage for five days . A mother dug for hours through the rubble of her collapsed home to recover the bodies of two of her children, but miraculously found her young son had survived. Sunthalia's home was destroyed in Jharibar, a village in the hilly Gorkha district of Nepal close to the quake's epicentre. With her husband away in India and with no help in sight, she was forced to retrieve the bodies of her 10-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son herself. But she spotted her other son, aged four, still moving. 'I could see my son's fingers fluttering through the pile of stones. 'That's how I could see him and save him,' Sunthalia said, sitting listlessly on the ground, her son by her side, with the stench of dead cattle still in the ruins of her house. Nepalese rescuers, supported by an American disaster response team, had been working for hours to free him. L.B. Basnet, the police officer who crawled into a gap to reach Tamang, said he was surprisingly responsive. ‘He thanked me when I first approached him,’ said Basnet. ‘He told me his name, his address, and I gave him some water. I assured him we were near to him.’ When Tamang was lifted out, his face was covered in dust, and medics had put an IV drop into his arm. He appeared stunned, and his eyes blinked in the sunlight as workers carried him away. Andrew Olvera, an urban search and rescue member with the U.S. Agency for International Development's Disaster Assistance Response Team, said the operation to save the boyd was dangerous. Twisted ropes of steel reinforcing rods were all that stopped huge concrete slabs from falling onto the scene. Two concrete floors hung down in front of the building like curtains. 'It's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we'll risk almost anything.'.Mr Olvera added. More than 5,500 people are confirmed to have died after Saturday’s mammoth earthquake, with authorities fearing that the death toll could rise to 10,000. Thousands of houses and other buildings have been destroyed, and the country has been plagued by more than 70 aftershocks in the five days since the disaster.

A soldier holds a saline drip high as 15-year-old Pamba is carried on a stretcher on his way to hospital . Homeless Nepalese are now fleeing the country in fear, with tens of thousands of people having left Kathmandu, and the government is providing a free service bus service to many destinations. The slow pace of the aid operation sparked clashes between police and desperate earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, as tens of thousands of people are sleeping rough in 16 makeshi . On Wednesday, helicopters finally brought food, temporary shelter and other aid to villages northwest of Kathmandu in the mountainous Gorkha District near the epicentre, where entire clusters of homes have been reduced to rubble.

"Many of us dream about escaping our everyday lives for something more exotic. Ten years ago, bartender Liz Clark did just that when she swapped cleaning glasses for sailing around the world. The 34-year-old left her home in San Diego, California, when she was given a Cal 40 sailboat on the condition that she sail the globe and document her travels. Scroll down for video . Ten years ago, bartender Liz Clark did just that when she swapped cleaning glasses for sailing around the world . The 34-year-old promised to document her travels on a Cal 40 sailboat after being handed inspiration from a retired professor . And for the last decade Liz has been enjoying an idyllic life as she sails alone in a sailboat, travelling about 25,000 nautical miles to date. 'After I graduated from university, I happened to cross paths with a retired professor, Dr. Arent H. Schuyler, who was looking for someone to sail his boat around the world,' says Liz. 'He was 80 years old at the time and just wanted to help someone else realize his dream.' Liz, who studied Environmental Studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara, jumped at the chance. She says: 'At university I learned about all the damage we were doing to the Earth and the unsustainable lifestyles we were leading. 'I looked around me and it seemed like no one was doing anything about it, and I decided that I really didn't want to be a part of it anymore. 'I knew this trip would be everything I loved in one-a simple, eco-friendly lifestyle close to nature, searching for remote uncrowded waves, learning from other cultures, challenging myself physically and mentally, and going on an open-ended adventure.' Liz, who studied Environmental Studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara, jumped at the chance to discover the world . As well as perfect her sailing skills, the ten-year trip has helped Liz perfect her surf-boarding talents . Sailing around the world offers Liz the perfect chance for scenic stop-offs to practise yoga . After graduating from university, Liz worked as a bartender for three years, before quitting her job when the opportunity to sail around the world arose. She spent three years preparing for her voyage and learning how to operate the sailboat. Liz says: 'It was petrifying to leave the safety and security of the dock and my friends and family. 'I didn't know if I would be capable of captaining a boat this big and managing all that goes into a trip where you're off the grid and away from any help - but I knew I had to try or I'd always regret it. 'When I left I didn't know how I'd make money, and I don't come from a wealthy family or anything, like many people assume. 'I was writing blogs the first year and from this I developed a close relationship with Patagonia, an outdoors clothing company - who have been my main financial supporter since the beginning.' It's often hard work for Liz, as she is photographed here  fixing the anchor in the ground to secure her boat in the eastern South Pacific . Liz did make a friend when she visited Tahiti in 2013, and even took the cat on the boat with her . Her travels around the world have given Liz memories to treasure forvever, including enjoying herself with the locals in Panama in 2007 . Setting off in October 2005, Liz has travelled to a number of exotic destinations, including Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the Galapagos Islands. Liz has documented her travels in a series of envy inducing photographs. She used a timer to take some of the pictures herself, while other photos were taken by locals. Photo shows Liz relaxing in the South Pacific in 2014; the former bartender admits to sometimes becoming lonely, and right, some deep sea diving . There was a prime catch on this trip in the eastern Pacific, but Liz would have wanted to share the meal with somebody . Liz feeds some small sharks whilst on an outer island in the French Polynesia in 2011, during her ten year trip around the world . Liz's daily routine includes adjusting sails and boat maintenance, as well as surfing, yoga, swimming and sleeping under the stars. She says: 'People are generally either awed or jealous, others are totally inspired and excited. 'It feels so great to inspire others to live their dreams, but it's impossible to explain to them what this life is really like; how much hard work there is and that it isn't always easy or fun. 'But that's part of living your dreams - it's never easy, but no work is ever as hard when it's part of your dreams and moving you towards your desires.' The journey throws up daily challenges for Liz, shown here as she battles tough weather in the eastern Pacific in 2008 . A spectacular selfie shows a huge wave forms int he background in the South Pacific in 2012 . The trip offered Liz the chance to do some teaching at a school in outer islands French Polynesia, in 2011 . Liz says: 'I get lonely at times and still hope to find a complimentary sailing partner. 'The kindness of strangers wherever I go, along with the remote love and support from family and friends, always fills up that emptiness whenever I feel a void.' In 2011, the man responsible for Liz's adventure, Dr. Schuyler, died, aged 87. Liz says: 'He never wanted to be on the boat. He just wanted to help me live my dream and live vicariously through me. 'That's how my blog originally started, because I wanted him to be able to share my experiences.'

"The old adage may claim that a liar can not look you in the eye, but in truth liars often stare. That's according to former police officer, Darren Stanton, who has become the UK's top human leading human lie detector and body expert. Appearing on ITV's This Morning, the former police officer who has a background in psychology, micro expression training, and neuro linguistic programming (the study of body signals), showed his immense skill in sniffing out deceit. Scroll down for video . The old adage may claim that a liar can not look you in the eye, but in truth liars often stare . Darren Stanton, who has become the UK's top human leading human lie detector and body expert, appeared on This Morning . He managed to suss out when both Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden were were fibbing and also appeared in a video clip catching out a cheating husband for lying about an affair. He asked Amanda Holden to conceal a ball and then try and trick him about which hand it was in, but Darren managed to spot her fib straight away. 'I noticed a slight flick on that side of the mouth – a micro expression,' he said, much to the presenters amazement. Philip Schofield was also caught fibbing, which Darren said he detected by a raised eyebrow. The full-time human lie detector, who recently sat in on the phone hacking trial, then shared his secrets on the This Morning website. How do you tell if someone is telling porkies? 'People might clutch a clipboard, file or coffee cup to their chest, creating a subconscious barrier if they're lying,' he says. 'Or hold it in two hands. Darren knew presenter Amanda Holden was fibbing due to a slight flick on one side of the mouth, much to the presenters amazement. 'Statistically it's a myth that a liar can't look you in the eye. Three to five seconds of eye contact is normal. Any longer and they are either in love with you or fibbing. He also said that brief answers and hesitation are also signs of lying. 'Liars don't like being asked for details. If they're not prepared, they'll either mirror your language or stutter for an answer,' he explains. 'The greater the consequences, the more signals a liar gives off,' adds, giving the example that a person who has committed a serious fraud would give more signals than someone who has stolen a cream cake. But according to the lie-sniffing expert people often have an accurate gut instinct about whether those close to them are telling the truth or not. 'The difference is that the techniques I've learned accelerate this process so I can have the same level of rapport and insight with another in seconds,' he explains. But one of the easiest ways to spot a liar is spotting a twitch. Liars often twitch when they are being untruthful,' he says. 'Sometimes it can be a particularly long blink, or it could be a tiny muscle in the cheek or neck. Men in particular have an area at the bottom of their nose that twitches when they are fibbing.'

"As manager of Rangers, Stuart McCall has learned to tolerate supporters booing their own players. Growing up watching Leeds United, he was less forgiving. 'I remember Terry Yorath and Ray Hankin coming in for stick,' he recalled. 'As a teenager I used to get into fights because of it. 'I remember standing at the back of Leeds kop, maybe I was 15 or 16 year old and Yorath and Hankin were getting booed. Terry Yorath had just taken over from Billy Bremner and it was boooooo… . Rangers manager Stuart McCall has had to get used to his players being booed by supporters . Lee McCulloch, the Rangers captain, was booed for an error that led to a goal against Raith Rovers . McCall hopes that for the time that he is manager of Rangers, McCulloch will be the last player to get booed . 'They had a song for Ray Hankin and it went: 'Ray Hankin, Ray Hankin' and half of them would then shout: 'S**t' and this is while he was warming up for the game. 'That's when I got into fights, with the people shouting s**t. 'Tell me, how's that going to help any individual when that's the reaction to their name just being read out?' Those sour memories returned last weekend when Rangers skipper Lee McCulloch was the object of frustration from the Ibrox stands. Culpable for a Raith Rovers goal, the veteran defender suffered the embarrassment of being booed by his own supporters. He was hardly the first to suffer that fate. So long as McCall remains manager of Rangers – an unknown currently – he hopes McCulloch will be the last. 'I've no problem with a team being booed off at half time or full time, that's fine. People pay their money. 'But I think the individual thing is not on. It was sad to hear last week. 'The good thing was that within minutes of it happening most of the supporters actually turned it round and he was getting backing again. 'We were losing 2-0 and I think people thought: 'You know what, we need to help the team.' It spun itself round and then the majority of the supporters were clapping. 'If it hadn't turned itself round, I don't think we would've got back in the game.' In the west of Scotland, grown men rarely express their feelings. To sympathise would only have drawn attention to the captain's predicament. McCulloch has made no reference to the incident to McCall and vice versa. 'He just wants to get on with it,' added the manager. 'There's not a lot you can say anyway. 'I remember a situation with Michael Higdon at Motherwell. I had to put out a message saying: 'Lay off.' He ended up with 27 goals and player of the year. 'It doesn't help anybody if a player is booed. Yes, we all understand and accept frustration in the stands. But booing one of your own players isn't going to help. 'I fully accept that when you boo your team at half time and full time that's everyone's prerogative. But it's certainly not going to help anyone by scapegoating an individual. 'Is it going to make him feel good and feel like he's going to flourish or is he going to go into himself? Surely that's common sense.' Should McCulloch play against Hearts at Tynecastle on Saturday– and the indications are he will – the defiant, thrawn streak in away supporters will no doubt prompt a different response. Such is the must-win nature of the game and the raucous Gorgie atmosphere that an exaggerated show of support is likely. McCall expects the 36-year-old - a strong, experienced footballer - to be fine. 'Lee has a leadership mentally and he has been about. It's good he's not one of the younger ones. 'He's had highs and lows and he's been there and seen it and represented Rangers terrifically well in his career. 'Hopefully that's it and, although it happened, the overriding feeling for me was that other supporters turned it on its head and that made it better.' The need for Rangers to find some unity at Tynecastle is obvious enough. They must beat champions Hearts and hope Hibs – yet to beat Falkirk this season – show the mental fragility many now regard as their trademark. If Rangers do attain second place, it means two less play-off games. Perhaps more importantly it also avoids another trip to the artificial pitch of Queen of the South where they have already lost 2-0 and 3-0 this season. 'Whoever gets Queen of the South will have a hard game,' said McCall. 'We lost down there twice, but we did beat them once at Ibrox and drew with them, too. 'If we have to go down there, we would be confident because we would have to play them at a full Ibrox as well, which would give everyone a huge lift. 'They have done really well and had two good results against us, but if we play Queen of the South and Hibs - or just Hibs - they will be tough games. 'We've obviously got to win to get second and that's what we'll try to do. Obviously, there is a slight advantage to finishing second with playing two less games. But when it comes down to it, you are just going to have win football games. McCulloch is in line to play for Rangers against league leaders Hearts at the weekend . McCall questioned whether fans booing their own players has any positive impact upon the team . 'If we manage to win at Hearts and Hibs don't win, there will be no great celebrations from our point of view because we won't have achieved anything. 'We've got into the play-offs but, either way, all the hard work is in front of us. 'We're aiming to win on Saturday, we think we can win, but I just really want a good, strong performance to go into the play-offs.'","Captain Lee McCulloch was booed by Rangers supporters last weekend .

"Nigel Farage tonight insisted he would not give up trying to pull Britain out of the European Union even if voters rejected leaving in a referendum. The Ukip leader said he would accept the result and rejected claims his party would become 'redundant' as a result. Mr Farage, appearing on a special Question Time-style programme filmed in Birmingham today, even claimed the party could enjoy an SNP-style surge in support in the wake of a vote to remain in the EU. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage, speaking tonight on a special Question Time style programme broadcast on the BBC, insisted he would not give up trying to pull Britain out of the European Union even if voters rejected leaving in a referendum . The Ukip leader said he would accept the result, but rejected claims his party would become 'redundant' as a result . The Ukip leader's comments come after David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg faced a live-TV grilling over their plans for the next five years in power. All three leaders faced questions over Mr Cameron's proposed European referendum in 2017. The Prime Minister revealed that he would not go into any future Coalition which refused to grant the public a say on Britain's membership of the EU. Mr Miliband however batted off criticism from the audience to insist that he would not hold a referendum – insisting it was not in Britain's interests. Speaking tonight, Mr Farage claimed Britain could thrive outside the EU and vowed to push for a referendum before 2017. He said: 'The point about a referendum is we've had a variety of promises of referendums that have never been delivered. 'I want that referendum conducted on full, free and fair terms. And what I mean by that is that both sides must have the same spending limits. The broadcasters must have an Ombudsman to make sure there is a proper, even debate and we must - and we must define who is qualified to vote in this referendum and who isn't. 'And if it's a full, free and fair referendum I will accept the result. Would it make UKIP redundant? No, because just look at what's happened in Scotland. The Scots – the Scots rejected their independence referendum and yet the SNP have gone to remarkable heights since then.' The Ukip leader faced questions from a live audience for the show, hosted by the presenter Jo Cockburn, broadcast tonight . The show was broadcast after David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg faced a live-TV grilling over their plans for the next five years in power . Mr Farage's claim that Ukip could surge to similar levels of support to the SNP is likely to spark accusations of hubris. In the wake of last year's independence referendum in Scotland, the SNP has seen its support surge to 54 per cent – putting it on course, according to some analysts, to win all 59 seats north of the border. Ukip meanwhile trail badly behind both the Tories and Labour – currently languishing on between 10-15 per cent in the polls. Unlike the SNP, the party is expected to win no more than five seats on May 7 – with some pollsters predicting only the popular Douglas Carswell clinging onto his seat in Clacton, Essex. But Mr Farage insisted Ukip was on course to do well at the election and claimed the party's stance on border controls was backed by the vast majority of the country. He said: '77 per cent of British people want us to have proper border controls and reduced immigration levels, all right? I am pro immigration, but I'm pro controlled immigration.' During the earlier TV showdown Mr Cameron guaranteed that he would not go into government with any party that would not give the public an in-out referendum . Ed Miliband, appearing on the Question Time special tonight, insisted he would not give voters a say on Europe . Mr Farage said Ukip could save 'easily £1bn a year' from NHS health tourism and returned to the controversial topic of foreign HIV sufferers receiving treatment on the NHS. He said: 'The issue I specifically raised was the issue that since 2012 anybody can come to Britain, not to live, but anybody can come to Britain and get HIV treatment on the National Health Service. 'Now it's interesting. I have here a letter from a 30 year old HIV positive man in London who says, why are the waiting rooms now full to overflowing? Why does it now take me three weeks to get an appointment? 'And he says to me, it is because since we opened the door in 2012 we're now incapable of providing HIV treatment for people legally living in Britain.' Mr Farage, facing tough questions from the studio audience, insisted Britain would not be damaged by leaving the EU. He said: 'We're not exiting Europe. Let's be very clear about that. I love Europe, it's a wonderful place. It's got different countries, different people, different languages, cultures, wines, cheeses, it's a great place. 'And providing it's democratic and not fighting each other it is, I think in many ways the richest, culturally the richest continent on Earth. 'However, what now masquerades as being Europe, what has hijacked the word Europe, is something called the European Union which has a flag, it has an anthem, it has a President – not that anyone can ever name who they are – and it is a political union that now makes nearly 75% of our laws, costs us a great deal of money and I think is wholly unnecessary, not just for Britain, but I feel that for the rest of Europe too. Nicola Sturgeon faced questions  from a studio audience at BBC Scotland in Glasgow this evening . The Scottish First Minister insisted she would block a Labour budget if Mr Miliband would not compromise with her . The Ukip leader also backtracked on comments praising the Russian leader Vladimir Putin – admitting that he was 'probably' a threat to the UK. 'Mr Putin who is clearly acting aggressively. I think he is a threat to us. I think there is also a threat from some of the extreme Islamic elements in the Middle East and it's back to the question about defence.'","Ukip leader said he would accept the result of any future EU referendum .

"Nigel Farage will say today that allowing refugees into Europe ‘could lead to half a million Islamic extremists coming to our countries and posing a direct threat to our civilisation’. The Ukip leader will say the boatloads of people trying to get to the continent from North Africa could provide a cover for jihadis wanting to do harm. Mr Farage will make his comments in a debate at the European Parliament in Strasbourg in the wake of more than 1,000 migrants drowning in the Mediterranean. Scroll down for video . Warning: The Ukip leader will say the boatloads of people trying to get to the continent from North Africa could provide a cover for jihadis . He will warn that if the EU agrees to give refuge to migrants from North Africa, it could lead to millions being given passports that allow them to move to Britain. A source close to Mr Farage said he was taking time out from the campaign trail in Britain to focus the election debate on immigration. Campaign bosses believe a provocative intervention could have the same effect as his controversial remarks on foreigners with HIV being treated in Britain – which were part of a so-called ‘shock and awful’ strategy to get attention and appeal to the party’s ‘core voters’. Mr Farage thinks his party could still get more than ten MPs if he manages to cause a ‘big shock’ in the eight days before polling day. A senior Ukip aide said: ‘He needs to make a special intervention. This is a big moment in the campaign. ‘Cameron and Miliband do not want to talk about this because they know the whole issue hinges on EU membership. ‘Nigel is going to highlight how jihadis are entering Europe, getting EU passports, and then are able to easily come to Britain because of the open-borders policy. 'If there is going to be one country where these guys are going to head to, it is going to be us because of the Iraq war and our involvement in Afghanistan and against Islamic State.’ Mr Farage said yesterday he opposed EU action to tackle migrant deaths in the Mediterranean because it could lead to a common migration policy and let millions of people into Britain. He added that the problem had the potential to be more damaging than the eurozone crisis. Mr Farage will warn that if the EU agrees to give refuge to migrants from North Africa, it could lead to millions being given passports that allow them to move to Britain . ‘I think what is happening in Strasbourg is far more significant than anything that has been said by any of the party leaders about immigration … during this campaign,’ he said. ‘They utterly refuse to accept that we are no longer in control of our borders … ‘I’m quite certain Miliband and Cameron will try and ignore this, so I am going there [Strasbourg] to engage in that debate and make sure they cannot ignore it.’ He added: ‘Are we about to see one of the great Brussels dreams come true … a common EU immigration policy? We currently have a net migration figure of 300,000. Goodness knows what it could be if this happens. 'Potentially EU passports are about to be given to a very large number of people and the British political class in Westminster is powerless.’ Mr Farage’s speech could be his last in the European Parliament if he is elected MP for Thanet South. On a campaign visit to Hartlepool yesterday, he accused the SNP of being ‘openly racist’, adding: ‘The anti-English hostility … is totally extraordinary.’","Nigel Farage says refugees into Europe could lead to influx of extremists .

Mr Miliband tonight ruled out a formal deal with the resurgent Nationalists, but a vote-by-vote arrangement remains on the table. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon faced questions from a studio audience at BBC Scotland in Glasgow this evening - immediately after the three main Westminster party leaders faced off in Leeds . Miss Sturgeon's comments came just days after her predecessor Alex Salmond was caught boasting: 'I'm writing Labour's Budget.' The SNP wants to end the Tory-Lib Dem austerity programme and delay plans to balance Britain's books by spending an extra £140billion over the lifetime of the next parliament. Miss Sturgeon believes the coalition's fixed term parliaments legislation will strengthen the SNP's hand. It means general elections are held on a fixed timetable every five years, and makes it much harder for an election to happen at other times. Two-thirds of MPs now have to back an earlier election, and governments can lose votes on Budgets, Queen's Speeches and other key legislation without it being seen as a vote of no confidence and triggering an election. '[Mr Miliband] will not be able to get policies through without winning support from other parties,' she said last night in a Question Time-style programme on BBC Scotland. 'He won't get his Budget through unless he compromises.' The Scottish First Minister talked up her chances of being Westminster's king-maker following next week's election, with polls still pointing to another hung parliament . Ms Sturgeon's remarks come after the former home secretary David Blunkett admitted that Labour could not win a majority because of the SNP surge in Scotland. He said: 'We have a situation where Labour could win literally scores of seats in England and Wales and see themselves unable to offer a majority Labour government because of what's happened in just one part of the United Kingdom.' Mr Miliband tonight insisted he would not do any deals with the SNP - and claimed he would rather not form a government than team up with Ms Sturgeon's party. The Labour leader's hopes of outright victory on May 7 have been shattered by an extraordinary surge in support for the SNP since the referendum in September saw Scots reject independence. Labour leader Ed Miliband, speaking in tonight's special BBC Question Time, said he would rather not be Prime Minister than make a deal with the SNP . David Cameron, appearing on the special BBC programme first, said he only needed 23 seats to win a majority . Ms Sturgeon, who replaced Alex Salmond after the No vote, has vowed to use her gains in the election to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour administration. An Ipsos Mori poll for STV News found support for the nationalists at 54 per cent while Scottish Labour had slipped to 20 per cent. Mr Miliband sought to dismiss the idea that he would be propped up by the SNP: 'We are not going to do a deal with the Scottish National Party. 'If it meant we would not be in government. then so be it. I'm not going to give in to SNP demands - whether that is on Trident or on the deficit. We do want to put forward a Labour Queen's speech.' But Ms Sturgeon said: 'If we have a big team of SNP MPs we can exercise real clout on behalf of Scotland, but we can also build alliances with others in other parts of the UK to get more progressive policies because I think Westminster needs shaken up for everybody.' She added: 'In the House of Commons now… you can defeat governments, you can change the direction of governments without bringing governments down. 'That gives the opposition parties enormous clout. 'Now I know that David Cameron and Ed Miliband are clinging to the pretence that one of the other of them is going to get a majority, but all the polls say – and everybody else knows – they're not. 'And after the votes are counted, they're frankly going to have to wake up and smell the coffee and respect the outcome of the election.' David Cameron faced a series of tough questions from the Yorkshire audience at the BBC Question Time programme hosted by David Dimbleby (left) Labour leader Ed Miliband faced a series of brutal questions over Labour's economic record - but insisted the party had not spent too much . The SNP has declared it will never support the Conservatives in a hung Parliament, but is ready to do a deal with Labour, even if it finishes in second place. It would be the first time since 1924 that a second-placed party had formed a government. Earlier this month, secret video footage of Mr Salmond raised new fears about the Nationalists holding the balance of power at Westminster after May 7. At a fundraising event in the Highlands filmed on April 13, Mr Salmond, who is bidding to return to the Commons, is heard mocking Labour after Chuka Umunna, Shadow Business Secretary, had slapped down Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and said: 'The leader of the Scottish Labour party will not be in charge of the UK budget.' Mr Salmond joked to the audience: 'But then I knew that already, because I'm writing the Labour party budget.' Mr MIliband has insisted Labour will be writing its own Budget.","Scottish First Minister talked up chances of being the king-maker .

"Theresa May warned last night that lives will be in danger if Britain is saddled with a hung Parliament unable to pass anti-terror laws. The Home Secretary said new legislation was urgently needed to update the powers of MI5 and GCHQ, and repair the damage done by the US traitor Edward Snowden. But, based on current polling, Parliament would be left deadlocked – with the balance of power held by Scottish nationalists opposed to updating the law. Home secretary Theresa May (pictured) warned that lives will be in danger if Britain is saddled with a hung Parliament unable to pass anti-terror laws - adding new legislation for MI5 and GCHQ is urgently needed . She urged wavering Ukip supporters and the four in ten voters who say they are still undecided to realise what is at stake for Britain’s security on May 7. The situation is made especially acute by a ‘poison pill’ inserted into emergency anti-terror laws passed last year. The legislation lapses next year. And if MPs cannot agree on a replacement, Britain’s spies will be unable to properly track the communications of Islamic State and other terrorists. Mrs May said that, in the worst scenario, the decision would be in the hands of a minority Ed Miliband government propped up by the SNP – which is opposed to new data retention powers, . Her comments follow a controversial warning by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that Labour might be unable to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP – as the polls say is highly likely. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (pictured) said Labour might be unable to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on Sturgeon’s SNP . Mr Fallon said that, having stabbed his brother in the back to get the Labour leadership, Mr Miliband may now do the same to his country over national security. However Mrs May insists that she is not using counter-terrorism as a ‘political football’ and the threat is real. She told the Mail: ‘It is a matter of very real concern to me. There is a concern where we have a hung Parliament where it is difficult to get legislation through or a Labour government that is propped up by the SNP. ‘Decisions will need to be taken about the capabilities we need and the one party that is committed to ensuring the security agencies and law enforcement have the powers that we need is the Conservative party.’ Mrs May delivered her warning in an exclusive interview with the Mail during a tour of marginal seats in the North and the Midlands. In a question and answer session with sixth formers in Bury, she was asked by a student what her opinion was of Snowden – who leaked millions of documents exposing sensitive spying techniques. In her most forthright comments yet, Mrs May replied: ‘As a result of what he has done, it has become more difficult for our security agencies to do the job they need to do to keep us safe. He has potentially put lives at risk.’ The anti-terror law due to expire next year is the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act, passed as emergency legislation in 2014. It gives security officials access to a treasure trove of communications data collected and stored by mobile phone and internet companies. This includes information on who you call, when, for how long and roughly where you were at the time. It is used for checking alibis, tracing kidnap victims and – in the case of terrorists – identifying and tracking plots. Security agencies say that without it, fanatics will be far harder to monitor and lives will be in danger. In the wake of the Snowden controversy, some technology firms have been reluctant to help the security services. Officials say the leaks by Snowden, made to the Guardian, have been a gift for terrorists. Despite the threat posed by jihadis returning from Syria, security has so far played no significant role in the election campaign. Mrs May will hope her intervention sharpens minds with less than a week to go.","Home Secretary Theresa May warned last night that lives will be in danger if Britain is saddled with a hung Parliament unable to pass anti-terror laws .

"A 'superhero' scientist has ventured into one of the most radioactive places in the world - scaling missile defence system towers, getting bitten by 'radioactive' ants and eating contaminated apples that have grown on trees close to Chernobyl's epicentre. Anonymous scientist Bionerd has attracted thousands of subscribers to her YouTube channel for her visits into the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the site of a devastating nuclear explosion 29 years ago on April 26, 1986, as she measures the high levels of radiation still lingering in the air. Since the disaster the site has been closed off to the world, with Ukrainian scientists agreeing that the area isn't habitable for humans for at least 20,000 years. Despite this, the daredevil researcher claims she has exposed herself to more radiation swimming in the sea and visiting hospital - and says the most scared she's felt during her six visits was getting dangerously close to a rabid fox and walking by abandoned, dilapidated buildings. Scroll down for video . Daring: Bionerd uploaded this picture of her in the Chernobyl power station control room on April 26, exactly 29 years after the disaster . Tasty: Bionerd eats an apple that has grown in radiation-filled Chernobyl, where humans are still not allowed to live due to the cancer risk - but she says she has exposed herself to more radiation going intohospital, and is more likely to develop cancer from swimming in the sea . High: Bionerd free-climbing up the early warning missile detection system in Chernobyl. The area was devastated by a huge nuclear explosion in 1986, but that hasn't stopped the scientist exploring into the no-go zone to film . Speaking to MailOnline Bionerd won't give her real name – because 'Nobody should adore a scientist, one should adore his or her work' – but explains how she has come to 'love' the disaster zone. 'At first it was just about the radiation, the contamination, measuring what was going on. By now, it's for a love of the place', she said. 'Nobody who has not seen this place is able to fully grasp this; a lot of people will think it's crazy. 'But if you've been there and experienced the zone as it truly is - a time capsule - you will understand. Timewarp: An abandoned experiment room in Chernobyl, untouched since the destructive accident in 1986. 31 people died in the immediate aftermath . Abandoned: A derelict operating room in Pripyat - the 'ground zero' city when the nuclear reactor exploded. Bionerd says visiting the abandoned site is like stepping back in time . Damage: The broken pressure gauges from the nuclear power station's control room after the nuclear reactor exploded 29 years ago . Relaxed: Bionerd at the foot of the Duga-3 radar system - known as the Russian Woodpecker - in the heart of the Chernobyl exclusion zone . 'Time stopped the moment the reactor blew, and I don't just mean the readings on the clocks... And if you embrace it, you can understand the zone's true meaning.' The 29th anniversary of the disaster was marked on Sunday, and it is still regarded as the worst nuclear power plant accident in history. Thirty-one people died in the direct aftermath, but the long term effects of the population living close by are still being investigated. As well as conducting scientific experiments measuring the amount of radiation with her bright yellow Geiger counter, Bionerd's videos also show the eeriness of the once thriving and busy area, now abandoned and inhospitable. Yet despite the obvious dangers, Bionerd says she has exposed herself to more radiation when going for a medical procedure in hospital - and is more likely to get skin cancer by swimming in the sea without wearing sunscreen. 'The received dose of radiation [in Chernobly] was far too minor', she said. 'If anything, the medical procedures have exposed me to far greater amounts of radiation than Chernobyl ever will, so if I was to have a 'radiation induced cancer', I probably got it at the emergency room. The Chernobyl power plant after the disaster in 1986 . On April 26. 1986, a sudden power surge at the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, near the city of Pripyat, led to a huge explosion of the reactor which cast highly radioactive particles into the air. The plume spread over wide areas of the then-Soviet Union and eastern Europe, leading to some 350,400 people having to be evacuated and resettled from the most contaminated areas in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. The fight to contain the contamination led to more than half a million emergency workers exposing themselves to high doses of radiation, and cost 18 billion rubles. The deaths of 31 people - all reactor staff or emergency workers - were directly attributed to the disaster, while the Chernobyl Forum predicts the eventual death toll could reach 4,000 among those with a high level of radiation. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was set up by the Soviet military directly after the disaster and covers around 30km of the site, including the epi-centre of the blast. It is one of the most radioactively contaminated areas in the world  - but there are still 197 'Samosley', or 'illegal residents' of the area who refused to move out. Tourism to the zone is growing, thanks in part to the popularity of video games including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Source: Wikipedia . Relaxed: Bionerd with her Geiger counters measuring radiation in Chernobyl. She has visited the site six times to film her experiments . Radiation: Bionerd's array of Geiger counters, which measure the amount of ionizing radiation in the air including alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays . Death trap: More dangerous than the radiation, Bionerd says, are the derelict buildings on the brink of structural collapse . Predator: The Chernobyl exclusion zone has become popular with wildlife, including this rabies-ridden fox . 'It was very stupid of me to go swimming in the sea multiple times without re-applying sun protection, and I hope I won't have to pay for this ignorance one day.' 'When necessary - which which was very few occasions - I was wearing gloves and/or a respirator and/or shoe protection so I don't get contaminated', she added. 'I was extremely cautious about the buildings, as some of them have partially collapsed and are highly dangerous to enter. 'Being buried by a collapsing wall is the true physical danger in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. 'I was also carefully looking out for animals, especially as rabies is a big issue in any rural area in the Ukraine - and thus, also in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, which is a wildlife habitat more than anything else.' Her encounter with a rabid fox is one of the few times on Bionerd's YouTube videos that you hear genuine panic in her voice, as the wild creature comes dangerously close to her car. Reflecting on the impact that nuclear disasters such as Chernobyl has had on the surrounding environment,  Bionerd said she doesn't see it as an 'ideal' energy source. 'In regard to stuff going really wrong, well, that rarely happens - in comparison to total running reactors versus time - and even if it does, it kills a lot less people in total than mining for coal or the smog resulting from emissions from coal plants. Untouched: The operator console of the control room for the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl. The site has barely been touched since the explosion . Defiant: Bionerd and her colleagues in nuclear reactors five and six over the potential reactor core - right in the heart of Chernobyl (see arrow). She says she wants a reliable energy source before shutting nuclear power plants . But after coal, it's still the second-worst source of power because of all that waste that is produced. Both the chemicals during separation and enrichment of uranium or spent fuel as well as the radioactive waste that results in the end of a fuel cycle are a huge issue. 'In theory, I'd say 'Research nuclear reactors: Yes! Nuclear power as an energy source: No!' But there, look at me - on my computer, with the lights on, drinking some coffee i have just prepared using one kW of power. 'We should also look into means of producing cleaner energy, for example nuclear fusion. Dangerous: The sealed-off Chernobyl nuclear power plant, pictured in March 2015 . Massive: Bionerd at the foot of the detection system. She said she finds the attention to her videos 'quite awkward' 'But I cannot demand that we shut off coal plants followed by nuclear power plants within the next ten years, as we need to have a true, reliable and sufficient alternative before that step.' And while Bionerd's videos are rightly receiving praise from around the world due to their scientific content, many have flocked to praise Bionerd's punk style and good looks. How does she feel about that attention? 'If somebody flatters me, it's quite awkward - kind of like if you hand in a manuscript to a book your have put a lot of time and effort into while writing it, and the publisher then writes back to you and just says that you have an absolutely beautiful and marvellous handwriting. 'It's not a bad thing, but it's not really what you want to hear, either.'

"When Jack Wilshere was first showing signs of his enormous potential at Luton Town’s academy, the big boys down the road soon came calling. Everyone was into little Wilshere, with West Ham (the team his dad Andy supports), Tottenham and Arsenal all offering to give Luton’s academy kid a shot at the highest level. Wilshere was a Hitchin boy, spotted early by Luton’s scouts before Arsenal took him to their Hale End academy at nine. At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger’s side. Charlie Patino, 11, and his family must weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham . Like Arsenal star Jack Wilshere he is a talented midfelder who has been spotted at Luton Town . Soon it will be decision time for another Luton discovery as 11-year-old Charlie Patino and his parents Julio and Katy weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Jack, he is a midfielder. The Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season. ‘We just want what’s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,’ said dad Julio on Wednesday. ‘He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.’ Charlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. ‘Other parents have commented on it in the past,’ admitted Julio. The big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA’s compensation guidelines. The transfer fee involved is £10,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton. There are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision. Charlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost £10,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton . 11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona . Julio’s parents are both Spanish. They moved to England in the Sixties before their son was born in England. Charlie watches live La Liga games on Sky Sports. Julio, who is a supporter of La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, added: ‘Charlie doesn’t watch the Spanish football, he analyses it. His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.’ Charlie’s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents’ home in London Colney, Hertfordshire. Soon enough he was invited to play for Luton, often playing in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability with the ball. He has a superior touch and a great feel for the ball, making the game appear effortless. He trains six times a week, spending more than 10 hours a week playing in various age groups at Luton’s highly respected academy before playing a game on a Sunday for the club. Julio, who works in the telecommunications industry, and mum Katy, who works for Marks & Spencer, insist their son has been unaffected by the interest from London’s three biggest clubs, who made their initial moves a few months ago. Charlie has often played in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability on the ball . He trains six hours a week, spending more than 10 hours a week at Luton (pictured Kenilworth Road) The Patino family have already visited the training grounds of Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea with their son, listening to the sales pitches and making it clear that they will take their time. ‘Charlie is only 11 but he gets it and he knows what is happening to him,’ added his dad. ‘He knows that this is a big opportunity to train with a top club, even though there are no guarantees at the end of it.’ The Patinos have been guided through the process by Luton, with the club’s chief executive Gary Sweet making sure that they have been kept fully informed. Julio intends to continue to take his son to Kenilworth Road next season even though Charlie will be settling into his new club. ‘Everybody at Luton has been fantastic and it is a very impressive set-up,’ he added. ‘They have really looked after Charlie over the years.’ The Patino family live near London Colney and have visited Arsenal, Spurs and Chelsea's training grounds .","Charlie Patino, 11, is being chased by Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham .

"Britain's only surviving mobile cinema has gone on sale for £120,000 as the owners who spent years of their life restoring it and touring the country now want to enjoy parenthood. Emma Giffard, 36, and Ollie Halls, 37, from Somerset, bought the cinema for just £1,200 in 2005 and spent £35,000 on restoring the vintage classic with friends in Devon over five years. They toured the country with the classic bus which became a celebrity, starring alongside Melvyn Bragg in a 20-part BBC2 series 'The Reel History of Britain and in 'George Clarke's Amazing Spaces'. Restored: Britain's last-ever mobile cinema has been brought back to its former glory after film buffs found it rotting in a field in 2005 . But now the pair have decided the time has come to sell the bus, which has taken over their lives for more than a decade. 'We've got two children under three,' Emma said. 'Sometimes my mother-in-law comes along and looks after the kids on whatever event site we're on but it's getting to be too hard with the two of them getting bigger.' After years on the road, the couple had their first baby Iona May Giffard Halls in 2012 and five months ago, they're second arrived, Ivy. Since then, Ollie has had to spend five months a year on tour while Emma stays at home with the children and he's now looking forward to having more time with Iona and Ivy. Love affair: Emma and Ollie outside the Bedford cinema which has taken over their lives since they restored it ten years ago . Iona May Giffar Halls, two and a half years old, sits outside the mobile cinema. Her parents are looking to offload the classic so they can concentrate on being parents to her and sister Ivy, five months old. Dad Ollie doesn't want to be on tour as they grow up . Happy families: Mum Emma with Iona May, left, and Ivy, right. The family have just bough they're first home in Somerset . 'I'll miss being on the road and that diversity but if I didn't give it up, I'd miss my children growing up and spending social time with them which is more important than the bus.' It's now listed on eBay for £120,000 which is 100 times what they originally bought it for, but it's not just a bus, it's a piece of British history, listed as 'the soul survivor' of the original fleet. It's one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967, to promote British industry as a global leader by visiting factories to show films about modernisation. With a plastic perspex bubble at the front and a Tardis-like interior with a 26-seater cinema inside, the Bedford SB3 looked like something from the future as they toured the country promoting the 'white heat of technology'. The vintage mobile cinema is one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967 . A piece of history: This was how the buses were advertised when they toured factories to promote British industry in the 1960s . Super seven: The vintage is the soul survivor of a fleet of seven and was rescued from a field in Essex where it sat for 14 years . Promoting industry: Bosses and workers at factories would enter the visiting bus to learn about the 'white heat of technology' But like all modern creations, soon enough they grew old and it wasn't long before this particular cinema was on the road to being forgotten. It was owned by the Transport Trust between 1975 and 1990 but after that it sat in a field in Essex for 14 years until it was rescued by a previous owner based in Somerset. In 2005, Ollie Halls and Emma Giffard of the Vintage Mobile Cinema Company bought it for just £1,200 and brought it to Devon, where they carefully restored it with the help of friends. They spent £35,000 on the restoration which put the vintage cinema back on the road and touring a series of shows at North Devon schools and villages and beyond. From there it went on to exhibit at film festivals, community, corporate and private events around the UK and abroad, travelling as far as Holland and France. Listed: The rare Bedford mobile cinema was fully restored between 2005 and 2010 and is now on offer on eBay for £120,000 . Oliver and Emma are hoping that someone else might take up the mantle and continue touring the bus but at this point the future of the cinema is uncertain. Ollie said: 'It could go any which way - a collector in this country or abroad, someone wanting to run the business, or a group putting together a bid to bring it into a trust. 'I really want it to continue to be out there for people to be able to carry on sharing the experience. 'But we have to decide what route is going to best secure its future, because it's completely unique and owning it means that we're custodians of that little bit of history. Government property: The fleet of Bedford SB3s as they were when they toured the country promoting industry in the 1960s . 'It was never meant to be a career - I just started doing it up as a hobby and it got out of control. 'I was working full time and spending all my spare time and spare money on the bus, lying in the mud in a freezing cold shed wondering if I'd gone mad. 'But people just loved everything about it, which made all the blood, sweat and tears worthwhile. 'They don't make things like this anymore, and it speaks to people's sense of nostalgia. 'It was so popular that it absolutely and 100 per cent took over my life - and it's been hard to give up to because so many people still want the bus.' There's also a new edition which could be a different opportunity to a new owner. The vehicles originally towed huge exhibition trailers and remarkably the cinema has now been reunited with its trailer - after being separated for 23 years. Re-united: The owners got a call 'out of the blue'  from someone who knew where the buses trailer was after they had been separated for 23 years. Now the pair have come together again - but the trailer is a restoration project in itself for the new owner . 'We got a phone call out the blue,' said Ollie. 'Someone saw us on the news and realised that the trailer their friend had been using as a woodwork shop belonged with our cinema. 'It's taken a few years but we've finally put them back together.' Ollie had been promised the trailer from an owner sympathetic to their project around four years ago but when he finally got it, it's actually what convinced the family to part with the bus. 'It's a huge restoration which I don't think I want to do because I have a number of other projects that I'm hoping to work on. 'We've just bought our first house in Somerset which is a restoration project and I've also got a 1940s caravan and another 1960s Bedford truck to work on. 'I'm the kind of guy who likes a challenge but I feel like the bus is done now and I want to work on something new - I've been doing it most of my adult life. 'They drive beautifully together but the trailer is another restoration project - maybe this time for someone else.' Mod cons: Inside the cinema is far from vintage with a full HD projector and Dolby surround sound . The vintage piece is advertised as the 'only surviving' member of a fleet of seven and has 26 1930s-style seats - as well as a few modern tweaks. The projection kit is full HD, with a 7.1 Dolby surround sound, complemented by sound proofing fitted to 'limit external disturbances'. There's also climate control, delivering hot and cold air 'for the comfort of the audience' Ollie and Emma hope that the cinema will remain in use for the people of Britain to enjoy. And although the price-tag is high, potential buyers won't get another opportunity to buy this piece of British history. 'It's one of a kind,' Emma said. 'It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for someone.'","One of only seven commissioned by Ministry of Technology in 1967 to visit factories promoting new technologies .

"A sales manager who claimed he was left too disabled to work after a 'minor' road accident ten years ago has been accused of attempting a £600,000 fraud - after being pictured out in a coffee shop with his celebrity friend Max Clifford. Kevin Morgan, 55, of Weybridge in Surrey, was injured when  a Land Rover Discovery reversed into his stationary Rover 75 while he was working in Dorset in September 2005. The married engineer suffered whiplash, which developed into chronic pain syndrome and a resulting deep depression, which together have ended his working life, his lawyers claim. But as his £600,000 damages claim began at the Central London County Court, he was accused of a staggering fraud by motor insurers, Direct Line Group. Kevin Morgan (pictured right) was filmed meeting up in a coffee shop with his friend Max Clifford (pictured left). Morgan claims that a car accident in 2005 has left him in too much pain to leave his home regularly . William Featherby QC, for Direct Line, said Mr Morgan had been put under surveillance and shown to be far from the disabled wreck he claims to be. He could be seen out walking, joking with a builder, striking up conversation with a stranger, crouching to fix the light on his car and as part of a gathering of friends – including disgraced PR guru Clifford – in a coffee shop. 'We submit that the surveillance evidence shows no sign of disability or distress whatever; rather, it just shows a normal man of Mr Morgan's age,' said the barrister. 'The court can properly find that he has been and is exaggerating deliberately to an unconscionable degree.' The court heard Mr Morgan claims he is in so much pain, particularly in his neck, that he only rarely leaves his house. But the QC said he had been watched by private investigators on 12 random days over three years up to 2013 and seen leaving his house on 10 of those days. 'On the 10 days, you were out and about, walking briskly and behaving perfectly normally,' he told Mr Morgan. 'When we see you on those 10 occasions, your neck doesn't go into spasm. It's lies.' Mr Morgan is pictured outside Central London County Court where the fraud case hearing continues . Questioned on the difference in his demeanour on the day in the coffee shop and in court, Mr Morgan said one had been a 'good' day and the other 'bad'. 'I'm not a dishonest person and I feel like it's almost like I'm on a murder charge,' he told Judge David Mitchell. 'I feel like I need to clear my name.' His barrister Simon Browne QC said the surveillance footage shown in court actually backed Mr Morgan's case. 'It reinforces Mr Morgan's post-accident limitations, as his daily life has been reduced to a 1,350 foot radius around his home,' he said. 'The footage proves that he no longer participates in the maintenance and DIY activities that were once such a large part of his life.' The court heard that, before the accident and until 2009, Mr Morgan had worked as a senior accounts manager for a tools manufacturer. He was a golfer and especially houseproud, keeping his home and garden in an 'immaculate' condition, doing bricklaying, carpentry, plumbing and decorating himself. He and his partner of more than 30 years, Deloris, holidayed often, visiting Greece, Germany, Turkey and various destinations in the UK. The accident, and its after-effects, put an end to all that, Mr Browne told the judge. Neck pain progressed to headaches, with blurred and double vision. His sleep was badly affected and he had numbness in his hands. A consultant psychiatrist who assessed him said his depression was most likely to have been caused by being told his chronic pain was 'likely to be incurable', he added. Experts said he would probably never work again and was more likely to remain in a 'retired' lifestyle, even at only 55 years old, he continued. If his claim was really fraudulent, he had managed to pull the wool over doctors' and other specialists' eyes for years, said the barrister. And, by taking such a claim to court, he was risking losing his home if it went against him, Mr Browne added. However, Mr Featherby said the accident was 'not serious' and 'low impact', occurring when another driver reversed into Mr Morgan's car as he sat stationary in a residential street. It displaced the bumper from his car, but he put it back on with the help of another and did not need to take any time off work immediately afterwards, said the QC. He said Direct Line accepted the accident was genuine and that Mr Morgan initially required attention for his injuries. However, the QC is focusing his specific allegation of 'fraud' on the time after 2009, when Mr Morgan was made redundant from his job. Mr Morgan strongly refutes Direct Line's accusations. The hearing continues.","Motor insurers Direct Line Group put him under video surveillance .

"The feel-good factor at Everton continued to grow after many of the club's first-team players attended the annual 'Academy Day' at Finch Farm on Tuesday. A spring resurgence of five wins and a draw in their last six games has propelled Roberto Martinez's side into the top half of the Premier League,  and the likes of Leon Osman, Phil Jagielka, Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku were all present to pass on advice to the next generation of talent. Players from the under-6 to under-11 age groups joined the Blues' senior stars for a training session  at the Halewood complex, with the fun-filled occasion including games of head tennis and shooting drills overseen by manager Martinez and his coaching staff.

The Academy graduate said: 'This is my second one as part of the first team but I still remember when I did it as an Academy player. We were training with the likes of Big Dunc [Duncan Ferguson] and Joseph Yobo then but it's been great to see the smiles on a lot of kids' faces today. 'The Club really look after the younger players and Finch Farm is a special place to be. Today has been good fun and I think we've had as much fun as the kids!' Academy Director Tim Devine added: It's a great opportunity for the six to 11-year-olds to interact with the players, It's a great example of the family atmosphere that exists at the club.

"Germans now think of themselves as the victims of Hitler and his Nazi Regime . Germans no longer see the Second World War as a defeat and now think of themselves as victims of the Nazis, it has been claimed. Nearly 70 years after the end of the conflict, attitudes are reportedly changing among the younger generation. Research carried out by the Forsa Institute found the number of people who considered the end of the conflict a defeat fell to just nine per cent - a 25 per cent drop in the last decade. Instead, they now exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans, the Times reported. The findings have been published exactly 70 years after Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin. Author Florian Huber has sold tens of thousand of copies of his book, Child Promise Me You Will Shoot Yourself, which examines the number of German suicides after peace was declared. 'German journalists are interested in my book, but they keep asking me whether I am doing something to make Germans out as victims, which is not allowed, it seems,' he reportedly told the newspaper. 'We have to think of ourselves as the bad guys, and it is still a controversial thing to suggest otherwise.' Crimes committed against ordinary Germans by the Allies and the millions that were left uprooted by war are also the subject of other tomes. The German city of Munich is today opening a new museum dedicated to exploring its past as the birthplace of the Nazi movement. The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in the Bavarian capital in 1920, a year before Adolf Hitler became its leader. German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised the city for tackling what she called 'the long repressed confrontation with the special role Munich played.' Gruetters noted that Germany's effort to examine its past - which encompassed World War II and the murder of millions the Nazis considered unworthy of life - is getting harder by the year because the number of witnesses is dwindling. Only nine per cent of Germans now consider the end of the conflict a defeat. Pictured:Operation Overlord in June 1944 .","Only nine per cent of Germans now consider the end of WWII a defeat .

"Jack Wilshere is reportedly on the shopping list of Manchester City this summer, but the Arsenal midfielder showed off his own trolley dash during his day off on Monday. Wilshere has been forced to miss five months of this season following ankle surgery in November, but the  England midfielder is closing in on a return to full fitness. Before that long-awaited return to first-team duty, and before loading the boot of his car, the 23-year-old was keen to share his staple food requirements with his 891,000 instagram followers.

"At last it’s on. Not only the Fight of the Century but the sale of tickets for Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao. The desert storm in a box office which some thought might pull the plug on the richest fight of all time has blown over. Those priceless tickets will be on sale at 8pm on Thursday after weeks of wrangling and accusations between Mayweather Promotions and Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum. Tickets for the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are on sale on Thursday . Pacquiao posted a picture of him looking in good shape 10 days before the fight . This thorny matter was settled at a meeting between Arum, Mayweather’s advisor Al Haymon and CBS television mogul Les Moonves who brokered the deal for the fight itself. The issues over the number of tickets, credentials and hotel rooms to be made available to each camp were all resolved. Since this required a separate contract with the MGM there was speculation that the fight might be in jeopardy. In reality May 2 in the Grand Garden Arena was always going to take place. Mayweather trains with his uncle Roger during a media workout in Las Vegas last week . Pacquiao is taken on the pads by trainer Freddie Roach in front of the watching media . Even Arum, angered as he was by delays he blamed on the Mayweather side for making the tickets release far later than for any big fight ever, had said: ‘There’s too much at stake for the plug to be pulled. Like half-billion dollars which it is now expected to generate, with Mayweather and Pacquiao set to bank at least $180million and $120m respectively, . Arum adds: ‘All the matters have been agreed and the contract is being drawn up.’ The vast majority of the 16,500 tickets were always destined to be parcelled up between the two promoters, the two cable networks sharing the pay-per-view broadcast and the MGM hotel group for their clients and high rollers. Only a token 1000 seats are going on public sale, at between $1,500 (£1,000) and $7,500 (£5,000) each. But none for the super-ringside tickets costing $10,000 (£6,600). There are reports that those seats will exchanged hands on ‘the alternative market’ for upwards of $200,000 (£133,000) As many as 50,000 tickets will be available to watch the fight at various MGM properties via closed-circuit television. Priced at $150 (£100), they will be on sale at 11pm on Thursday.","Tickets for the fight in Las Vegas go on sale on Thursday night .

"IPSA chief Sir Ian Kennedy launched a bid to keep MPs' receipts private . All MPs' expenses receipts will have to be published after a court threw out a bid to keep them private. The Commons expenses watchdog, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, had launched a bid to keep MPs' original claims secret. But the Court of Appeal ruled today that it must release all the copies of receipts and invoices which have been submitted by politicians. The legal action centred on whether copies of original documents should be published - rather than a summary of the claim put in by MPs. The case stems from a Freedom of Information request to Ipsa in 2010 - just a year after the MPs' expenses scandal erupted - asking for three specific receipts submitted by politicians in support of their claims. But instead of providing the original receipts, Ipsa sent back a typed-up summary of the claims. The Information Commissioner later ruled that the receipts themselves should have been published - but Ipsa continued to fight the case. Today's ruling comes six years after the MPs expenses scandal broke - triggering the most explosive British political scandal in a generation. Voters reacted with fury at the list of extraordinary claims submitted by MPs - with jaw-dropping details of fraud, fake receipts and payouts for ornamental duck houses and moat cleaning. Yet, today's latest court ruling shows the the scandal has refused to die, six years and almost two general elections later. After dismissing the privacy appeal today, Lord Justice Richards said the receipts could still not be published in full - to give Ipsa time to appeal again to the Supreme Court. An Ipsa spokesman said after the ruling: 'We need to study the judgement carefully. The court made clear that this is an important test case with implications not just for Ipsa but for all other public bodies. 'We were right to test the point of law through an appeal to see whether images of receipts add anything additional to all the information about MPs' expenditure that we already release.' The spokesman added: 'We remain completely committed to openness and transparency and already publish a detailed breakdown of every claim made by every MP.' Lord Justice Richards said that although the appeal was concerned with three specific invoices or receipts 'it is a test case and has important implications for Ipsa and, no doubt, for other public authorities'. He said Ipsa publishes details of claims on its website but does not publish copies of the supporting invoices or receipts. In 2010 Ben Leapman, then a Sunday Telegraph reporter, made a request to Ipsa for the information contained in three such documents to be sent to him. Parliament's expenses watchdog has fought plans to keep MPs' original receipts secret - arguing that it should only have to publish a summary of their claims . The MPs expenses revealed a series of extravagant claims - including for the repair of a 'Stockholm' duck house by Tory MP Sir Peter Viggers . The judge said Ipsa responded 'with a transcript of information contained in the documents, including information additional to that published on its website, but refused to provide copies of the documents themselves'. Ipsa was set up to restore public confidence following the 2009 expenses scandal, which led to some MPs being jailed. In that same year, parliamentary authorities published more than a million receipts online - with details such as addresses and account numbers hidden. However, Ipsa decided in 2010 not to publish receipts routinely, restricting its regular releases to a summary of each claim. It said there were a number of factors which had led it to decide that there was ''insufficient public benefit'' in publishing receipts and invoices. In a letter to the Information Commissioner, it said: 'Primarily, a trial of extracting and redacting receipts and invoices for the purposes of publication showed that the cost would be in excess of £1 million for additional staffing and IT costs alone, compared to the approximate £250,000 cost under the chosen model.' It said 'on balance' it took the view that providing images of receipts or invoices would be 'disproportionate in terms of costs, insufficiently beneficial in terms of transparency and represented a higher risk in terms of data protection'.","Commons expenses watchdog launched bid to keep MPs' claims private .

"The future of Andy Murray’s coaching arrangement with Amelie Mauresmo looks shrouded in doubt after he confirmed that they will take a prolonged break from each other after Wimbledon. Mauresmo, who is expecting a baby in August, will be replaced by Swede Jonas Bjorkman in the lead-up to the US Open and quite possibly after that, depending on how she assesses her priorities. The 27-year-old Scot, who is in Munich for this week’s BMW Open and joined in the 100-year celebrations at the Iphitos Tennis Club on Monday night, parted company with Ivan Lendl last year because the Czech was no longer able to spend half the year travelling.

Murray (left) and coach Jonas Bjorkman enjoy the celebrations in Munich on Monday evening . Murray (left) arrives at the party alongside German sports manager Michael Mronz . Murray (right) poses for a picture alongside WBO Super Middleweight champion Arthur Abraham . Murray made it clear that if the responsibilities of parenthood prevent Mauresmo from fulfilling her 26-week commitment, then their relationship may have to go the same way. ‘Right now Amelie does all the major competitions but if she doesn’t want to do loads of time, I don’t find it beneficial if someone just comes in for the major competitions and doesn’t do any of the training, any of the other events,’ Murray said. The plan is for Mauresmo to work with him up until Wimbledon, although by then she will be in the latter stages of pregnancy. Murray originally considered Bjorkman as a replacement for Lendl so if their current trial works well, it is likely he will take a more significant role than as an assistant to Mauresmo. It quickly became clear to Murray that the respected Swede might be used in an increased capacity after Mauresmo told him in February that, eight months after they had formalised their agreement, she was expecting — initially saying she had ‘something personal’ to tell him. ‘I thought, “Something personal to tell you?” I thought maybe she’s pregnant,’ Murray said. ‘She normally goes to the gym all the time but she didn’t train once through Australia. When she told me, it was a bit of a surprise. But because she’d pre-warned me I kind of expected it a little bit.’ Murray and Mauresmo look likely to part ways when his coach gives birth later on in the year . Jonas Bjorkmann (left) will work with Murray until the end of the US Open and then maybe longer . Mauresmo is not in Munich this week for Murray’s first tournament on the clay since he got married. So far everything with Bjorkman has been satisfactory and he joined them in Barcelona last week at a training camp. ‘He’s easy going but as a player he was mentally very strong and had a great work ethic,’ Murray said. ‘I see him as being a good fit personality-wise but you don’t really get the whole package until you’re playing matches and there’s a bit more pressure and stress. I wouldn’t imagine it would be too much of a problem for him.’ Although wearing a wedding ring, Murray will be taking it off when he plays. ‘I can’t play with it holding the racket because it gives me blisters,’ he said. After Munich, Murray is playing Masters level events in Madrid and Rome before heading to the French Open in Paris.

"Nigel Farage today accused the SNP of being 'openly racist', blaming Alex Salmond for fuelling resentment. The Ukip leader said anti-English sentiment in Scotland was now the 'biggest' form of racism in the UK. H‎e said Mr Salmond had made the problem worse and said it was wrong that Ukip is called racist. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage, pictured today giving a speech in Harrogate, said the SNP was 'openly racist', accusing Alex Salmond (right) of fuelling resentment . Speaking during a visit to Hartlepool, Mr Farage said: ''The biggest racism I have seen in British politics is happening north of the border where some of the anti-english hatred is reaching a truly astonishing level. 'T‎he SNP are openly racist. The anti-English hostility and the kind of language that is used about and towards English people is totally extraordinary. 'If my supporters behaved in the way that some of those pro-independence supporters behaved in the referendum I'd have been painted out to be the worst person that had been seen for 70 years in British politics.' Asked if being anti-English was the same as being racist, Mr Farage said: 'When I say that I don't think we should have an open door to Poland, Latvia and Lithuania I'm accused of being racist and yet when it's the Scots being rude about the English you don't think it is. 'The fact is Ukip is a non-racist non-sectarian political party and we've got more members of black and ethnic minority standing for us than the Green Party or the Liberal Democrats. We're an all embracing party.' Mr Farage addressed supporters at the Grand Hotel, in Hartlepool,  as he stepped up his election push in the north of England . Nigel Farage has said he is 'astonished' by how little clothing women in Newcastle wear on a night out. The Ukip leader said it showed that people in the North East are 'particularly tough'. During a visit to Hartlepool, he said: 'The last time I went out in Newcastle was about 18 months ago and I think it was February or March and I think it was completely astonished to see how little clothing people wear in this part of the world. 'There were girls with platform shoes like that, dresses here, blokes in T-shirts and I can only conclude that although we are all from the same country you are particularly tough up here.' Mr Farage accused the former Scottish first minister of not doing enough to counter the problem. He said: 'I think the one I blame is Alex Salmond. When I was attacked by a group of thugs in the street in Edinburgh with the most extraordinary anti-English sentiments being shouted, when Salmond was asked whether he condemned that ‎behaviour he didn't. 'I think it is ironic that all the talk about extremism within British politics is pointed towards Ukip when there are others who are far more guilty.' Asked if Nicola Sturgeon was also to blame, Mr Farage added: 'She hasn't done anything to stop it, but I haven't heard her say anything to encourage it.‎' But SNP MSP Humza Yousaf hit back at the Ukip leader's 'politics of fear and intolerance'. He said: 'These disgraceful comments - which aren't just offensive to the SNP, but to the majority of people in Scotland on current polls - show exactly why the people of Scotland reject Ukip. 'Nigel Farage's politics of fear and intolerance have been exposed in this campaign, and he has still not apologised for David Coburn MEP comparing me to a convicted terrorist merely because I am a Muslim. 'The SNP have been clear that we will be a positive voice for people across the UK - and with progressive policies such as ending austerity to invest in public services and our NHS, we can bring real change north and south of the border. 'All Ukip have to offer is nasty rhetoric.' Mr Farage said both Nicola Sturgeon and Mr Salmond had failed to act to quell resentment between the English and Scots . Mr Farage also dismissed a claim from Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna that Ukip is infected with the 'virus of racism'. He said Mr Umunna, who he labelled 'the high priest of the liberal metropolitan elite', had made the comment because Labour is 'running scared' of Ukip. Hartlepool, which has been held by Labour since it was formed in 1974, is Ukip's main target seat in the North East at the general election . In 2010, Ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and Labour's Iain Wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority. He replaced Peter Mandelson as the MP in a by-election in 2004 after the Labour grandee stood down to become a European Commissioner. Mr Farage's hopes for electoral victory in Hartlepool come after the town elected a man dressed as a monkey as its mayor in 2002. Stuart Drummond stood as 'H'Angus the Monkey', Hartlepool United FC's mascot, as a publicity stunt with the slogan, 'free bananas for schoolchildren'. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009 before voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the paid post in 2012. Hartlepool's residents are famously said to have hanged a monkey during the Napoleonic wars because they thought it was a French spy.","Ukip leader blames former Scottish First Minister for fuelling resentment .

"Marouane Fellaini did not have the best of days at Goodison Park on Sunday, but that did not stop the Manchester United midfielder sharing a glass of bubbly with his twin brother Mansour on Tuesday. The brothers were recently the subject of a mix-up involving Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho prior to the Blues' crunch clash with United at Stamford Bridge on April 18. Following his side's 1-0 victory over Louis van Gaal's side, Mourinho revealed he prepared his Chelsea players to deal with the threat of Fellaini all week – only to be told by a hotel doorman that the Belgian was not playing.

Following Manchester United's 3-0 loss against Everton, Fellaini spent Tuesday chilling out with his brother . Fellaini was substituted at half-time against the Toffees as Louis van Gaal's side struggled at Goodison Park . Mourinho planned for Kurt Zouma to man mark Fellaini - with teenager Ruben Loftus-Cheek playing the 6ft 4in midfielder in training. But he feared his tactical master plan was set to be for nothing when he was told that the United powerhouse was not playing by the doorman at the club's hotel. Mourinho, relaying his conversation with the doorman, said: 'Fellaini doesn't play because he was here to get tickets for the game from Eden Hazard. He was dressed in jeans, this and that'.

"Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao tickets are the hottest property in town. Only 500 were on general sale with the rest distributed by the fighters, promoters, television networks Showtime and HBO and the MGM Grand. One fan, Ade Adebayo, 34, from Brighton was lucky enough to get hold of a ticket when they were released last week and here he tells us his story and his hopes for the fight. I booked the trip to Las Vegas back on December 13. One of my friends, Toby, was convinced the fight was going to happen and we needed to book it before it was announced and the prices sky-rocketed. So we booked it and waited for the announcement. Christmas and New Year came and went and the fight was not announced. Then it looked like it was going to be announced during half-time of the Super Bowl. It didn't happen. Then we thought it was going to be announced during the NBA All-Star game. It wasn't. Ade Adebayo (second right) and friends at Gatwick before jetting off to Las Vegas . Ade and his friends booked their trip to Las Vegas back in December in anticipation for the big fight . The email confirmation that showed Ade had bought a ticket for the biggest fight . But eventually it was announced late one Friday in February and we could not believe it was finally going to happen. Even though we had our flights and hotel booked we were not sure if we were going to be able to get tickets as we thought that hardly any would be released and they would be sold to the big companies for the most amount of money. We thought the whole thing was being orchestrated to make the most amount of money possible. But all four of us had been to Vegas before and we always said that if we were to go again then it would have to be for a big event or fight like this, so we thought it was worth going even if we didn't get a ticket. One of my friends in the group had been in Vegas for both Ricky Hatton vs Floyd Mayweather and Hatton vs Manny Pacquiao. He said it would be insane and that we had to go. Then it was announced last week that a limited number of tickets would go on sale at 8pm on Thursday night. We all agreed to try and get tickets. But my problem was I going to fit camp with my mum on Thursdays and it was the last one, and if I didn't go then she wouldn't go, and I am trying to encourage her. So we went to the gym and I was looking at the clock the whole time. We did the session and the warm-down and at 7.55pm I sprinted out of the gym and into the car and was trying to get online while in the car. We drove to my mum's house and by the time I got there it was 8.09pm and I got the laptop out and went on to the Ticketmaster website. Ade and friends are staying at The Cosmopolitan on the Vegas strip overlooking the famous fountain in front of the Bellagio hotel . I put in for four tickets. None available. I tried three. None available. Two and then one, same thing. I kept trying and trying and was changing the price bracket and number of tickets and then at 8.15pm I got through and it said on the screen that I had one ticket. I was stunned. It was $7,924.40 (£5,141.68) But I realised I was on my business partner's laptop and it did not have all my credit card details saved as mine does. So I had to sprint out of the house to my car to try and find my card and race back, by the time I got back to the laptop and put in my details there was about 45 seconds left on the countdown timer. In panic when I was filling everything in I clicked the box for insurance and ended up paying an extra $455. I'm not even sure what it is insurance for! Ade and the boys stopped off at the famous Wild Card gym in Hollywood where Pacquiao trained for the fight . Ade and his friends are planning a trip to the Hollywood hills in the days before the big fight . The group plan to head back to Vegas via Death Valley and the Nevada desert . Then it was all confirmed and I thought it was all too easy, and had I really managed to get a ticket? Or was it a scam and had I been turned over for just over £5,000? But then an email came through from Ticketmaster and I could not believe I had managed to get one. I then went on to our group WhatsApp group and just wrote 'I got a ticket' and the phone just went mad with messages asking to see a screen shot. And when I sent it everyone just went mad, no one could believe it. My business partner, Neil, has been on Twitter and he thinks he may have tracked down a ticket in the row behind me and the person may be willing to sell it, so we may possibly have two tickets. We will see. The group plan a big night out on Friday on the famous Las Vegas strip . The Wet Republic pool party at the MGM Grand is on the agenda for Saturday . We flew out from Gatwick on Wednesday and we're staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel just down the Strip from the MGM Grand. After a 'quiet' night on Wednesday, we are going on a road trip to LA and the Hollywood Hills. We are spending one night there and then coming back to Vegas on Friday via the sights of Death Valley and the Nevada desert. We'll have a big night out on Friday and then chill out on Saturday at the Wet Republic Pool Party at the MGM hosted by DJ Calvin Harris. And then it is fight night! Carl Froch beat George Groves in front of 80,000 fans at Wembely Stadium . Ade had good seats for the Froch vs Groves fight at Wembley in May last year . Mark Wright and James Argent were two of the 'celebrities' at the Froch vs Groves fight - but A-listers are expected to be in attendance at the MGM Grand on Saturday night . I have been to big events in the past, I was at Carl Froch vs George Groves at Wembley and we had good seats for that. We saw people from The Only Way Is Essex, Gordon Ramsey and Andros Townsend. But Vegas is going to be the REAL A-list. I have had some good trips in the past as well, a friend of mine is Richard Branson's PA and she invited me to his island a few years ago, so I've spent a few days chilling out there, it was insane. I never thought that holiday would be topped. Ade will be one of 16,000 fans who will pack into the MGM Garden Arena on Saturday night . Floyd Mayweather will face Manny Pacquiao in the richest fight in boxing history . But already this trip promises to be amazing, the atmosphere in Vegas will be amazing ahead of the fight, everyone will be buzzing. In terms of the fight, I would like to see Manny Pacquiao win. He has not got anything to lose. Mayweather is flash and that is liked in America, but around the world the whole money thing is not liked as much. Either way I hope it is a great fight and a great occasion.","Floyd Mayweather will fight Manny Pacquiao on May 2 at MGM Grand .

'Many people quite rightly say Messi and you cant dispute that opinion,' he told the 1991 World Snooker Champion. 'Ronaldo could play for Millwall, QPR, Doncaster Rovers, anyone, and score a hat-trick. I'm not sure Messi could do that. 'Ronaldo's got two feet, he's quick, great in the air and brave.

The primary aim of this appearance was to get much-needed minutes under his belt but his two goals had the added effect of sending United four points clear at the top of the Under-21 Premier League table. Van Persie was undoubtedly the star attraction, but the team fielded by Warren Joyce also included Adnan Januzaj, Tyler Blackett, Anders Lindegaard and Andreas Pereira. And it didn’t take long for the visitors to assert their authority against a Fulham side threatened by relegation from the top tier at this level. On 13 minutes, Van Persie controlled a Pereira through ball just inside the 18-yard box and slotted past Fulham goalkeeper Magnus Norman to open the scoring. It was two shortly afterwards when Januzaj found Joe Rothwell in behind the Fulham defence with a lovely through ball and United’s No 7 was left with an easy finish.

Van Persie could have claimed his second five minutes later when he stretched to reach Januzaj’s cross and saw his effort come back off the post. The contest was over two minutes before the break when Januzaj advanced down the right and cut the ball back for Rothwell to place the ball into the bottom corner. The Dutchman saw an effort deflect off Fulham captain Jonathan Buatu and against the crossbar in the second-half but he wouldn’t be denied another goal. 10 minutes from time, he was found behind Fulham’s back line again and added his second of the night with a dinked finish over Norman. It proved to be Van Persie’s last act as he was replaced by James Weir before the restart. Fulham did claim a consolation in stoppage time when Stephen Humphreys headed home Luca de la Torre’s cross.

"Following all his inspired charity work, Didier Drogba has been awarded with a Barclays Spirit of the Game trophy. The Chelsea forward set up the 'Didier Drogba Foundation in Africa,' as he hopes to inspire the next generation of footballers in Africa to fall in love with the game. The 37-year-old, who scored against Leicester on Wednesday, spoke in the video about his experiences growing up in the Ivory Coast and his love for football. Didier Drogba with the Barclays Spirit of the Game award following all the charity work he's done in Africa . The Ivorian scored the equaliser for Chelsea against Leicester on Wednesday, his seventh of the season . He said 'I come from a poor family where I played football in the streets with my friends with no shoes, there was no grass but we still enjoyed it. 'There is nothing better than when you see a kid with a smile on his face and that is why I'm trying to help. I want to do a lot of things in Africa, I want to give people the chance to dream, and it is easier to dream when you are in good health and happy.' Zebeto is one of the children inspired by Drogba and he hopes to follow in his heroes footsteps . Drogba loves to make the children of his home country happy and visits the foundation regularly . In the latest Barclays video they spoke  a young boy growing up in the Ivory Coast called Zebeto, who has been inspired by Drogba and dreams about following his hero. The 'Didier Drogba Foundation,' contribute financial and material support in education and health including school bags for the school children, as well as a medical clinic in his hometown of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, which will be opening its doors later this year. Chelsea's stars such as Eden Hazard, Petr Cech and Branislav Ivanovic were out in force earlier this month as they raises £400,000 for the foundation at a charity ball. The money raised will be used to complete the medical clinic in Abidjan and help finance mobile clinics that will travel outside of the capital to those who are either to sick or poor to make the journey to the medical centre.","Didier Drogba given the Barclays Spirit of the Game award .

"'Boring' has been the word on everyone's lips when talking about Chelsea this week, but Didier Drogba has shown he and his team-mates still have the skill to disprove that disparaging tag. The Blues are preparing for Wednesday night's trip to Leicester City at St George's Park, having drawn criticism for the way they ground out a decisive 0-0 draw against Arsenal on Sunday. And Drogba and his team-mates, who can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more victories, have shown off their abilities with an intricate six-man heading trick around the dinner table. Didier Drogba hit back at claims that Chelsea were boring with a video of them completing a 'bin challenge' After the ball is headed by Loic Remy and Eden Hazard, John Terry heads to Drogba in the six-man task . After Drogba, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is the next to take the ball, heading back to John Obi Mikel . Mikel stoops with a diving header that sees him fall off his chair, but the ball does drop into the small bin . Manager Jose Mourinho shot back at claims that his side were boring this week, insisting that going 10 years without winning the league - as Arsenal have - was more boring, and now Drogba has added to the retort with a video captioned: 'Boring boring chelseaaaa!!!!!!' With six players seated opposite each other on either side of a long table, Branislav Ivanovic throws the ball on to the head of Loic Remy to start the game. He heads back to Eden Hazard, who then directs it on to John Terry followed by Drogba and Thibaut Courtois before John Obi Mikel stoops to knock the ball into a bin with a diving header. After just about managing to complete the feat all seven players celebrate wildly, the sort of scenes that might be seen against Crystal Palace on Sunday if Chelsea win at the King Power Stadium and then on their return to Stamford Bridge. The champions-elect have been preparing for Wednesday night's game at the National Football Centre at Burton-on-Trent since Monday, where they are staying at the on-site Hilton Hotel. While French forward Remy was more than willing to jump around with his team-mates in the video at the hotel, he has been ruled out of the game against Leicester by  Mourinho. With Mikel on the floor, Courtois and Terry leap into the air in celebrations that could soon be repeated . The seven players involved in the game at St George's Park jump around in a celebratory huddle . Drogba and his team-mates can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more league victories . Diego Costa is also a doubt having missed almost a month of action with a hamstring problem that has bugged him for much of the season. Midfielder Oscar has a chance of returning from the concussion he suffered against Arsenal in a challenge by goalkeeper David Ospina on Sunday. St George's Park, which opened in October 2012, is used by the full range of England teams as well as club sides. Barcelona, Galatasaray and Monaco are among the visiting teams to have stayed there.

"The first high-resolution footage of solar flux ropes on the sun has been revealed. In the fascinating video, twisting groups of magnetic fields can be seen writhing around. And with the new images it may be possible to further understand their evolution and how they cause space weather. Research led by a scientist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology has revealed the first high-resolution footage of a solar flux 'rope' taking shape on the sun, shown in this still image . The new footage was revealed in a paper in Nature Communications led by Dr Haimin Wang from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. A solar flare accompanies the twisting flux rope in the footage, which moves around a common axis before bursting from the sun. They are essentially twisted bundles of magnetic field that extend out of and back into the surface across hundreds of kilometres. As common structures in the solar corona, they are thought to be the main cause of several types of solar weather - including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The formation of a flux rope can take weeks, but the  moment when it is flung into the atmosphere can take just a matter of hours. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth's magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. In the video, twisting groups of magnetic fields writhe around a central axis, and the rope ultimately causes a bright flash - a solar flare - to form, shown here . Dr Wang and his colleagues made the findings using the 5.2ft (1.6 metres) New Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory in California. They describe an S-shaped bundle of magnetic fields, from which a set of loops peel off and grow upward into a multi-stranded flux rope in just two minutes. Two flare ribbons also appear at the point where the rope joins the solar atmosphere. It is hoped the study, which shows a flux rope in unprecedented detail, could help increase understanding on how they form - and how they are related to solar eruptions. ‘In the large scale, magnetic flux ropes are found in the interplanetary magnetic clouds, which may interact with Earth’s magnetic field to generate geomagnetic storms,’ the researchers wrote in their paper. Solar flux ropes are common structures in the solar corona, and they are thought to be the main cause of several types of solar weather – including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), pictured .","New Jersey Institute of Technology research reveals stunning video .

"A rookie playing  for the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field for the first time won't remember his home ballpark debut because of the single he hit or the run he scored. Addison Russell, 21, may recall his first game at Wrigley Field with a sense of horror because he let his bat slip through his fingers in the seventh while he was trying to catch up to a fastball. The bat went flying and struck a fan sitting several rows behind the Cubs' on-deck circle in the face. Scroll down for video... Addison Russell was batting for the Chicago Cubs in the seventh inning during his first game at Wrigley Field . Russell, a rookie, swung at a first-pitch fastball and accidentally let the bat slip out of his fingers . The bat went flying and it ended up striking a fan who was sitting several rows behind the Cubs' on-deck circle . Cubs officials rushed to assist the spectator and towels from the home team's dugout were brought to the injured fan. Russell, who was ranked the No. 5 prospect in baseball earlier this month, said the bat 'just slipped', according to MLB. He said: 'I saw it connect with his face. 'I saw the dude's glasses fly, and it just wasn't pretty. I feel really bad. 'Words can't describe how bad I feel.' The rookie, 21, went 1-for-3 on Monday night and is batting .160 in six big league games for the Cubs . Russell, who was ranked the No. 5 prospect in baseball earlier in April, said the bat 'just slipped' from his hand . The fan suffered 'wounds' but was conscious and communicative after being hit, the Chicago Tribune reported. The Cubs said the patient was transported to first aid, then transferred to an ambulance and taken to a nearby hospital. The club thanked everyone who shared their concern while updating the patient's status. If the fan feels comfortable around bats again after he's out of the hospital, Russell has one for him. He said: 'I found the bat in my locker, so if you see that guy out there, I'm willing to give him a bat and sign it. 'I feel terribly bad about it.'

"Daniel Sturridge is well-known for showing off his dance moves, but the striker's shapes were no match for a young Liverpool fan. The Reds frontman was challenged to a dance-off by Kop Kids presenter Paisley back in February and duly obliged only to be left red-faced by the talented youngster. Before the pair showed each other their moves, Paisley sat down with the former Chelsea man to ask him how important dancing and music is in his lift.

'Dancing is more from my childhood,' said Sturridge. 'I always used to dance. Where I grew up was a Caribbean area, so dancing was a huge part of my upbringing and music was exactly the same. 'I listen to music before every game but it's the dependent on the mood I'm in and what kind of vibe i want to get into. The 25-year-old then revealed that he wasn't a fan of pop group One Direction despite posting a picture of himself with band member Louis Tomlinson in March. He added: 'I'm not a 1D kind of guy.

"Manny Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum has revealed that the contracts for his fight against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas in just 10 days have yet to be signed. With the pair finalising their preparations for the fight at the MGM Grand on May 2, Top Rank promoter Arum told ESPN that the contracts have still not been finalised. Tickets for the bout have also yet to go on sale and Arum claimed that the draft contract he received on April 15 was not what he agreed with Mayweather Promotions and MGM when the term sheet was signed a few months ago. Bob Arum has revealed that the contracts for the mega fight next weekend have yet to be signed . Top Rank boss Arum is promoter for Manny Pacquiao and he said the contract hasn't yet been signed . 'We agreed that we would all be signatories on the final contract and then they sent us a draft of the agreement and it excluded us,' Arum said. Not being a signatory would mean that Top Rank wouldn't have control of decisions such as video content and music during the fight. 'They don't want us to have any say,' Arum added. 'That's what we're enmeshed in.' Pacquiao in training for the fight in Los Angeles on Tuesday on his morning run and workout . The Filipino's promoter says that the draft contract he received is different to the terms that were agreed . Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe said that Arum 'isn't willing to live with the agreement' But Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, disagreed with Arum. He said: 'The bottom line is that Bob isn't willing to live with the agreement signed a couple months ago, which doesn't allow him to be in control. 'The only conspiracy, in my opinion, exists with him trying to conspire with his lawyers to change the terms of the agreement.

"When Floyd Mayweather posted a picture of a signed contract for his $300 million mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao two months ago, there was a collective sigh of relief. After more than five years of wrangling and bickering, the richest fight in boxing history was finally set for May 2 in Las Vegas. But with 11 days to go until the two protagonists are due to touch gloves, not a single person has a ticket in their hands. Floyd Mayweather fights Manny Pacquiao next weekend but officially, no tickets are on sale . That's not to say that nobody has bought one; SeatGeek, which claims to be the world's largest event ticket search engine, is selling briefs for up to $30,000 (£20,000). These are known as 'spec tickets' which the sellers don't have but expect to get before the fight. The venue for the bout, the 16,500-capacity MGM Grand Arena has the following message on its website: . 'Details on ticket sales coming soon! Please be aware that tickets for the May 2, 2015, Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight are not yet available for purchase. 'Buyers should use extra caution when purchasing alleged tickets from unofficial sources, for fraudulent or counterfeit tickets will not be accepted.' So why the delay? Initially, Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum said tickets would be on sale in the first week of April but that less than 1,000 - priced between $1,500 and $7,500 - were expected to be made available to the public. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum (left) has blamed Mayweather's side for the lack of tickets . Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, claimed they would be on sale last week . The rest would be distributed by the fighters, promoters, television networks Showtime and HBO and the MGM Grand. But last week, SeatGeek analyst Connor Gregoire said: 'It's bizarre, normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight. To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.' Gregoire went on to say that only a dozen tickets had been sold through the website at an average price of $8,000 (£5,400). Another ticketing site, StubHub, are yet to put any tickets on sale. Spokesperson Alison Salcedo said: 'There's still so much up in the air for this fight that we're not allowing spec sales. We're not willing to take that risk now.' As far as Arum is concerned, the blame lies squarely on Mayweather's side. 'All of this is on the MGM (Grand), I mean, if you think that the MGM is calling the shots here, you're totally mistaken. It's the man behind the curtain,' he told Boxing Scene, alluding to Mayweather's adviser Al Haymon. Mayweather trains with his uncle Roger during a media workout in Las Vegas last week . Pacquiao is taken on the pads by trainer Freddie Roach in front of the watching media . 'This is going to the governor's office. This is an absolute disgrace, what's happening. 'What do you want from me? It's not on us.' Pacquiao's manager Michael Koncz has also expressed his frustration. He said: 'It's a real mess right now. I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the holdup? I'm more than a little upset they're not for sale to the public.' In the opposite corner, Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe has claimed Arum was lashing out because he is not the lead promoter in the fight. 'Every time he doesn't get his way, he goes running to the press misrepresenting the facts,' he said. 'The bottom line is this: Bob cannot stomach the fact that he is not the lead promoter. Reality has set in, and this is typical Bob. My responsibility is to ensure every deal is done properly, to benefit the fighters and the event.' It remains to be seen who will make up the 16,500-capacity crowd at the MGM Grand . Ellerbe did say that tickets would be on sale last week but there is no sign of an end to the stalemate. Nor is there any indication of when the reported 50,000 closed-circuit seats at MGM properties - priced at around $150 (£100) - in Las Vegas will be available to purchase. The hotel's website says simply: 'Please check back for closed-circuit viewing availability at other MGM Resorts Properties.' In fact, the only ticket you can buy is for the weigh-in. Priced at $10, the unusual step has been taken in an effort to control the expected huge crowd but all proceeds will go to charity with each fighter nominating their choice. With UFC star Ronda Rousey guaranteed the only free ticket from Arum and Amir Khan set to be ringside next Saturday as he eyes a future fight against either man, there will at least be a crowd of sorts. But who will join them is anyone's guess.","Floyd Mayweather takes on Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2 .

"Audi has created a so-called 'green' diesel fuel made using a combination of water and carbon dioxide. The car manufacturer described its breakthrough as the 'fuel of the future' and claims it could provide a carbon neutral way of powering vehicles. Experts used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel. Scroll down for video . Audi claims to have created the fuel of the future - diesel (shown above) made from water and carbon dioxide. Experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel . Tests have shown it can be mixed with diesel from fossil fuels, or used as a fuel in its own right. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. Reiner Mangold, head of sustainable product development at Audi, said: 'In developing Audi e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long‑distance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate. Audi's fuel was developed with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800°C (1,472°F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature. The hydrogen is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures. This causes them to react to produce long-chained liquid hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels, but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as 'blue crude'. Audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70%. The blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel. 'Using carbon dioxide as a raw material represents an opportunity not just for the automotive industry in Germany, but also to transfer the principle to other sectors and countries.' The new fuel was developed by Audi along with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam, which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800°C (1,472°F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature. The hydrogen  is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures. This causes them to react to produce long-chained liquid hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as 'blue crude'. Audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70 per cent. The blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel. Water is heated to form steam, which is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen using  electrolysis. Hydrogen is  pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures and causes them to react to produce liquid hydrocarbons, known as 'blue crude'. Hydrocarbons form the base of fossil fuels . Audi added that the synthetic fuel does not contain sulphur or hydrocarbon rings – known as aromatic hydrocarbons – which are found in crude oil and can create additional pollution. A breakthrough was recently made in the development of clean hydrogen power. Currently, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University have designed a molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. The approach increases the efficiency of electrolysis of water into its constituent parts by reducing the amount of energy needed to perform the  oxidation half of the reaction. Christian von Olshausen, chief technology officer at Sunfire, said the fuel was highly combustible and produced less pollution than traditional diesel. He said: 'The engine runs quieter and fewer pollutants are being created.' A special processing plant has been built in Dresden Reick and is set to produce 3,000 litres of e-diesel in the coming months. The carbon dioxide is currently supplied by a biogas facility as a byproduct. Audi said it also extracts carbon dioxide from the ambient air using 'direct air capturing'. Burning of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions by humans into the atmosphere and is driving global warming. By capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air, Audi says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere. The project is the latest attempt by Audi to produce more environmentally friendly fuels for its vehicles. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. The minister is pictured testing the new fuel in her official car . In 2009 it announced a project to produce e-gas - a form of synthetic methane – for use in its g-tron gas powered vehicles. At the launch of the new e-diesel, Dr Wanka put five litres of the fuel into her official Audi A8. She said: 'This synthetic diesel, made using carbon dioxide, is a huge success for our sustainability research. 'If we can make widespread use of carbon dioxide as a raw material, we will make a crucial contribution to climate protection and the efficient use of resources, and put the fundamentals of the ""green economy"" in place.'","German car manufacturer used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into 'blue crude' oil which was then refined into diesel .

"Goggles that could help the blind see have come a step closer to reality. The technology is based on a technique known as 'neuromodulation' in which electricity from a chip stimulates the nervous system to restore sight. The revolutionary system is being commercialised by French company Pixium Vision, with clinical trials scheduled for 2016. Scroll down for video . Goggles that could help the blind see have come a step closer to reality. The technology is based on a technique known as 'neuromodulation' in which electricity stimulates the nervous system to restore sight. A surgeon first implants a small silicon chip with 150 electrodes on the retina. When the patient puts on the system's dark glasses, an integrated video camera sends images to a portable computer. A connected 'pocket processor' converts that recording into an infrared image, which the goggles will then beam into the eye. Pulses activate electrodes in the implant, and the optic nerve carries images to the brain. Retinal implants that restore some sight when in the blind are already available, but their quality isn't good enough to work in many real-world conditions. Pixium Vision's solution, however, claims it has been able to restore the sight of rats to a level equivalent to 20/250. This would allow the wearer to see the largest line of letters in an opticians test. The company claims it may be able to get its final product to restore vision to 20/120, which would be a huge leap forward in vision quality. Second Sight, the company that got FDA approval for the first visual prosthesis two years ago, currently offers patients about 20/1300 vision.

A connected 'pocket processor' converts that recording into an infrared image, which the goggles will then beam into the eye. Pulses activate the electrodes in the implant, and the optic nerve carries the images back to the brain. Following surgery, patients have to train their brains to interpret the new images, which are seen in variations of back, white and grey. A small pilot program to test the system is already underway, with promising results. 'We don't give them back their sight, but another way of seeing,' Yannick Le Mer, the surgeon who implanted the system in three of Pixium's test subjects told Forbes. A new trial of the system is due to begin next year by Australia’s Bionic Vision. The cost for the system is expected to be around 100,000 euros (£72,000 or $111,200), plus surgery.

The designer told DMA that she was unaware of court proceedings, and only became aware of it when contacted by the media yesterday. The sister of Real Housewives Of Melbourne's Gina last year relaunched her eponymous jeans label  last year as By Bettina Liano, after going into liquidation in 2013. Empire: The jeans designer relaunched her label last year as By Bettina Liano after going into liquidation in 2013 . Liano's denim empire started in 1986 in Melbourne, but ran into difficulty in recent years. After going into administration in 2011, the brand was revived by backing from the Apparel Group, who own Sportscraft and Saba, but the deal ended acrimoniously, with Liano ordered to pay back $150,000. 'I lost my entire business,' Liano told DMA. 'A lot went down... it was disastrous.' 'I just want to make jeans. I'm starting out again with my new label, but it's going to take time to recover.' Bettina revealed that she is also in the process of writing a 'motivational' book charting her career.

"Many of us may not have the billionaire lifestyle or scientific prowess of Marvel's Tony Stark, but we can now at least get his trademark hi-tech gloves at home. Laser expert Patrick Priebe  created a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm. And in a video, the contraption is shown popping balloons and lighting matches from feet away. Scroll down for video . Laser expert Patrick Priebe  built a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm (pictured lighting a match) The gadget was created by Wuppertal-based Mr Priebe, who designs and builds metal laser gadgets to order online. He posts videos to YouTube as AnselmoFanZero. His Laser Gloves and Laser Gauntlet/Arm are  available to order in varying wavelengths. Earlier this year, Mr Priebe built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said, although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside . A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall. Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. These range from the blue 405nm-type laser model to one fitted with 445nm, or 650nm. He also offers a 'low power green' version on his website. The gadgets are powered by Lithium-ion cells and output ranges between 0.2W and 1.2W. Prices are not known. The Laser Glove can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and can be made for either the left or right hand, or both. He has previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and  a built-in laser pointer. The rechargeable watch has an LED watch module and 1,500-milliwatt laser. Earlier this year, the same German inventor built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said that although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside. A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall. The gadget (pictured) is powered by Lithium-ion cells and output ranges between 0.2W and 1.2W. Prices are not known. The Laser Glove can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and it can be made for either the left or right hand, or both . The glove was inspired by Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jnr (pictured) Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. The inventor is obviously fearful his designs will fall into the wrong hands, too, as he states on his website: 'No plans, no schematics, no blueprints'. The laser weapon is a taken on the iconic Gatling gun invented by Richard Gatling in the 1860s. Mr Priebe  previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and built-in laser pointer (shown) Mr Priebe admitted  the watch was a ‘pain in the a’ to make because of all the tiny parts, and the total watch took him around 40 hours to complete. The watch is pictured popping balloons on a wall . The laser watch was inspired by 1964 Bond film Goldfinger. In this scene, Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Fröbe) ties James Bond (Sean Connery) to a table and threatens to cut him using the laser pointer (pictured) In a video for Reactions, the American Chemical Society took a look at the science of Marvel's Avengers. Tony Stark's original suit, made only of iron, would have weighed around 70kg (150lbs) according to the ACS - not very comfortable or easy to move around in. He later upgrades it to a gold-titanium alloy, but that would actually make things worse explained the video. ‘That suit would probably weigh around 160kg (350lbs), which might work for the Hulk but not for Tony Stark,’ said the narrator. However, Dr Raychelle Burks continued that it is later made of a nickel-titanium alloy called nitinol. The American Chemical Society in Washington recently explained the science behind the Avengers in a video. It looked at the composition of Iron Man's suit - said to be a gold-titanium alloy in one of the movies - and Captain America's shield. The video also explained the science behind super-healing abilities . This is ‘strong but light, and can be reformed after taking damage,’ she said. ‘There may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre, which can take a lot of heat - useful if Iron Man doesn’t want to singe his feet using those rocket boots.’ None of this would work, though, without Stark’s own portable nuclear power station - the Arc Reactor. In Iron Man 2 this uses palladium - but we soon learn this is poisoning and killing the character. So instead, he creates a new element - and Dr Burks said this might not be as far-fetched as it seems. He uses his own particle accelerator to smash the nuclei of atoms together and make a new type of atom, which is not entirely dissimilar to the experiments taking place at real-life accelerators such as Cern.","Iron Man-style arm and hand was built by laser expert Patrick Priebe .

"Technology shows such as the annual E3 games conference in Los Angeles have become known for their scantily clad 'booth babes' designed to attract people to stands. However, a Dutch firm has taken a slightly different approach for its London event. TransIP hired a pair of pole dancing robots for an event in Shoreditch. Scroll down for video . The robots were originally created by Walker for a show called 'Peepshow'.

The robots were originally created in 2012 by Walker for a show called 'Peepshow'. 'We are now all living in a peepshow. 'Continually being watched by mechanical peeping toms on every street corner,' he said. 'With this in mind, I wondered if it was possible to literally make a CCTV camera sexy using simple mechanics...and by using the imagery of a pole dancer question the roles played in voyeurism. The robots will be pole dancing for the remaining four days of the event, along with presentations from leading figures in the technology industry. 'Could this pile of old windscreen wipers and odd pieces of metal become something sexual....

"After experiencing major devastation and loss of life in the April 25 earthquake, Nepal was left with an unsavoury taste in its mouth after receiving packets of ‘beef masala’ as part of the relief package from Pakistan. Since the majority-Hindu country treats cows as sacred and there is a blanket ban on slaughtering the animal, the development has the potential to trigger diplomatic acrimony between the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) member countries. Indian doctors at Kathmandu’s Bir Hospital told Mail Today that packets of ‘beef masala’ were sent by Pakistan on Tuesday as part of relief aid to the temblor survivors. These doctors – drawn from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) — are members of a 34-member medical team sent to Nepal for treating the survivors. “When we reached the airport to collect the food items from Pakistan, we found packets of ready-to-eat meals, including packets of ‘beef masala’. There were other food items too,” Dr Balwinder Singh told Mail Today. Perplexed, the doctors chose to have food from a hotel instead. “We did not touch the Pakistani aid,” Dr Singh said. “Most of the local people are not aware of the contents. When they understand, they avoid it,” said another doctor on the condition of anonymity. He added: “Pakistan has hurt Nepal’s religious sentiments by supplying the masala. Shockingly, it did not care about the sensitivity of the matter.” Pakistani soldiers load relief supplies for Nepal . Exclusive photographs of the ‘beef masala’ packets supplied to Nepal are with Mail Today. These pictures clearly show that the place of origin of these packets was Nowshera Cantt in Pakistan. These packets also prominently mention that these are not for sale and the contents include ‘potato bhujia’ and ‘beef masala’. A top Nepal government official said: “The matter has been conveyed to Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and the intelligence chief. We are also starting an internal inquiry to verify the facts. If the report is correct, we will raise the matter at the diplomatic level with Pakistan. India, being our key partner, will also be informed of the developments.” Tasneem Aslam, spokesperson for Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs, told Mail Today: “I am not aware of the issue…I am not responsible for the dispatch. The relief aid is sent by the National Disaster Management Authority.” Nepalese soldiers stand next to wrecked buildings at Durbar Square . A press note uploaded on the website of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Pakistan (http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/), states: “(The) National Disaster Management Authority has dispatched the second of two sorties of C-130 aircrafts on April 28 in collaboration with Pakistan Army, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Pakistan Air Force. The relief goods include 250 tents, 200 food packs (2.6 tonne), 1,000 Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), 1,000 blankets and 33 cartons of medicines. These relief goods have been provided from NDMA stocks….” Despite repeated attempts, the officials of the Pakistan NDMA could not be contacted. The food items have been manufactured by PANA Force Foods. The consignment was supplied after receiving orders from Pakistan’s NDMA. “PANA Force food processing centre aims at providing quality goods at affordable prices. Currently, the company is supplying two brands of products to Pakistan Army commonly known as Meal Ready to Eat (MRE) and Emergency Pack Ration (EP Ration or high-energy biscuits) whereas a plant for the production of dehydrated vegetables and fruits is under construction,” the official website of PANA Force Foods mentions. The website also states that the processing centre provides food to civil population during natural calamities, like earthquakes and floods. According to Hindu belief, eating beef is a religious offence since the cow is a sacred animal and treated on a par with one’s mother. In Nepal — for long the world’s only Hindu state — the first royal order officially prohibiting cow slaughter stated that the punishments for the crime were death and confiscation of all property of the offender. The first Civil Code of Nepal, the Muluki Ain of 1854, stated: “This kingdom is the only kingdom in the world where cows, women, and Brahmins may not be killed.” It trumpeted Nepal as the ‘purest Hindu kingdom’ and simultaneously signaled to Nepalese citizens that Hindu religious creeds would be the law of the land. But an amendment in 1990 to the Civil Code made cow slaughter punishable by 12 years in prison. Delhi High Court raises alarm over illegal buildings . By Mail Today in New Delhi . Municipal authorities in Delhi received a rap from the Delhi High Court on Wednesday over the numerous illegal buildings across the city. Days after the killer earthquake in Nepal, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday said unauthorised constructions and colonies in the city are disasters waiting to happen. A bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva observed that if an earthquake hits Delhi like the one in Nepal, all the unauthorised buildings constructed without following regulations, will crumble. It also said each government has been extending the date till which illegal constructions are protected from punitive action as it is looking for votes. “If people die, then who will vote?” the court asked. “They are disasters waiting to happen. Are you (municipal corporations) taking strict action? Are you coming out with an action plan?” the bench questioned while hearing a batch of petitions on unauthorised constructions in the city. In response, the civic agency said it was coming out with an action plan. The court, thereafter, said it will take up the matter of seismic viability of structures in the national Capital in some other appropriate matter. UK aid team in security breach at Delhi airport . By Ankur Sharma in New Delhi . It has come to light that a rescue team which arrived from the United Kingdom on Monday for operations in earthquake-hit Nepal, violated the safety norms of the Delhi IGI Airport. The team allegedly waited in front of an aircraft at the ‘apron area’ of the airport for about six hours before they could fly to Kathmandu. According to the members of the British rescue team, after waiting for all those hours, they were accommodated in a flight of the Spanish Air Force. Members of the British rescue team headed to Nepal posted photos of themselves waiting at IGI Airport on Twitter . According to a senior civil aviation official, it was a case of gross violation of safety rules. The DGCA can take action against the agencies that were responsible for the violation. “DGCA had earlier punished various airlines for committing such a violation. This particular British team had dogs with them and they were in front of the aircraft for six hours. It’s scary,” a senior DGCA official said after seeing the photographs of the group that were posted by a rescue team member on Twitter. An immigration official said the British group comprised 15-20 personnel from the UK Fire and Rescue team. They reached Delhi IGI Airport around 5.30pm on Monday. But due to weather and other clearance issues, they were asked to wait at the airport. “The team didn’t have proper clearances. India keeps a watch on every unit and aircraft flying to Kathmandu through Delhi. Airport officials asked them to wait but instead of going to the terminal building, these rescue team members waited in front of the nosewheel of an aircraft,” a senior airport official told Mail Today. Later, when the Indian agencies told them that the weather in Kathmandu was not favourable and it was packed with aircraft, the British rescue team members arranged their materials on their own, the official said. After almost an hour they managed to convince the Spanish Air Force officials, who agreed to fly these British rescue team members to Kathmandu. “Even then, the rescue team members didn’t go inside the airport. No security official asked them to move from there. They remained there for more than three hours,” a senior immigration official said. “They had equipment which needed to be checked by various agencies. Also, they didn’t take proper permission due to which they were asked to wait. But, they ignored all security rules and stayed there in front of an aircraft,” a senior airport official said. According to a senior official of the ministry of civil aviation: “No one is allowed to wait in front of an aircraft. Even the passengers are not allowed to put their baggage near to the plane.” The team reportedly left Delhi around 12 midnight and reached Kathmandu around 2am.","Cows are treated as sacred in Nepal, where the majority are Hindus .
