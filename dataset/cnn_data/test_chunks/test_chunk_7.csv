"Four years after becoming the youngest first-class cricketer in county history, Yorkshire's Barney Gibson has retired from the sport. The Leeds-born wicketkeeper entered the record books in 2011 when he lined up against Durham University just 27 days after his 15th birthday. But that match proved to be his only appearance at senior level and he never again progressed from the second XI. Ben Gibson, pictured at the age of 15, has decided to retire from cricket just four years after his debut . The 19-year-old said it was a 'difficult decision' to retire from cricket at such a young age . In his last game for the second string he did not bat or keep wicket, instead sending down 3.3 overs for 29 runs. 'This was a difficult decision to make,' the 19-year-old said. 'I would like to thank the players and staff at Yorkshire for their support. I have been involved with the club since I was 11 and I feel that now is the right time for me to look at a career change. 'The support from my parents has been tremendous and I would like to thank Ralph Middlebrook at Pudsey Congs Cricket Club and England coach Paul Farbrace, who I had close working relationships with.' Yorkshire's director of cricket development Ian Dews, said: 'Everyone at the club wishes Barney well. 'It is very much his decision. We hope that the next chapter in his life is very successful.'","Barney Gibson became the youngest first-class cricketer in 2011 .

"The world endurance championship, whose annual highlight is the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar classic, is getting rid of the grid girls. In a move that will be applauded by many, and is sure to dismay those accustomed to seeing scantily-clad beauties posing next to cars before a race, the FIA-backed series is adopting a more progressive stance. 'From Silverstone next week, you will see that for any race we will do - no grid girls like in the past,' WEC chief executive Gerard Neveu said after a presentation on Thursday for the opening Silverstone six-hour race. The world endurance championship have announced that there will be no more 'grid girls' before races . The decision by the FIA is seen as a progressive one by those in a male-dominated sport . 'For me that is the past. The condition of women is a little bit different now,' he said. The use of models, also referred to as 'race queens' or 'umbrella girls', to stand by cars with flags or placards displaying drivers' numbers has long been a feature of Formula One. It has also been a bone of contention for those seeking more equality and less sexism in a male-dominated sport, although in some series where women racers have joined the grid the 'umbrella' role has been taken by a man. The Hawiian Tropic Girls arrive on the grid before the start of the Le Mans 24 Hour Race in 2001 . Toyota's world champion Anthony Davidson said it was about time things changed. 'I talk about this with my wife quite a lot, and we both agree it's actually pretty backward,' the Briton, who has also raced in Formula One, said. 'It's old school to have such a concept as grid girls. Surely the world's moved on? And motor racing should follow quite closely what the rest of the world's doing in that respect. 'I think that's a really nice touch, a modern touch as well, from the WEC to take that aspect of racing away. It is a bit sexist.' Neveu said the cars would line up diagonally opposite the pit wall and grandstand as if for an old-style 'Le Mans start'. Current world champion Anthony Davidson has backed the decision to remove grid girls for equality . In Le Mans of old, before safety concerns stopped the practice, drivers would run across the track to the cars but at Silverstone there will be a rolling start. Neveu said the changes were all part of catering for a new audience. 'The sport is sport, but around it we can do many things,' he said. 'We will have a DJ, entertainment, many things on the grid. The show will start from the grid... but the star at the end is the sportscars and the drivers of the car.'","World endurance championship begins at Silverstone on April 12 .

"The renowned sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters claims he did little more than give Jonathan Trott the tools to rebuild his England career. Warwickshire batsman Trott touched down in the West Indies with England on Thursday night, back in the international set-up for the first time since leaving last winter's Ashes tour with a stress-related illness. Trott has spoken openly of his struggles since, but has slowly rehabilitated his career with both Warwickshire and the England Lions and is now on the brink of returning to Tests. Jonathan Trott returns to the England set-up for the first time since taking a break with a stress-related illness . The 33-year-old has worked extensively with Dr Peters during the last year, learning from a man who has done notable work with the British cycling team, Liverpool FC and Ronnie O'Sullivan, and who introduced the 'Chimp Paradox' in a bid to help people better manage their own minds. But speaking in The Independent, Peters said there is no magic cure and that Trott had worked hard to counter his problems, which he described as 'situational anxiety'. He wrote: 'He ticked all the boxes. It was a foregone conclusion to me that he would make massive progress - I just hoped that he would then perform as he has been doing and justify his place. Now he has done that. Dr Steve Peters worked with the batsman and gave him the necessary tools to return to the game . 'He's an incredible cricketer. The advice I give to most of the people I work with is not to go public because obviously you're training people to do a skill. A lot of people don't understand it is a skill and therefore you might not get it right. 'People are expecting a magic-wand cure and that's not really the way it works. Jonathan decided he wanted to go public about this because he has done so well. 'It's a credit to the man. You can have periods in sport, sometimes a whole season, when things just aren't happening and you're just digging even harder to make it happen again - that's effectively what Jonathan has done. Trott has impressed since returning for Warwickshire and the England Lions, earning his return to the squad . 'From a psychological point of view, Jonathan is quite robust and certainly determined. It was just a case of giving him the tools to understand what was going on.' Peters, who helped mentor the golden generation of British cyclists and also worked with O'Sullivan for his last two world titles, can see no reason why Trott will not make a successful return to Test cricket. 'What Jonathan did was to take it very seriously, he meant business, which is a measure of the man,' he added. Peters (left) has worked with Liverpool, Ronnie O'Sullivan and the England football team in recent years . 'He was very open, hard-working, and what I effectively told him to do was to get some insights into the way his mind was working. Then it was up to him to operate [his mind] in the way he wanted it to, rather than it dictating to him what was going happen. 'I don't have a recipe for people. It's up to the player himself to manage the mind in the way they want to in the future. That's something anyone can do, it's not something you only do when you're distressed. Jonathan had what became a situational anxiety, and once that was understood, he was able to manage it. 'My feeling is that he'll do very well and he won't have any problems now because he has that insight.' Trott reacts while bowling during a friendly match at Edgbaston, Birmingham during his comeback .","Jonathan Trott returned to England's set-up after his stress-related illness .

"John Higgins narrowly defeated Judd Trump 5-4 to move into the quarter-finals of the China Open, where he will face home favourite and defending champion Ding Junhui. The veteran Scot recovered from losing the opening frame to move 4-2 ahead, but both players were struggling for rhythm in Beijing. Trump narrowed the gap and a break of 68 helped the UK Championship finalist take the match to a decider, where Higgins prevailed, after overturning a 59-point deficit. John Higgins moved into the quarter finals of the China Open with a 5-4 victory over Judd Trump . Trump had a 59 point lead in the deciding frame before being dumped out by the veteran Scotsman . His reward will be a clash with world No 4 Ding, who dispatched two-time world champion Mark Williams 5-2. The Chinese took the initiative in the opening frame with a 68 and from then on never looked back, winning the last two frames with Williams failing to pot a single ball. World champion Mark Selby was also a 5-2 winner over David Gilbert in a low-quality clash and the world No 1 will next face Robert Milkins, who thrashed Michael White 5-1, which included four breaks over 50. Masters champion Shaun Murphy was in fine form against Jamie Jones, whose late rally counted for nothing in a 5-3 defeat. Higgins will face defending champion and local favourite Ding Junhui in the last eight in Beijing . World No 1 Mark Selby moved into the quarter finals with a routine win over David Gilbert . After losing the opening frame, Murphy bounced backs and breaks of 67, 143 and 80 helped him move 4-1 ahead, and although Jones came within one frame of levelling, the world number eight prevailed. Murphy will play Kurt Maflin in the last eight after the English-Norwegian player cruised to a 5-1 victory over Robin Hull. Breaks of 76, 87, 51 and 79 helped Barry Hawkins to a 5-3 triumph over Stephen Maguire and a clash with Gary Wilson, a convincing 5-1 winner over Dechawat Poomjaeng.","John Higgins defeated Judd Trump 5-4 at the China Open in Beijing .

Here is all the information you need for West Brom's home clash with QPR... West Bromwich Albion vs Queens Park Rangers (The Hawthorns) Team news . West Brom . West Brom's Craig Dawson is suspended for the visit of QPR after he was awarded the red card wrongly given to Gareth McAuley against Manchester City. Defender McAuley was dismissed by referee Neil Swarbrick for a foul on Wilfried Bony which Dawson committed and the red card was switched to Dawson after a review. Craig Dawson (right) will serve a suspension for his challenge on Wilfried Bony following retrospective action . Ben Foster has been ruled out for six months with damaged crucial knee ligaments which the England keeper suffered in the Baggies' last home game against Stoke while Callum McManaman is also out with a foot injury. Provisional squad: Myhill, Rose, Gamboa, Pocognoli, Wisdom, Lescott, Olsson, McAuley, Baird, Brunt, Morrison, Fletcher, Yacob, Gardner, Mulumbu, Sessegnon, Berahino, Anichebe, Ideye. QPR . QPR manager Chris Ramsey has no fresh injury concerns for Saturday's visit to fellow Barclays Premier League strugglers West Brom. On-loan striker Mauro Zarate has returned to parent club West Ham to regain fitness while Richard Dunne and Leroy Fer are both out with knee injuries. Queens Park Rangers youngster Darnell Furlong is likely to miss out with a calf injury . Darnell Furlong is also likely to miss the game with a calf problem and Alejandro Faurlin is a long-term absentee with a cruciate ligament injury. Provisional squad: Green, Caulker, Onuoha, Yun, Wright-Phillips, Henry, Sandro, Phillips, Taarabt, Austin, Hill, McCarthy, Kranjcar, Hoilett, Vargas, Zamora, Grego-Cox. Kick-off: Saturday, 3pm .

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) West Brom have kept six clean sheets in seven games in all competitions at the Hawthorns under Tony Pulis. Queens Park Rangers have lost 17 of their last 19 Premier League away matches (W1 D1 L17). Only two teams in Premier League history have ever had fewer points away from home after 14 away matches than QPR (3) have currently (Sunderland 2 in 2007-08 and Burnley 1 in 2009-10). The Baggies have won three and lost just one of the five Premier League meetings with Rangers. QPR have conceded the first goal in 23 of their 30 Premier League games this season; more often than any other team. Charlie Austin scored a hat-trick for QPR in a 3-2 win over West Brom earlier this season at Loftus Road . Rob Green has made more errors leading to opposition goals than any other Premier League player this season (5). Joleon Lescott has given away three penalties in the Premier League this season; more than any other player. 15 of Saido Berahino’s 18 competitive goals for WBA this season have come at the Hawthorns (83 per cent).

"Jonas Gutierrez was the surprise inclusion in the Newcastle side, coming in for his first start in 20 months. The Argentine has twice beaten testicular cancer and only returned as a substitute last month. But, in fairness to the 31-year-old, he was Newcastle’s best player - not that he had much competition. Jonas Gutierrez was not expected to start after twice surviving cancer, but was the visitors' best player . Gutierrez gets up to challenge Steven Fletcher during a good performance, but one that ended in defeat . History was on Dick Advocaat’s side. The last two Sunderland managers – Paolo Di Canio and Gus Poyet – both enjoyed Tyne-Wear victories in their second match in charge and the Dutchamn kept alive that quirk of footballing fate. So whoever is the new boss at the Stadium of Light next season can only hope the Magpies are game No 2. Sunderland's new manager won a derby in his second game in charge, just like his two predecssors . Newcastle suffered an injury scare during the warm-up when emergency centre-back Daryl Janmaat limped off towards the dressing-room, although he did start the game. United, though, had no recognised defenders on the bench. However, rumours that coach Dave Watson was set to start in the middle of the backline were probably wide of the mark. Daryl Janmaat's warm-up injury led to rumours of Dave Watson filling in, but the Dutchman recovered . John Carver hardly helped in sparing Jack Colback the gauntlet of hate from the home fans. The head coach started the former Sunderland midfielder at left-back, ensuring every time he took a throw-in supporters in the front row would vacate their seat and hiss insults in his ear. At left-back on the opposite flank was Patrick van Aanholt, formerly of Newcastle. However, a barely-memorable seven appearances in the Championship meant he avoided such scorn from the Toon Army. Jack Colback was not protected from the Sunderland fans' ire, positioned by John Carver at left back . Colback was returning to face his former club after departing to join rivals Newcastle last summer . Both sets of supporters were united in the 17th minute as they applauded as one in tribute of Newcastle fans John Alder and Liam Sweeney who were killed when flight MH17 was shot down above Ukraine last summer. Sunderland fans subsequently helped to raise nearly £33,000 in their memory and rivalries were forgotten during the minute-long tribute.","Jonas Gutierrez was an unexpected inclusion, but performed well .
Dick Advocaat continued Sunderland's new managers' winning tradition .

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Leicester have won just one of their last 10 Premier League home matches (W1 D3 L6). West Ham United are unbeaten in their last seven league games against Leicester City (W4 D3 L0). The Hammers scored with their only two shots on target in their 2-0 win in the reverse fixture against the Foxes back in December. Sam Allardyce’s team have won none of their last seven Barclays Premier League away matches (W0 D4 L3). West Ham have kept just one clean sheet in their last 20 Premier League games on the road. Andy Carroll will not feature for West Ham United at Leicester City but he did score in the Hammers' 2-0 victory over the Foxes back in December . Nigel Pearson’s side have scored just three goals in their last nine Premier League games at the King Power Stadium and have gone five hours and 15 minutes since they lasted netted in front of their own fans. West Ham will be looking to win back to back Premier League games for the first time since December 7th. No ground has seen fewer Premier League goals this season than the King Power Stadium (30, level with Villa Park). After scoring five goals in his first five Premier League appearances for Leicester City, Leonardo Ulloa has scored only two in his 23 apps since.

"Kevin Pietersen has announced plans to begin his season with Surrey against Oxford MCCU in The Parks. Pietersen, hoping to press for an England recall through weight of runs in the LV= County Championship, signed a new contract with Surrey last month. The 34-year-old was given fresh hope of a return to Test cricket, after his sacking last year, when incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves hinted in a broadcast interview that it was a possibility. Kevin Pietersen posted this photo on Twitter and wrote 'Nothing good comes from walking at full pace into a tree! #faceplant' Pietersen is set to play against Oxford MCCU in The Parks as he prepares for the new season with Surrey .

"It is still Der Klassiker - but not quite as we know it. The fierce rivalry between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund has dominated German football for much of the past decade, reaching its crescendo when the two titans met in the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley. For a while, Der Klassiker represented the pinnacle of European football. Briefly, it carried as much relevance on the continental stage as El Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid - maybe even more. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Borussia Dortmund looks dejected after Robert Lewandowski of Bayern Munich scored an equaliser during Der Klassiker between the teams at the Allianz Arena in November . Arjen Robben eventually grabbed the winner five minutes from time as Bayern defeated Dortmund 2-1 . Former Dortmund striker Lewandowski (left) battles with defender Mats Hummels during the recent Bundesliga clash at the Allianz Arena . But as these two prepare to meet in front of an 80,000 audience at the Signal Iduna Park on Saturday evening, some of that lustre has been lost. There is something unsettling about Bayern and Borussia being separated by nine Bundesliga places and a whopping 31 points. It just doesn't seem right, they should be No 1 and No 2. It feels very weird that nothing is riding on the outcome, at least so far as the title race is concerned. A Bayern win will confirm what we already know, that they will be champions for a third successive season. Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben scores past Borussia Dortmund's goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller during the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley Stadium . Bayern Munich defeated Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at Wembley to win the Champions League - a period in which Der Klassiker was one of the highlights on the European football calendar . A Dortmund win would make a little dent in Bayern's 10-point lead but isn't likely to derail their serene progress to retaining the shield. It would, however, boost their hopes of qualifying for Europe. Therein lies the problem - these two have experienced contrasting seasons in the extreme, to the point where the transferable Klassiker tag could soon be applied to another fixture - perhaps Bayern vs Wolfsburg or Bayern vs Monchengladbach. Having been rock-bottom at the beginning of February, Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund embarked on a seven-match unbeaten run, winning five, and could salvage a modicum of respectability from a disastrous season - and perhaps offset a summer exodus of their best players - by finishing in the top six. Mario Gotze celebrates scoring for Borussia Dortmund with Robert Lewandowski in their 1-0 win at Bayern Munich in November 2011 - both have since joined Bayern as Dortmund have slipped down the table . For Klopp, whose reputation around Europe has taken a battering this season, insists that Der Klassiker is still as significant as ever. 'We've got to try to beat Bayern and where that can take us in the league is secondary,' he said. Gotze refuses to celebrate after scoring for Bayern Munich against Dortmund in November 2013 . 'Although we're 10th, and although there's a huge points gap between us, and although a lot is different compared to the past, it's still a Borussia Dortmund home game. 'I don't recall us gifting any of these games in the past. Gladbach have shown us how it's done. Wolfsburg have also beaten them, but it's not all that easy.' Dortmund do have positive recent memories in this fixture to draw upon. They won 3-0 at the Allianz Arena at the tail end of last season, for example, though it came far too late to alter the destination of the title, which Bayern won by 19 points. They completed the double over their rivals en route to winning their back-to-back Bundesligas in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. But those great moments seem a long time ago now and the fixture is harder to hype without so much riding on it. Another source of optimism for Klopp is Bayern's mounting injury list, with winger Franck Ribery, who has a recurring ankle problem, joining Arjen Robben and David Alaba on the sidelines. Not that club chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was panicking: 'We cannot change it and it would be a mistake if Bayern started to lament now.' Quite understandable. Another thrilling climax to the season awaits for Pep Guardiola and his team - they are coasting to a 25th championship, travel to Bayer Leverkusen in the last eight of the DFB-Pokal and Porto in the same stage of the Champions League. Another Treble looms for this all-conquering side. And, for a change, Dortmund are in no position to affect that.","Borussia Dortmund host Bayern Munich on Saturday at Signal Iduna Park .

"Lyon moved back to the top of Ligue 1 for 24 hours at least after claiming a comfortable 3-1 victory at Guingamp. Nabil Fekir's goal and Alexandre Lacazette's penalty in the first half put Les Gones in control and Guingamp's hopes of a comeback took a blow when Christophe Kerbrat was given his marching orders before half-time. Clinton N'Jie struck just after the hour to put Hubert Fournier's side three goals to the good, meaning Claudio Beauvue's effort 10 minutes from time was only a consolation. Alexandre Lacazette celebrates after scoring a penalty for Lyon to send them top of Ligue 1 on Saturday . It was Lyon's first win in three and moved them back above Paris St Germain, who play third-placed Marseille in a much-anticipated encounter on Sunday evening. Two quick-fire second-half penalties saw Montpellier come from behind to beat Bastia 3-1 and move six points off the European places. Lucas Barrios and Anthony Mounier both struck from the spot within two minutes to cancel out Giovanni Sio's opener - with Morgan Sanson adding a third for the hosts in stoppage time. It was Lyon's first win in three and moved them back above Paris St Germain who play on Sunday . Lille got back to winning ways in emphatic fashion with a 3-1 triumph over strugglers Reims. Sebastien Corchia and Divock Origi put the hosts 2-0 up before Nicolas de Preville pulled one back for Reims but Nolan Roux added gloss to the scoreline at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. At the other end of the table Rennes took a significant step closer to survival with a 3-0 win at Lorient, whose own hopes of avoiding the drop received another hit. Edson Mexer gave Rennes a 17th-minute lead and then goals either side of half-time from Sylvain Armand and Abdoulaye Doucoure ensured Philippe Montanier's men would be returning home with the points. Lille's French forward Nolan Roux is congratulated by teammates after scoring in their 3-1 win over Reims . Metz gave themselves at least some hope of staying up as Modibo Maiga's hat-trick earned them a 3-2 victory over relegation rivals Toulouse. Wissam Ben Yedder gave Toulouse a 21st-minute lead but Maiga - on loan from West Ham - quickly equalised, put Metz ahead before half-time and completed his treble early in the second period. Toulouse then had Marcel Tisserand sent off and could only manage a late consolation from Tongo Doumbia. Metz gave themselves at least some hope of staying up as Modibo Maiga's hat-trick earned them a 3-2 victory . Nice and Evian both picked up another point in their battles for survival following a 2-2 draw at the Allianz Riviera. Evian took a 18th-minute lead through Dany Nounkeu, Daniel Wass having wasted an earlier chance to put them in front from the penalty spot, but they had to rely on an Adrien Thomasson equaliser 12 minutes from time to earn a share of the spoils. Goals either side of half-time from Alexy Bosetti and Valentin Eysseric had turned the match in Nice's favour.

"Roma ended their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday in a key match for Champions League places.

'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.'

They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game . Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points . Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in. Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home . Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma, who have fallen off the pace recently . Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there wasn't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli, who officiated last year's World Cup final. In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th. Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net. Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November.","Roma win at home for the first time since November .

"Stuart McCall revealed captain Lee McCulloch apologised to him and the Rangers players after being sent off in the 2-1 win over runaway Scottish Championship winners Hearts at Ibrox. Goals from striker Kenny Miller and the returning midfielder Haris Vuckic had the home side two ahead and cruising before McCulloch was shown a straight red card by referee Bobby Madden for fouling striker Osman Sow. It left the 10-man Govan side to fight a rearguard battle in the second half and, although Jambos striker Genero Zeefuik reduced the deficit in the 83rd minute, Rangers held on to move into second place in the league, three points ahead of Hibernian with a game in hand over the Leith club. Lee McCulloch was sent off during Rangers' crucial 2-1 victory against Hearts in the Scottish Championship . Staurt McCall says the Gers captain apologised to him as well as the players after the incident . The Gers boss said: 'Believe it or not I haven't seen it again and I didn't see it live - all I was interested in was Zeefuik going through the middle - but I spoke to Bobby coming off and he said he caught him with his elbow. 'Jig (McCulloch) came in after the game and apologised to me and the team so obviously it must have merited a red card.' The former Rangers midfielder paid tribute to Gers supporters in the crowd of 40,521 who willed their team on to a third successive win when they were down to 10 men. He said: 'In the second half, that was the first time for a long, long time, since I was playing, that I got goosebumps out there. McCulloch walks off the pitch after he was shown the red card on Easter Sunday . 'The fans deserved that (win) but I thought the players deserved their applause coming off the park because you need both together to be a success. 'It was pleasing in a lot of ways. We set out with a game plan to stop Hearts playing because they are a good side, no doubt about that. 'Obviously it was two terrific goals, but I thought the tempo and passing in the first half was outstanding. 'I thought the second half was just about guts, desire, being a good team-mate, so it was a hard shift but a nervy finish.' Man of the match Nicky Law also noted the improving relationship between players and supporters. The Rangers midfielder said: 'The crowd just lifted everyone and the atmosphere was as good as it has been since I signed at the club and Hearts fans played their part in that as well. 'Probably for the first time the fans have been right behind us and united as one, which it hasn't been for a while and that was great to see. 'We know that has been down to ourselves in large parts because it hasn't been good enough. 'But we hope that they see the effort we are putting in and hopefully we can achieve the aim that we started the season with and repay the fans. 'It was a huge win for us. Three wins on the spin now and the boys are buzzing.' McCall has paid tribute to the 40,521 Rangers fans who made it to Ibrox for the game . It was Hearts' first away defeat in the league all season and head coach Robbie Neilson refused to be too downbeat. He said: 'I thought we dominated in the second half without creating a lot of chances. I don't think we did enough to win. 'But the pleasing think is I am sitting here at Ibrox, having lost 2-1 and everyone is devastated. 'We have to take a step back and look at the big picture. 'We are 23 points clear at the top of the Championship and we are guaranteed top level football next year. 'So I don't want to be too down. I spoke to the players after the game and told them to put it into perspective. 'When they walk out of Ibrox they should have their heads held high because they are champions and it doesn't matter what happens in one game, it is a 36-game league and they have been the best team.'

"If selected on Sunday, David Templeton will form part of a Rangers guard of honour to recognise the outstanding Championship success of his former club. There will be no feelings of envy as he applauds Hearts on to the Ibrox pitch. Despite enduring much injury-induced frustration in his three seasons in Govan, the winger remains adamant he can prove his worth by rekindling the kind of form he once showed in maroon. Templeton made his first start in almost three months last weekend as Stuart McCall's recorded a 4-1 victory over Cowdenbeath. That followed up a breakthrough win over Hibernian at Easter Road and enhanced confidence ahead of a real litmus test of their recent progress. Rangers ace David Templeton promotes tickets for Sunday's match against Hearts at Ibrox . Hearts romped to the title with seven games to spare and currently sit 26 points in front of a Rangers side fighting to finish as best of the rest ahead of the play-offs. This wasn't a scenario Templeton could ever have envisaged when he moved west along the M8 in August 2012, away from Vladimir Romanov's teetering reign that would eventually lapse into administration. Back then, Rangers were just starting to emerge from their own, even deeper, financial meltdown of liquidation. Few predicted any on-field problems in their journey back up the leagues. Rangers' Haris Vuckic & Nicky Clark training at Murray Park ahead of the clash with Hearts . This season has told a very different story. Templeton, though, insists he has had no regretful thoughts of what it would be like to somehow still be a Hearts player. 'No, because I think I would have been away the following season anyway,' he said. 'At the time I moved, it was the right time for me, I was kind of forced out, as well. 'It was just one of those things, it was a good move at the time and if we can go up through the play-offs then I still think it would have been a good move. Rangers' Tom Walsh training at Murray Park ahead of their clash with runaway leaders Hearts . 'It's massive that we do that. When I signed for Rangers with the squad we had, I thought we would go up each year. For us as a club - and the supporters and everyone - it's massive to get back to the top league. 'My time here has been pretty frustrating, personally. The first season I really enjoyed, although I picked up a couple of injuries which didn't help. 'Last season, I had a couple of little niggles pre-season and then I didn't play a lot. This season, the exact same. Hopefully now I can keep myself fit and start afresh if we go up.' Rangers captain Lee McCulloch holds the ball up as his teammates look on during a training session . Templeton is not among the dozen or so first-team players out of contract this summer, with 12 months still left on his deal. 'The fans have definitely not seen the best of me,' he admitted. 'I need to get back playing the way I was before I signed here because that was the reason I signed for Rangers. 'I know that I'm good enough to get back to that and hopefully the manager sees that in me.' Rangers trialists Milos Milovic (left) and Josef Shirdel (right) are put through their paces during training . Templeton on Friday lauded the difference McCall has made since his arrival last month. The 26-year-old claimed he now felt more confident about expressing himself on the field. 'Earlier in the season, I played a few games and didn't do too well, but at the same time the team wasn't doing as well either and it's hard to stand out then,' he said. 'Last Saturday we were really attacking and creating a load of chances which made me feel a lot better, a lot more confident. The manager has given me the confidence as well since he has come in. Rangers' Lee Wallace tests his reaction speeds as he is put through his paces during training . 'Even before I'm going on in games, he'll just tell me to stay wide, get the ball and attack. It doesn't matter how many times I lose it in the final third, but just to try and make things happen. As a winger, that's what you like to hear - that you're not going to be criticised for trying to do the right things.' Hearts have won both previous matches against Rangers this term but Templeton believes the gap in those games was not significant. 'The past few times we have played Hearts we didn't actually do too badly,' he added. 'In the first game of the season we should have won it - I missed a sitter at 0-0 and if I had scored it we would have gone on to win the game. Templeton holds the ball up as a Rangers teammate looks to dispossess him during a training session . 'The second game, we started well and they couldn't get out of their half. But then we had a man sent off which didn't help us. 'It will be good to play against them on Sunday. They have been excellent this season and thoroughly deserved to win the title. But we will work on how we will play and I am sure we will all be ready.' McCall is dismissive of any suggestion that Hearts might somehow slacken off having already secured a Premiership return. Hearts' Jordan McGhee (right) speaks with teammate Callum Paterson at training ahead of their game . 'If you have won nine on the bounce and you are champions then you are going to have a lot of confidence,' insisted the Ibrox boss. 'Every one of their players will have that. They also have a real good spirit. 'It is a test for us but every game between now and the end of the season will bring a test. Going down to Queen of the South on Thursday will be tough. 'But I take the point that people will look at the Hearts game and think it might be a barometer of how far we have come. The Hearts squad train at Tynecastle ahead of their fixture with Rangers on Sunday . 'We have improved each game and that is all we are asking for again. But we will slip up between now and the end of the season, no doubt. We won't win every game. 'There will be ups and downs but it is about how we handle it. There is a little bit of belief back in the players again, but we know it is only two wins. No-one is getting carried away.' *All tickets previously purchased for the abandoned Rangers v Hearts game at Ibrox on Friday, 16 January are still valid.

"Host commentator . So that's it from the Sportsmail live coverage of Real Madrid versus Granada. Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo (five, yes, five), Karim Benzema (two), Gareth Bale and a Diego Mainz own goal secure a huge win. Robert Ibanez scored Granada's consolation. Thanks for following our coverage. If you enjoyed it, why not follow our minute-by-minute updates of Tottenham Hotspur's trip to Burnley back in the Barclays Premier League. Our live coverage has started HERE. That's it at the Bernabeu. Final score, Real Madrid 9-1 Granada. The biggest win of the La Liga season and what a way for the home side to get back to winning ways after El Clasico! 90 mins: A fifth for Ronaldo. He heads in at the far post from Modric's cross. Real Madrid have managed half the amount of goals Granada have scored in total all season, before today, in just this game! 88 mins: Good stop by the Spanish keeper as he denies Granada a second goal, saving at his near post. 83 mins: It's a tough job stopping Ronaldo, but you don't help yourself when you put the ball in your own net. Luka Modric crosses in, with the Portuguese forward at the far post but the ball doesn't even reach him. Diego Mainz puts his past his own goalkeeper. That's eight. 82 mins: Hernandez is brought down for a foul and Ronaldo and Bale shape up to take the subsequent free-kick from 25 yards. The Portuguese forward takes it and hits it through the wall but well wide. 74 mins: The very definition of a consolation. Robert Ibanez breaks through, Ramos lets him cut inside and Casillas can't quite stop it from finding the net. Not a perfect afternoon for Real Madrid. 72 mins: Useless, this bloke, isn't he? Ronaldo can't manage a fifth goal as he stretches to reach Jese's cross but sends the ball wide of the goal. 70 mins: No let-up here, Bale plays the ball into Ronaldo but it gets stuck under his feet and his finish is wide of the left-hand post. 68 mins: A great cross from Marcelo finds Manchester United loan star Hernandez but it ends up in the goalkeeper's hands. 66 mins: He scored with a free-kick for Wales during the international break and Gareth Bale almost repeats the trick here. His curling effort from the right-hand side hits Oier Olazabal's side netting. 61 mins: An excellent return to the side for James Rodriguez ends as he is replaced by Jese. Two-goal Karim Benzema is replaced by Javier Hernandez too. 56 mins: 7-0. That's S-E-V-E-N. Benzema finds the net again. His shot is deflected into the net by the defender but they all count. Embarrassing for Granada. Real Madrid are ruthless and there could be more with 34 minutes to go. 54 mins: Bale's had criticism for not passing to Ronaldo recently, but he's laid a goal on a plate for the four-goal hero here. Granada so poor in defending as the Welsh winger latches on to a ball played over the top, he knocks it across goal to give Ronaldo an open net to finish into. It looks like he's hurt himself in a collision with the goal but should be alright. 52 mins: And it's five! The corner is put in by Rodriguez, Benzema is allowed to control it on his chest inside the box and he strikes a beauty into the top corner of the net. Awful defending on. Real's BBC have come under some stick of late but they've all scored here. Ronaldo gets us started at the Bernabeu. Can he get even more goals in this second half? 15 minute break at the Bernabeu. 4-0 at the half-time whistle and Ronaldo has been at his rampant best. Cutting Barcelona's La Liga lead is a formality for Real. 44 mins: That's more like it from the visitors. Youssef El-Arabi hammers in a shot from outside the area but it cannons off the crossbar and down on to the line. Definitely not over, so no controversy, but Granada have come close. 43 mins: Have Granada given up? Ronaldo turns provider this time, crossing from the right-hand side into Benzema but the keeper gathers. 38 mins: This is getting silly now. it's a landslide. Ronaldo brings the ball forward and he blasts it past the goalkeeper from the edge of the box. It's an eight minute hat-trick for the Ballon d'Or winner and Real Madrid are out of sight. 36 mins: Ronaldo plays the ball out to Marcelo, it's crossed in and the goalkeeper can't deal with it, palming it out to the feet of Ronaldo. Is there anyone worse to put the ball on a plate for? The former Manchester United man smashes the ball in and it's 3-0. He's top scorer in Spain now ahead of Messi. 34 mins: Ronaldo is now level on goals for the season with Lionel Messi. 32 this campaign. It's relentless from Real Madrid at the minute but Granada stop them with plenty of bodies back. Plenty more goals to come here at a sunny Santiago Bernabeu. 30 mins: That's game over. Ronaldo makes it 2-0. Benzema makes a mess of a cross but the Granada defence are all over the place. It comes out to James Rodriguez who pulls off a great flick to gift Ronaldo the ball and he finishes confidently. 25 mins: Gareth Bale breaks the deadlock and gives Real Madrid the lead! The Welshman is played in by a brilliant pass from Toni Kroos, he does well to round the goalkeeper and just keeps it in to finish off the move and give his side the lead. 22 mins: How has Alvaro Arbeloa not scored? Real's full backs are both up in the opposition half and Marcelo whips a dangerous cross into the penalty area from the right. Arbeloa meets his tantalising ball but somehow his effort goes wide. On target and it was almost certain to be a goal. Poor. 18 mins: Real have been on top but it's the opposition who come close here. It's a great chance for Granada as Sergio Ramos refuses to close down Robert Ibanez after a terrible throw from Iker Casillas but luckily for the Real Madrid pair, the Granada man drags his shot inches wide . 16 mins: The pressure is on Granada now, Real have two corners in a row. Taken by Rodriguez and Toni Kroos but both set-pieces come to nothing. 13 mins: Lovely stepover from Cristiano Ronaldo on the left-hand side of the box and he fires in a shot early that leaves the goalkeeper fooled. Unluckily for him it hits the side netting. Real Madrid are finding their feet. 10 mins: Big error by Juan Carlos, he misses a long ball over the top ahead of his goalkeeper and Gareth Bale is ready to pounce. The Welshman unfortunately nips the ball over the bar between the two Granada men but Real are getting closer. 8 mins: Excellent cross from James Rodriguez, looking sharp despite just returning to the first team. It finds Benzema at the back post and he slides in to finish but his shot is straight at the goalkeeper. Real's first chance. Granada have every player inside their own half, gives you an impression of how this one is going to go... 6 mins: Granada manager Abel Resino must have been working hard on that high line this week, Karim Benzema is caught offside now, Real struggling to find a way through in the opening minutes despite dominating possession. 4 mins: Cristiano Ronaldo has just been ruled offside as Real Madrid try to start an attack. The Granada back four of Foulquier, Babin, Mainz and Carlos are playing a fairly high line so let's wait and see if Real can catch them out. Here we go as Real Madrid look to take the lead at the top of La Liga. Granada get us going. Not long until we kick off now, Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and co are almost ready. Granada are second-bottom of La Liga so this game should represent a great opportunity for them to reel in Barcelona before they play Celta Vigo later this evening. The Andalusian side have lost three of their last five games but Real's form is similarly poor, matching their losses over the same period. Marca's front page yesterday spoke of how Real want to win their last 10 games to take the La Liga title. Can they start on that road today? Granada go with 4-2-3-1. Pretty attacking team for a trip to the Bernabeu. Will their bravery pay off? Olazabal; Foulquier, Babin, Mainz, Carlos; Rico, Iturra; Ibanez, Rochina, Candeias; El Arabi. Carlo Ancelotti had confirmed that James Rodriguez would be back in the Real Madrid side during his press conference on Saturday, and his words ring true. The Colombian playmaker starts in place of Isco, who is suspended. Alvaro Arbeloa comes in for Dani Carvajal and Raphael Varane is in for the injured Pepe. Here's the Real Madrid team for this morning's game: Casillas; Arbeloa, Ramos, Varane, Marcelo; Modric, Kroos; Bale, Rodriguez, Ronaldo; Benzema. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five, including a seven-minute hat-trick, as Real Madrid beat sorry Granada 9-1. Gareth Bale broke the deadlock and Carlo Ancelotti’s team were 4-0 up before half time as they put memories of their Clasico defeat to Barcelona a fortnight ago behind them. The huge gulf in class showed in the midday sunshine at the Bernabeu right from minute 20 when Bale bullied Diego Mainz off the ball and charged through on goal. He dribbled around flailing Granada keeper Oier Olazabal before nudging the ball over the line for 1-0.","Real Madrid take on Granada in La Liga early Sunday kick-off .

"Fighting between rival fans forced a Russian Premier League match between Arsenal Tula and Torpedo Moscow to be stopped for seven minutes on Sunday. A statement on Arsenal's official site read: 'In the 31st minute, fans from the visiting Moscow club broke down barriers in front of the visitors sector and tried to get to the East Stand, where a number of women and children were sitting. 'The Torpedo fans began breaking seats and throwing them towards law enforcement officers and stewards.' Scroll down to watch video footage of the incident . Fans fight leading to Arsenal Tula vs Torpedo Moscow to be suspended for seven minutes on Sunday . Torpedo Moscow fans broke down barriers and threw chairs, according to Arsenal Tula's website . Referee Alexander Yegorov stopped the match and told the players to leave the pitch and head for the dressing rooms, while fights broke out between fans on the running track after they managed to climb over barriers. After order was restored play resumed and Torpedo ran out 3-1 winners. Sergei Cheban, executive director of the Russian Football Premier League, said Torpedo could expected to be heavily punished for this latest outbreak of violence by their fans. 'Those people who organised the trouble have already been detained. The security forces on duty were very professional in their work,' said Cheban in an interview with Championat.com. 'Torpedo can expect to receive serious punishment. This is hooliganism and it not the first time they have stopped a match. The punishment will be harsh.' Torpedo's fans have caused trouble on a number of occasions and the club have already been punished three times this season for racist behaviour of their supporters. The last incident occurred on March 15 when Torpedo fans abused Zenit St Petersburg's Brazilian forward Hulk. The side were sanctioned by having to play two matches behind closed doors. Torpedo are currently in 12th place in the Russian Premier League table with 19 points, while Arsenal Tula are one place off the bottom with 14 points.","Torpedo Moscow fans broke down barriers and threw seats .

"It may an unorthodox way of achieving European qualification, but West Ham manager Sam Allardyce would welcome doing so through UEFA's Respect and Fair Play rankings. The top three nations in UEFA's rankings qualify for the Europa League, with England currently sitting third and West Ham topping the Barclays Premier League's Fair Play table. West Ham have little left to play for as they sit ninth ahead of Saturday's match with bottom-club Leicester City at the King Power Stadium. Yet they could achieve European qualification regardless of where they end up in the Premier League by finishing top of the Fair Play table. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce wants the club to qualify for Europe next season through Fair Play . It is a case of the fewer yellow and red cards the better for Allardyce, but the West Ham manager insists he has not instructed his players to keep their discipline at all costs. Asked if his players should tone down their commitment for the final eight games, Allardyce said: 'I haven't told them that. 'If we have done what we have done all season and we have been as good as we have been I shouldn't really need to tell them any more. 'For us as a team to be where we are at this stage of the season shows that we have played the game in the right way and the right manner and achieved something that is out there to promote the game in the right fashion.' Allardyce shouts instructions at his Bolton players during a UEFA Cup match against Besiktas in 2005 . Allardyce led Bolton Wanderers into UEFA Cup qualification for the first time in the club's history in 2005, and knows first hand how it can attract players in the transfer market. 'It was never easy but there were players of much higher quality interested in coming to Bolton, there is no doubt about that,' Allardyce added. 'The journey may not be great financially, but it is not the financial journey we look for as footballers and managers – it is the experience. 'It is the fact that you are competing in Europe which in itself may help in some of your recruitment areas – however you have got there.'

"Hull midfielder David Meyler says he is totally convinced the Tigers will hang on to their Premier League status. Steve Bruce's side are in 15th place, three points off the relegation zone, but have a tough run-in with five of their last eight matches against clubs in the top seven of the Premier League. The Tigers have impressed however against top sides, drawing 1-1 away at Manchester City and losing 3-2 at the hands of Chelsea in a match they could easily have won. Hull midfielder David Meyler is confident his side will remain in the top flight despite their recent poor form . The Tigers will be hoping to bounce back from their 3-2 home defeat by Chelsea when they face Swansea . Hull are currently just three points above Burnley . Speaking ahead of the weekend meeting with Swansea, Meyler said: 'We are not going down. We just have to get into the mentality that it is not good enough to accept the 3-2 defeat by Chelsea, even if they are likely Premier League champions. 'We had some great chances and we need to win these games when you get into those positions.' He added: 'We're down to the last eight games now and this is where we have to earn our money. 'This is the period when everything will be decided so we've got eight games to make sure we finish as well as we can and that is what we aim to do. 'We finished 17th last season and at the moment, we're 15th this season so we're a little bit ahead. Hull trio Mohamed Diame (pictured), James Chester and Gaston Ramirez could feature against Swansea . 'What we want to do here is maintain Premier League status for a number of years to come and we'll do what we have to do to achieve that aim and build this club. We're looking to develop every year. 'We've got eight games to come, against some decent teams, but I'm sure we can get the wins we need if we keep performing like we did in games against the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool and for 70 minutes against Chelsea. 'It will be tough against Swansea but we're going there with the mentality that we can get some points.' Hull will be hugely boosted by the return of Senegal midfielder Mohamed Diame after a long injury absence, and James Chester is also back in the squad to face Swansea.

"After hitting nine past Granada at the weekend, it's safe to say Real Madrid's attacking prowess isn't misfiring at present. And for Real boss Carlo Ancelotti he now faces the enviable dilemma of trying to fit in his array of stars into his starting line-up. However, as Spanish paper AS reports seven players into six spots doesn't go - with one set to be upset at being left out of his preferred 4-3-3 formation. Spanish papers report on the attacking selection that Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti now has at the club . For the first time since November midfield quartet Isco, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez are all fit and available alongside famed 'BBC' triumvirate of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo. Marca also recognises this issue at the Santiago Bernabeu. Leading with the headline 'Blessed Problem,' the publication states that Ancelotti will have to choose between either Isco or Rodriguez to finalise his best starting line-up. The Madrid-based paper further adds that the latter is the favourite due to his impressive stats in his debut season at Real to date. In all competitions so far, the 23-year-old has scored 12 goals and provided 11 assists in comparison to Isco's five and six. Over in Italy, the fallout at the demise of giants Inter continues with Corriere dello Sport reporting that there is a huge divide between Italian and foreign playing and non-playing staff. The main issue of contention at the San Siro outfit appears to be at boardroom level though with Managing Director Marco Fassone and CEO Michael Bolingbroke  said to be wanting to take the club in different directions. Over in Italy, Corriere dello Sport focuses on the internal struggles at fallen giants Inter Milan . Meanwhile Tuttosport looks ahead at the Coppa Italia semi-final second legs taking place in midweek - with Fiorentina's clash against Juventus taking centre stage. The paper reports that Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri will pair star striker Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata together for the trip to Florence, while Viola manager Vincenzo Montella is looking for another moment of magic from on loan Chelsea midfielder Mohamed Salah. And finally in France, the reaction to Paris Saint-Germain's pulsatring 3-2 win at title rivals Marseille on Sunday continues. L'Equipe state that exciting affair at the Stade Velodrome is confirmation that Ligue 1 is progressing and becoming more appealing - while the result adds an extra spice to this year's championship race. As it stands, PSG sit top of Ligue 1 with 62 points after 31 games - just one ahead of second-placed Lyon and five ahead of Marseille in third. In France, L'Equipe reports that PSG's 3-2 win at Marseille is an indictment at the improvement of Ligue 1 .","Real Madrid thrashed Granada 9-1 in La Liga at home on Sunday .

"Kolo Toure has warned Raheem Sterling that leaving Liverpool could see him end up on the scrapheap at a big club, similar to the way that Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair did at Manchester City. Sterling stunned Liverpool earlier this week, giving an interview confirming that he has turned down a new £100,000-a-week contract and admitting he is 'quite flattered' by interest from Arsenal. Chelsea and Manchester City are also keen on English football's hottest property. But Toure, who used to play for  City with Rodwell and Sinclair, has warned his Anfield team-mate a move to one of European football's heavyweights may not be everything he has dreamed of. Raheem Sterling has been warned about the dangers of leaving Liverpool by his team-mate Kolo Toure . Toure compared Sterling's situation with that of Jack Rodwell (left) and Scott Sinclair joining Manchester City . Toure (centre) says Liverpool is the best place for Sterling to stay and continue his development as a player . After starring in Everton's midfield and making his England debut, Jack Rodwell was being linked with every big club around. Sir Alex Ferguson was known to be an admirer but Rodwell was snapped up by Manchester City for £12million. Repeated injury problems and the presence of Yaya Toure, David Silva, Samir Nasri and Javi Garcia saw his appearances limited, while Fernandinho arrived for £30m the next summer. After just seven league starts in two years, Rodwell moved on to relegation-threatened Sunderland for £10m. It was a similar story for Scott Sinclair. After powering Swansea City's promotion to the Premier League and scoring eight times in the top flight, Chelsea youth product Sinclair moved to City for £8m. But he too struggled with the competition in City's squad and moved to West Bromwich Albion on loan last season. He found it hard to break into the team there and returned to City before heading out on loan again to Aston Villa in January where he has found some form. Rodwell joined City in a £12million deal in 2012, while Sinclair made the same move from Swansea City for an £8m fee later that summer. The English pair made just nine Barclays Premier League appearances between them across two seasons at the Etihad Stadium. Rodwell joined relegation-threatened Sunderland last summer to end his City nightmare while Sinclair is trying to rebuild his career at Aston Villa. Toure says Sterling could be making a similar mistake by leaving Anfield. 'Both Rodwell and Sinclair went to a club where there is big competition and didn't play,' Toure said. 'If Raheem left Liverpool he wouldn't be sure to start games. Make a mistake or don't score for two games and he will be on the bench. There is no messing at clubs like that.' Brendan Rodgers used his pre-match press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Arsenal to reiterate that Sterling was not for sale, and Toure sees Liverpool as the perfect place for the 20-year-old to continue his development. 'I'm not surprised there's speculation because everybody would want to have a player like him,' he told the Liverpool ECHO. 'But he needs to stay here. Liverpool is a great place for him. Sterling stunned Liverpool this week, giving an interview confirming that he had turned down a new deal . The likes of Chelsea, City and Arsenal would have big competition in their squads for a place . 'This is definitely the best place for him to continue his development. At Liverpool, he's beginning to be one of the most important players. He's playing every week. 'If he went to another club there would be big challenges he would face. He wouldn't be the most important player.' Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Chelsea had joined the race to sign England star Sterling, with the Premier League leaders wanting to be kept informed of any developments in his contract situation. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are also monitoring the developments in his stand-off at Anfield. Rodwell made just seven Premier League starts for City during his two-year spell before leaving the club . The former Everton man now plays for relegation-threatened Sunderland after a tough time at City . Sinclair's spell was even more difficult, he made just two league starts for City before moving out on loan . Sinclair is on loan at Aston Villa as he looks to rebuild his reputation as a young England talent . Doubts over Arsenal’s ability to fund a move have seen their interest questioned, but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him with the likes of Chelsea and City. Liverpool boss Rodgers said on Thursday: ‘He’s got two-and-a-half years to go on his deal and he’s not going anywhere in the summer. 'I cannot speak for the owners but I have a good idea of what they would do. I know them well enough and for me it would not happen. Liverpool are one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money doesn’t come into it. If the club doesn’t want to sell, it won’t sell, it’s as simple as that. Money has never been the objective for the club. ‘Whatever player - Raheem or anybody - it would always be on the terms of the club. ‘He still has two-and-a- bit years left of his deal so it’s not something we’re overly concerned about. I’m confident that at the end of the season we’ll find the solution.’ Brendan Rodgers has said Sterling is going nowhere this summer despite the speculation over his future . Sinclair spent more time on the bench than the pitch at City, and Toure thinks it could be similar for Sterling .","Raheem Sterling has turned down a £100,000-a-week Liverpool contract .

"The Premier League returns this weekend after the fourth interruption this season for international fixtures, leaving managers hoping their players have returned with a clean bill of health. The break can be both a blessing and a curse, potentially halting your momentum if results and confidence are positive, or halting your slide if all is not well. Premier League sides have already had to resume their season after international breaks in September, October and November 2014. Premier League leaders Chelsea have won all three of their matches following the international break . Everton lead the post-international Premier League table with three wins from three after the break . However six Premier League clubs are still chasing their first win after an international break this season, so who has been the best at managing this transition? Sportsmail examines this through a modified Premier League table that takes in only results immediately after international resumptions. Our alternative table makes nice reading for Toffees fans, with their side winning all three matches and keeping clean sheets against Aston Villa and West Brom. Champions-elect Chelsea are the only side to match this perfect record, though both of these teams have not faced a current top seven team across their post-international fixtures. Southampton and both Manchester clubs are the only other unbeaten sides though United did slip up in drawing 2-2 at home to West Brom. Manchester City have been relatively impressive, drawing 2-2 at the Emirates and most notably dispatching Champions League chasing Tottenham 4-1, who have an indifferent record. Moving further down and Liverpool have a significantly worse record following the international break than in overall form, suffering surprise defeats when visiting Crystal Palace and hosting Aston Villa. Moreover their only win came through an unconvincing 3-2 victory at Queens Park Rangers, secured only through a sensational second-half display by Raheem Sterling. Manchester United will be hoping to follow up their win against Liverpool by beating Aston Villa . Arsenal are awaiting their first Premier League win directly following an international break . Brendan Rodgers (right) will be hoping his side can pile more post-international misery on Arsenal . Saturday . Arsenal vs Liverpool . Everton vs Southampton . Leicester vs West Ham . Manchester United vs Aston Villa . Swansea vs Hull . West Brom vs QPR . Chelsea vs Stoke . Sunday . Burnley vs Tottenham . Sunderland vs Newcastle . Monday . Crystal Palace vs Manchester City . Both the Reds and Arsenal will want to change the vast discrepancies between their current league table positions and their positions in our alternative view, currently sitting in eighth and 13th respectively. The two Champions League sides meet on Saturday lunchtime as Arsenal chase a first win following an international break this season. The Gunners have been fortunate in having three home fixtures but have totally failed to capitalise on this, drawing 2-2 with Hull City and Manchester City, whilst losing 2-1 at the hands of Manchester United. Southampton have handed out two thrashings to sides in the North-East by picking up 8-0 and 4-0 wins over Sunderland and Newcastle respectively. However in this table the Toon still make the top six through narrow 1-0 wins over both QPR and Leicester. The Foxes have a notably improved position whilst keeping clean sheets against Sunderland and Stoke in their three post-international games, despite these being relatively rare across the season. Relegations strugglers QPR have lost all three of their post-international fixtures so far this season . This puts Nigel Pearson’s side comfortably nestled in mid-table, joined their relegation strugglers Burnley. Possibly benefitting from having fewer players occupied on international duty, both join a cluster of teams on four points. Stoke will also be concerned by their poor record, which includes 2-1 and 1-0 defeats when hosting relegation-threatened sides Burnley and Leicester City. Such results across an entire campaign may have seen them struggling to maintain mid-table stability under Mark Hughes. Hull City, Sunderland and West Brom are all winless, though the Black Cats did claim a respectable 2-2 draw at home to Tottenham. Swansea City and QPR are both pointless, though the Swans have had three games including difficult trips to Chelsea and Manchester City. Meanwhile the R’s have hosted Liverpool whilst suffering away defeats with scoring at both Newcastle and Manchester United – Chris Ramsey’s team will hope to change that trend when travelling to West Brom on Saturday.","Everton and Chelsea have perfect records with three wins each .
Southampton, Man City and Man United are the only other unbeaten sides .

"It is eight long, barren years since an English club claimed the top prize in European rugby and the bookmakers aren't convinced the grim cycle can be broken this year. When Wasps claimed the Heineken Cup in 2007 with victory over Leicester, it seemed unthinkable that the Premiership would not produce another continental champion for so long. Yet since then Irish teams have seized four titles — Leinster claiming a hat-trick — and French teams three, accurately reflecting the balance of power in the European game. This season is not seen as any real exception, despite the presence of four English sides in the last eight of the new Champions Cup. There is a consensus among the bookies that holders Toulon are destined to finish on top of the pile for the third successive year, with Clermont their primary challengers followed by Racing and Leinster. The Aviva Premiership quartet are all away from home this weekend and are all firm underdogs. Francois Louw runs with the ball during the Bath Rugby training session held at Farleigh House . Bath's George Ford practices his kicking during the training session at the Farleigh House complex . Leinster's Jamie Heaslip is tackled by Sailosi Tagicakibau during the Champions Cup match with Wasps . In World Cup year it would provide a clear boost to national morale if one of their elite clubs could shatter the status quo by lifting the trophy on May 2 but there are significant reasons why an English triumph shouldn't happen. The first comes down to money. Northampton, Saracens, Bath and Wasps are well-funded, with strong squads, but their resources are modest compared to French powerhouses Toulon, Clermont and Racing, who have budgets three or four times the size of their Premiership opponents. Across the Channel, squads are awash with Test-class players from around the world, even on the bench. Meanwhile, Leinster have superb recent European pedigree and benefit from the Irish system which sees top players rested from league duties in order to peak on these major occasions.Bath will find themselves in hostile territory at the Aviva Stadium, but they went to Toulouse in January and scorched the earth to win 35-18. If their pack can go toe-to-toe with the hosts, the likes of Jonathan Joseph are capable of wreaking havoc. Make no mistake, Mike Ford's team are capable of winning in Dublin. Also on Saturday, Northampton face an arduous task in trying to storm the Stade Marcel Michelin fortress where Clermont are on a 22-match unbeaten run in Europe. The Saints are the only English team to win an away quarter-final against French opposition — beating Biarritz 7-6 in 2007. English sides have lost the eight other quarter-finals they have played across the Channel.

Clermont winger Napolioni Nalaga (right) charges with the ball during the match against Bordeaux-Begles . Nothampton's Stephen Myler (left) and Luther Burrell (right) prepare to tackle Jamie Roberts of Racing Metro . The current Premiership champions were losing Heineken Cup finalists in 2011. To reach that stage again would require a monumental result this weekend, but Clermont are far from infallible, as Saracens proved, thrashing them 46-6 in last season's epic semi-final. The London club lost to Toulon in the final, but they have been the standard-bearers for English rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to Paris and beat Racing, who can be wildly inconsistent. Wasps captain James Haskell provides a link back to the club's distant 2007 success, but Dai Young's men will be confronting a multi-national force in Toulon that would beat most Test teams. If they were to stun the holders, it would go down as one of the greatest shocks in European competition. There is a fair chance that one English team can progress, with Bath and Saracens the more likely candidates. If two were to make it, that would provide a colossal and timely boost to national morale. Wasps captain James Haskell receives a pass during the training session at Twyford Avenue Sports Ground .","It has been eight years since an English club triumphed in the European Champions Cup .
Despite four English teams in this year's quarter-finals, that hoodoo looks set to persist .
English clubs are nowhere near as well-resourced as French clubs .

"Wales' crunch Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium this summer has been declared a 33,000 sell-out. The top two sides in Group B meet at the Cardiff City Stadium on June 12 with Wales in their best position to qualify for a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden. Belgium and Wales both have 11 points from five games with Marc Wilmots' side - ranked fourth in the world - on top spot because of a superior goal difference.

Real Madrid star Bale celebrates as the victory took Wales to the top of the Group B table on goal difference . But Wales' comprehensive 3-0 victory in Israel last weekend has seen expectations rise that Chris Coleman's charges can claim one of the two automatic qualifying spots and make it all the way to the 2016 finals in France. 'The stunning performance in Israel has created a huge buzz around Chris Coleman's team and the FAW has been inundated with orders for tickets,' the Football Association of Wales said in a statement on its website. 'Due to overwhelming demand, general admission tickets for the European qualifiers match between Wales and Belgium at the Cardiff City Stadium have now sold out.' It is understood the Wales squad prefer to play at the Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium . There had been speculation that Wales would play Belgium at the 74,500 capacity Millennium Stadium with so much interest in the match. But that was never going to happen as UEFA rules prevent the venue being changed within 120 days of the scheduled date. It is understood Gareth Bale and company would prefer playing at the more intimate Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium, where they have not played since meeting England in a Euro 2012 qualifier in March 2011.","Wales' Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium has been declared a sell-out .

"Mark Hughes has insisted he will have significant money to spend this summer if required – and told Asmir Begovic he can fulfil his ambitions at Stoke City. The Stoke manager has kept the club's chequebook largely in his pocket since taking over in May 2013 but said he would splash out when the right player became available. Signing Begovic to a new contract is a priority given the Bosnia goalkeeper will be entering the final year of his current deal. Stoke City manager Mark Hughes is confident he will have money to spend in the summer transfer window . Hughes wants goalkeeper Asmir Begovic to agree a new contract at the Britannia Stadium . But Hughes will add expensive acquisitions if needed, having missed out on £10million Xherdan Shaqiri in the January window. Hughes said: 'We haven't spent a great deal since I've been here. A net spend of £6million I think over four transfer windows. 'But I've never been given the impression that if the right player was available and we wanted to really push the boat out there wouldn't be funds available. 'We've chased any number of players and some targets we've got very, very close to where we would have been in a position to make a decision whether or not we spent a significant amount. Stoke sit 10th in the Premier League and still have an outside chance of earning a European berth . Begovic is out of contract at the end of next season and could be targeted by clubs this summer . 'We've never actually got to the point where we've needed to just because the target fell by the wayside. I've never been in any doubt that if the right target is available then the finances will be made available to me.' A host of clubs may decide to make a move for Begovic, 27, who is set to open talks over extending his Stoke stay once the season is over. Hughes said: 'I'm sure they will be looking at him. But we've got a lot of things we can offer to Asmir. 'He knows we're a good club that will continue hopefully to progress. He wants to be part of a successful football club, I know that. He's an ambitious guy. 'But we'd like to think he could achieve what he needs from his career here at Stoke.'","Stoke manager Mark Hughes has a net spend of around £6million .

"Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling’s interview didn’t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn’t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I’m hoping that that wasn’t the whole point, as we’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: ‘let him go’. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money’s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers . Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract . Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It’s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there’s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £100,000-a-week contract he’s turned down. But it’s only that: potential. At present, he’s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he’s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn’t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . And while I’d be willing to see the club give him £100k a week – possibly £120k a week - the club shouldn’t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I’m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling’s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he’s welcome to. Personally, I don’t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United . Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club . If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he’s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we’ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he’s easily worth £25-30 million. If I was FSG, I’d hold any interested club to ransom, though – double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn’t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there’s little Arsenal can offer that we can’t. Sure, they’re more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract . I think we’re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren’t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he’s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won’t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

"Raheem Sterling gave a revealing insight into his future on Wednesday, insisting he was not a money-grabbing 20-year-old despite turning down a Liverpool contract worth £100,000-a-week. The England winger instead pointed to his desire to finish out the season before considering any more offers, focusing on winning trophies with his club for the time being. But how much of what Sterling told BBC Sport can we believe? Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai tries his hand at interpreting. Liverpool star Raheem Sterling gave a revealing insight into his Liverpool talks with BBC Sport . WHAT HE SAID: ‘I would never want the fans to think bad of me, to think I just want as much money for myself. I want them to understand it’s been a bit much for me this season, with everyone talking about it every minute.’ WHAT HE MEANT: Can’t a guy just let his contract run down in peace? WHAT HE SAID: ‘It’s never been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That’s all I talk about.’ WHAT HE MEANT:  Finishing the season empty-handed won’t help the situation . Sterling says it is not about money, only about trophies - so can Liverpool afford to not win any this season? WHAT HE SAID: ‘I don’t talk about how many cars I’m going to drive, how many houses I’ve got. I just purely want to be the best I can be.’ WHAT HE MEANT: If you’re wondering, I drive a Mercedes C63 and also have a Range Rover 4x4. They are both white. WHAT HE SAID: ‘You really want to be working with world-class players day in, day out. It’s obviously left a little dent, these two world-class superstars (Suarez and Gerrard) leaving, but I think we have good players coming through at Liverpool.’ WHAT HE MEANT::Players come and go. Deal with it. Sterling rejected Liverpool's contract offer of £100,000-a-week and says he is focusing on his football . WHAT HE SAID: On speculation that Arsenal are keen: ‘Quite flattering.’ WHAT HE MEANT:  Auctions are always better when more people turn up . WHAT HE SAID: ‘Everyone’s dream growing up is seeing themselves in an away kit somewhere in a sunny country. But, in reality, I’m happy to be playing for Liverpool and trying to win trophies.’ WHAT HE MEANT:  Barcelona and Madrid are nice cities. And warm, too. The 20-year-old England international has been linked with moves to Arsenal, Real Madrid and Barcelona . WHAT HE SAID: ‘If, at that point in time, I was offered a contract, I most definitely would have signed straight away, probably for far less money than being said now. I just think the timing was a bit off.’ WHAT HE MEANT:  You need me more than ever now. WHAT HE SAID: ‘I just want to focus on football and, when it gets to the end of the season, assess my position as a 20-year-old player playing in the Premier League.’ WHAT HE MEANT:  Literally all of the power in this situation is with me.

"A sign of Raheem Sterling’s tender years can be seen inked into his forearm. The image of Wembley, which overlooked his estate growing up, is clear amid a cluster of tattoos. Rather than those two famous towers, synonymous with the national stadium for 77 years, it is the arc, unveiled in 2007, that is unmistakable. Back then, Sterling was a young kid dreaming of a career in professional football, playing jumpers for goalposts on streets and in parks.

He knows, with two years left on his £35,000-per-week deal, he holds the cards in discussions with one of the biggest clubs in English and European football. It has been quite a remarkable rise for Sterling since his days looking up at Wembley with hope in his heart and a ball under his arm; rapidly progressing along the ground and through the ranks.

He was born in Maverley, Kingston, a tough Jamaican community where gun crime is rife and drug gangs rule, before moving across the Atlantic aged five to join his mother Nadine in north London along with three siblings. Living on the St Raphael’s estate meant the sounds of gunshots were never far away. Police labelled the adjoining Stonebridge estate a warzone in 2005. Rival gangs engaged in tit-for-tat shootings. ‘They were all dealing in crack cocaine and it was a fight for territory,’ said Detective Inspector Stephen Horsley in 2009. Sterling had his football and his mother, a source of inspiration and guidance. But he failed to settle in a mainstream primary school because of behavioural problems, finding escape at the Vernon House Special School, which he attended for three years. A decade ago he began to take his sport seriously. The English youngster spent seven years at Queens Park Rangers before moving to Liverpool in 2010 .

At this time Sterling was taken under the wing of Tom Walley, a veteran youth coach who has worked with Ashley Cole and David James. Sterling’s pay has rocketed since he left QPR, where he would have been earning around £400 per week. After his move north, his first pro contract at Liverpool was worth £2,000 per week and his current deal earns him £35,000 per week as previously mentioned. Michael Calvin details in his book, The Nowhere Men, how Sterling would take part in pick-up games organised by Walley on a pitch in the back garden of the home of Tim Sherwood, then Tottenham’s technical co-ordinator.

Fulham were assured of his talent and had Sterling in their building before Liverpool swooped to take him to Merseyside aged 15 for £500,000. Shortly before travelling north, Sterling took part in Soccer Am’s Skill School challenge, facing another promising youngster Christain Nanetti. He is most recently of Dover Athletic, a tale of just how tough it is to make the kind of ascent Sterling has managed. He is close to completing his third full season as a Liverpool first-teamer having become the club’s second-youngest debutant aged 17 years and 107 days.

"Brendan Rodgers will deliver his weekly briefing to the media on Friday afternoon, previewing the showdown with Arsenal on Saturday and discussing the future of Raheem Sterling. The young England star has moved a step closer to an Anfield exit after revealing in a TV interview that he is not ready to sign a new contract at Anfield. Sterling, 20, has been offered a new £100,000-a-week contract to stay at the club but admitted he is 'flattered' by interest from Arsenal. Follow the press conference as it happens from 2pm. Host commentator . And with that, Brendan Rodgers has brought to a close the broadcast section of his press conference. The rest of his quotes will now be embargoed until tonight. In summary, then, Rodgers has insisted that Raheem Sterling will not be going anywhere this summer and that focus for the moment is purely on his football. The manager said he was 'relaxed' about his contract situation and that Liverpool are a 'superpower' of world football and don't have to sell their best players. He did admit, however, that Sterling's interview was conducted without the prior consent of the club and 'took them by surprise.' 'The concentration a few weeks back was to purely focus on his football, and help him continue with his development at the place he’s made great strides over last couple of years. 'The last time we sat down with plays and representatives that was the intention. 'Raheem has come out and made his feelings clear on that, and hopefully continue to focus on his football until the end of the season. 'What he said absolutely underpins everything we’re trying to achieve here. Raheem says it’s his ambition is to win trophies, and that’s perfectly aligned with what we’re trying to do. 'This is Liverpool one of the great clubs of football world. 'It is an honour for him to play at a club like Liverpool and he understands that. 'What he’s saying is that he’s got two and a half years left, he’s quite relaxed as I am, he just wants to concentrate on football. 'I'm quite relaxed on it. It's part of modern game. People who look after players have different ways of working. The focus is purely on the football. He has been involved with the first team for two and half years and player he is today is because of environment and what we’ve created. 'He's got a lot of improvement to do and this is the best place for him to do it. 'He's not going anywhere in the summer. The focus on trying to make him the best player we can. Does money talk? 'This club has shown that’s not the case. Liverpool is one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear and we’ve seen it before that money doesn’t come into it. If the club doesn’t want to sell it won’t sell. That’s that case with any player, Raheem or anybody else. 'It’s about continuing to nurture a young player so he can be consistently playing at the top if his game. 'For Raheem it’s purely about the football and he’s made it clear that he’s happy here. Trying to put off all the talk. He’s a boy who loves his football. He understands and respects the opportunity that he’s had. 'Still has two and a bit years left of his deal so it’s not something we’ve overly concerned about. Hopefully we’ll get it sorted out. On the interview... 'There was no permission by the club, it was something that surprised us all. He’s a young player who has to learn and sometimes they makes mistakes. Our relationship is strong. He will learn as time goes on. We all make mistakes, especially when you’re young.' Moving back onto the subject of Saturday's match with Arsenal, Rodgers says he is targeting 'at least a point' from the trip to the Emirates. 'We go into the game happy to play our game.' He adds: 'We need to keep the ball better, we need to be technically better.' Rodgers has confirmed that Sterling did not have permission from the club to do the BBC interview. 'It surprised us all,' he admits. 'He will learn we all make mistakes in life, especially when you are young.' Then swiftly back to the burning issue: 'Liverpool is one of the superpowers of football. The money doesn't come into it. If the club doesn't want to sell, it doesn't sell. Money has never been the objective. 'For Raheem, it's purely about the football. What the kid is trying to do is put off talk about him being all about money.' The conversation moves on from Sterling to Saturday's match with Arsenal. Liverpool have no new injury worries, with Jordan Henderson back in the squad and Lucas available to start. Reflecting on the damaging 2-1 loss to Manchester United before the international break, which left Liverpool five points behind their rivals, Rodgers says: Obviously it was a disappointing result. We have to make sure we perform [against Arsenal].' On the contract talks: 'He has two and a half years left on his deal, he's going nowhere in the summer' On Sterling being linked with Arsenal, Rodgers says: 'Arsenal is a great club, but this is Liverpool. 'I'm quite relaxed on it. It's part of the modern game. Raheem still has a lot of improvements to make. This is great place for him.' And the subject is raised straight away, with Rodgers saying: 'The focus is purely on his football. That's my only concentration. He is at a place where he's made giant strides over the last few years. 'Raheem's ambition is to win trophies and that's perfectly aligned with what we're trying to do. This is one of the great clubs.' Brendan Rodgers has just arrived to begin his press briefing... Laurie Whitwell: A sign of Raheem Sterling’s tender years can be seen inked into his forearm. The image of Wembley, which overlooked his estate growing up, is clear amid a cluster of tattoos. Rather than those two famous towers, synonymous with the national stadium for 77 years, it is the arc, unveiled in 2007, that is unmistakable. Back then, Sterling was a young kid dreaming of a career in professional football, playing jumpers for goalposts on streets and in parks. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY .

"A serious knee injury may have cruelly ended Bojan Krkic's season in January but it hasn't stopped the Stoke striker keeping up-to-date with the Premier League. Scheduled to return to action in July, the former AC Milan and Roma forward has been keeping a close eye on England's top-flight as he recovers in Barcelona. Here, Bojan tells Sportsmail which players make his team of the season. Bojan Krkic, pictured celebrating a goal against Rochdale, has picked his Premier League team of the season . The Stoke striker  poses in his garden at his home in the Barcelona province of El Papiol . Bojan shows off the memorabilia he has collected during his career with Barcelona, AC Milan, Ajax and Roma . Bojan gives a thumbs up to the camera as he uses an anti-gravity treadmill which was developed by NASA . Sportsmail spent two days with Bojan in Barcelona as he recovers from the serious knee injury which ended his debut season with Stoke . GOALKEEPER: DAVID DE GEA . I nearly picked Fraser Forster. I have him on Fantasy Manager and he's won me a load of points! I was so sorry to hear about his injury. David de Gea is a great friend — I have known him since the early youth groups with Spain. He is enjoying one of the best seasons I have seen from a keeper. David de Gea makes a save from Swansea's Ki Sung-yueng during one of many excellent performances . RIGHT BACK: NATHANIEL CLYNE . Fast, direct and athletic. I like watching him go forward and he won't let you down defensively. He has been a major part of Southampton's excellent season. Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne (left) is now in the England squad after a fine season with Saints . CENTRE BACK: JOHN TERRY . It hasn't been a great season for centre backs but Terry is still a really tough opponent. When we played against Chelsea just before Christmas, I was impressed by the way Jose Mourinho organised his defence. He put Nemanja Matic and John Mikel Obi on me. It limited the space and made things difficult, plus they had that really strong defence behind. Mourinho is very intelligent in this way. Chelsea skipper John Terry has helped his side to the top of the Premier League table . CENTRE BACK: RYAN SHAWCROSS . He is a very strong defender and is a seriously tough opponent in training. He has a strong character. He has a great personality and is a real leader in the dressing room. He can play at a very high level. Ryan Shawcross, pictured scoring against Manchester United, has been a rock in Stoke's defence . LEFT BACK: BRANISLAV IVANOVIC . My dad is from Serbia and still keeps a close eye on their players. We both admire Ivanovic who has a habit of scoring big goals in big games. I know he plays mainly on the right but I want him in the team. Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic has chipped in with some vital goals for Jose Mourinho's side . RIGHT MIDFIELD: ALEXIS SANCHEZ . Unfortunately I never got the chance to play with Alexis at Barcelona. He has had a really impressive first season and will only get better. He possesses star quality. Alexis Sanchez has settled into life in the Premier League with ease after joining Arsenal last summer . CENTRE MIDFIELD: STEVEN NZONZI . A player I rate really highly. A brilliant midfielder in the modern game. Physically strong and tactically and technically sharp. He can control a midfield and conduct our performances. I love playing with him. Stoke midfielder Steven Nzonzi has impressed Bojan with his strong performances in central midfield . CENTRE MIDFIELD: SANTI CAZORLA . In Arsenal's 2-0 win against Manchester City, his was a wonderful performance. His movement is good, he can battle, and his passing is as good as anybody's. Spanish players here have a really strong relationship with supporters. You see Juan Mata and Ander Herrera at Manchester United, David Silva at City — the fans love them — and the Stoke fans have been so warm towards me. It is because we have the character of fighters and feel a responsibility to please supporters. Santi Cazorla, pictured scoring against Newcastle, has been an important cog in Arsenal's midfield . LEFT MIDFIELD: EDEN HAZARD . He is getting better and better. His dribbling is amazing and he is adding more goals to his game. A really special player. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard gets away from Burnley's Matt Taylor during his side's win at Turf Moor . CENTRE FORWARD: SERGIO AGUERO . The best out and out forward around. He's explosive, skilful, a great dribbler and has a powerful shot. Bojan believes Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is 'the best out and out forward around' CENTRE FORWARD: HARRY KANE . Diego Costa imposes his character on every game. His goalscoring record is great and Chelsea have improved with him. However, I didn't know too much about Harry Kane before this season but he has been amazing. He scores every week! It is great to see an English player doing so well and it has been one of the season's great stories.

As Mr Hiscox crossed the ball into the box, he was tackled by the defender and hit the floor. He then slid into the clubhouse, where his head which thrown backwards against the wall. Mr Bennett said Mr Hiscox was knocked unconscious for five minutes but managed to move himself away from the pitch. Four ambulances then rushed to the scene to take him to Southmead hospital, Bristol. In hospital, Mr Hiscox was given medication to sedate him and, by Monday, was showing signs of improvement. He was moved out of intensive care but died the next day. Mr Hiscox, who worked in insurance, leaves behind a partner and six-year-old step-daughter. 'Total legend': Mr Hiscox (pictured left and right with who is believed to be his partner), who worked in insurance, leaves behind a partner and six-year-old step-daughter .

Mr Bennett, 33, said: 'He was a big part of the club and the team here. 'He had been part of the club for a long time, since he was about 16. He was a total legend and one of the nicest guys I have ever met. 'Everyone that met him liked him. He was one of the nicest blokes you could know. No one had a bad word to say about him. 'He just got on with everyone. It is a sad day for the club and we're all thinking of him and his family.' Speaking about the incident, he added: 'He was running towards the byline and he went to cross the ball into the box.

'It was just a coming together. It was no different to any other tackle really. 'He was unconscious for about five minutes. When he came to he didn't know where he was. He was being sick and people were quite worried about him. 'He managed to get up and walk over to the sideline though. An ambulance arrived in about eight minutes - they drove on to the pitch to help him.' He added: 'No one thought it would have ended up like this.

'I've been in situations like this before - you think there isn't much to it. The game stopped for about half an hour. Some players wanted to carry on while others didn't. 'The defender in the tackle didn't play for the rest of the game. He was shaken up. The other club have been really good. They were calling and emailing to check that he was okay.' Tributes also came in from former club Bristol Manor Farm FC, where Mr Hiscox played between 2008 and 2010. Manor Farm's club secretary Andy Radford said: 'He was the life and soul of the party and a brilliant guy. 'He was not only a great goal scorer, but a great guy - if you were feeling down he would cheer you up. 'He is one of the players that you just don't forget; he was an absolute all-round great bloke. 'His infectious humour always brightened up your day and made you feel better. 'My condolences are with his family and friends.

Liverpool are infuriated by Sterling's decision to give the interview without even telling them and some members of the club's hierarchy are convinced that the England international and his representatives are simply preparing the way for a move this summer. 'It's not about the money at all,' Sterling said. 'It's never been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That's all I talk about. 'I don't talk about how many cars I'm going to drive, how many houses I've got. I just purely want to be the best I can be. 'I don't want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old. 'I try to kill it off, but I don't think the public can see it that way. 'I think they just see it as this 20-year-old boy being greedy.

'If, at that point in time [last season], I was offered a contract, I most definitely would have signed straight away, probably for far less money than being said now. 'I just think the timing was a bit off.' Sterling's stand-off with Liverpool has been a theme of the club's season so far. Liverpool fans will be desperate for him to stay but it would now appear that the gap between himself and his club is widening. Manager Brendan Rodgers is aware of Sterling's comments and will address them as part of his weekly press conference on Friday. It is understood that he will not allow the issue to cloud his judgement ahead of his selection for Saturday's game and that Sterling – if fit – will play at the Emirates. Equally, however, Liverpool's American owners will not allow themselves to be bullied over this issue and are prepared to stand firm – just as they did with Luis Suarez in 2013 – unless they receive an astronomical offer for a player they value in excess of £50m.

'Really, up until the Manchester United game we were the form team and playing very, very well.

Liverpool take on Blackburn in a replay of their FA Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, when talk about Sterling will no doubt still be dominating the headlines. Rodgers is only interested on what is happening with the forward on the field, though, and wants another impressive performance from the England international at Ewood Park. 'There was no change in him,' he said of Sterling. 'I thought he was excellent today, our best player. 'He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, won the penalty and was very direct and strong, so I thought he was excellent today.' Rodgers was peppered with questions about Sterling in the post-match press conference, during which he said 'a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him'. Sterling (top) did win the visitors' penalty after he was fouled by Bellering (bottom) in the second half . The Liverpool manager was coy when asked about outside influences destabilising both club and player, but was forthright when it came to the forward's future. 'At 20 years of age - and just turned 20 in December - there is still a long way for him to go,' said Rodgers, who confirmed Mario Balotelli deemed himself unfit to travel after receiving a knock in training. 'He has got a lot of potential. I believe that potential he can really develop over these next few years at Liverpool. 'Of course, it will be the job of, in particular, his advisors to look at maybe what possibilities might be beyond that. 'The only thing I will say is that he has two-and-a-half years left, he won't be going anywhere in the summer. That's for sure. 'They will sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer.' Liverpool boss Rodgers believes Sterling can fulfill his potential at Anfield over the next few years . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was also asked about Sterling in the post-match press conference, but preferred to focus on his side's fine display. Impressive goals from Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez in quick succession gave the hosts a comfortable half-time lead. Jordan Henderson's penalty reduced the deficit, but Olivier Giroud added extra gloss in this seventh straight league win after Emre Can saw red. 'You always have imperfections in any game but I feel we started with a great intensity, which is what we wanted to put them under pressure,' Wenger said . 'We created some early chances after and then when we relieved the pressure they had one or two chances. Liverpool are a good side going forwards and they always look dangerous. Emre Can (right) was sent off late in the second half for Liverpool to compound a miserable afternoon . 'We had a killing instinct and took advantage of our strong moments in the first half. 'In fairness we played at a good pace and had some good combination game in the final third. 'The second half was more down to, can we maintain the discipline, intensity and not allow them to come back early? We did that. 'We had many chances on the break that I've seen again but in the end it was 4-1 which is very convincing in a very important game.' Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was pleased with the 'killer instinct' his side showed against Liverpool .","Arsenal beat Liverpool 4-1 in their Premier League encounter on Saturday .

"Arsene Wenger has revealed he only makes the final decision on his starting line-up on the morning of the match - and agonises over the selection all week. The Arsenal manager, who has taken charge of 1,056 matches since his appointment in September 1996, has lifted the lid on his pre-match rituals in an interview with the official Arsenal Magazine. Wenger said: 'I always have eight or nine players of my team in my head the day before the game, but there's always a doubt on one or two. Arsene Wenger has revealed the selection process he uses to pick his Arsenal team . Wenger lifts the FA Cup following Arsenal's triumph over Hull City at Wembley last season . 'You try to make it as scientific as much as you can, but it's intuitive as well because you have to think if the balance of the team is right or if one player was a bit better in the last training session. 'When two players are together in your mind, competing for one position, every single detail can go for one of them - experience, confidence under pressure - everything can make a difference. 'I always have a final chat with the medical people to make my mind up and make sure that everybody is alright. I do that on the morning of every game. Then I make my decision.' But even though the Frenchman waits until the hours before the game to confirm his team, the overall selection process takes much longer. Wenger, drenched in champagne, is held aloft by his players after Arsenal's FA Cup win last season . Wenger said: 'Anyway, you always have your team in your head, for the whole week. You never go to bed without thinking about what the next line-up will be. 'You live with that always. That can create uncertainties, because you think about it every day. 'If you don't know on Friday night, you will not know on Saturday morning so you have to decide in your head early, and go for it.' Wenger's methods have delivered three Premier League titles and five FA Cups during his tenure at Arsenal.","Wenger has spoken about the process of selecting Arsenal teams .

"Richard Henyekane, a former South Africa striker, was killed in a car crash early Tuesday, his club and the country's Premier Soccer League have confirmed. Henyekane's club, Free State Stars, said the 31-year-old player was traveling with four other people in the vehicle but was the only person to die in the crash. Henyekane made nine appearances for South Africa in 2009. He was on loan at Free State Stars from Pretoria-based Mamelodi Sundowns. Henyekane went on as a substitute in Stars' 1-0 loss to AmaZulu in the east coast city of Durban in the PSL on Saturday. Richard Henyekane died tragically in a car accident on Tuesday morning while he driving in Bethlehem . South African media reported the crash happened in Bethlehem, the town in central South Africa where Free State Stars are based. Other South African clubs, South African Football Association President Danny Jordaan, and the minister of sport sent messages of condolence for Henyekane. Henyekane's younger brother, Joseph, who was also a footballer, died in December. South Africa has a poor road safety record.

"Darren Bent has revealed an Aston Villa return this summer could be on the cards and discussions have taken place. The former England striker, on loan at Derby County, also said Villa were ‘100 per cent’ correct to sack Paul Lambert. Bent, 31, praised Tim Sherwood, who he knows from Tottenham Hotspur, and opened the door on a shock continuation of his Villa Park career even after his contract expires in June. Darren Bent has scored seven goals on loan in the Championship with promotion-chasing Derby . Paul Lambert was sacked by Aston Villa in February after two-and-a-half seasons at the club . ‘There have been conversations with Villa regarding the future and I need to have a think about things in the summer,’ Bent told the Daily Telegraph. ‘I’m not ruling out going back, just like I wouldn’t rule out staying at Derby because they have given me a lifeline to play football and score goals again. We will have to look at it. ‘A club that size should not have had the seasons we’ve had for the last couple of seasons. I enjoyed the first few years but Paul Lambert came in and it all changed, it all went downhill for me from there. ‘He made those decisions but ultimately he’s not there any more and I think it was 100 per cent right, the best thing for the football club. Bent endured a frustrating time at Villa Park while Lambert was in charge as he was left on the sidelines . Tim Sherwood has inspired at mini-revival at Villa Park since taking over earlier this year . ‘I know Tim Sherwood from Tottenham, he’s an unbelievable motivator and it’s the perfect job for him.’ Bent, who has scored seven goals since going on loan to Derby, also praised Steve McClaren as one of the best managers he has played under. ‘He’s being linked with Sunderland and Newcastle and that shows you how good he is,’ Bent added. ‘Whether we get promoted or not, we’ll definitely be trying to hold on to him this summer. He’s up there with the best of them.’","Darren Bent currently on loan at Derby County from Aston Villa .

"Argentina beat Ecuador 2-1 to notch a second straight Copa America warm-up victory without Lionel Messi at a freezing MetLife stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday. Gerardo Martino's Argentina, with captain Messi looking on again while he nurses a right foot injury, had beaten El Salvador 2-0 in Washington on Saturday. They went in front after eight minutes on Tuesday when midfielder Javier Pastore glanced an Angel di Maria corner towards the far post where striker Sergio Aguero headed his 22nd international goal and first since Argentina beat Germany 4-2 in a friendly last September.

Pastore scored the winner in the 58th minute when an Ecuador clearance was blocked and he beat the offside trap to tap the ball under goalkeeper Alexander Dominguez. 'I thought this was a pretty good Argentina in general terms though we have a lot to work on with our coordination,' Martino told reporters. 'Messi is having trouble getting his boot on because of the pain, there's no way he could play.' The match, which began in a sleet storm and was played in temperatures barely above freezing, was Gustavo Quinteros's second in charge of Ecuador while defender Ayovi won his 100th cap.

"Danny Lennon's interim appointment as Scotland Under 21 coach officially ended as reports claim he will be named as Alloa Athletic boss on Tuesday. The former St Mirren boss has reportedly agreed a deal to take charge of the Scottish Championship side until the summer of 2016. Paddy Connolly has been in temporary charge of the Wasps since Barry Smith resigned on March 7. Danny Lennon has left his role as interim Scotland Under 21 manager . Lennon, who left the Buddies in May 2014, took charge of the Scotland Under 21 side for a 2-1 friendly victory against Hungary last month. The Scottish FA issued a statement which read: 'The Scottish FA can confirm that Danny Lennon's interim appointment as Scotland Under 21 coach has now come to an end. 'Danny leaves with the association's best wishes after dedicating himself to the stewardship of the team for the 2-1 victory against Hungary in Tatabanya last month.' Stewart Regan, Scottish FA chief executive added: 'I would like to thank Danny for the professionalism and enthusiasm with which he took charge of the Under 21 squad. 'While Danny was aware of the short-term nature of the job, his preparation for the match was meticulous and he was rewarded with a victory that he will savour for years to come. The former St Mirren manager looks set to take over at Scottish Championship club Alloa Athletic . 'I know he thrives on the day-to-day involvement of club management and I am certain he will be a success in his next challenge. On behalf of the Scottish FA I wish Danny the best of luck for the future.' Lennon said: 'I knew from the outset this was an interim appointment but it was an honour and pleasure to serve my country at international level. 'I put everything into making sure the under-21s got a positive result and I would like to thank the players and coaching staff for ensuring a great performance and a win, one I will treasure for the rest of my career. 'I would like to thank Stewart Regan and everyone at the Scottish FA and would welcome the opportunity to work with them again in the future.'

"JB Holmes took victory in a play-off at the Shell Houston Open when Johnson Wagner saw a four-foot putt lip out. Holmes, who started the day six shots off the lead but ripped through the first half of the course to make the turn in 29, had moments before missed from 10 foot but 2008 winner Wagner could not save par to take the play-off to a third hole. Overnight leader Jordan Spieth, who hit a fine putt to par the 18th and make it a three-way play-off, had been eliminated on the first hole. J B Holmes poses with the Houston Open trophy after a thrilling climax saw him take the title . Holmes bumps fists with his caddie to celebrate winning the Houston Open after two play-off holes . Johnson Wagner watches his putt go by the hole on the second play-off, handing the title to Holmes . Spieth's one-shot overnight lead evaporated almost before he had time to warm up on the course thanks to Holmes' blistering start. Six birdies on the first seven holes saw Holmes tear into an outright lead as Spieth was easing into proceedings with his second par in as many holes. Holmes picked up a further shot on the eighth on his way to finishing the front nine on a seven-under 29 to tie the nine-hole course record with Fred Couples. The 32-year-old had a less prolific back nine, but he still picked up two further birdies, with a bogey on the 16th his only blot on a fine day's golf. He returned to the clubhouse with a two-shot lead having carded 64, but back-to-back birdies on 13 and 14 saw Spieth join Holmes on 16 under overall with four holes remaining. Holmes began the day six shots off the lead but stormed up the leaderboard with a brilliant start . Overnight leader Jordan Spieth saw his advantage go before he was on the course, but made a play-off . The 21-year-old, who could have gone second in the world rankings with victory in Houston, just missed taxing birdie shots on 16 and 17 to take it all down to his final hole. And just after his tee shot narrowly avoided the bunker, Wagner dramatically birdied the par-four 18th with a 25ft putt to card a 69 and create a three-way tie at the top of the leaderboard. Spieth still had the chance to win it outright but found a bunker, and he needed a fine 42ft chip and then a 12ft putt to rescue par and join the play-off. Once it began, things quickly went south for the Texan. He found the greenside bunker with his second shot, and then made a poor shot out from a difficult lie, claiming something had distracted him during his backswing. He would be eliminated with a bogey. Wagner had also run into trouble with his second shot but salvaged a par, and when Holmes missed from 10ft they headed back to the tee to try again. Spieth was the first to drop out in the play-offs, after bogeying the first hole to fall out of contention . Johnson Wagner celebrates his birdie at the eighteenth, to earn a place in the play-off, but he fell just short . Neither man had dramas on the way to the green this time but Holmes got much closer to the hole with his second approach shot, and after Wagner over-hit a long putt Holmes again had the chance to win it from 10ft. His putt drifted a couple of inches wide but Wagner's putt from four feet lipped out and Holmes could celebrate. 'I knew I had to play a really low round to have a chance, but I started out great and it worked out for me,' Holmes said on Sky Sports 4 before turning his attention to next week's Masters. 'It's great any time you get a week where you can win going into a major. I went there Monday and Tuesday and saw the course so hopefully I'm ready. I'm hitting it well, and looking forward to it.'","Johnson Wagner loses out to JB Holmes after second playoff hole .

"An unknown Englishman playing in his first PGA Tour event will have the chance to complete an unbelievable fairytale at the Shell Houston Open on Sunday and earn the most unlikely invitation to the Masters. Surrey-born Kelvin Day has only played a handful of events on the subsidiary circuit, the Web.com Tour but decided to enter qualifying for the Houston event. This is a real 36 hole lottery where 131 players were fighting for the final four spots. With two excellent rounds of 64, the 27-year-old finished tied first to earn his place – and how he has taken advantage. It was a decent achievement in itself to make the halfway cut, and it earned him a third round draw alongside two rather more famous Englishmen in Paul Casey and Justin Rose. Kelvin Day is three shots behind the leaders and remains in with a chance of making the Masters . Day, however, refused to be overawed as he put together a tidy, bogey-free scorecard to match the 68 shot by Casey and upstage Rose, who shot 72. Incredibly, that has left Day alongside Casey in tied sixth place, just three shots off the lead held, almost inevitably, by the remarkably consistent young American, Jordan Spieth. Realistically, a top ten finish would be a fine achievement for Day, which would earn him a place in the field for the tournament after the Masters, the Heritage in South Carolina. But it is worth bearing in mind that a victory would not only earn him a PGA Tour card but the last spot in the field for Augusta. Wouldn’t that be some story? Casey only learned he was in the field for the Masters himself last Sunday, and is continuing his welcome revival this season with another good showing. He is a former winner of this event and again showed his liking for the course. Record crowds descended on the Houston suburb of Humble to watch the great crowd pleaser Phil Mickelson, who began one off the halfway lead and the newest Texan golfing hero, Spieth. Jordan Spieth leads the way in Houston . But while the latter delivered with a 67 to lead the way on 14 under, Mickelson could only muster a 75 to tumble down the leaderboard. It’s amazing to think it’s only 18 months since Spieth was attracting heavy criticism for dropping out of college to take his place on the PGA Tour as the 809th ranked player in the world. While his former university classmates are studying hard for their final exams, 21 year old Spieth might be said to have passed his own particular exam with flying colours, since he has risen to fourth in the world and will go second behind Rory McIlroy should he claim this title on Sunday. He would also take his earnings over those 18 months to almost $12 million. Funnily enough, he’s not attracting criticism anymore. Spieth, watched by his parents and younger sister Ellie, hass a one stroke advantage over a trio of lesser-known countrymen – Scott Piercy, former Houston champion Jason Wagner and Austin Cook. ‘I’ve got a lot of friends as well as my family in the gallery and I shall certainly be trying to win for them on Sunday,’ said Spieth. If he did that it would be his fourth victory in his last nine starts and underline his status as one of the favourites to win the green jacket. Spieth finished runner-up behind Bubba Watson on his Masters debut last year. Like Day, 24 year old Cook is trying to write an astonishing story of his own. He just happens to be the Monday qualifier who tied Day for first place. As for Mickelson, his poor form over the past few months caught up with him on Saturday after opening rounds of 66 and 67 had raised hopes he was close to his best. The 44 year old fell apart over the closing stretch, registering four bogeys in his last five holes.","Kelvin Day, from Surrey, has played a handful of events on Web.com Tour .

"As if the news that Tiger Woods will be back at the Masters next week was not encouraging enough for American golf, the sight of a resurgent Phil Mickelson at the Shell Houston Open provided added lustre. The gifted leftie followed his opening 66 with a 67 to sit one shot behind leader Andrew Putnam going into the third round. While Woods electrified the twittersphere with his announcement, his great rival thrilled the massive number of fans on the ground with a display that recalled all his great days. Another to enjoy a good day was Englishman Justin Rose, who provided further encouraging evidence he is now over his bleak March with a 68 that has left him just four shots off the pace and in contention going into the weekend. Phil Mickelson capped his resurgence in form at the Houston Open with rounds of 66 or 67 . Mickelson is one shot behind going into the third round with The Masters a week away . Tiger Woods confirmed his participation at The Masters at Augusta next week . As for Woods, the news he will end his self-imposed exile next week was enthusiastically welcomed here in Texas. Padraig Harrington had only to be told Woods had played a practice round at Augusta National on Friday before pre-empting the official announcement. ‘If Tiger is fit and healthy there’s absolutely no way he will be sitting out the Masters,’ said Harrington. ‘It will be great to see him back. Just by being there he will add to the intrigue and the fascination.’ Woods fuelled speculation he would return when he flew by private jet from Florida to play a practice round last Tuesday. He reportedly shot 74 with the dreaded chipping yips making an unwelcome return with a thinned shot across one green that finished in a bunker. It was those problems that caused him to take a break from the game in the first place. Back in late January he skulled a number of chips in a horrific 82 at the Waste Management Open, his worst score as a pro. Woods said he wouldn’t return until he was satisfied he could compete. Justin Rose continued his upturn in form with an encouraging round of 68 . Mickelson has struggled for form this year and carded an 82 at the Waste Management Open . Woods reportedly shot a round of 74 in practice at Augusta on Tuesday and had a return of the chipping yips . There will be considerable scepticism he can compete next week given it’s over a year now since he turned in a decent tournament. Woods missed the Masters last year owing to back surgery. As for Harrington, his welcome revival continued after a second round 69 that took him to five under but Lee Westwood’s tournament is over.

"Until a few days ago, the closest Danny Willett could come to playing Augusta National was on a simulator at Doncaster Golf Range, where he also gained his first experience of Doral before last month's WGC-Cadillac Championship. And considering the 27-year-old Yorkshireman finished joint 12th following a closing round of 68 on the Blue Monster, perhaps it is not too fanciful to suggest Willett could become the first Masters debutant to slip on the green jacket since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979. 'I've always said if you're not going to go to an event and be fully prepared to try to win, there is no point going,' Willett said. Danny Willett is aiming to become the first debutant to win The Masters since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979 . Willett insists he is preparing to emerge victorious in the first Major of 2015 . Fuzzy Zoeller won on his Augusta debut in 1979 and Willett is looking to emulate his achievements . 'You don't pitch up to try to finish 15th, 30th or just try to make the cut; you try to go and win regardless of the field or whatever. If you can't do that I don't know what your own long-term goal is. I have my own idea of where I want to be and it's not finishing mid-pack.' A certain Rory McIlroy might have something to say about such lofty ambitions next week, but Willett is very well aware of what the world number one is capable of from their amateur days. The pair met in the first round of the Amateur Championship in 2007 and it was Willett who was five up after six holes before eventually sealing victory on the 17th. Later that year they were on the same team in the Walker Cup as Great Britain and Ireland lost out at Royal County Down to an American team featuring Rickie Fowler, Billy Horschel, Dustin Johnson and Webb Simpson. 'That was a long time ago now, both of our games have changed since then so hopefully we can be on the same team in Ryder Cups and I can beat him a few more times,' Willett added. 'I think I was the last person to beat him as an amateur before he turned pro. He's a very difficult person to beat right now on a golf course. It's pretty phenomenal golf he's playing. 'If you finish one place in front of Rory in most events you're going to do all right. He's going to be the man to beat around Augusta. If he doesn't win it this year I'm sure it's only a matter of time before he does.' Willett swapped the simulator for the real thing before heading to Texas to play in the Shell Houston Open and was understandably excited by the prospect. 'Gym time before typing magnolia lane into the sat nav!!! Boom!!' was one post on Twitter, followed afterwards by: 'Well that first experience at Augusta can only be described as awesome!!' The two-time European Tour winner added: 'The first one is always special. I remember the first Open that I played and there is a different feel about majors. I think the Masters is going to feel more different still. 'Obviously the Open is close to your heart as your home major but the Masters always has that air of being just a little bit special. I'm going to try and treat it as a normal week in terms of I'm going there to try and compete with all the guys I have played against for the last six years, try not to make it too much of an ordeal but at the same time appreciate what you've achieved to get there and actually enjoy it.' To that end Willett and his friends and family will be renting two houses in Augusta for the week, while his wife Nicole will be carrying his bag in the traditional par-three contest on Wednesday. 'My wife was born on the Sunday that Sandy Lyle won (in 1988) so that could be an omen,' Willett joked. Before the fun of the par-three contest Willett will look to pick the brains of the likes of stablemate Lee Westwood in practice, the former world number one having finished in the top 10 in each of the last three years and second in 2010.

But he will also take plenty of confidence from his victory in the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa last December, when he finished with rounds of 65 and 66 to overturn a five-shot deficit to another former world number one in Luke Donald. 'The win there is more for your own inward confidence that regardless of where you are, you can draw on experiences where you were really under pressure and had to hit a certain golf shot and that week I stood up and did it almost every time,' said Willett, who remains top of the Race to Dubai ahead of McIlroy. 'I played fantastic, especially on Sunday. We played very aggressive like we did all week, didn't change the game plan and kept smashing it with driver off the tee to get shorter irons in and that made it difficult when we got in front for people to catch us.'","27-year-old Danny Willett will make his debut at The Masters next week .

"Michael Carrick's outstanding second-half performance for England against Italy on Tuesday night has put him on course to become the longest-serving outfield player to represent the Three Lions behind Sir Stanley Matthews. Carrick made his England debut against Mexico in May 2001 as a teenager with West Ham United and if – as now seems likely – he carries through to Euro 2016, he will be the first non-goalkeeper since the legendary Sir Stanley to have an international career spanning more than 15 years. Matthews won his 54 England caps over a 23-year period between 1934 and 1957, interrupted of course by the Second World War. Michael Carrick's appearance for England against Italy on Tuesday night keeps him in the longest-serving list . Carrick has played for England for 13 years, 310 days - while Sir Stanley Matthews reached 22 years, 228 days . Sir Stanley runs with the ball in action for England against Brazil at Wembley in an international friendly . Stanley Matthews (1934-57) 22 yrs, 228 days . Peter Shilton (1970-90) 19 yrs, 224 days . Frank Lampard (1999-2014) 14 yrs, 257 days . Steven Gerrard (2000-2014) 14 yrs, 23 days . David Seaman (1988-2002) 13 yrs, 335 days . Michael Carrick (2001- ) 13 yrs, 310 days . ...AND THE LEGENDS HE OVERTOOK . David Beckham (1996-2009) – 13 yrs, 43 days . Sir Bobby Charlton (1958-70) 12 yrs, 23 days . Bobby Moore (1962-73) 11 yrs, 178 days . Gary Lineker (1984-1992) 8 yrs, 22 days . Carrick was hailed by Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney as 'the best player on the pitch by a mile' after the 33-year-old was introduced as a half-time substitute in Turin and helped Roy Hodgson's men fight back to earn a 1-1 draw. His longevity already surpasses that of great names like Sir Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore, David Beckham and Gary Lineker and if he continues to play in the next European Championship he will overtake Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard too. The only player to have had a longer career since Matthews is goalkeeper Peter Shilton who played for England between 1971 and 1990. It also begs the question why Carrick, who has won four Premier League titles and the Champions League with Manchester United, has been used so sparingly by his country at international tournaments. He played once at the 2006 World Cup in a 1-0 victory against Ecuador, was in the squad but never played by Fabio Capello in the disastrous 2010 campaign in South Africa, and wasn't even selected by Roy Hodgson last year in Brazil, even though England's perennial problem has been keeping the ball. With Rooney now captain and clearly a huge fan of the midfielder, it seems unlikely Carrick will be overlooked again and is now finally getting the recognition he deserves. The 33-year-old may still have a few years left but remains a long way off Sir Stanley's record .

"Steve Bruce has promised his wife Janet he will go on a diet after unflattering paparazzi pictures of him on a Barbados beach were publicised. The Hull manager says he was 'disappointed' that the pictures were published and that he was baffled that anyone would be interested. Steve Bruce was looking larger than life after being snapped holidaying in Barbados with Alan Shearer . Bruce has promised his wife Janet he will slim down after seeing the unflattering snaps . Bruce was baffled that anyone would be interested in pictures of a 55-year-old on a beach . 'I don't think too many 55-year-olds look that good on a beach do they,' he said, 'but I have promised my good lady I will go on a diet. 'So watch out - I'm going to turn into the horriblest, most awkward b******d you have ever come across. 'I have had some letters saying it's nice to see someone relaxing in their own skin - not many mind!' Bruce also had an appetite for the debate about how Premier League clubs should do more to bring through English talent. FA chairman Greg Dyke recently outlined new proposals, including increasing the number on homegrown players in a squad of 25 to 12, in effort to improve the national team. And Bruce agreed with Dyke, before going on to question how his former club Manchester United, along wide Liverpool and Manchester City, recruit players. Bruce fells his former club Manchester United should do more to produce young English players . He said: 'It is a great debate. We have the Premier League which is a wonderful spectacle but we have to find a way to produce young players and we have one or two, but we would like a lot more. 'One thing that is staggering over the last 20 years is that we have invested millions in academies but are we producing enough players? 'When you look back, where are they? It is a hell of a debate. For me personally, we miss children playing football at school. 'If you are going to do a job properly, you have to look at the football club as a whole and see if we can produce a younger player.'","Steve Bruce has promised wife Janet to go on a diet and lose some weight .

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs . Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise) Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call . Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters . A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write.

"Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned Theo Walcott’s confidence is plummeting after his struggles with England this week. The Arsenal manager will have a heart-to-heart chat with the forward ahead of Saturday’s crunch top-four clash against Liverpool. Walcott was hauled off after 55 minutes of England’s 1-1 draw in Italy on Tuesday night. Theo Walcott struggled for England and Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned by the winger's confidence . Walcott was replaced by Ross Barkley after just 55 minutes of England's 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday . 2 - Premier League goals for Walcott this season - his average haul per season during his time at Arsenal is 5.6. It was the latest disappointment in a difficult season for the 26-year-old, who has struggled for game time since returning from a long-term lay-off due to a serious knee injury. With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain out of Liverpool’s visit due to a hamstring strain, and Danny Welbeck a major doubt after sustaining a knee problem on international duty, Walcott could start on Saturday. But Wenger said: ‘Yes, I’m worried about Theo’s confidence. He’s sensitive and I’m a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. Walcott could face Liverpool on Saturday with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain injured and Danny Welbeck a doubt . ‘He’s not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. ‘At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal. I will speak with him, but I think he is strong enough. ‘I will see what state of mind he is in. We always have a word, if it is a positive experience or a negative experience, you ask “how did it go?”. We always speak about the last game. ‘He is not fragile mentally, he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready. ‘He needs patience. He is at the moment not in his best mood. ‘He has big confidence in himself and he has gone through some difficult periods in his life and he has always come out with strength.’ Arsenal boss Wenger says he will speak with Walcott but believes the Gunners winger is 'strong enough' Walcott found himself playing in the No 10 role for England in Turin — a role he is not accustomed to. And Wenger admitted he was surprised to see the pacy forward in such an unfamiliar position. ‘Have I ever seen him play No 10 in training or anything? No,’ said Wenger. ‘Theo’s strength is the quality of his movements, he wants to go to get on the end of things. He’s not a guy who provides. ‘I don’t think it was the intention of Roy Hodgson to play him there. It’s maybe because Wayne Rooney took the initiative during the game to play higher up and tell Theo to drop back. ‘I didn’t see Roy Hodgson in the game stand up to say “Walcott, you come and play in midfield and Rooney you go up front”. That’s an initiative they took on the pitch.’ Walcott aims a shot at goal during England's friendly against Italy at the Juventus Stadium in Turin . Walcott was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments . Meanwhile, Wenger insists there are fundamental flaws in FA chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to increase the number of required homegrown players in Premier League squads to 12. Dyke believes increasing the number of British players in squads will help contribute to a more successful England team. But Wenger said: ‘I believe we are in a top level competition and you earn your right through the quality of your performance rather than your place of birth. ‘Secondly, I’m happy to, and would like to contribute to the quality of the English national team, but you have two questions you can raise before that. ‘First of all between 1966 and 1996 there were no foreign players in England and it didn’t improve too much the performances of the national team. ‘Secondly, if between the ages of 16 and 21 the England youth teams win every single competition in Europe then there is something we have to do because they are not getting their chance at the top level. Wenger believes there are flaws in FA Chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to increase the homegrown quota . ‘That is not the case, on the contrary. I think between 16 and 21 the English youth teams, until now, have not performed. So that’s the heart of the problem. ‘Let’s get better at that level, then if there is a problem integrating these players in the top teams, we have to do something about it. ‘I think today you have to be very brave to integrate young players in the top teams because the pressure is very high. I still believe when they are good enough, they play. ‘You speak about Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Nobody stops the quality, no matter where they are from. So let’s focus on that first.’","Arsene Wenger will have chat with Theo Walcott ahead of Arsenal clash .

"Chelsea are poised to join the heavyweight battle for English football’s hottest property Raheem Sterling. Chelsea have made discreet overtures about Sterling, despite Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insisting on Thursday that his 20-year-old striker is going nowhere this summer. Sterling stunned Liverpool earlier this week by giving an interview in which he claimed he is not motivated by money in stalling over a £100,000-a-week contract and admitting he is ‘quite flattered’ by interest from Arsenal. It has led to suspicions that Sterling, who was raised in London and came through the youth system at QPR, is agitating for a return to the capital. Premier League leaders Chelsea are poised to join the battle for Liverpool wideman Raheem Sterling . However, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists the 20-year-old star is 'going nowhere' this summer . Sterling has claimed he is not motivated by money in stalling over a £100,000-a-week contract . Now Chelsea want to be kept informed about the forward’s future as they join the hunt with Arsenal and Manchester City. But Rodgers said: ‘He’s got two-and-a-half years to go on his deal and he’s not going anywhere in the summer. I cannot speak for the owners but I have a good idea of what they would do. I know them well enough and for me it would not happen. Liverpool are one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money doesn’t come into it. If the club doesn’t want to sell, it won’t sell, it’s as simple as that. Money has never been the objective for the club. ‘Whatever player — Raheem or anybody — it would always be on the terms of the club. ‘He still has two-and-a- bit years left of his deal so it’s not something we’re overly concerned about. I’m confident that at the end of the season we’ll find the solution.’ Sterling shares a joke with Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge during Liverpool's training session on Thursday . City and Chelsea have the money to lure Sterling should he be allowed to leave Anfield. Sportsmail understands Arsenal’s interest is also serious. Doubts over Arsenal’s ability to fund a move for Sterling have seen their interest questioned, but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him. In addition to the English trio, Sterling is also attracting interest from Europe — with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich monitoring developments. However, Rodgers reminded Sterling that it was Liverpool who made him the player he is today, saying he should be ‘honoured’ to represent the club. He refused to say whether the player will face disciplinary action after admitting the club had been caught off guard by the interview. Rodgers reminded England international Sterling it is Liverpool who have made him the player he is today . ‘There was no permission by the club, it was something that surprised us all,’ added Rodgers. ‘It’s part of the modern game. People who look after players and represent them have different ways of working. I’ve seen that over the years. ‘The last time we sat down it was the intention of the player and his representatives, and also the club, to put (contract talks) on hold. Obviously, Raheem has come out and made his feelings clear on that and hopefully now the focus will be on the football. ‘He’s a young player who is still learning and developing on and off the field. Sometimes you make mistakes as a youngster. ‘Our relationship is strong, which is important. He knows I’m working in the best interests of the club and for him.’","Chelsea are poised to join Arsenal  in the hunt for Raheem Sterling .

The sandy-colored canine was found sprawled in a pool of his own blood on a rural road in Cass County, North Dakota.

"Those who achieve greatness are high achievers from an early stage. They know this better than most at Anfield. Take Michael Owen. By the time he was 20 in December 1999, his list of accomplishments read like the wish-list of many footballers. He had been named PFA Young Player of the Year (1998), scored one of the greatest World Cup finals goals and won BBC Sports Personality of the Year. There were also 18 England caps and he had passed 50 career goals for Liverpool. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training on Thursday, has rejected a new contract worth £100,000-a-week . Sterling trains with his Liverpool team-mates at Melwood as the Reds prepare to face Arsenal on Saturday . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (right) insists that Sterling will not be sold in the summer transfer window . Then there is Robbie Fowler. Another PFA Young Player of the Year award winner (1995), he had entered the record books by scoring the fastest hat-trick in the Barclays Premier League on his way to 50 goals by his 20th birthday and won his first major honour (the 1995 League Cup). Others had similar impacts. Steve McManaman ended his first season as a Liverpool regular with a Man-of-the-Match performance in the 1992 FA Cup final win over Sunderland. Steven Gerrard's first year out of his teens saw him collect the League Cup, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup. That is the barometer by which those on The Kop judge prodigies. So let us now look at the CV of Raheem Sterling, who was 20 on December 8 last year. It currently reads: Liverpool Young Player of the Year 2013-2014 and Europe's Golden Boy 2014. There are also 14 England caps and one goal. Steven Gerrard had won three trophies in the first year out of his teens including the FA Cup and UEFA Cup . Michael Owen scored this memorable goal against Argentina at the 1998 World Cup when he was just 18 . Owen had been named BBC Sports Personality of the Year and scored over 50 goals when he hit 20 . Steve McManaman lifts the FA Cup in 1992 after helping Liverpool defeat Sunderland at Wembley . Robbie Fowler was PFA Young Player of the Year in 1995 and scored the Premier League's fastest hat-trick . Good? Yes. Great? No. Just 18 months ago he couldn't even get a start for Liverpool. This should not come across as an attempt to belittle Sterling's talents — he is undeniably exciting — but he has become embroiled in a storm that has made him out to be on par with the four men named above. His comments in that ridiculously misguided BBC interview about wanting to challenge for trophies in his career and playing with the best players evoked memories of the Luis Suarez affair. He is absolutely not in the same sphere as the Uruguayan. 'That was probably Raheem looking over the course of the next 15 years if he plays to 35,' Brendan Rodgers observed on Thursday. 'Players now look to later in their career and their life. But I can only focus on here, Liverpool and what is best for now. As a 20-year-old, he's not at that level. 'We think that it will be best for him here and we will work hard to ensure he stays.' Sterling receives Europe's Golden Boy award ahead of a game against Arsenal in December last year . Sterling was named Liverpool's Young Player of the Year for 2013-14 but he is miles behind Luis Suarez . Sterling's first and only England goal arrived against Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier last Friday . Liverpool shouldn't have to work hard to keep Sterling. His advisors have every right to look to maximise their client's earnings but, somewhere and somehow, they have lost sight of the bigger picture and a series of dreadful judgements have been made. The first signs that all was not well came on October 3 when Sportsmail ran a back page story with the headline 'Kop fight to keep Sterling'. That the story came after Sterling had been anonymous in a 1-0 Champions League defeat in Basle didn't do him any favours. There have been a raft of similar stories, a lot of which have either coincided with games that have gone against Liverpool — such as when their fate in the Champions League was condemned in December — or ones in which he has played well, England against Lithuania being a prime example. Sterling, pictured in action against Chelsea, has only scored six Premier League goals so far this season . Sterling is expected to start for Liverpool when they take on Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday . The former QPR youngster is wanted by clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich . As he looks to steer Liverpool into the Champions League and win the FA Cup, Rodgers could do without this sideshow unfolding and so, more than anyone, could Sterling. If he wants to get to the level of Owen, Fowler or Gerrard, he needs to influence the games that matter. He has been regularly championed for his strength, pace and trickery after being given a platform on which to thrive by Rodgers. Deep down, Sterling will know what his manager has done for him. Now is the time to pay him back — and show potential, perhaps, can become something more substantial.","Raheem Sterling has rejected a new contract worth £100,000-a-week .

The porn star wrote in text messages to the victim in February: 'I'm just going to bite hard. I want a new car,motorcycle and both hands full of cash.' 'I do have a twitter and your photos. Lies can be made or maybe it's the truth.' He went on: 'Check my twitter, the conversation will grown [sic] and questions will be asked. You lied to me and treated me like s***. I asked again and you put it behind you. Now it's biting your a**' D.B's attorneys contacted the FBI and Brank was arrested in a sting operation after the two men met up in a coffee shop where the porn star had made demands to be given cash and the title for an Audi R8 worth $180,000. Brank was found in possession of a revolver on his arrest. Brank was scheduled to appear in court on Thursday for a bail review hearing. He was previously denied bail as the judge deemed him a flight risk. Brank's attorneys appealed the decision. The porn star's public defenders also asked that the name of his victim be revealed arguing that D.B allegedly paid Brank for sex. A trial has been scheduled for May 12.

"Homesick Sam Tomkins insists it is not a foregone conclusion that he will return to Wigan when he cuts short his New Zealand Warriors stay at the end of the season. The 26-year-old England full-back is interesting his former club, where his brother Joel plays, and Wigan have an option to bring him back to the DW Stadium. When announcing his departure barely 18 months ago, Wigan announced they could re-sign Tomkins on a 'defined salary' on his return to Super League. Sam Tomkins has been released by the New Zealand Warriors after feeling homesick . And while Tomkins says it would 'be nice' to resume his Wigan career, he is tentatively exploring alternative options too. Asked where he would be playing next, Tomkins said: 'I've not worked that out just yet. The first thing was to sort it out over here that I could go back. 'Hopefully that'll be sorted in the not-too-distant future.' Wigan is where Tomkins launched his career, playing for the club from 2008 to 2013, so it is inevitable he should be linked with last season's Grand Final runners-up. 'That's where my brother's playing and that's where I'm from, but I'm open to other places. I'm just trying to work out what will be the best option for me,' he said. 'Wigan would be nice but I know it's not the only team I can go to.' Before the announcement on Wednesday morning that Tomkins will be on the move, Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan told Wigan Today: 'If he became available we would be very interested. 'We've got the first option. If it gets to the point where he is available it is in our hands. And I'll be delighted if that was the case.' Tomkins has been open with his current club about the reasons for wanting to leave. Rather than not settling into the New Zealand game, it is being apart from his family and friends that has been niggling away at Tomkins, unsettling him and leaving him longing for life back in the north of England. He told Sky Sports News: 'I've enjoyed every minute of being amongst that group but New Zealand is pretty far from Wigan, where all my family live, so I want to be back in England around my family. Tomkins celebrates winning the Super League Grand Final with Wigan in 2013 having spent five years with club . 'I'll be two years I've been away and to be able to go back and be around family and friends is what I'd rather be doing next year.' A replacement for Tomkins has already been found by New Zealand Warriors, with Kiwi international Roger Tuivasa-Sheck agreeing a three-year contract that will take effect from next season. Tuivasa-Sheck will join from Sydney Roosters, with New Zealand Warriors head coach Andrew McFadden describing the 21-year-old on Wednesday as 'a wonderful talent and a fantastic signing'. That has cleared the way for Tomkins, currently sidelined with a minor knee injury, to depart without causing excessive disruption 12 months before the end of his three-year contract. Tomkins joined the Warriors for a world record transfer fee - thought to be in the region of £700,000. 'They invested a lot into me to get me over here which I appreciate,' he said. 'They handled that brilliantly when I was coming and again equally so when I've asked if I can leave. 'It was tough because I feel like I owe them something and hope I can pay them back with another big year this year.' New Zealand Warriors managing director Jim Doyle said of Tomkins: 'He came here excited about testing himself in the NRL and also experiencing living in a new country but, in the end, Sam has found it too much of a challenge being away from home. 'It's disappointing that it has come to this but reluctantly we have accepted there is no option but to allow Sam to return to England.'

"Neil Phillips, the team doctor for England's victorious 1966 World Cup campaign, has died at the age of 83. Manager Sir Alf Ramsey promoted Phillips from his role as Under-23 team doctor just before the '66 World Cup as seniors doctor Alan Bass had run out of holiday and could not join up with the squad for their preparation camp in Lilleshall. Phillips, who was born in Tredegar in south Wales, was England's team doctor for the defence of the Jules Rimet trophy four years later in Mexico and left the FA in 1974 following Ramsey's departure. Dr Neil Phillips (right), pictured with Sir Alf Ramsey (centre) was England's doctor at the 1966 World Cup . Phillips was a former director at Middlesbrough and also used to have a surgery in Redcar.

"The cell phone ban at the Augusta National Golf Club has forced fans to dust off their often unloved and rarely used old cameras if they want to capture a photo of their heroes. Barred from bringing their cell phones on to the Georgia course, fans have adapted by going back to the future and using their pocket-sized digital cameras or their old 35mm bodies and lenses and re-learning how to use them. But a quick refresher course is all they're allowed. When play begins on Thursday, fans will have to put them back on the shelves. A Masters patron uses her camera to take photos of the action during the player practice rounds ahead of the 2015 Masters at Augusta National Golf Course in Augusta, Georgia, which starts on Thursday . 'Actually, the last time I had this out was Easter,' Wayne Watson said about the large black Nikon hanging around his neck. And the time before that? 'No idea,' he said. 'Probably the Easter before.' More than a few of the fans lugging around similar equipment were, like Watson — who made the two-hour drive from Macon — experiencing Augusta National in person for the first time. Most just planned to mosey around until something caught their fancy. Some had general targets in mind — a favorite player or two, the trio of back-nine holes reverentially dubbed 'Amen Corner,' or the gigantic manual scoreboard alongside the first fairway. Then there was the occasional experienced big-game hunter, decked out with camera bags and an array of lenses. 'I'm after Phil Mickelson,' said Kim McNeeley of nearby Aiken, South Carolina. 'I got a great shot of him the last time I was here — 18 years ago. 'But there are plenty of guys more serious than I am,' she added. The cell phone ban at the Augusta National Golf Club has forced fans to dust off their often unloved and rarely used old cameras if they want to capture a photo of their heroes like Tiger Woods . 'I had to borrow this from a friend who just had a baby. A few minutes ago, I saw a guy actually loading film into his camera. Film. Now that's old school.' Stepping back in time produced more than a few comical moments. Parked in lawn chairs behind the first tee, two pals leaned in close as one tried to figure out how to take a 'selfie' with a point-and-shoot camera — never mind that the term hadn't even been coined when the camera was originally manufactured. Behind the seventh tee, Kevin Davis of Gibson City, Illinois, recounted the preparations he went through to make sure his 4-year-old digital camera was ready to roll. First, he had to find it — 'It took me awhile to remember where I left it,' he said, finally remembering it was in a desk drawer — and then make sure it was charged. 'I've got a big camera, but I didn't want to lug that around,' Davis added. 'That's usually for family events.' Fans photograph Tiger Woods on their cell phones during a practice round for the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone Country Club South Course in Akron, Ohio, last July . But he might have had second thoughts when his twin 5-year-olds saw the camera and realized it wasn't a phone. 'They were scratching their heads,' he recalled. 'They said, 'Daddy, why is it so big?'' The fact that so many wound up opting for the big camera likely had to do with the number of serious hobbyists. While many planned to share their photos with friends on social media, a few planned to commemorate the trip with a photo album — talk about old-school — and in the case of Wes Rackley, make quality 8x10 framed prints and give them as presents. Few people, though, seemed as comfortable carrying around all the serious gear as Brett Pavel of Atlanta. He was at Augusta National for the 20th time — 'I think that's right,' he said, 'because I've got at least 18 shirts — and said he has a camera around his neck at least once a week. 'My wife calls it my ""pacifier,""' he laughed, 'because our youngest son plays competitive soccer and she says taking pictures is the only thing that keeps me from cussing and yelling at the refs and everybody else.'","Fans on the Georgia course have adapted by going back to the future and using their pocket-sized digital or their old 35mm cameras .

"Referee Mark Clattenburg has been named to take charge of the Manchester derby on Sunday, despite having sent off three players from United and City this season. City captain Vincent Kompany was dismissed for two bookable offences during Belgium's narrow 1-0 defeat of Israel in their Euro 2016 qualifier on March 31, meaning he is now suspended for the match against Wales in June. And, although Clattenburg has been accused of favouring Louis van Gaal's side in the past, it's worth noting that the 40-year-old has only sent off two players season in the Premier League this season and both have been from United; Tyler Blackcett in the 5-3 defeat by Leicester and Luke Shaw in the 1-1 draw with West Ham. Mark Clattenburg will officiate the Manchester derby between United and City at Old Trafford . The English referee sent off City and Belgium captain Vincent Kompany during the international break .

The champion's shock 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday saw United move a point above their local rivals to add extra incentive for both sides ahead of the derby at Old Trafford, which could ultimately decide who finishes second behind expected winners Chelsea. While Manuel Pellegrini's side have struggled since the turn of the year, turning from title challengers to fourth place chases, United are coasting on confidence having won their last five consecutive league games.

"A young Irish rugby star escaped serious injury when his home was targeted by a gunman who fired multiple bullets through his windows. Adam McBurney, who has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s and recently played in their Six Nations campaign, was not at his home in Cromkill in County Antrim, Northern Ireland when it was targeted on Easter Sunday. Shocked neighbours said he could have been killed if he was in the property, after bullets tore through the windows and ended up embedded in the kitchen and bathroom walls. Adam McBurney, who has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s (left), was not at home when a gunman fired multiple bullets through the windows of his property in County Antrim, Northern Ireland (right) on Sunday . Mr McBurney, who lives at the home with his brother Shane, 20, and is deemed a bright prospect for Irish rugby, is said to have returned to the house following the attack but is yet to speak about the incident. Photographs from the scene today show at least 12 bullet holes still visible in a living room window of the property, which is situated on a small housing estate alongside just seven other homes. Police Service of Northern Ireland said a number of shots were fired at the windows of the unoccupied house at 2.20am on Sunday. Detectives are now appealing for witnesses and said the incident had 'criminal elements'. Officers also said a red Honda Accord car, which is believed to have been involved in the incident, was found burnt-out in a nearby road shortly after the attack. Chief inspector Natalie Wilson said: 'This type of attack is totally unacceptable and there is no place for this type of activity in a civilised society. I know that the vast majority of people in Ballymena do not support those responsible. 'I want to reassure the Ballymena community that we are determined to tackle these criminal elements and as such we are committing additional resources over the next few nights. 'We will not accept this type of behaviour and I would ask for community support and information as we work to identify those responsible.' Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident which occurred when the house was unoccupied in the early hours of Easter Sunday. Investigators' markings showed at least 12 bullets hit one window of the house . Mr McBurney, who lives at the home on a quiet residental street in County Antrim with his brother Shane, 20, is deemed a bright prospect for Irish rugby and played in Ireland U20's game vs France U20's (pictured above) One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, described the incident as 'very worrying'. He told Belfast Live: 'It is fortunate the boys were not at home when these shots were fired into the living room because with that amount of shots flying about we very well could be talking about the death of one or two brothers, one of whom is one of the best young rugby stars in Ireland.' Adam McBurney is deemed one of the best young rugby stars in Ireland and there are hopes he will play internationally. The young player grew up playing for his local club Ballymena, and has also been associated with Randalstown RFC. He has since gone on to represent Ulster and Ireland and has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s – playing recently against Italy and France in their Six Nations campaign. He is also actively involved with the Belfast Met Rugby Academy- which blends intense professional rugby training with academic courses. Alongside rugby, McBurney works at Tullyglass House Hotel - an imposing country residence set in its own grounds on the outskirts of Ballymena. Another neighbour, Marie McKeown, 77, added: 'I heard the bangs and at first I didn't realise what it was. It woke me up. 'This is a very quiet area. I would be a light sleeper and I heard bang, bang, bang. I was shocked when I heard this happening. I hope it quietens down.' Following the attack, police cordoned off part of the housing estate and increased patrols in the area. It is believed, from the bullet casings found at the scene, that a nine-mm type weapon was fired with twelve rounds hitting the living room window and its frame. A further two strike marks were visible on the wall above the window. Bullets lodged in the kitchen and in the bathroom walls suggest that anyone who might have been in either room at the time of the shooting would most likely have been killed or suffered serious injury. Mr McBurney, who played for his local rugby club Ballymena before going on to represent Ulster and Ireland, inherited the property with his brother when their mother Heather died in December 2013. Anyone with information about the incident should contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Adam McBurney's home targeted by gunman who fired through windows .

"A teenager from Illinois is tackling her disability head-on and attempting to positively influence thousands of others by dancing. Dayna Dobias, 19, from Downers Grove was born with cerebral palsy, but she hopes to inspire others with her enthusiastic videos. 'I've gotten bullied because of it and I get people all the time, staring and so it's definitely made things difficult in my life,' Dayna told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Challenging: Dayna Dobias, 18, is hoping change the way people with disabilities are represented by the television, film and the fashion industry . Her hope is that the video not only entertains, but inspires others to think before judging. The teenager says her motivation for creating the video was to counteract stereotypes held by people over certain disabilities. 'People tend to think that because I have cerebral palsy I cannot do anything and that I am so different from everyone else, when in reality I am pretty much just the same as everyone else,' she added. 'I might do things a little bit differently than most people, but that doesn't mean that I should be treated differently.' This is one of several videos that Dayna has created. Last year the teenager produced another dancing clip with her strutting her stuff to Taylor Swift's Shake It Off.

Don't judge: People tend to think that because I have cerebral palsy I cannot do anything and that I am so different from everyone else, when in reality I am pretty much just the same as everyone else,' Dayna says . 'People like to define me based on disability. People just look at me and think, oh that's just the girl with cerebral palsy,' she said. 'I would like people to look past that and be like, oh she's just one of us.' Dayna says she wanted to turn any negativity that might be held over her disability into something positive and hopefully inspire others, or at the very least raise a smile. 'When I was first diagnosed with cerebral palsy, doctors warned my parents that I may never walk, but here I am dancing! I drive, I go to college, I do things like every other 19-year-old,' she says. The teen has now begun to do some motivational speaking at a couple of local schools.

"A Florida woman has been arrested for driving under the influence after she allegedly caused a scene at a McDonald's drive-through while wearing nothing but a bra and panties, police say. Lydia Kelm, 23, had a blood-alcohol content of .247 when police tested her after showing up to the McDonald's in Leesburg, Florida, early Monday.

"FIFA presidential candidate Luis Figo on Wednesday disputed the Confederation of African Football's claim that all 54 votes from the continent will go to incumbent Sepp Blatter in the presidential elections next month. The former Portugal international, in Egypt at the CAF Congress to canvass for votes, told Sportsmail he did not believe all Africa was solidly behind Blatter, who seeks re-election on May 29 against Figo, Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan and the Dutch football association president Michael van Praag. 'I feel there's a lot of respect for CAF among all the African federations but I'm positive that (CAF president) Mr (Issa) Hayatou did not speak in the name of the 54 members of the confederation,' said the former Barcelona and Real Madrid midfielder. Luis Figo does not believe that Sepp Blatter will receive ALL 54 votes from African nations . Blatter (left) has received the backing of African football's president Issa Hayatou (right) 'Even when he (Hayatou) announced he would support Blatter, we could notice a difference from past congresses when a statement like that normally is followed by a standing ovation. 'This time we heard just a normal applause, which confirms my idea that a lot of African countries understand and agree with the need to change for the better of everyone, especially the national associations. 'In fact there were federation presidents who ensured me they would vote for me but they were reluctant to saying this out loud because they feared reactions against them, their federations and even their countries,' said Figo. 'It also to end this kind of atmosphere that I decided to be a candidate. Football should be about a beautiful game and people should be able to express themselves freely and openly.' Figo (left) and Michael van Pragg (right) are opposing Blatter and have chosen to run for presidency . Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is the third challenger and the FIFA vice-president was in attendance in Zimbabwe . The CAF congress in Cairo ended on Tuesday with Hayatou declaring Africa's complete support for Blatter's re-election but on all previous occasions when the CAF chief has promised a block of African votes, many have broken ranks. When Blatter came to power in 1998, Hayatou pledged Africa's votes to rival Lennart Johansson of Sweden but most defied him to vote Blatter into power. When Hayatou stood against Blatter in 2002, almost half the African countries voted for the Swiss rather than their own confederation president.","Luis Figo is challenging to replace Sepp Blatter as FIFA president .

"This is the surreal moment a dog takes the reins and literally drags his owner out for a walk. Dashcam footage, shared by dailymotion.com user Vidsking, shows a giant St. Bernard  running across a road somewhere in the Czech Republic with a child trailing behind. It appears to be a rather uncomfortable excursion, with the young boy going along the ground on his belly with his legs stretched out behind. As the canine scampers along, his passenger holds tightly to a leash. Two men watching the bizarre scene from their car are heard chuckling in the background. They're forced to slow down  to avoid hitting the animal and human train. Once the dog reaches the other side of the road, it makes its way over a muddy verge. At that point the boy gets up and stumbles forwards. Another pedestrian is seen on the roadside but he doesn't appear to be overly fazed by the scene. According to the video time stamp, the incident took place on March 3 just past 5pm. 'A dog walks a child,' the cameraman casually titled the unusual piece of footage.

"All eyes will be on Cristiano Ronaldo when Real Madrid visit Rayo Vallecano in La Liga on Wednesday. The 30-year-old hit five in Real's thumping 9-1 win against Granada at the weekend to take his tally to 36 goals in the league so far. Ronaldo's quintuplet moved him above Lionel Messi in the race for the Pichichi trophy given to the top goalscorer in La Liga at the end of the season. Spanish paper Marca (left) previews Real Madrid's trip to Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday night - with the focus on superstar forward Cristiano Ronaldo after his five-goal haul against Granada at the weekend . And going into Wednesday's Madrid derby, Marca builds up to the match by focusing on Ronaldo. Leading with the headline: 'Captain Thunder against Rayo,' the paper states that Ronaldo 'arrives unleashed after his exhibition against Granada.' In addition Marca adds that Ronaldo will be up against Rayo striker Alberto Bueno - the highest scoring Spaniard in the league at present with 15 goals. Meanwhile in Catalonia, Mundo Deportivo looks ahead to Barcelona's clash against Almeria on Wednesday night - and more so the importance of Lionel Messi. If he plays at the Nou Camp, it would be the 50th consecutive week that the Argentina maestro has done so in the Spanish top flight - dating back to January 11, 2014. Barca coach Luis Enrique says he will make changes against Almeria - but Mundo adds that if Messi isn't spared then it is 'cruel' on the 27-year-old. Meanwhile in Italy, the reaction from Juventus' Coppa Italia semi-final triumph over their bitter rivals Fiorentina continues. Over in Italy, the papers focus on Juventus' 3-0 Coppa Italia semi-final second leg win over Fiorentina . Goals from Alessandro Matri, Roberto Pereyra and Leonardo Bonucci saw Juve overturn a 2-1 first leg deficit to win 4-2 on aggregate at the home of the Viola. Corriere dello Sport hails the visitors' performance with the headline 'Tre-mendous Juventus' adding that manager Massimiliano Allegri produced a tactical masterpiece to seal victory without a number of his regular starters - including star striker Carlos Tevez. Aside from Juventus' win, Corriere dello Sport and Tuttosport both report that Paris Saint-Germain forward Edinson Cavani is being linked with a move to AC Milan. The 28-year-old is reportedly fed up of playing second fiddle to Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the French capital, often shunted out wide to get the best out of the Swedish striker. And Tuttosport adds that the Uruguay international has been offered to Milan - with the deal currently being 'weighed up.'","Real Madrid thrashed Granada 9-1 in La Liga at the weekend .

"Vincent Kompany believes that if Manchester City are able to pick up a valuable three points away to rivals Manchester United, then they can help 'rectify' a disappointing season. Manuel Pellegrini's side were given a torrid time by Crystal Palace on Monday night, as their Premier League title hopes were all but dashed and a place in the top two is all they have left to fight for. The City captain admits that the derby game is crucial and believes being the underdogs suits his side. Vincent Kompany (left) believes that a win against rivals Manchester United will help rectify their season . Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure after a disappointing season and could be replaced in the summer . He said: 'A derby is a derby. It doesn't matter what place you are in the league, it's a derby. If anything, it's a good moment to go into a derby. I guess the momentum is a little bit with our neighbours at the moment, but it's the perfect place for us to go and try to rectify what we've had.' With speculation surrounding their manager Pellegrini, it remains to be seen if he'll still be in charge in the summer but Kompany says that a strong finish will be key for them next season. 'My only concern is we get back to our best form,' he added. 'I think it's our general form that we have to improve. I've learnt from the past seasons as well that finishing a season strongly can have an impact on your next season as well. In some funny way, it wasn't even a bad game [against Palace]. Glenn Murray terrorised the Manchester City defence and opened the scoring despite being offside . Kompany and his team-mates talk to referee Michael Oliver after the clearly offside goal was awarded . 'We are demanding with ourselves because we have to win, but you guys saw it. Did they have a shot on goal except for set-pieces? They are definitely a solid team. They are definitely a team who knows how to defend. 'They had a game plan so credit to them but, for us, it wasn't a bad game in comparison with other games that we might have lost. It has a bit of a different feel to it maybe than the result at Burnley. But a team like us needs results.'","Vincent Kompany says beating Manchester United can 'rectify' the season .

"Christian Benteke rescued Aston Villa from the drop zone with a brilliant late free-kick to seal his hat-trick and salvage a point against relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers. Tim Sherwood’s team were set to drop into the bottom three when Charlie Austin scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season 12 minutes from the end, before Benteke’s intervention five minutes later to cap off a pulsating game. The point lifts QPR above Burnley to 18th on goal difference, while Villa move above Hull to 16th. Tim Sherwood was disappointed that Aston Villa's domination of QPR did not result in three points for his side . Sherwood did concede that the point taken could be vital and praised Christian Benteke for his hat-trick . Sherwood said: ‘I’m disappointed with a point when we’ve dominated the match like that. The referee should have stopped it at half-time. Anyone who has seen that football match knows it shouldn’t have been close. ‘But it’s not about what you deserve, it’s about what you actually get. This could be a vital point come the end of the season. When you’re going so late into the game and Christian’s had to pull that one out of the bag, we’re grateful for that.’ Chris Ramsey was equally frustrated that his team only took a point from Villa Park, having twice led, initially through Matt Phillips’ header. Benteke equalised with a deflected shot before putting Villa ahead before the break with a cool finish. Defender Clint Hill levelled the game with a header before Austin struck and Benteke scored his seventh goal in five Villa games to ensure honours finished even. Benteke was Villa's star man, twice pulling them level with three goals that earned a point at Villa Park . Charlie Austin had scored late on for QPR as they looked to claim and unlikely away end in the Midlands . Ramsey praised Benteke, saying: ‘He is a formidable player. When you are playing against people that can pull out that little bit of magic, sometimes you have to hold your hands up. His free-kick was a fantastic strike in off the post against a top keeper, who had it been anywhere else probably would have saved it.’ The QPR head coach added: ‘Based on the way we played in the second half and the beginning of the first half you have to be disappointed you haven’t been able to get above the line, which was the aim before we started the last two games. We showed tonight we’re more than capable of doing that. I don’t know what we need but we’re probably going to have to win three games. We know our next home games will be very important. We have the potential cup final against Leicester on the last game of the season. QPR head coach Chris Ramsey called Benteke a 'formidable player' after he took apart the visitors . Sherwood and Ramsey embrace before kick-off having spent periods of their careers working together . ‘Any team would take being in it right till the end and then roll the dice. You don’t want to become detached where every game is a mountain to climb. There is a belief in the camp they are capable of surviving, there is no doom and gloom.’ Sherwood added: ‘We’re creating chances, aren’t we? I can’t really understand why they scored 12 goals before I came in, incredible really for players with that kind of strike-rate... we must keep our tempo up and shore it up at the back. Otherwise we could find ourselves in trouble.’ Sherwood now takes his team to Tottenham and Manchester City. ‘Who is to say we can’t go to any of those games and win?’ he said. ‘We’ll try. We can’t do what QPR have done today, we’ll play on the front foot.’ .","Aston Villa draw 3-3 with QPR  with Christian Benteke scoring a hat-trick .

"If you had planned to jet off today to catch the end of the Easter school break, you may just wish you had stayed at home. In a double hit for thousands of holidaymakers trying to leave Britain today, strikes by French air traffic controllers and new border control checks threaten severe delays. Air passengers face up to three days of disruption, with British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair and Flybe among the airlines forced to cancel dozens of flights. Scroll down for video . Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Chaos: New passport regulations could cause queues on roads leading to Dover and Folkestone (file photo) And those travelling abroad by ferry or Eurotunnel face queues as exit checks are introduced at Britain’s ports. The change, which takes effect from today, means every passenger in a car or coach will have their passport scanned. The walkout by France’s biggest air traffic controllers’ union SNCTA will begin at 5am today and run until 5am on Friday – with vast knock-on disruption expected. Last night, easyJet, which flies to more than a dozen French cities, said it was cancelling 118 flights, including ten directly affecting the UK. BA warned of ‘significant disruption’ and apologised for the cancellation of around a dozen return flights from Britain. Flybe said it was cancelling 16 of today’s flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Crush: Passengers travelling on the Channel Tunnel or on cross-Channel ferries are likely to see the worst of the disruption (file photo) Ryanair said it was cancelling 250 of today’s flights, with more likely, branding the strike ‘grossly unfair’. Nearly a third involve the UK, although many are destinations outside of France hit by the knock-on effect. A Ryanair spokesman said all affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options – full refund, free transfer on to the next available flight or free transfer on to an alternatively routed flight. The Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation because industrial action is classed as an ‘unforeseen circumstance’ outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. In response to dire warnings that the introduction of border control checks would cause chaos, ministers have tried to lessen the impact by phasing the new rules in. For the first month, all passports will be scanned but only a quarter of passport holders will have to have their details verified. By June, this will rise to 100 per cent . Forget Rome or Athens, the best place to bask in spring sunshine this week will be Britain. The glorious weather is set to stretch out for the rest of the week – with hotter temperatures here than in many Mediterranean destinations. The mercury is set to rise steadily until Friday, when southern parts of England are forecast to hit 21C (70F) or higher, which would be the hottest temperature here so far this year. Rome and Athens are only expected to reach 16C (61F), while Marseille is set to stall at 18C (65F). But make the most of it when you can as last week’s cooler weather is predicted to return on Sunday. Dan Williams, spokesman for the Met Office, said: ‘We are looking at high temperatures until the weekend. It will be cooler and breezier over the weekend with some rain. That will make way for more unsettled weather into next week.’","Strikes by French air traffic controllers will affect thousands of Brits today .

The NYPD released the video Tuesday, along with a photo of the victim in the hospital in hopes of identifying her. The woman was critically injured and still has not regained consciousness. The grainy video, obtained from a store owner in the Richmond Hill section of Queens, shows a man dressed in a hooded sweatshirt and sweatpants dragging the limp body of a woman from the backseat of a parked car at around 12.30am Saturday.

"Frustration was clear in the voices of Peter Moores and Alastair Cook  as they fended off repeated enquiries about Kevin Pietersen's future more than a year after he had seemingly been banished from international cricket for good. Well, there is only one person to blame — and that is Colin Graves. The incoming ECB chairman has been responsible for the mixed messages that leave the England team in as big a state of turmoil and internal rebellion as ever. Graves has forged an excellent reputation in English cricket as chairman of Yorkshire for the way he bankrolled and transformed the club, but his initial forays into the international game have been little short of an embarrassment. Colin Graves has made a habit of talking before thinking since being announced as ECB chairman . He has become the loose cannon of English cricket — and he has yet to take up office. It all started on March 1 when he gave an interview to Garry Richardson of the BBC, who is known for his persistence and admirable success in coaxing ear-catching sound bites from interviewees. So when Graves said that Pietersen — exiled for valid reasons after the last Ashes debacle before producing a nasty autobiography that only supported the ECB's decision — had to be playing county cricket to earn an England recall, it was put down to Yorkshire straight-talking. Yet subsequently, most importantly in a phone conversation with Pietersen, Graves has done little to play down the 34-year-old's chances — even if privately the chairman is said to be perplexed at the media's 'spin' on his apparent opening of the England door. If Graves, who has apparently assured senior figures that he does not want Pietersen back, really had no intention of encouraging the maverick, then he has made a right old mess of it. For he has created a soap opera that will run and run now Pietersen has rejoined Surrey and put huge pressure on a fledgling England middle order who made significant Test progress last summer. England head coach Peter Moores (left) and Alastair Cook  answer questions at a press conference . Not to mention completely undermining managing director Paul Downton and national selector James Whitaker, who have repeatedly clarified England's stance on the batsman over the last 14 months. And if Graves disagreed with the original decision to axe Pietersen, then he had a duty as deputy chairman of the ECB to say so then, not wait until he had taken over from Giles Clarke. That is not all. Since his Pietersen outburst, Graves has said that there will be an inquiry if England do not beat a 'mediocre' West Indies in the upcoming three-Test series. This prompted the respected Barbadian commentator Tony Cozier to liken the comments to Tony Greig's infamous intention in 1976 to make the West Indies 'grovel'. Then Graves came out with the ridiculous notion of reducing Test matches to four days. This would be achieved by introducing the unrealistic target of playing 105 overs a day — a move that would destroy the primacy of the ultimate game. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen has been linked with a return to the national side recently . If Graves wants to make himself useful, then he should concentrate on his supposed main aim of introducing a 10-team English Premier League franchise Twenty20 competition. Everybody bar a few myopic counties wants that. He could also do something about a crippling fixture list that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months — a key factor in why they have fallen so far behind in the 50-over game and just endured the worst World Cup in their history. There is much for the ECB's new regime — which includes new chief executive Tom Harrison and communications director Chris Haynes — to do, but all the new chairman has done so far is make things worse. Colin Graves should think very carefully in future before he speaks.","Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves has handled the potential return of Kevin Pietersen very poorly .

"Not one but two very familiar faces will be ranged against Andy Murray on the support benches as he revisits one of the most highly charged matches of his career. Tomas Berdych is his opponent in the semi-final of the Miami Open, the man Murray met — and eventually beat — at the same stage of the Australian Open in January. It was a match that had everything, with even the saintly Kim Sears caught uttering profanities in the direction of the Czech powerhouse. Andy Murray will have to cope with seeing two of his former team in the opposite corner in Miami . Fitness trainer Jez Green (left) and coach Danny Vallverdu left Murray to join Tomas Berdych's team . There is no love lost on the tour between the British No 1 and his Czech opponent Berdych (right) Much of the build-up to that fractious encounter centred on the fact it was a reunion between Murray and his close friend and assistant coach Dani Vallverdu, who had switched jobs to work with world No 9 Berdych. Now there is the added presence of Murray’s former fitness trainer Jez Green, with whom he spent so many painstaking hours becoming a super athlete, following Vallverdu into the Berdych camp while also working with the outstanding German teenager Alex Zverev. By the time they met in Melbourne there had been endless references to people failing to pull in the same direction when on Murray’s team. It is fairly clear that meant disagreements over training methods and other matters. Murray's fiance Kim Sears was caught shouting expletives towards Berdych at the Australian Open . Murray and Berdych meet at the net after the Brit's semi-final victory in Melbourne in January . Murray, who after one break in Melbourne pointedly celebrated straight at Vallverdu, admits the Australian match was difficult due to the intensity of the friendships. However, he insists that tension has now dissipated. ‘We chat most days when we’re in the locker room and stuff,’ said the Scot. ‘In Melbourne it was a bit awkward but now I feel I’m past that. We’ve moved on.’ He admits to not being close to Berdych. And that has not changed. Murray reached the last four in Key Biscayne after a three-set defeat of rising prospect Dominic Thiem .","British No 1 faces Tomas Berdych in the Miami Open semi-finals .

"There was no special treatment for Lewis Ferguson at Paul Nicholls’s yard on Thursday morning. The 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as usual, just a cut on the nose to show for the fall which has made him an internet sensation. Ferguson’s spectacular double somersault fall from the favourite Merrion Square in the 4.20pm at Wincanton has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online. But he was back riding out and is undeterred from getting back in the saddle. Amateur jockey Lee Lewis Ferguson has just a cut on his nose to show for his ordeal . Teenager Ferguson was flung from his horse in spectacular fashion at Wincanton . ‘It was just a blur,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t work out what had happened until I got back to the weighing room and watched the replay. All the other jockeys asked me if I was all right and stuff, they all watched with me and looked away in horror. It’s about the most impressive fall I’ve seen. ‘There was nothing I could do to avoid it, you just have to let it take its course and hope it’s not a bad one. I’ve been very lucky. I got a bit of abuse from the lads and picked up a few hundred Twitter followers but it’s all good banter. ‘Given the somersaults, maybe I’ll look at having a gymnastics career after finishing racing.’","Lewis Ferguson was mucking out the stables as usual on Thursday .

"Rory McIlroy admits Thursday cannot come soon enough as he bids to complete the career grand slam by winning the Masters. The hype surrounding McIlroy's attempt to join Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods in winning all four major titles has been building since the night before his Open victory at Hoylake last July. And although the return of Woods to competitive action after two months on the sidelines has taken some of the spotlight off McIlroy, the world No 1 is anxious to let his clubs do the talking. Rory McIlroy insists he has arrived at Augusta ready to mount a serious challenge on the Masters . The world No 1 shields himself from the rain as he plays a shot during a practice round . 'I said in the middle of last week, 'If Augusta was to start tomorrow, I'd be okay. I'm ready,'' McIlroy said on Tuesday. 'I think that's a good indication of where I am with my game. I've been ready for this thing to start for a week already so just trying to keep my game where it is and do some quality work, not overdo it. 'Just do the right amount so that when I got here yesterday for the first time, I was ready to play and just needed to go see the golf course. I wasn't working on anything in my game, my swing. Wasn't thinking about technique at all. Just all about hitting the shots I need to and thinking about how to manage my game and get it around here for the next four days. 'Results-wise, the last three tournaments haven't been what I've wanted. I still feel like there's plenty of positives to take from them, especially Doral and Bay Hill, I felt like I played pretty good there. A couple silly mistakes here and there, but for the most part I felt like I got what I needed out of them. 'But the last two weeks have been great. I've just practised at home in Florida and made another trip up here a couple of Fridays ago. 'I just really felt like spending a couple of weeks away from this (media attention), I guess, and just preparing at home and in private and not really having everything critiqued and analysed and over-analysed. I just wanted to get away from it all, and I feel like it's been a good thing.' All eyes have been on Tiger Woods' latest comeback, which could take the pressure off of McIlroy . The Northern Irishman speaks to Wood's girlfriend Lindsey Vonn and his children during practice . McIlroy followed Woods into the media centre at Augusta National and admitted the presence of the 14-time major winner - who was relaxed and jovial with the press - could work in his favour. 'A little bit, I guess,' the 25-year-old added. 'It is such a big story, Tiger coming back at the Masters after a bit of a lengthy period where he has not been around. But still I'm just here to play golf and you guys can write the stories, I won't read them and we'll move on.' McIlroy has recorded just one top-10 finish in six previous appearances at Augusta - last year's tie for eighth - although he did take a four-shot lead into the final round in 2011 before collapsing to a closing 80. He admits he will have to play the par fives better to have a chance of slipping on a green jacket on Sunday, covering them in level par last year compared to eight under by champion Bubba Watson, who finished eight shots ahead. McIlroy led the field heading into the final day of the 2011 Masters before suffering a dramatic meltdown . McIlroy plays a shot from the azaleas as he recorded his best finish of eighth in last year's tournament . But he also believes Augusta National suits his game if he can take advantage of having a nine iron in his hands for second shots to holes like the 13th and 15th. 'I think I've developed a game where I can compete at pretty much any golf course now. That might not have been the case two or three years ago,' McIlroy added. 'But if you're looking at the courses, Augusta's the one that should set up the best for me just with my ball flight and being comfortable off the tee here, especially being able to turn the ball over from right to left. 'If I can play the way I know I can around here and just have a good week on the greens, then there's no reason why I shouldn't have a good chance.'","World No 1 arrives at Masters hoping to complete a career grand slam .

"Jonjo O'Neill hosted a media stable visit on Thursday at his Jackdaws Castle yard in Gloucestershire and said he could not be happier with favourite for the Crabbie's Grand National, Shutthefrontdoor. He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the £1million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month . O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season . 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 . 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning. He came alive there last year and seems to like the track.'","Crabbie's Grand National takes place at Aintree on April 11 .

"Marcelo Bosch basked in the gratitude of his team-mates after kicking Saracens into the semi-finals of the Champions Cup in dramatic scenes in north Paris. Bosch, striking the ball into a strong wind, landed a 55-metre penalty in the final act of the last eight showdown against Racing Metro to snatch a 12-11 victory at the Stade Yves-Du-Manoir. It completed a scarcely believable win given Saracens had been battered for most of the match only to display remarkable tenacity and set up a semi-final appointment with Clermont in St Etienne in two weeks. Marcelo Bosch kicks the winning penalty as Saracens beat Racing Metro 12-11 . Bosch is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring the kick that won his team the game . Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall admitted he was surprised to see Bosch taking the penalty . 'With kicks like this you're either the hero of the day or the bad guy, so I'm happy that it went my way. I just stayed relaxed and fortunately it went through the posts,' Bosch, 31, said. 'Sometimes they ask me if I'm keen to take the long-range kicks and because of the wind it was not a good distance for the other kickers. I said 'why not? I can take it' and the rest is history. 'The last time I did a kick like that was when I was 21 and playing for an amateur club in Argentina. It was from more or less the same range against our classico rivals. 'It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. I tried to be as relaxed as possible because we had the wind in our face and I didn't want to force it. 'It was the last minute of the game so I was tired and tried not to think about what it represented.' Bosch also executed a try-saving tackle on Racing wing Juan Imhoff when all his Argentina team-mate had to do was fall over the line for a potentially decisive final-quarter try. 'Juan is a real player. He's like a striker - always smelling the goal. I followed him and fortunately stopped him from scoring at the end,' Bosch said. Until Bosch delivered the knockout blow - referee Nigel Owens awarded the penalty with 10 seconds left on the clock - a full blooded quarter-final that was often a poor spectacle appeared to be destined for a home win. Saracens fly-half Charlie Hodgson kicked one penalty and full-back Alex Goode supplied six points to keep the match favourites in sight. Two second-half penalties from scrum-half Maxime Machenaud, who also crossed for the game's solitary try in the 27th minute, placed Racing in control that the Parisians only relinquished as Owens was preparing to blow for full time. 'I was surprised to see it was Bosch taking it because I though it was in Alex Goode's range,' Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said. 'But the wind was very strong, so it was Bosch's range. He had the nerve and balls to say he wanted it, which is half the battle. He hit it pretty sweetly. 'Marcelo is pretty cool. He's pretty laid back, but like anybody, that's one of those kicks that if you miss it can cause the damage. 'I'm very grateful that he held his nerve. He also made the tackle on our goalline that kept us in the match as well. Chris Ashton (left) of Saracens is tackled by Juan Imhoff of Racing Metro in the quarter-final clash . Alex Goode (centre) of Saracens sprints with the ball as Jamie Roberts (right) approaches . 'We weren't great in the first half even though we had a very strong wind behind us. But that's where it turned around and I'd say our second half performance was as courageous, brave and hard working as I've seen. 'We went hunting and kept knocking them down and scrapped for absolutely everything.' Racing's Wales centre Jamie Roberts was distraught at the outcome. 'I'm hugely frustrated and gutted for the team. We thought we had it in the bag. That last minute cost us so fair play to Marcelo with the kick at the end,' Roberts said.","Marcelo Bosch secured a  12-11 win for Saracens against Racing Metro .

"The mighty boot of Marcelo Bosch kept the English flag flying in Europe as the Argentinian kicked Saracens through to the Champions Cup semi-finals with a famous last-minute penalty.

'It was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals. It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. ‘I tried to be as relaxed as possible. We had the wind in our face and I didn’t want to force it. I tried not to think about what it represented and I said, “Why not? I can take it.” The rest is history. With kicks like this, you’re either the hero or the bad guy - I’m happy that it went my way.’ It was the sort of strike that was associated with Ronan O’Gara during his illustrious playing career with Munster and Ireland.

CLERMONT v SARACENS, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, St Etienne, Saturday, April 18, 3.15pm (GMT) TOULON v LEINSTER, Stade Vélodrome, Marseille, Sunday,     April 19, 3.15pm (GMT) Racing are a team who, in their early years, would play wearing berets and bow ties. They would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter, offering little to inspire the Parisian painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic. The partisan home crowd were angered by two of Owens’ decisions in the opening quarter, with the Welshman not penalising Alex Goode for a block on French winger Teddy Thomas and scratching off a potential try for Dimitri Szarzewski because of a knock on. Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties – either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. ‘We weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb. Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility back who moved to Europe in 2006 to play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in the 2013-14 season and has featured predominantly at centre. He is not Saracens’ first-choice kicker - Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex Goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike. It’s earned him cult status with the Allianz Park crowd, who chant ‘Bosch, Bosch, Bosch’ whenever he lines up one of his kicks. As a teenager, Bosch played football in Buenos Aires but claims that it was always his dream to play rugby in England. He married Augustina last summer and they are expecting twins.

Strettle is upended going for a high ball against Racing's Brice Dulin, who escapes a yellow card . ‘But that's where it turned around and I'd say our second half performance was as courageous, brave and hard working as I've seen. We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.’ Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line – although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass – and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later. The blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but, sacrebleu, Metro tried to run down the clock. Then Metz came flying off his feet at the crucial moment.

"Belly flop to belly up?  It’s fair to say Steve Bruce has had better weeks than this one, which featured the publication of some poolside diving snaps and culminated in a defeat that suggests Hull might yet bomb out of the Premier League. This was a game they could not afford to lose. Not when their final seven games include fixtures against Southampton, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But lose they did, bringing their winless run to five and leaving themselves in a right mess. Bafetimbi Gomis roars with celebration after giving Swansea a 2-0 lead against Hull at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Gomis unleashed a thunderous overhead kick shortly before half-time to capitalise on some poor Hull defending . The French striker fires a spectacular volley past Allan McGregor and into the roof of the Hull net to double the home side's lead . The Swansea striker celebrates his strike in front of a group of young supporters after doubling his side's lead in the first half .

Bafetimbi Gomis scored a spectacular overhead. CLICK HERE for more match zone . True, they could have benefited more from refereeing decisions – Bafetimbi Gomis was offside in the build up to his brilliant first goal and David Meyler’s second-half red card could have gone either way – but that should not exonerate a side that is supposed to be fighting for it life and yet looked so meek for half of this match. They managed no shots on goal in the time it took Swansea to go 2-0 ahead through Ki Sung-Yueng and Gomis’s bicycle kick. And it was only in the second half that they mounted a challenge. As fate would have it, Meyler was sent off for fouling Kyle Naughton two minutes after Paul McShane had given Hull a lifeline. Gomis finished them in stoppage time. Bruce was exasperated. He said: ‘We were disappointed to lose the game and we knew we were nowhere near good enough in the first-half in particular. ‘But the two big decisions went against us and they could have turned the game. Gomis’ first goal is a fantastic piece of skill but he is five yards offside. Gomis grabbed his second of the match after racing on to Jonjo Shelvey's pass and chipping McGregor in injury time . The 29-year-old celebrates in front of the Swansea fans on his hands and knees after making sure of the three points . Paul McShane pulled a goal back for Hull five minutes into the second half when he pounced in the six-yard box . The Hull defender slotted past Lukasz Fabianski from just four yard out after latching onto a free kick totally unmarked . ‘We had got back into the game at 2-1 but unfortunately David has picked up a red card. I’ve seen it six times now and from three angles and to me it’s a perfectly decent challenge. ‘The other three I look at it and he takes part of the ball and the leg collides with the boy. We may as well say with these grey areas that you are not allowed to tackle if you tackle on the floor.’ The consequence of the challenge, beyond damage to Hull’s survival prospects, is that Naughton went to hospital for an X-ray on his ankle. Garry Monk said: ‘His ankle is really swollen. That is the real negative. We hope it is not serious. At the time I thought it was a genuine 50-50 challenge. My initial reaction was “bad challenge” but I don’t think there was any malice. You run that risk if your foot is high and goes over the ball.’ For Monk, it was the only complaint from a match that Swansea probably could have won in third gear. That’s no exaggeration in the context of how poor Hull were in the opening 45 minutes. For a team in that kind of mess, with those fixtures still to come, it was incomprehensible. That’s not to say Swansea stormed from the blocks. Ki’s opener after 18 minutes was actually the first chance of the game. Jonjo Shelvey had taken his usual punt from distance and while Allan McGregor did well to get down and save, his parry fell squarely at the feet of the South Korean. David Meyler was sent off for the visitors just three minutes after McShane pulled a goal back for a lunge on Kyle Naughton . Hull midfielder Meyler and his team-mates look on in disbelief as Andre Mariner reaches for the red card . Swansea right back Naughton limps from the field and has to be replaced by Angel Rangel following Meyler's tackle . Ki buried the finish without taking a touch and now has scored four goals in eight games. With seven this season, the deep-lying midfielder has become a delightfully complete player. It took 24 minutes for Hull to have their first chance – Abel Hernandez hit a bouncing ball from 30 yards and it trickled all the way to Lukasz Fabianski. It wasn’t even on target. The rest of their attacks fizzled, a side with five across the middle seemingly incapable of holding possession. Gomis nailed the second with a goal that was hardly at home in such a subdued game. It really was a beautiful finish. Kyle Naughton delivered a ball into the area, Michael Dawson attempted to head clear and the striker buried a bicycle kick. Replays showed he had come back from an offside position, but the finish was magnificent. At that stage, Hull appeared out of it. Monk warned his side of complacency at the break and, in his words, ‘they did the total opposite’. It enabled Hull to pull one back after 49 minutes. Ashley Williams had tangled with Dame N’Doye and conceded a free-kick which Robbie Brady delivered from the right. Alex Bruce found space from six yards to flick a header at goal and McShane poked a finish past Fabianski. For two minutes Hull looked a genuine threat. And then, just as quickly, hope was gone. Meyler went high on Naughton and will miss the next three games. Ki Sung-Yueng opened the scoring for the home side inside 20 minutes after pouncing following an Allan McGregor save . Ki leads the celebrations after giving Garry Monk's side an early advantage at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Hull, to their credit, did not give up. But it was in their desperation for a leveller that they conceded a third. Nathan Dyer dispossessed Brady and Sigurdsson sent a long ball to Gomis. With none of Hull’s outfield players in their own half, the Frenchman had time to think before a nice chip over McGregor. In this strange old season of moans and a feint, he has also made his way to eight goals in all competitions. It will be interesting to see if his improved recent form has soothed some of the anger caused by his January agitations. It will be more interesting in the shorter term to see if Hull can find the significant improvement needed to get themselves out of this hole.","Swansea City beat Hull City 2-1 in the Premier League at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday .

"Wisconsin ended Kentucky's bid to become the first college basketball team to remain undefeated in nearly 40 years, beating the Wildcats 71-64 behind 20 points and 11 rebounds from Frank Kaminsky. Wisconsin will play Duke, an 81-61 winner over Michigan State in the earlier semi-final, at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Monday night. 'It gives us another 40 minutes, I know that,' said Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan, who leads the Badgers to their first final since 1941.

Wisconsin moved through to the final with a tense victory over Kentucky at the Lucas Oil Stadium . And Kentucky has a long ride home, finishing the season at 38-1 - two wins short of becoming the first undefeated team in college basketball since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers. Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trailing by four and gasping for breath after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome. Kaminsky and Bronson Koenig went 7 for 8 from the line over the last 24 seconds to seal the win. The 70,000-capacity Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, home of the Colts in the NFL, is hosting the Final Four . Wisconsin Badgers fans cheer on their team at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis . Kentucky's last, best chance came while trailing by three with 12 seconds left. But Karl-Anthony Towns received the ball in the post and got fouled. He made only one free throw, and from there, Wisconsin clinched it from the foul-line. Earlier Saturday, Justise Winslow scored 19 points and Jahlil Okafor added 18 to lead top-seeded Duke to an 81-61 victory over Michigan State on Saturday and a shot at its fifth national championship. Winslow, who played through some early foul trouble, had nine rebounds and was 5 for 7 from the field, while Okafor grabbed six rebounds and was 7 for 11 from the field. Duke celebrated reaching the final of the NCAA Tournament with a 81-61 win over Michigan State . Justise Winslow of the Duke Blue Devils goes up for a dunk in the semi-final in Indianapolis . Senior Quinn Cook had 17 points for the Blue Devils, who dominated the game except for the opening minutes when they trailed 14-6. Defensively, it was a team effort, just the way coach Mike Krzyzewski has stressed for his 35 seasons at Duke. What had been wide open 3-pointers early for Michigan State became contested shots and when the Blue Devils started getting up and on the Spartans, the points were suddenly tough to come by. Denzel Valentine finished with 22 points, which included hitting three quick 3-pointers in the first quarter to give the No.7 seed Michigan State an early lead. Trice scored 16 points and Branden Dawson added 12 for the Spartans.","Wisconsin beat Kentucky 71-64 at Lucas Oil Stadium in Final Four .

"Even after offering so little on the pitch, Harry Kane still served a useful purpose for his manager on Sunday. He drew the attention away from the cold reality of a disappointing display against Burnley; away from the fact that Tottenham’s chances of now qualifying for the Champions League appear extremely remote.

How the Premier League table looks . Kane's heat map vs Burnley. Click for more . Harry Kane had a bad day at the office by his recent high standards: . 0 SHOTS on target by Kane. The last time he failed to hit a shot on target in the Premier League was on December 6 against Crystal Palace. 14 Kane made just 14 passes, the joint lowest of any Spurs starter. 56% Kane's pass completion rate was the worst of any Spurs player except goalkeeper Michel Vorm. In fairness to Pochettino, this would not have been in his thinking when he selected Kane as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top-four place would now be difficult. But the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21-year-old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance Kane and his colleagues had just produced. Seemingly miffed by the line of questioning, Pochettino’s only explanation for why he made Kane the youngest skipper in the Barclays Premier League this season was brief and to the point. ‘He deserved it,’ he said, and with so many senior players missing it was not entirely without logic when he is said to be one of the more vocal members of the dressing room. But Pochettino did not stop there, accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine Kane as club captain. ‘He has the quality,’ he said. ‘So yes, maybe (he could be captain in the long term).’ Right now anything would appear possible with this kid. The goal only 78 seconds into his England debut; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first Tottenham striker since Gary Lineker to score 30 in a season. Perhaps he will be hosting Match of the Day next week. Here at Turf Moor, though, the dream and the reality were not quite in tandem for once, Kane enduring one of the more difficult afternoons he has experienced this season alongside team-mates unable to provide him with the service he requires. ‘It was difficult for him and difficult for his team-mates too,’ Pochettino acknowledged. He also pointed to Manchester City’s recent defeat here and complained that ‘long balls into the box’ made Sean Dyche’s side hard to play against. But Tottenham played like a side that took one look at Arsenal’s thumping defeat of Liverpool on Saturday and concluded that a place in the Champions League was already beyond their reach. They lacked urgency as well as energy, and while Pochettino could point to illness, injury and the international commitments of his players it remained a disappointing display. ‘Maybe we like playing on Thursday nights??’ tweeted Darren Anderton.

Walker was forced off through injury in the second half as Tottenham chased the win against Burnley at Turf Moor . Tottenham had only two shots on target in this game — they have only managed fewer three times in Premier League games this season. It remained more than a little perplexing that Pochettino waited until the 83rd minute to unleash Andros Townsend from the bench. The scorer of England’s equaliser against Italy and probably full of confidence as a result, he might have injected some much-needed momentum into Tottenham’s football. As it was he once again found himself the target of Paul Merson’s venom, the former Arsenal midfielder teasing him on Twitter that he must have missed the bus. Dyche focused more on the positives of his own team’s efforts but should really see this as a missed opportunity, given how poor Tottenham were. A point would have been welcome but three would have lifted them out of the relegation places, and on reflection his side had the best of the chances. Danny Ings squandered a marvellous opportunity in the opening few minutes before forcing a fine one-handed save from Michel Vorm shortly before the interval. The fact that the first booking came in the 78th minute illustrated how timid a contest this was. Even after Dyche had taken the fairly bold step of starting with Ings, Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes. This game boasted the two hardest working players in the Premier League this season, with George Boyd top of that list with 338.8km covered and Christian Eriksen second, just 600m behind the Burnley midfielder.

It was Boyd’s industry that created the first decent chance of the game, the pressure he applied on Ryan Mason forcing the newly capped England player into directing a back-pass into the path of Ings. The Burnley striker should have scored but succeeded only in firing his shot straight at Vorm. The second half was no better. Eriksen burst clear only to send a shot well over the crossbar, while Barnes threatened too. Paulinho found himself clean through at one stage only to scuff his effort embarrassingly wide. And the irrepressible Boyd would go close moments before the final whistle only to see his header bounce agonisingly wide. ‘I think we edged the game,’ said Dyche afterwards. ‘Danny (Ings) has had a couple of great chances but the first one he’s probably just hit too cleanly. But I’m pleased by the fact that we’ve got another clean sheet against a team that has spent a couple of hundred million on players.’ Not that there was much evidence of that here.

"Officially it's known as a 'forward three-and-a-half somersaults with one twist pike' but unofficially it's the 'firework' and Tom Daley hopes it's the dive that turns London bronze into Rio gold. The former world champion knows he needs to push the boundaries of his sport and spent most of last year battling to master his 'demon' dive, a dizzying combination of somersaults and twists he had hoped would prove the difference. However, along with new coach Jane Figueiredo he spent the winter modifying a new plunge, something that has never been attempted before. Daley spent long hours on the trampoline perfecting technique before building the dive in stages from different heights. Tom Daley hopes his new 'firework' dive can help win Olympic gold at the 2016 Rio de Janiero Games . It was painstaking and detailed work but the dive finally got its premiere at the British Championships and was part of Daley's repertoire when he won silver, with a personal best score, at the recent World Diving Series in Dubai. 'There was a sense of relief when we decided to bin the old dive but the pressure was on to come up with something,' admitted Daley. 'The old dive did terrify me and while I did conquer my demons with it, it's a weight off my shoulders that I've moved on because it was a bad dive for me. 'We wanted to do the least twist possible because I hate the twisting part. We've only got one twist in this dive so we had to decide whether we were going to do it at the beginning or at the end because you can do that dive three different ways. 'We tried doing it at the beginning but it made the dive really hard because the G-force getting into your pike shape is really difficult. 'We go through 20 Gs of force as we're spinning around so at the end we decided to do it on the way out. So you spin as fast as you can and then you come out at the end, do one twist then land in the water.' Daley (right) has spent the winter modifying the plunge with his new coach Jane Figueiredo . It's six years since Daley won his breakthrough world title in Rome, one year after making his Olympic debut as a 14-year old in Beijing. Last year there were inaccurate reports that Daley was to call time on his diving career but he insists he's enjoying the sport more than ever, following the decision to relocate from Plymouth to London. His home pool is now the Olympic pool, a place with happy memories, and he'll be the star attraction at next month's FINA Diving World Series, 1-3 May in his newly-adopted hometown. But Daley is no longer the sole standard bearer for British diving, Jack Laugher became the first non-Chinese diver to win on the World Series this year in Dubai and Tonia Couch and synchro partner Sarah Barrow are also established among the world's elite. 'I have never loved diving as much as I do now and I want to stay in diving for as long as I possibly can,' added Daley. The 20-year-old says he is enjoying diving more than ever after relocating from Plymouth to London . 'With the move to London it has become exciting again. Especially with the new dive, there are new challenges and new obstacles to overcome. 'It's been great having Jane on board, we've had a year and three months working together now. 'There's little things that we've changed – the strength and conditioning, the way that we work in the pool, the way we work in the gym but it's really working out. 'British diving is the strongest it's ever been and we are all really excited about coming back to London and competing in our own pool. 'We know in London that we always get a crowd that's loud. It's normally a sell-out and the atmosphere is a bit more electric than anyone else, it gives you that extra adrenaline rush and, in theory, it should get us to dive a little bit better.' And Daley hopes his new dive will bring victory at next month's FINA Diving World Series in London . But Daley's key ambition for the season in this summer's World Championships in Kazan. Since striking gold in Rome, he has settled for a fifth and sixth at the event, a record he concedes must change. His rivals will be the normal suspects, reigning champion Qiu Bo, Olympic champion David Boudia and Germany's Sascha Klein. 'The build up to Rio is going pretty well,' he added. 'It's got a lot of competitions leading up to it and the worlds will be our first chance to qualify. 'London is one of the key parts of the diving calendar this year because it's the middle part of the World Series. So it's a really good marker to see how the new dive's going and how all of that is piecing together and it's exactly the half-way mark competition wise so I'm really looking forward to it.'

The Argentinian midfielder poses with the trophy after his team won the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup . Cambiasso had an illustrious career at Inter Milan, winning an impressive 15 trophies during his stint . River Plate (2001-2002) Argentine Primera Division . Real Madrid (2002-2004) La Liga . Super Cup . Supercopa de Espana . Inter Milan (2004-2014) Champions League . Serie A (5) Coppa Italia (4) Supercoppa (4) FIFA Club World Cup . Having not won a game since January, Nigel Pearson's men face West Ham United on Saturday and Cambiasso is still convinced they can avoid the drop. 'I understood when I signed for Leicester it's not an easy job to stay in the Premier League,' he said. 'It's a difficult situation but I think we have our chances to win matches. There's a quarter of the Premier League left to finish. 'I think some people think for Leicester all is finished. But I'm sure, because I watch my team-mates every day, we can save Leicester and stay in the Premier League.' The former Inter Milan star signed for the Foxes in the summer, leaving Italy after ten years and embarking on a new challenge in England. After agreeing to a one-year-deal, Cambiasso has quickly established himself as a key player but it remains to be seen if he'll still be in the East Midlands at the start of next season. The former Real Madrid man was also successful during his short spell in Spain for Real Madrid . Cambiasso played during Real's 'Galatico' era, with Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham . 'Leicester always wanted me,' he added. 'After these nine months or eight months, I'm very happy because my family is OK, and I'm good. 'I want a few more points, but all the rest is perfect.' Cambiasso is happy in the East Midlands and could stay beyond his current one-year-deal .","Esteban Cambiasso says saving Leicester will feel like winning a trophy .

"Southampton striker Graziano Pelle insists his confidence hasn't been destroyed despite no scoring in the Premier League since December 20. The 29-year-old, who netted against England for Italy in the 1-1 international friendly on Tuesday, is now hoping to return to the form that saw him plunder eight goals in his first 17 league games. The former Feyenoord star has thanked Saints fans for continuing to support him through his lean spell, while manager Ronald Koeman has backed Pelle to go on a run during the final eight games of the campaign. Graziano Pelle remains confident despite not scoring in his last 13 Premier League games . The Italy striker celebrates after netting the opener in Tuesday's 1-1 friendly draw with England . 'I was happy to play in a nice stadium it's a great team to play against. I like those games. I was happy, especially because I scored,' he told Southampton's official website. 'For Southampton I got the chances, but I didn't profit about it. I'm not a person who thinks negative. I have a great job and all I can do is work more and more when something is going wrong. 'That way I can achieve what I want to do. When you perform well the goals can come. It's not only about scoring the goal, I want to do well for the team in general. Pelle last scored in the Premier League during Southampton's 3-0 defeat of Everton on December 20 . 'I'm really happy for the support they give me. I said I have to try and bring the supporters to my side when I joined, in the beginning not many people knew me. 'I did well and then everyone was behind me. Then it has gone a bit wrong and some people can think he's not good enough, but the stadium every time they make me feel good. 'I have to say thanks to them, I want to do my job as good as possible. I'm double happy if I score but I just want to think about the future, we have eight games left.'","Graziano Pelle hasn't scored in the Premier League since December 20 .

"Rangers boss Stuart McCall has revealed he was warned about taking over at Ibrox by Walter Smith - but insists he has made the right decision. The former Light Blues midfielder steered his new side to their third victory on the bounce with Sunday's 2-1 win over Hearts. It was a crucial triumph that moves Gers back into second place in the Scottish Championship and looks to have restored vital momentum ahead of the end-of-season play-offs. Stuart McCall says he was warned not to take the Rangers job but is pleased that he took the risk in the end . McCall has managed to unite a forlorn band of players since taking over a month ago and quickly transformed them into real promotion contenders. But he has revealed nine-in-a-row boss Smith - who McCall says was the 'greatest manager' he ever worked for - called to make sure the former Scotland international knew what he was letting himself in for when he agreed to replace Kenny McDowall. McCall, who still does not know if he will remain in charge beyond the summer, told TalkSport: 'Walter Smith rung me up on the day I took the job and asked if I knew what I'd let myself in for. 'But in fairness, he understood I would never have got the opportunity to manage such a wonderful club like this [were it not for the club's current circumstances]. The Gers boss has seen his new side win their last three games in a row including a crucial win over Hearts . 'Even though I knew it was a gamble and the pitfalls, just to be part of it has been great. 'Regardless of what happens at the end of the season, I have relished every minute of it and I'm thoroughly enjoying it, especially with the results being good.' Rangers' promotion hopes looked to have crumbled earlier this season as previous bosses Ally McCoist and McDowall struggled to maintain the required levels of morale and confidence amid the din generated by the club's bitter off-field civil war. Dave King's boardroom coup saw McCall brought in to rally the troops and his impact has been impressive. Kenny Miller (centre) fires home the opening goal for Rangers during Sunday's Scottish Championship game . Newly-crowned Scottish Championship winners Hearts were clapped on to the pitch by the home players at Ibrox. But it was Rangers who left the field to cheers after clinging onto victory after playing the entire second half a man down following skipper Lee McCulloch's red card just before the break. Kenny Miller and Haris Vuckic netted a pair of clinical strikes and McCall believes the quality of his side's goals only proves that the feel-good factor has returned to Glasgow's south side. He told the Rangers website: 'They were brilliant and the first was a good move down the left. On-loan Haris Vuckic (centre) curls home his sides second goal at Ibrox to put them in command . 'I think everyone knows Lee Wallace's capabilities when he gets forwards. Nicky Law has played him in with a good weighted pass and it was a great cutback and a fantastic finish by Kenny. He is just playing off Nicky Clark at the moment and doing it really well. 'The second goal is why Haris played today. He's got a goal in him, he's a threat. He can come in on his left foot and do what he did so it didn't surprise me when he picked it up there that it ended up in the back of the net. 'I felt for him at half-time. I explained to him that we had to bring him off and it was nothing to do with his performance, it was just because of the change of shape. 'He took it well, he understands, but what is good in the dressing room is that it's not just the 11 or the 14. There's about 22 lads and staff and everybody in there was congratulating each other for that performance. It's good to keep the momentum, the belief and the confidence high.' The Slovenian celebrates his goal as he continues to impress during his spell from Newcastle United . Rangers take on Queen of the South at Palmerston on Thursday night and McCall is expecting another battle after Gers lost 2-0 under McCoist's charge the last time they visited in December. He said: 'I saw Queen of the South against Hibs and they are well organised and we know what happened the last time we were down there. 'It was a tough night so they'll be confident as well after their victory. But the momentum carries on and we are going to have to be at our best on Thursday.'","Stuart McCall revealed that he was warned about taking the Rangers job .

"Former Sunderland defender Danny Higginbotham has described a controversial speech made by Roy Keane which he calls 'one of the most bizarre team talks I've ever experienced'. Higginbotham and his Black Cats team-mates were about to take on Aston Villa during the 2007-08 Premier League season when Keane sat them down in the home changing room at the Stadium of Light. But instead of encouraging his players to put their poor start to the season behind them, the former Manchester United midfielder delivered an astonishing team talk.

Keane watches his Sunderland players in action against Aston Villa after delivering his 'bizarre' team talk . Danny Higginbotham (right) gave struggling Sunderland the lead during the game on December 15, 2007 . In his new autobiography Rise Of The Underdog: My Life Inside Football, Higginbotham - who scored in Sunderland's 1-1 draw with Villa that day - describes Keane's attempt to motivate his players. '''Listen lads,' he said. 'Basically you're s***. Try and enjoy the game. You're probably going to get beat. But just enjoy being s***."" 'Then he just walked out. Those words have got to be insulting to any professional, no matter who they come from, and I'll admit it served as the perfect motivation to get out there and prove him wrong. I scored after 10 minutes and we were leading at half-time. We ended up drawing.' Higginbotham also reveals how Keane once demanded for him to swear at and criticise his team-mates instead of getting behind them. Aston Villa winger Shaun Maloney (right) scored a free-kick to secure a 1-1 draw for the visitors . Keane is now part of Martin O'Neill's backroom staff after leaving his role at Aston Villa earlier this season . Higginbotham (right), pictured in action against Manchester City, played under Keane for a season . Referring to a talk with Keane, Higginbotham writes: '''Danny, all I'm f****** hearing from you when I'm watching that game yesterday is f****** encouragement. That's all I'm hearing."" I thought, well, that's not so bad. ""I don't f****** want that. I want you to tell some of them they're being c****. Tell them.''' Despite a 2-0 loss away at Bolton in the season's penultimate game, Sunderland secured their Premier League safety with a match to spare. But although he had helped ensure another year in England's top-flight, Keane was in no mood to praise his players after their defeat against Gary Megson's side. Higginbotham (left) now works as a pundit after hanging up his boots in January, 2014 . Reliving his manager's post-match team talk, Higginbotham writes: '''You're the reason I'm driving up and down the f****** country to find another player, you're not f****** good enough,"" he yells at one player. '""Your attitude is s***. You're not good enough,"" he bawls at others. '""Next week we've got our last home game, against Arsenal. You know at the end of the season when you walk around the pitch, thank the fans for their support? I'm ringing Umbro and getting you some hooded jumpers, because you're a f****** embarrassment, it's a joke and this is not going to stay this way.""'","Danny Higginbotham covers his time under Roy Keane in his new book .

"Manchester City have not won a Premier League game having been behind at half-time in almost 20 years. The shocking stat is revealed as City's title hopes lay in tatters following Monday night's 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace which Manuel Pellegrini's side trailed at the interval. The last time City managed to win having been in a losing position at half-time was on April 17, 1995 when they beat Blackburn Rovers 3-2 having been 2-1 down at the break.

Man City have not managed to win a Premier League fixture having trailed at half-time in almost 20 years . Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini looks to the floor at Selhurst Park as his side's title dreams lay in tatters . While City have spent five seasons out of the top-flight since the 1994-95 campaign - which Rovers went on to win - the stat still makes for incredible reading as the blue side of Manchester look to retain their Premier League crown and claim their third title in four seasons. City's goalscorers that day were defender Keith Curle, now manager of League 2 strugglers Carlisle, from the penalty spot,  former Brentford boss Uwe Rosler and Paul Walsh. City went on to finish the Premier League season in 17th, two places above the drop zone.

While City have not won having trailed at the interval in almost two decades, all of City's top six rivals have managed to overturn half-time deficits in the last five years. Spurs came from behind to beat Hull in November 2014, Manchester United and Chelsea claimed victory after trailing at half-time last season. Liverpool beat Aston Villa after losing 1-0 at the interval against Aston Villa in March 2013 while Arsenal came from 2-1 down to beat Chelsea 5-3 in October 2011. To make matters worse, it seems Manuel Pellegrini's men are in need of some new blood. City had the second oldest starting XI in the Premier League this weekend with an average age of 29 years and 345 days; only West Brom fielded an older side, during their 4-1 home defeat to QPR. Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and goalkeeper Joe Hart were the only starters against Palace aged 28 or under. Arsenal – 29/10/11 – 2-1 down at Chelsea at HT, won 5-3 .

"Defender Daryl Janmaat has admitted Newcastle got exactly what they deserved from their derby trip to Sunderland - nothing. The 25-year-old Holland full-back played the full 90 minutes of Sunday's 1-0 Barclays Premier League defeat at the Stadium of Light despite suffering a suspected tear in his calf muscle during the warm-up, but was unable to prevent the Black Cats running out winners as the Magpies slipped to a record fifth successive defeat in the fixture. Newcastle created little of note on another poor day for John Carver's men, and Janmaat was pulling no punches as he assessed the fall-out. Daryl Janmaat (left) has admitted that Newcastle United's performance in their Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland wasn't good enough and they got exactly what they deserved - nothing . The Holland full-back played the full 90 minutes despite a suspected calf muscle tear . Janmaat tries to get across and stop a cross from Sunderland's Steven Fletcher at the Stadium of Light . He told NUFCTV: 'It was not good enough. The first half was really poor, we were too negative, so it was not good enough. The second half was much better, but it still wasn't good enough. 'I wouldn't say we didn't give everything. What I can say is we were not good enough and everybody saw that Sunderland were better, especially in the first half. 'If you are not good enough, then most of the time, you lose.' Newcastle were simply not at the races as a Sunderland side motivated by new head coach Dick Advocaat dominated from the off, although they looked like making it to half-time unharmed before Jermain Defoe smashed home a stoppage-time volley which proved to be the tangible difference between the teams. Janmaat said: 'A goal in the last minute of the first half, it's always hard to concede it because you go into the dressing room with a bad feeling. If you go in at 0-0, you can be positive in the dressing room, but if you concede a goal in the 47th minute, then it's hard. Jermain Defoe scored the winning goal - a spectacular volley - on the stroke of half-time . Defoe's goal proved to be ample reward for Sunderland's dominance in the Tyne-Wear derby . The result moves Sunderland three points clear of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone . April 13 Liverpool (A) April 19 Tottenham Hotspur (H) April 25 Swansea City (H) May 2 Leicester City (A) May 9 West Bromwich Albion (H) May 16 Queens Park Rangers (A) May 24 West Ham (H) 'But they deserved to score in the first half because they had maybe 20 free-kicks and they were better than us, then normally you score a goal. Like I said, it was not good enough.' Defeat was greeted with fury by frustrated fans who have now seen Sunderland take 17 of the 21 points on offer in the last seven derby encounters. Indeed, the Black Cats have won just 17 of their last 75 league games, five of them against their neighbours, a statistic which provides a damning indictment of Newcastle's lack of progress on the field. The Magpies last week reported profits of £18.7million at a time when its recruitment policy has once again come under close scrutiny. Carver went into Sunday's game with only one recognised central defender and right-back Janmaat having to play in the middle with midfielders Ryan Taylor and Jack Colback operating as full-backs, and he was also without a proven Premier League striker in the 18. Newcastle United manager John Carver had to cope with a weakened defence following injuries . Janmaat gets stuck into a challenge with Sunderland's Steven Fletcher during the derby match . That selection crisis was due in part to suspensions for Fabricio Coloccini and Papiss Cisse and injuries to Steven Taylor, Paul Dummett and Massadio Haidara, as well as midfielders Cheick Tiote, Siem de Jong and Rolando Aarons, a casualty list which has served to expose the lack of depth in a squad assembled on a budget and made up largely of players sold a move to St James' Park as a stepping stone to bigger things. Owner Mike Ashley's tight financial constraints mean where the Magpies were once able to compete for big names - it was they who sparked the bidding war which ultimately led to Wayne Rooney's move to Manchester United from Everton in 2004 - they are now unwilling to do so even with clubs of a similar or lesser stature, and as a result, less able to do so on the pitch. Newcastle have made no secret of their view that the domestic cup competitions are unimportant, and European qualification very nearly ended in disaster during the 2012-13 campaign. Mid-table Premier League status and financial self-sufficiency remain the stated dual focus and as a result, disenchantment on the terraces has reached epidemic levels. It is against that backdrop that Carver is attempting to prove he is the man to replace Alan Pardew at the helm, but a run of two wins from 13 games represents a less than impressive audition despite the mitigating factors.","Sunderland beat a lacklustre Newcastle 1-0 in Tyne-Wear derby .

As he got out of the car, he realised he’d left one rather important item back at his rental home. His golf clubs. Englishman Ian Poulter was so excited to get started at Augusta that he forgot his clubs . CAN FLU-HIT HENRIK FLY? There is a reason why the phrase ‘beware the injured golfer’ has entered the sport’s lexicon. So who among the lame, sick and wounded currently playing down their chances is going to confound his own expectations this week? Listening to Swede Henrik Stenson, who’s just getting over a nasty bout of flu, he fits the bill. Henrik Stenson of Sweden looked less than impressed after coming down with a bout of flu . LOOK OUT FOR TIGER CUBS . Has Tiger Woods finally learned to look up and smell the azaleas? Not only will he play in the traditional par-three tournament for the first time in over a decade but sharing bag-carrying duties will be his two offspring, Charlie and Sam. Do you think there might be one or two photographers who will take an interest? Tiger Woods will be accompanied by his children when he plays the traditional three-par tournament . THE PIONEER GENE . Masters Tuesday saw the 80th anniversary of the most famous shot in the tournament’s history, the one that put the event on the map, when Gene Sarazen made his albatross on the 15th hole in the final round to edge out Craig Wood. Rory McIlroy will impress us all if he completes his career Grand Slam in more dramatic fashion than that. Gene Sarazen played the most impressive shot in the tournaments history with an albatross on the 15th . WAITING FOR SWEET 16 . A practice-round tradition at this grand old tournament is to gather around the beautiful par-three 16th hole and see which players are talented enough to skip their golf balls across the water and on to the green. So far, none has matched the amazing feats of Vijay Singh in 2009 and Martin Kaymer in 2012, whose shots not only reached the green but dropped into the hole. Martin Kaymer of Germany is one of two players to have holed after skipping off the water at the 16th . HAND IT OVER, SIR . As the patrons make their way through the admission gates to Augusta National, the plethora of signs listing the prohibited items offers reassuring confirmation of the list of priorities at the Masters.

"Per Mertesacker is not one to shy away from a verbal confrontation and the defender revealed that bringing back the 'arguing culture' to Arsenal was key to their upturn in results - following a number of heavy defeats. Arsene Wenger's side were thrashed 6-3 by Manchester City and 5-1 by Liverpool last season as they slipped from the top of the summit to a battle for the Champions League places. And Mertesacker, who last season was pictured remonstrating with Mezut Ozil, admits being embarrassed by the bigger teams was the catalyst for a number of much-needed confrontations. Per Mertesacker says Arsenal have brought back the 'arguing culture' after some heavy defeats last season . The central defender gives Mezut Ozil a piece of his mind following Arsenal's heavy defeat at the Etihad . He told the Independent: 'We tried to think what went wrong for us last season, especially when we got beaten heavily by those big teams. Very severe. 'It's always a big discussion. I mean, we are responsible for our performances. No one wants to have such a miserable day again.' 'You need that arguing culture. We lost that at times. It gets personal, and someone gets upset too quickly, but you have to face the truth and have a proper argument. That was normal 10 years ago and it has slightly changed. The German thinks confrontation can be vital for a teams mentality and it has helped Arsenal since . Aaron Ramsey (left), Jack Wilshere and Nicklas Bendtner of Arsenal stand dejected after the fifth City goal . 'We lost that a bit, what is the intention of argument. It's really important, not only in general, but in a footballer's life. It has to get louder sometimes. We need to discuss, to find solutions, to get everyone in one direction.' This season is very different, with an in-form Arsenal closing in on Manchester City in second and showing that they can compete for the Premier League title.# .

"The 79th Masters gets underway on Thursday and the focus will be on Rory McIlroy as the Northern Irishman bids to become only the sixth man in history to claim the career Grand Slam.

"Amir Khan has gone face to face with Adrien Broner ahead of a possible summer fight against the former lightweight world champion. Khan is expected to announce his next opponent imminently, with British rival Kell Brook set to feature on his agenda for a Wembley blockbuster next year. Amir Khan appears on the screen as Adrien Broner urges him to make their fight happen on FaceTime . Broner says, 'Let's get this money', in the short video of their conversation posted on Instagram . Khan hasn't fought since his win over Devon Alexander in December and has struggled to find an opponent . Broner has been relentless in his calling out of Khan since his comfortable win over John Molina Jr . But in the shorter term, the Bolton fighter has held talks with American Broner, who tweeted a video of himself and Khan talking via video. He included the hashtag #BronervsKhan. In the video, Broner tells Khan: ‘Hey, tell them to make the fight, man, let’s get this money.’ It’s by no means certain that the fight will go ahead, with Broner seemingly more keen than Khan. However, the Brit has previously encouraged talk of a bout against a man whose brash manner has made him a big draw in his homeland. Khan is targeting a fight at the end of May before breaking for Ramadan in mid-June, with a distant hope of facing the winner of Floyd Mayweather’s May 2 showdown with Manny Pacquiao. Brook remains the money-spinning fight on the agenda, with Khan having said on Tuesday that he wants to fight the IBF welterweight world champion at Wembley within 12 months. Broner posts a cheeky artist's impression of what he believes would happen should he fight Khan . Khan has said he would love to fight Broner in lieu of not being able to get in the ring with Floyd Mayweather . Khan says he has given his word to his next opponent and will be making an announcement 'very soon' Brook was due to fight in July but revealed he has brought forward his plans following his demolition of Jo Jo Dan last Saturday. He said: ‘I have told Eddie Hearn to get me out as soon as possible and I want to fight twice before the end of the summer, starting at the end of May.’","Adrien Broner posted a video of a FaceTime conversation with Amir Khan .

"Amir Khan has ended speculation over his next opponent by announcing he will fight former light-welterweight world champion Chris Algieri on May 30. The Bolton fighter had earlier this week come under increasing pressure to take on British rival and IBF welterweight champion Kell Brook in June. However, Khan, who was also linked with bouts against Adrien Broner and Keith Thurman, said he was already deep in negotiations to fight somebody else. Amir Khan (left) has announced his next fight will be against Chris Algieri at welterweight on May 30 . Khan's (right) last fight came against Devon Alexander in December, whom he beat to take his record to 30-3 . Algieri (left) lost his last bout against Manny Pacquiao in November - his first defeat in his professional career . Algieri was knocked down six times en route to a heavily lopsided points loss in Macau . And on his wife's YouTube channel Khan announced: 'The next opponent will be Chris Algieri. I will be taking that fight at 147lbs (the welterweight limit).' The fight has yet to be rubber-stamped, but Khan added: 'I'm looking forward to getting this fight announced officially by my manager and advisor Al Haymon. '(His management team) think it's the right fight for me, they want to keep me going.' Algieri's only defeat in his 21-fight professional career came in his last bout against Filipino superstar Manny Pacquiao, who faces Floyd Mayweather in a mega-fight on May 2. Algieri was knocked down six times en route to a heavily lopsided points loss in November last year. Yet Khan believes his American foe is a credible opponent as he wrested the WBO light-welterweight title off the much feared Ruslan Provodnikov in June 2014. Khan said: 'You can class him as an A-class opponent. 'He has fought decent opponents, beaten decent opponents, and just fell short against Manny Pacquiao, which is an A star opponent. 'He's a decent boxer overall. He knows how to box and knows how to move well. He takes a decent amount of shots and he's got a decent amount of power, so I think overall it's going to be a good fight for me.' The 28-year-old hopes to fight in Algieri's home city of New York, with Khan's only previous outing there an 11th-round stoppage of Paulie Malignaggi at Madison Square Garden in May 2010. Adrien Broner (right) had been relentless in calling out of Khan since his comfortable win over John Molina Jr . Khan (pictured in March 2014) hopes to fight Algieri's home city of New York next month . Khan (right) has fought once before in New York - where he defeated Paulie Malignaggi  in May 2010 . This time, though, Khan wants the non-title bout at the Barclays Center as he said: 'We're looking at fighting in New York, I think New York's a great venue for me. 'Having that fight in New York will be good for the UK fans in a way because it will give them a chance to travel and it won't be as far as going to (Las) Vegas. 'This time I'd like to fight at the Barclays Center, which I've never fought at.' Khan has made no secret of his desire to chase lucrative showdowns against Mayweather or Pacquiao and is confident a win over Algieri can lead him to that. 'Hopefully this can lead me on to the bigger fights in the future, which is what I'm looking at,' he added. But Khan's announcement has left IBF welterweight champion Brook disappointed. Sheffield's Brook retained his world strap with a four-round destruction of Jo Jo Dan a week ago and immediately called out regular verbal sparring partner Khan. The two have spent the week trading barbs - with Brook offering a June 13 date at Wembley for an all-British bout - but Khan made it clear he was going his own way when announcing his next opponent on Thursday. The Bolton man said he will face Chris Algieri in New York on May 30 and Brook cannot understand the move. After Kell Brook's victory over Jo Jo Dan on March 1, he called out Amir Khan in a post-match interview . Khan has previously refused a fight with Brook, but now promises it will take place within 12 months . 'If someone said to me you can get five million quid, a world title, fight at Wembley with a fight that every fan wants to see, it's a no-brainer for me,' 28-year-old Brook told BBC 5 Live. 'He's fighting Algieri who didn't win a round against (Manny) Pacquiao, a feather puncher, not a big puncher. It doesn't make sense to me. 'I'm world champion, I'm calling him out, we want the fight, there's a word title and a bagful of money and it doesn't make sense that he's fighting this guy who's bringing nothing to the table. 'He's said he'll fight me before but when it comes to it, I don't get why he doesn't want to fight me. Yes (I feel frustrated), wherever I go it's always Amir Khan, when are you going to fight him? 'He's delicate around the whiskers, he knows I'm a big strong welterweight and he knows I'm coming for that chin of his.' Khan hit back on Twitter, though, saying: 'Seems to me Kel Brook is dying to fight me for the big pay day before he faces a half decent opponent and loses that IBF title.'","Amir Khan will fight Chris Algieri in New York next month .

"Down Augusta way they say the azaleas are in full bloom, which is more than can be said for England’s Justin Rose. A bruising Florida swing last month saw the Englishman fall outside the world’s top 10. For a player who has been virtually a fixture in the top five for the last three years it was certainly a dent to the ego, with the Masters now just around the corner. Rose’s solution to his miserable form — three missed cuts and a 55th-place finish at the Cadillac Championship in four PGA Tour starts — was the time-honoured one. For the past two weeks, the 34-year-old has spent long hours on the practice ground. Justin Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69 at the Shell Houston Open . In the first round of the Shell Houston Open on Thursday there were encouraging signs his decline will prove temporary. Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69, the same score as his playing partner, the ever- consistent Jordan Spieth. ‘It’s certainly a welcome return to the sixties, for it had been a while,’ said Rose, smiling. On a day when American Scott Piercy went round in 63 and Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66, it was hardly surprising the only reporter waiting to talk to Rose was this one. But under the radar is never a bad place to be going to the Masters. The boom and bust years that characterised the first half of Rose’s career meant there was never going to be any feelings of panic following his unusually poor run in the Sunshine State. ‘There’s no doubt I lost my game there but the Florida swing can be unforgiving if you’re slightly off,’ he said. ‘Over the past two weeks I feel like I’ve done some good work and whether I finish well or not here I feel like I’m going in the right direction again. ‘Basically I was getting ahead of the ball at impact, and shots were going left or right, the irons were not solid and the new putter was not working. So we’ve corrected the faults and I’ve gone back to the old putter.’ Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 on Thursday . Does he pay much attention to the world rankings? ‘You notice, for sure,’ he said. ‘I’m very proud of the fact I’ve been in the world’s top five for practically the whole of the last three years. It’s a nice ego thing, so by the end of the year I’m hoping there won’t be any slippage. ‘But right now, I’ve got to focus on my game in the knowledge that the rankings change fast when you’re playing well. I’m in all the tournaments I want to be in, so there’s no need to worry on that score. Typically, your good years are built around four or five really good weeks, so you have to stay patient.’ He’d certainly love for one of those good weeks to be the next one. Rose paid a reconnaissance visit to Augusta last Monday and felt the same old thrill. ‘It’s such a treat to enjoy it when it is quiet, you still pinch yourself,’ he said. ‘I think if I’d had a crystal ball when I was 13 or 14 and it had said I’d get to play Augusta every year, I’d have been very happy with that.’ He’s certainly had his share of adventures during his nine appearances to date. Rose might be the only player in Masters history to have led or had a share of the lead after every round bar the last one. His best chance so far of finishing on top after 72 holes came in 2007, when he stood on the 17th hole tied for the lead only to run up a fatal double-bogey six. Paul Casey celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with two eagle threes in a fine round of 68 . ‘The Masters has probably been less on my mind this year because I am trying to find some form,’ he admitted. ‘But I think the fact I’ve had a number of great rounds there will always stand me in good stead. Regardless of what happens here, I feel comfortable on that course and know I can manage my game even if it’s not 100 per cent. You draw off the energy of the place.’ Mickelson has certainly done that over the years and perhaps the veteran lefty, a three-time Masters champion, is gearing himself up for another run at the green jacket. ‘It was a good start to the tournament and now I’m looking for three more good rounds,’ he said. 'This is a big week for me. I felt the game was close last week. The only thing missing was chipping and short game.' Paul Casey, like Mickelson another former winner of this event, celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with a fine round of 68 notable for two eagle threes. In the afternoon wave, Padraig Harrington and Lee Westwood both made good starts to play their first six holes in two under.","Justin Rose bounced back from Florida misery by carding 69 in Houston .

"Rory McIlroy believes it is 'unthinkable' that he will not win the Masters at some point to complete the career grand slam. And the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at Augusta National in 2011 was the most important day of his career. McIlroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. Rory McIlroy tees off at the Arnold Palmer Invitational golf tournament in Orlando on March 19 . 'For me now it's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved,' the 25-year-old said in an interview with BBC Northern Ireland. 'There's something special I can achieve going into Augusta this year. You are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses, different tests, different conditions. Not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome. It would just be incredible. 'You feel the sense of what can be achieved but I can't think about that too much. I just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as I can and if I can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else's.' McIlroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six Masters appearances, finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round. McIlroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at Augusta later this month . But the 25-year-old cannot picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket. 'During my career, yes it's unthinkable,' he added. 'If I don't win it this year...either it's not the right time or it isn't your time. If I was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket I'd obviously be very, very disappointed. 'And not just one. I feel like it's a course I can do very well at and a golf course I can hopefully win multiple times on. Obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others.' McIlroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago, only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner Charl Schwartzel. But he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the US Open two months later, before adding wins in the 2012 US PGA and both the Open and US PGA last year. McIlroy is hoping to emulate the likes of Jack Nicklaus (above) by winning all four major titles . 'I think it was the most important day of my career,' he added. 'If I hadn't had the whole unravelling and say I just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one, I might not have learnt as much. 'But for it all to come apart how it did I learnt an awful lot. I learnt so much about myself and my game and what I needed to do differently the next time I was in that position. 'Luckily it didn't take me long to get into a position like that again where I was leading a major and we know how that one played out. I was able to get over the line pretty comfortably.' McIlroy's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to Caroline Wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in February. McIlroy's extraordinary success last year came he called off his wedding to Caroline Wozniacki . And he hopes he can again use the golf course as his 'sanctuary' from the pressure and hype surrounding Augusta. 'The golf course was my sanctuary, it was where I could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours that I am out there and it helped.

'I was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and I think it will be the same at Augusta because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen.

"We're suckers for athletes who play with a lot of heart. In Erik Compton's case, make that plural: hearts. He'll tee off this week at the Masters on his third. The 35-year-old veteran would rather be known for his golf than what he's had to overcome to earn a spot in the field. But Compton isn't shy about sharing his story, either. Erik Compton shares a joke with Jim Furyk during a practice round at Augusta ahead of the Masters . A first heart transplant at 12, then a second in 2008 after a major heart attack - what doctors call a 'widow-maker' - while driving home from a lesson with longtime coach and close pal Charlie DeLucca. He's been trying make up for lost time ever since. 'It's hard, but it's also a great thing,' Compton said on Monday after a practice round at Augusta National. 'There's two sides to me. I'm a competitor and a sports person, and I'm also the recipient of two transplants, and I know what that involves. So when you put them together, it does make a little bit of spaghetti in my mind sometimes you know.' 'I'll take it,' he added a moment later. It's not like Compton had a choice. He recovered from his childhood setback to become the No 1-ranked junior in the United States at 18, then a two-time All-American at Georgia. Compton, 35, is set to make his first appearance at the famous tournament this week . But he's spent most of the intervening years battling on minor league circuits, then becoming an advocate and spokesman for Donate Life, an alliance for national and local groups raising awareness about organ and tissue donation. In a nice bit of serendipity, his first appearance in the Masters coincides with Donate Life Month. But it's already a full-time campaign for Compton - he's been displaying the organization's logo on his shirt sleeve for a while. All of those efforts paid big dividends last year, when he carved out a spot on the PGA Tour and nearly stole the show at the US Open. His runner-up finish at Pinehurst nudged Compton and his story into the spotlight - and earned him an invitation to Augusta. It was something he'd longed to do since watching the tournament on TV as a kid. 'For me, it was a bit difficult to watch so many years and think, I'm never going to play in the Masters, just because of other issues that I've had. But yet, I just love to watch the Masters. So it's going to be weird,' he said to laughter, 'not watching the Masters this year.' Compton's wife, Barbara, and parents Peter and Eli won't be tuning in this year, either, making the drive up from Florida to watch Erik play in person. It's a well-deserved reward to be sure, since all of them had a hand in the push-pull climb toward the top of the golf hill. The veteran has had two heart transplants, but wants to focus on the week ahead, rather than his journey . After walking most his son's practice round, Peter Compton recalled how motivated Erik was, no matter how tough things seemed. Six months after Hurricane Andrew hit the Miami area in 1992, forcing the family out of their home and into temporary housing alongside a golf course near Doral, he took his son to play a few holes. 'We were in a cart and back then, he liked driving more than playing,' Peter recalled. 'But every time we'd leave the tee, he'd drive to his ball, and he was already hitting it 225 (yards) or so. So finally, about the third time it happened, I had to remind him, ""Hey, stop here. Let me play MY tee shots!"" 'He started playing junior tournaments in the area after that and a lot of the fathers would come up and tell me what a terrific story it was,' Peter said. 'But it wasn't long after that Erik started winning those tournaments. ... He could have sat back, said he'd been dealt a bad hand and did nothing. So I think that's what we're most proud of - he refused to give up.' Compton chats with his caddie as he walks the famous course ahead of his first ever round at the Masters . Compton tries to strike a delicate balance between those accomplishments and his aspirations. After a promising 2014 campaign on the big tour, his breakthrough performance at Pinehurst - only the second major he qualified to play. But Compton struggled this year, opening the 2015 season with a tie for 10th. He then wrestled with his driver and missed the cut in his next five tournaments. At the moment, most of his energy and focus are devoted to keeping the ball in play . 'I'm here in the press room at the Masters, and that's a great thing,' he said. 'But I don't look at myself as somebody who is a role model ... I look at myself as a golfer who has used golf as a means to maybe put some of the tough stuff that's happened to me in the past. Golf's been very therapeutic for me over the years. 'As I'm sitting here today,' Compton concluded, 'I view myself as somebody who is going to try to do the best he can to compete in the Masters.'","Erik Compton has had two heart transplants, the last in 2008 .

"Lydia Ko tied Annika Sorenstam's LPGA Tour record with her 29th consecutive round under par, shooting a 1-under 71 on Thursday at the ANA Inspiration. The 17-year-old Ko saved par on the par-4 seventh - her 16th hole - after hitting an approach shot through a gap in the trees. She hit a 6-iron to 18 inches to set up a birdie on the 158-yard, par-3 eighth and closed with a par on the par-5 ninth. The top-ranked New Zealander started the streak in the first round of her victory in the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship last year. Her worldwide streak is 32, counting the three rounds she played in her victory in the Ladies European Tour's New Zealand Women's Open this year.

Sorenstam set the LPGA Tour mark in 2004. Ko also won the Women's Australian Open winner in February the week before her New Zealand victory, she was a stroke behind leaders Charley Hull, Na Yeon Choi and Austin Ernst halfway through the first round in the first major championship of the season. Opening in strong morning wind at tree-lined Mission Hills, Ko made a 14-foot birdie putt on her first hole and got to 2 under with an 8-footer on the 12th. She bogeyed the par-4 13th, hitting into the front right bunker and leaving herself a 25-foot par putt. After playing partner Lexi Thompson hit into the water in front of the green on the 133-yard 14th with the wind gusting to 25-30 mph, Ko hit pin-high to the right and made the 15-footer for birdie. Former world No 1 Sorenstam set her LPGA tour record of consecutive rounds under par in 2004 . Defending champion Lexi Thomas could only manage a round of 72 on her opener . Ko bogeyed three of the next four holes to make the turn at 1 over. Playing into a right-to-left crosswind on the par-4 15th, she drove into the front of the left fairway bunker. Close to the lip of the bunker, she chipped 30 yards to the fairway and hit her third to 35 feet. On the par-4 16th, she drove to the left, with the ball stopping in rough on the front edge of a bunker. Her fairway wood with the ball below her feet ended up short of the green in the left rough and she hit her third to 20 feet.

"Crystal Palace are convinced Yannick Bolasie will learn from Wilfried Zaha’s mistakes and not jump into a dream move too soon. The electrifying winger has dazzled for the Eagles since Alan Pardew took over in January and has been watched by Liverpool and Newcastle this season. Bolasie has the opportunity to shine against Manchester City on Monday night and his manager - who was firm in the stance that it would take astronomical money to tempt Palace into selling - wants the 25-year-old to continue honing his skills at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace are convinced Yannick Bolasie will learn from Wilfried Zaha’s mistakes and not jump ship . Electrifying winger has dazzled for the Eagles since Alan Pardew took over the club in January . ‘If he is going to go, he’s going to have to for a lot of money,’ Pardew said. ‘I think Yannick knows he needs to develop more to go to a top club. I actually think top clubs probably appreciate that.’ Zaha made the £10million switch to Manchester United two seasons ago but managed just two Premier League starts under David Moyes and sealed a permanent move back home this February after impressing on loan. Many point towards Zaha’s troubling spell in the north-west as serving only to curb his development, and Pardew believes last week’s announcement of post-tax profits of £17m means Bolasie will stay in south London when clubs inevitably come knocking this summer. He has two years to run on his contract. Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United in two years with the club . Louis Van Gaal told Zaha he wasn't part of his plans after Capital One Cup snub . ‘He is a player who can change games and it brings unbelievable value to him. It’ll have to be a very, very big fee trust me,’ Pardew added. ‘The club is on a great financial footing. We are trying not just to improve the team but the facilities. It is not just the stadium but here at the training ground and grow the club as quickly as we can. ‘We have got a good base of players here and three or four additions to the group in the summer, we could be strong candidates for the top ten.’ Pardew admits it would have to take a very, very big fee to lure Bolasie away from Selhurst Park .","Winger Yannick Bolasie has excelled under new manager Alan Pardew .

"FA Cup semi-finalists Reading still have lingering relegation worries in the Championship after they threw away a 1-0 lead to draw 1-1 with Cardiff at the Madejski Stadium. Reading took the lead with only four minutes gone when Pavel Pogrebnyak got a touch to Garath McCleary's nod-down to divert the ball past Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall. But they allowed a mediocre Cardiff side to snatch a point in the 90th minute when Conor McAleny rifled in a shot from Aron Gunnarsson's precise pass. Cardiff's Conor McAleny (left) celebrates after scoring a late equaliser against Reading . Reading: Federici, Gunter, Pearce, Hector, Obita, McCleary (Norwood 74'), Ake, Akpan, Robson-Kanu (Blackman 85'), Mackie (Appiah 68'), Pogrebnyak . Subs not used: Yakubu, Karacan, Knight, Andersen .

Subs not used: Adeyemi, O'Keefe, Moore, Gabbidon. Goals: McAleny 90' Referee: Scott Duncan . Attendance: 17,953 . Reading face Arsenal in their last-four clash at Wembley on April 18. On their previous semi-final appearance, in 1927, they lost 3-0 to eventual winners Cardiff at Molineux. As Reading's cup displays have been impressive, though, their league form has been patchy. They had won only two of their previous nine Championship matches, losing six of them. Cardiff's season has been one of inconsistency, too, but they arrived at the Madejski Stadium on an unbeaten run of three matches. They were also undefeated on their travels for five games, winning their past three. Reading made the early running and were rewarded in only the fourth minute when they went ahead. Jordan Obita crossed from the left, McCleary nodded it forward and Pogrebnyak guided it past Marshall for his third goal in two matches. Cardiff, beaten 2-1 at home by Reading in the cup fourth round in January, replied quickly. McAleny tried a snapshot from the edge of the Reading area but his effort was half-blocked and goalkeeper Adam Federici gathered comfortably. Reading could have stretched their lead when captain Alex Pearce rose to meet a McCleary corner but fellow centre-back Michael Hector got there before him and glanced his header wide. Cardiff tried hard to get back into the game but had little joy. Fabio cut in from the left flank but his powerful strike was blocked by Pearce at the near post, and Peter Whittingham's dangerous free-kick was neatly caught by Federici. Pavel Pogrebnyak celebrates scoring for Reading against Cardiff . Reading continued to assert control after the break, with Chelsea loanee Nathan Ake impressing on his debut in midfield. Most of Reading's best creative moves were channelled through him. Cardiff relied on the swift counter-attack, with Joe Ralls almost setting free McAleny. But his final pass carried too much pace and, with McAleny unable to retrieve it, the chance went begging. An opportunity also went astray at the other end, when Bruno Ecuele-Manga's poor pass was intercepted by McCleary but the Reading winger hesitated too long before firing a shot wide of Marshall's far post. Cardiff responded with a low shot from Craig Noone, which Federici did well to save, and a header from Ecuele-Manga from another Whittingham free-kick, which drifted wide. Reading went much closer in the closing stages. Substitute Kwesi Appiah, on debut on loan from Crystal Palace, forced a fine stop from Marshall and Hector nodded a McCleary corner into the ground and up against the crossbar. But Cardiff grabbed a draw right at the end from McAleny's fine finish from the edge of the home area.","Conor McAleny scores stoppage time equaliser for Cardiff .

"Liverpool's players must focus on getting themselves and the club into the semi-finals of the FA Cup rather than Steven Gerrard, according to Reds legend Robbie Fowler. Gerrard will leave Anfield at the end of the season to join Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy and the skipper is hoping to bow out in style by leading Brendan Rodgers' side to the final at Wembley. But ahead of Wednesday night's quarter-final replay with Blackburn, Fowler has warned Gerrard's team-mates not to concentrate on providing the 34-year-old with a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (right) trains alongside Rickie Lambert at Melwood on Monday . Gerrard will miss Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final replay with Blackburn because of suspension . Reds legend Robbie Fowler, pictured with Kenny Dalglish, says Liverpool's players must not focus on Gerrard . Fowler told goal.com: 'Everyone would absolutely love Steven to win it, what with this being his last season and possibly last game, and hopefully that will be the case. 'But Liverpool have got to get themselves into the position where they can't do this just for Steven Gerrard. They've got to do it for every individual involved with the club. That's the way it should be.' Gerrard will miss the trip to Ewood Park as he serves the second match of a three-game suspension and Fowler hopes that Jordan Henderson and Co put their missing captain to the back of their minds . 'If you put too much effort in for one man, maybe you can get a little bit too excited or overboard,' added Fowler. 'As much as it would be Steven's last game, they've got to get past that and just do it for themselves. 'In an ideal world, they'll do it, and no-one would love it more than me. Steven deserves to go out on a high but they've got to do it for themselves. It's not all about Steven.' Fowler has also urged Raheem Sterling to end his contract wrangle and commit his future to the club after he rejected a new deal worth £100,000-a-week. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has rejected a new £100,000-a-week deal to stay at Anfield . Fowler believes Sterling, pictured training on Monday, should stay at Liverpool to develop his game . Writing in his column for the Daily Mirror, Fowler said: 'I think it’s nonsense to suggest Sterling will have to go elsewhere to win trophies and fulfil all these dreams he’s apparently got. 'In the space of two seasons, with a very, very young team that will only get better, they should have won the league, should have beaten Chelsea in a semi to get to Wembley... and should play in an FA Cup Final there in May. 'I was brought up at Anfield and still work there, so what else am I going to think?, but he’d be crazy to go at this stage in his development, especially because he’s being guided by a special manager who has already turned Luis Suarez into one of the best players in the world... and earned Luis the money to go with that status.'","Liverpool face Blackburn in an FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday .

"Quiz question. Which player is the second-highest scorer in the country this season? Stand up and take a bow anyone who came up with Benik Afobe, who was one of Arsenal’s own before they loaned him to MK Dons and sold him to Wolves. Afobe is young, electric-paced and on 28 goals this season - one behind man-of-the-moment Harry Kane of Tottenham and England. Bakary Sako celebrates after scoring Wolves second goal in a 2-1 win at Nottingham Forest on Good Friday . Sako doubled Wolves' advantage from the penalty spot after he was fouled by Forest's Henri Lansbury . Nottingham Forest (4-1-4-1): Darlow 6.5; Mancienne 6.5, Wilson 6, Lascelles 6.5, Lichaj 7; Gardner 6; Burke 7 (Walker, 76), Lansbury 5.5, Osborn 5 (Paterson, 57, 6), Antonio 5.5 (Blackstock, 83); Akpom 6 . Subs not used: Fox, Vaughan, Hobbs, Evtimov . Goal: Blackstock 90+4 . Booked: Gardner, Lascelles . Wolves (4-4-2): Ikeme 6.5; Iorfa 7, Baath 7, Stearman 7.5, Golbourne 7; Sako 7, Price 6.5, McDonald 6.5, Henry 7 (van la Parra, 66, 5); Afobe 8 (Doherty, 83), Dicko 7.5 (Edwards, 66, 5.5) Subs not used: Doyle, Ebanks-Landell, Hause, Kuszczak. Goals: Afobe 46, Sako 72 . Booked: Price . Ref: Andy D’Urso 6 . Man of the match: Afobe . If he keeps this up, Afobe might even be able to inspire Wolves all the way into the Premier League. What a bargain for £2million, too. Having scored 19 times for MK, the 22-year-old striker has nine goals in 15 appearances for Kenny Jackett’s Wanderers. He has a goalscoring knack, beautifully illustrated 30 seconds into the second half when he collected the ball round the centre circle and started running. Back-tracking Forest defenders held off and held off until, boom, Afobe took a pot-shot and Karl Darlow retrieved the ball which had just avoided his finger tips. Suddenly a tight, strangely underwhelming, match, had a breakthrough and Wolves duly capitalised on it as Bakary Sako doubled the lead from the penalty spot. They are building up a head of steam as the Skybet Championship enters the final weeks with one defeat in nine. Jackett has steered his team from the blind side with remarkable efficiency. A trip across to the East Midlands could have been a very tricky encounter considering Forest’s resurgence under Dougie Freeman. The news that owner Fawaz al Hasawi wants Freedman to stay beyond the summer hardly comes as a surprise. More importantly, from the supporters’ point of view, the manager is making all the right noises about triggering his year’s option too. The Freedman effect is tangible at the City Ground, even if this turned out to be the first real blip. Henri Lansbury has been back to something like his best after a forgettable first chunk of the season so this was a step back for him, too. If anything illustrates BP and AP – before and after Stuart Pearce – then it is Lansbury’s match stats. Before Pearce’s sacking Lansbury had 10 yellow cards and five goals to his name. Since then he has picked up one more booking and scored seven times. Admittedly he went into this Midlands derby on the back of a six-match goal drought and it was his clumsy challenge on Sako which had referee Andy D’Urso pointing to the spot. Wolves defender Dominic Iorfa (right) battles for the ball with Forest striker Chuba Akpom . Danny Batth (left) tackles Akpom during their Good Friday encounter at the City ground . Gary Gardner attempts a scissor kick as Forest look to breach the Wolves defence . A bad day at the office, then, for Forest. Maths and time is against them making the top six but beating Wolves would have had the double impact of keeping them in the chasing pack and denting the top-six hopes of Kenny Jackett’s team. Certainly the 27,000 bumper Good Friday crowd who braved the drizzle arrived in hope and expectation because Freedman’s other achievement since his arrival has been a transformation of home results. Five straight victories at the City Ground after a similar winless run had injected optimism. By the final whistle there were resigned expressions on faces again despite a 90th minute consolation from Dexter Blackstock. Yet it had started promisingly. Michail Antonio might have scored in the opening minutes although it would have been a fluke. The Forest attacker blocked Carl Ikeme’s clearance and the ball ballooned up and could have gone anywhere. Benik Afobe celebrates after putting Wolves 1-0 ahead at the City Ground on Good Friday . Afobe (centre) gave the visitors the lead with a right footed shot from outside the box . The Wolves striker (centre) is mobbed by his team-mates after putting them ahead in the second half . The home side also had their ‘A’ man and, like Afobe there is an Arsenal connection. Chuba Akpom was on the wanted list of many clubs in January but Forest managed to persuade the Gunners to loan him out to them. He was named from the start but struggled to impose himself. His best moment was a penalty claim when he went down under a challenge from Chris Burke but D’Urso was having none of it. Highlights for Forest included a long-range effort by Michael Mancienne which was pushed wide by Ikeme while Lansbury shot over the bar from the edge of the area. Wolves thought they had scored in the first half when Kevin Wilson’s slip let in Afobe. Darlow saved the shot and Eric Lichaj blocked the follow-up by Nouha Dicko. Next up for the Wanderers is Leeds at home on Easter Monday. Neil Redfearn was an interested spectator on Good Friday and he needs no telling it will be a toughie.","Benik Afobe fired Wolves ahead on 46 minutes with a low right-footed shot .

"Blackburn Rovers are in familiar territory facing an FA Cup replay against one of the country's best, only this time it's Liverpool and not Manchester City. Last season, the Championship side held eventual Premier League champions City to a draw, but were then thrashed 5-0 in the return. None-the-less, midfielder Tom Cairney didn't come away from the game empty handed and grabbed Yaya Toure's shirt at the end, which takes pride of place framed in his living room. 'I don't know what he did with mine, I think he needed something to clean his car with!' Cairney jokes, hoping that there will not be a repeat when they host Liverpool on Wednesday in their FA Cup quarter-final replay. 'When we went to Anfield in the last match we were scared of failing and scared of getting hammered. That's part of what makes you dig even deeper against those sides.' Raheem Sterling's contract negotiations have dominated the headlines in the past fortnight . Tom Cairney, who will face Sterling on Wednesday night, has sympathy for the young winger . Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer and his players are also hoping the Liverpool players' studs will sink a little further into the Ewood Park turf, currently in a sorry state, to help their cause. 'Against Brighton in our last game there you had to take three touches to control the ball,' Cairney explains. 'Personally, it's not what I like, but if it takes Philippe Coutinho a few extra seconds to control the ball then I will be happy with that.' It does not suit Cairney, 24, who is a ball-playing central midfielder with a sweet left foot. But he is also not afraid to get stuck in, learned when he had a taste of the top flight as a teenager at Hull City when Phil Brown threw him in as the club were heading down. Since then, after moving to Blackburn, on loan first and permanently last summer, he would kill for a chance to get back there. One might expect him, then, to be incredulous that Liverpool's Raheem Sterling is turning down contracts worth £100,000-per-week but Cairney feels sympathy instead. 'I know it sounds stupid more than one hundred grand a week but that's the world we live in and that's football,' he says. 'It's up to him. If he stays at Liverpool he will be one of the top players for the next eight years. 'He might be thinking the top dog at Liverpool is on a lot more and he feels he's doing a job just as well. To turn down one hundred grand a week in our world is crazy but he's in the top three 20-year-olds in the world.' Sterling shares a laugh in training ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup replay with Blackburn on Wednesday . Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal, admitting he was 'flattered' by their interest . Part of Sterling's issue is that boss Brendan Rodgers sometimes plays him as a wing-back instead of up front, where the player prefers. 'I was pleased when he played wing-back against us in the first match,' Cairney adds. 'He was out of the way a little bit.' Cairney has his own taste of superstardom, too, if only around Blackburn's Brockhall Training Ground where he goes by the nickname of 'Justin Bieber.' When he first joined the club, the other players dug up pictures that revealed his uncanny resemblance to the Canadian pop star. 'It was on my old Facebook. I had a basketball vest on and shades and a cap backwards,' Cairney says. 'I didn't have any stubble because I can't grow it so they thought I looked a bit like Bieber. 'He's not bad with the ladies is he? And I like a few of his songs so it could have been worse.' Cairney and Sterling — and Bieber, come to that -— were not born the last time, before this season, Blackburn met Liverpool in an FA Cup quarter-final. That was in 1958 when Ron Clayton and Ally MacLeod scored late on for Blackburn to overturn Bobby Murdoch's early Liverpool goal. Yet Cairney's upbringing was rich in the competition due to his father Ian. 'He used to go on about the FA Cup all the time when I was little,' Cairney says. Blackburn were hammered by Edin Dzeko (centre) and Co in a FA Cup replay last season . 'Some people don't see it as big as they used to in the olden days.

"London Broncos are set to give a debut to Leeds teenager Elliot Minchella, who has joined them on loan to the end of the season. The 19-year-old loose forward has made six substitute Super League appearances but has failed to break into the Rhinos team so far this year. London coach Andrew Henderson said: 'Elliot comes highly recommended from Leeds and has come through a good system. I feel Elliot will add competition for places and some quality to our forward pack.' Elliot Minchella has joined London Broncos on loan from Leeds until the end of the season . Minchella and his Leeds team-mate Zak Hardaker remain the subject of an investigation by the Rhinos into an assault. Both were released by police after paying compensation to their victim but Leeds are conducting their own inquiries and are expected to deliver an outcome next week. Minchella has been named in Henderson's 19-man squad for Friday's game with Featherstone. 'I'm really excited to be coming down to London,' he said. 'It's a massive change of scenery but I'm going to learn a lot from being down here. 'It's really good for my development to play with some great players down here and hopefully I'll do a good job for London.'","Leeds teenager moves to London Broncos until end of the season .

"Stuart McCall on Sunday night admitted the finest performance of his short Ibrox reign left him with ‘goosebumps’ and a growing belief that he can steer revitalised Rangers up to the Premiership. On a day which ended with Ibrox captain Lee McCulloch publicly apologising for a reckless red card, first-half goals from Kenny Miller and Haris Vuckic were enough to ensure the captain’s 44th-minute folly did not prevent Rangers securing an important three points against Championship title winners Hearts. Genero Zeefuik pulled back a late consolation for Robbie Neilson’s men but Rangers closed out the game to make it three wins in a row as McCall’s improving side leapfrogged Hibs into second place with six games remaining. Kenny Miller (left) celebrates scoring for Rangers against Championship winners Hearts on Sunday . And last night the delighted Ibrox caretaker boss admitted he is starting to trust that his players can take charge of their own destiny in the end-of-season play-offs. ‘I’m beginning to trust the players the more and more I work with them,’ said McCall. ‘I’m very proud of the team and the fans. Hearts had won nine on the bounce before today and they are champions for a reason. They’ve won 26 out of 30 games. ‘But we scored two terrific goals and the tempo and passing in the first half in particular was outstanding. Haris Vuckic (centre) scored the decisive goal for Rangers in the 2-1 victory that moved them into second . ‘The second half was about guts and desire and being a good team-mate. ‘It was a hard shift and there were a lot of tired boys at full-time — but it was a deserved win in the end. ‘I’ve got to say that was probably the first time for a long, long, long time — probably since I was playing — that I have been out there and got goosebumps. I thought the boys deserved their applause at the end. ‘Hibs have lost three on the bounce now and we’ve won three on the bounce, so that shows how things can change quickly in football. Rangers were reduced to 10 men when captain Lee McCulloch was dismissed from the pitch . Staurt McCall says the Gers captain apologised to him as well as the players after the incident . ‘We’ve got a tough game at Queen of the South on Thursday and all we want is to keep improving. ‘But we can take belief, confidence and momentum forward from this.’ After the match, McCulloch made a brief appearance on BT Sport to apologise for his red card for an elbow on Osman Sow. He said: ‘I felt as though I was caught in no-man’s land, if he won the header there would have been a runner in. Genero Zeefuik tapped in from close range as Hearts scored a consolation against Rangers . ‘There was no intent whatsoever, I can say that honestly, but obviously I’m disappointed. ‘I’ve apologised to all the management, all my team-mates, I feel as if I’ve let myself down.’ McCulloch is out of contract at the end of this season and when asked if he would like to remain at Ibrox, he said: ‘Of course I want to stay here. I’ve got a part to play I feel for the run-in and get the club back to where we want to be.’ McCall plans to watch the incident again before deciding what action, if any, to take against his captain, who now misses Thursday night’s match at Queen of the South. Victory for Rangers moves them into second and continues their resurgence under Stuart McCall . He said: ‘I missed the challenge but the referee said he’s caught the boy with an elbow. ‘Jig’s come in and apologised to me and the team afterwards, so it must have merited a red card. ‘Am I disappointed that such an experienced player would do that at such an important time of the season? That’s a good question but I’ve not had time to think about it. I’ll look at it then speak to him.’ McCulloch walks off the pitch after he was shown the red card on Easter Sunday . But McCall praised the attitude of the players who remained on the park and won three points. ‘Attitude and desire has got to be a gimme if you want to play here at Rangers,’ he added. ‘It’s easy to buckle and go into your shell when things aren’t going well but we saw today people puffed out their chests. ‘They are enjoying themselves because of the way we are playing and results. But they know if they don’t perform like that every week they will be out of the team.’","Rangers boosted their chances of promotion with a win against Hearts .

"Fourth-place Monaco missed the chance to close the gap in the French title race after drawing 0-0 at home to Montpellier on Tuesday. A win would have moved Monaco level on points with third-place Marseille, but coach Leonardo Jardim's side failed to break down a well-organized Montpellier side, which is in seventh place. The visitors missed a penalty early in the second half when Paraguay striker Lucas Barrios fired a penalty over the crossbar. Substitute Dimitar Berbatov responds as Monaco are held to a goalless draw with Montpellier at Stade Louis II . Result sees the Principality side remain in fourth spot, behind Marseille, Lyon and Paris St germain . Montpellier forward Lucas Barrios reacts after missing a penalty to put the visitors in the lead .

The draw means Monaco is two points behind Marseille, six behind Lyon and seven behind league leader Paris Saint-Germain. Teenage striker Anthony Martial, who had netter five goals in his past four games, started ahead of 34-year-old striker Dimitar Berbatov. In a tight first half, midfielder Morgan Sanson forced Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic into a smart save, while Monaco left back Layvin Kurzawa headed in a cross moments before the interval, but his effort was ruled out for offside. Montpellier had a penalty claim turned down early in the second half. But moments later referee Said Enjimi pointed to the spot after midfielder Nabil Dirar barged into Bryan Dabo. But Barrios missed the chance for this 12th goal in the 24th game of the campaign when he fired his shot high over high over the crossbar. Meanwhile, second-division Auxerre beat French Cup holder Guingamp 1-0 to reach the final.

The France international was carried off on a stretcher early in the 4-3 win against Leicester City and missed his country's friendlies against Brazil and Denmark.

"Blackburn Rovers boss Gary Bowyer has challenged star striker Jordan Rhodes to become an FA Cup hero as the Championship underdogs face Liverpool in the first full house at Ewood Park since 2011. Rovers rejected a £12million bid from Hull City for Scotland international Rhodes at the start of the season — a decision that will be vindicated should the 17-goal striker score the winner in Wednesday night's sixth-round replay and take his side to Wembley. ‘Someone has got to be the hero for Blackburn Rovers,’ said Bowyer. ‘We will need heroes in terms of defending and work-rate, but we also need a match-winner and there is probably no-one better than Jordan Rhodes. Hopefully he can step up and have his name in lights.’ Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer has said Jordan Rhodes (centre) can become an Ewood Park hero . Rhodes goes into the FA Cup replay on the back of scoring in Blackburn's 3-0 win over Leeds . Rovers were a laughing stock when they were last in the FA Cup quarter-finals in 2013 and only 8,000 turned up at Ewood Park to see them lose to Millwall, but Bowyer said: ‘There will be an extra 20,000 people in the stadium compared to that game against Millwall. 'I think it’s recognition from the supporters who have realised the amount of hard work that’s gone into what we’re trying to do, myself and the staff.’ Blackburn’s run is even more impressive because of a restricted squad of 24 players due to breaching Financial Fair Play rules. They also have injuries to Josh King, Chris Taylor, Rudy Gestede and Grant Hanley. Rovers boss Bowyer believes his side will be buoyed by the 'extra 20,000 people' at Ewood Park .","Gary Bowyer hopes Jordan Rhodes can fire Blackburn into next round .

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has warned his side must overcome a difficult obstacle at Crystal Palace to avoid losing yet more ground to their rivals. Fading champions City had to watch in frustration on Saturday, not only as Chelsea extended their lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League, but as Arsenal and Manchester United shunted them down to fourth. Slipping to such a position was not in the script when City pulled level with Chelsea on New Year's Day and any further slips would increase the pressure on Pellegrini significantly. Manuel Pellegrini has warned his side must overcome a difficult obstacle at Crystal Palace . Manchester City manager Pellegrini does not want his side to lose any more ground in the race for the title . With the Manchester derby coming next week, City can ill afford to drop points at Selhurst Park on Monday but Pellegrini knows the Eagles have become a tough proposition under Alan Pardew. Pellegrini said: 'Maybe they are playing different. They are in a good moment and they are playing with a lot of trust. 'With the other manager also Crystal Palace was a difficult team, but now they are playing at home.' City laboured to a 3-0 win over Palace at the Etihad Stadium in December in what proved Neil Warnock's penultimate match in charge. Pardew was appointed early in the new year and since then they have proved highly resilient, losing just three times in the Premier League and removing relegation fears. The Monday fixture has meant both sides have had to be patient for their return to action after the international break. It is a wait that could have been advantageous in terms of extra rest had their rivals lost over the weekend.

The Chilean said: 'I don't think we have excuses about those things. We are going to play the last game of this matchday but that doesn't matter. 'It is not an excuse and not an advantage. All the national players arrived back on Wednesday - most of them - so every team had three or four days to prepare. It is not so important.'

"Playing video games makes you better at learning than non-gamers, a study has claimed. Research found that gaming boosts the ability to learn a number of tasks more accurately, and possibly puts gamers in an 'expert category' of problem solving. But the researchers note they are not quite sure if gaming makes people learn skills better - or if people who learn skills better are more likely to become gamers. Playing video games (stock image shown) may not only improve the ability to perform visual tasks, but also the learning ability for those skills, a study by Brown University in Rhode Island has claimed . The research was carried out by scientists at Brown University in Rhode Island. To conduct the study, the researchers pitted nine frequent gamers against a control group of nine people who game rarely, if ever. They participated in a two-day trial of visual task learning. Subjects were shown an on-screen ‘texture’ of either visual or horizontal lines and had to quickly point out - in a fraction of a second - the one area where an anomalous texture appeared. Parents are in danger of being reported to police by their children's head teachers if they allow them to play video games for over 18s. A letter sent by a group of schools in Cheshire raised concerns about the 'levels of violence and sexual content' young people are being exposed to by playing games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, which are renowned for their violent characters and have an 18 classification. It warns that if teachers are made aware their pupils have been playing these video games they will contact police and social services. The letter, sent by Nantwich Education Partnership, said allowing children to play these type of games on Xboxes and Playstations is deemed 'neglectful'. In visual processing research this is a standard protocol called a ‘texture discrimination task.’ Prior studies have shown that people can be trained to improve their performance in the task, but if they move on to a second task too quickly, it can interfere with the learning process. The researchers wanted to find out if gamers could overcome this interference better, compared to non-gamers. And the results showed that gamers managed to improve performance on both tasks, while non-gamers did what was expected. That is, they improved on the second task they trained on, but not on the first. Learning the second task interfered with learning the first. The data show that gamers on average improved their combination of speed and accuracy by about 15 per cent on their second task and about 11 per cent on their first task. Non-gamers produced the same average 15 per cent improvement on their second task, but they actually got a bit worse on the first task they learned, by about 5 per cent. Research subjects were shown an on-screen texture of short lines - either vertical or horizontal, first one then the other - and were asked to spot anomalies. Their responses were measured in milliseconds. Gamers were shown to be more successful when learning both tasks than non-gamers . Despite the small number of participants, the results proved statistically significant. ‘When we study perceptual learning we usually exclude people who have tons of video game playing time because they seem to have different visual processing. They are quicker and more accurate,' said senior author Dr Yuka Sasaki, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown University. ‘But they may be in an expert category of visual processing. ‘We sometimes see that an expert athlete can learn movements very quickly and accurately and a musician can play the piano at the very first sight of the notes very elegantly, so maybe the learning process is also different. ‘Maybe they can learn more efficiently and quickly as a result of training.’ The exact neural mechanisms underlying visual or perceptual learning are not yet known, Dr Sasaki said, but the study suggests that gamers may have a more efficient process for hardwiring their visual task learning than non-gamers. ‘It may be possible that the vast amount of visual training frequent gamers receive over the years could help contribute to honing consolidation mechanisms in the brain, especially for visually developed skills,’ the researchers wrote. After training on both backgrounds, testing showed that video gamers had done better at learning the first and second. Non-gamers actually did worse on the first. But it was unresolved whether video games improve visual learning or whether good visual learners tend to play more video games . Being certain will require more research. Importantly, the study doesn't prove whether playing video games improves learning ability or whether people with an innate ability become gamers because they find gaming more rewarding. The study also has a stark gender imbalance between the nearly all-male gamer group and the nearly all-female non-gamer group. But the researchers could not find evidence in the literature for gender differences in perceptual learning that would make this disparity worrisome. By documenting these and other apparent cognitive differences between gamers and non-gamers, the field is discovering that there is more to video games than merely passing the time, lead author and graduate student Aaron Berard said. ‘A lot of people still view video games as a time-wasting activity even though research is beginning to show their beneficial aspects,’ Mr Berard said. ‘If we can demonstrate that video games may actually improve some cognitive functioning, perhaps we, as a society, can embrace newer technology and media with positive application.’","Researchers at Brown University studied how people learned tasks .

"Andros Townsend admitted he had devoted plenty of thought to his cheeky retaliation against Paul Merson. ‘That tweet has been going over in my head,’ said Townsend, who followed up his spectacular equaliser in Italy by hitting Twitter to strike back at criticism from the former Arsenal and England midfielder. ‘As soon at the goal went in, I was just desperate to get that tweet out. I’m eagerly awaiting his response. I haven’t seen it yet. Andros Townsend scores England's equaliser in their 1-1 friendly draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday night . Townsend celebrates his strike with Tottenham Hotspur team-mates Ryan Mason (left) and Kyle Walker . In his column for skysports.com, Merson wrote: 'If Andros Townsend can get in then it opens it up for anybody. We are not picking players who are playing well for their clubs – he got taken off after 30 minutes the other week against United. 'The England manager is there watching the game and he still gets picked. Townsend and Kyle Walker were the worst two players on the pitch. 'How can you tell me that a manager goes and watches Man United against Tottenham, the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes, the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full-back for England and Ashley Young doesn’t get in the squad?' ‘He said when the squad was announced that I should be “nowhere near the squad”. It didn’t really annoy me, but gave me the extra incentive to silence a few critics. Hopefully I’ve done that as I always have.’ Merson had made his comments on Sky Sports when Roy Hodgson named the players for games against Lithuania and Italy. The 1-1 draw in Turin had not long ended when Townsend (below) tweeted to his 285,000 followers: ‘Not bad for a player that should be “nowhere near the squad” ay @PaulMerse?’ The Tottenham’s winger’s father Troy joined in, too, tweeting: “Oh ye of little faith #Merson get in.’ They could also have pointed out that Townsend’s screamer was his third for England, taking him level with Merson. ‘You can never stop proving things to people,’ said Townsend. ‘But I think every time I’ve put on an England shirt I have done myself justice, I have done Roy Hodgson justice and the nation justice. I was a bit disappointed with his comments but I have come on the pitch and silenced them.' Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson (centre) criticised Townsend's call-up to the England squad last week . Harry Kane congratulates his Tottenham team-mate Townsend after the final whistle in Turin . Good-natured north London Twitter skirmishing aside, there will have been a few Spurs supporters who understood Merson’s point. Townsend’s form has been inconsistent, and having seen him come off the bench to score for England they will wonder why he cannot do it more often for Tottenham. ‘I can’t put my finger on it or tell you what it is,’ admitted Townsend, when asked about the contrast. ‘The (England) manager has always given me confidence to go and express myself and play my natural game. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s my best form but this is the best form I’ve produced this season. I have had a few injury problems but I’m over the worst of that. ‘I’m slowly building my confidence back to where it was and hopefully from now until the end of the season I can get more games for Spurs and England and get back to the football I was producing last season.’ After long-range goals against Montenegro and San Marino, Townsend enjoyed the one he flashed past Gianluigi Buffon on Tuesday. It came from his weaker, right foot, against elite opposition and he made a beeline for Buffon after the match to ask for his shirt as a souvenir. ‘He is a top goalkeeper — one of the best to ever play the game — so to score past him I thought was no mean feat,’ said Townsend. ‘As soon as the whistle went, I thought I’d go and get his shirt because it is a real night to savour for me.’ Roy Hodgson was also impressed with Townsend after the Tottenham winger's fine goal after the break .","Andros Townsend scored the equaliser in England's 1-1 draw with Italy .

"Almost two weeks on from Liverpool’s wretched afternoon against Manchester United at Anfield, it would appear that lessons have already been learned. Asked about a setback that may yet cost Brendan Rodgers and his players a place in next season’s Champions League, the club’s midfielder Joe Allen was rueful. ‘They were ready to go and maybe we weren’t,’ Allen told a young supporter at Melwood this week. ‘Yeah, maybe the rivalry can sometimes get in the way.’ Joe Allen battles it out with Ander Herrera during Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Man United at Anfield . Liverpool midfielder Allen spoke to Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman at Liverpool's Melwood training ground . Midfielder Allen believes Liverpool have performed well against the big teams during the last two seasons . For Allen, and indeed for Liverpool, one suspects that their defeat by their greatest rival of all is already being viewed as merely another kink in the road. Certainly there is nobody at Anfield who will accept the opinion offered by Sky Sports’ Gary Neville, the former United defender, that Liverpool froze. ‘No, I don’t think that’s the problem,’ said Allen. ‘I think over the last two seasons we have performed against the big teams. Games can just be like that sometimes. It doesn’t happen very often. Next time that game comes around we will get it right.’ Over the past few months at Liverpool there has certainly been more right than wrong. Going into Saturday’s game at Arsenal, they are five points off fourth place in the Barclays Premier League but that still represents progress from the dark days of autumn and early winter. Allen, one senses, has been integral to recent improvement. With captain Steven Gerrard no longer an automatic starter and the Brazilian Lucas Leiva recently injured, the 25-year-old midfielder has been given an extended opportunity to prove his worth. Allen has been given an opportunity  with captain Steven Gerrard no longer an automatic choice for Liverpool . While Gerrard is no longer the first name on the teamsheet, Lucas Leiva (left) has also been sidelined . Having arrived with Rodgers from Swansea in 2012, Allen could not always be relied on. He admitted this week that at times the challenge seemed a little too big for him but he hopes that recent performances in big victories against Manchester City, Southampton and Swansea will one day be seen as evidence of a genuine breakthrough. ‘I think so, I hope so,’ Allen told Sportsmail. ‘Personally I have always been confident that I just needed games. ‘I will be open and honest, though. In my first season there were moments when I look back and am disappointed about how I did cope with that [mental] aspect of things. ‘Maybe I underestimated it a little bit before I came. I tried to anticipate it but you can’t do it until you get here. Now I have come through that and the only issue this season has been injuries. Hopefully I can stay fit now and show people the best of me.’ Allen’s increased standing at Liverpool saw him selected for a meet and greet with supporters this week. Guest of honour was Sean Melia, a volunteer at the Anfield Sports Community Centre who was present at Melwood as a ‘Barclays spirit of the game hero’. During a 20-minute Q&A with a group of supporters, Allen talked openly about the sad feeling at the club when Gerrard announced that he would not be staying and the devastation of last season’s title failure. ‘We understand that we gave it to Manchester City,’ he said. Allen admits, at times, the challenge of playing for Liverpool felt a little too big but has impressed recently . Gerrard consoles Luis Suarez as Liverpool's title hopes were dented against Crystal Palace last season . Allen also spoke of the feeling at the club after captain Gerrard announced he would be leaving the Reds . Later on, however, his conversation with Sportsmail was more personal and touched on his relationship with his older brother Harry, a talented footballer who plays for the Wales deaf side after losing his hearing to meningitis as a toddler. ‘When we were younger, he was a striker and he was a better player than me,’ revealed Allen. ‘At primary school I played with him and his mates and that gave me a little bit of a head start as they were two years older. ‘He is profoundly deaf but he speaks so well. I used to sign a little bit but he communicates so well now that I don’t need to. ‘Sibling rivalry is the perfect description of what we had, though. We loved playing against each other but there was a competitive edge to it. It’s a while back but I guess that is where the path all started for me. ‘It’s hard to say whether he would have made it - it is something that I do wonder about. But going out on to the pitch profoundly deaf is a huge disadvantage. So I don’t know. It’s one of those that we will never know the answer to…’ Home these days for Allen is the house he shares in Chester with his wife Lacey and son Alfie. Inherently private, he was a little embarrassed when Lacey posted a photograph on Twitter of last year’s birthday present. Then again a photograph of a top footballer holding a live chicken is rather unusual. Allen poses with a rooster bought for him by his wife for the Liverpool midfielder's 24th Birthday . Allen's wife, Lacey-Jo, shared the snap of Allen and his Birthday present on Twitter last year . Allen poses with Sean Melia, a volunteer at the Anfield Sports Community Centre who was present at Melwood as a ‘Barclays spirit of the game hero’ ‘It was just a “What do you get the guy who has everything?” kind of present,’ laughed Allen, fidgeting rather uncomfortably in his chair. ‘My wife is a big animal lover and it was, yeah, my surprise present. It has got a name but I’m not telling you! We already had a couple of chickens and this is a cockerel. That was the point of it really. In the dressing room, it’s a bit of a random one. ‘I keep my private life private and I guess that was a rare insight. We didn’t realise what impact it would have but it was harmless enough.’ Allen was rather more comfortable when the conversation returned to football and, in particular, Wales’s weekend win in Israel that left Chris Coleman’s team at the top of their qualifying group for Euro 2016.Allen was in Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium in 2004 when Mark Hughes’s team lost a play-off to Russia. Now he wants to make some history with his country and finish off the work started by one of his early national coaches, the late Gary Speed. Allen is keen to make history with Wales and finish the work started by former manager, the late Gary Speed . ‘His presence is still there for everyone,’ Allen said poignantly. ‘He began this journey for us and his big dream was for us to qualify. In lots of ways we want to make sure we can do this for someone like Gary. ‘He was a real people person. For a young midfielder going into the squad, he certainly had a huge impact on my career. ‘It was a huge win for us in Israel and we have a great chance now. For me it was the perfect thing to happen after the Man United result. ‘That’s the beauty of football. There is always the next game to put things right.’ Allen played in the 3-0 win over Israel which took Wales to their top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group . Domestically, Liverpool’s opportunity to make amends begins at the Emirates tomorrow and continues in Lancashire next Wednesday with an FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn. There is still much to aim for at Anfield this season and, with Gerrard suspended for three games, opportunity continues to knock for one of the next generation. ‘Whatever happened in one game has gone,’ said Allen. ‘We can start another run and do it again. That has to be our belief and confidence now. ‘Last season we had a similar run. We have to use that to inspire us. If the teams above us do slip up then we will be waiting.’ Joe Allen was speaking at a Barclays event to inspire the next generation of fans to fall in love with the game.

"Mike Brown admitted he would adopt a 'cautious' approach in recovering from his latest concussion setback. The England full-back remains unsure when he will return after pulling out of Harlequins' Aviva Premiership clash with Saracens at Wembley last weekend. Northampton wing George North has been advised by leading medics not to play again this season after suffering four quick-fire concussions, while Ireland's Johnny Sexton was stood down for 12 weeks earlier this term. England full back Mike Brown admits he is unsure when he will return to action for club side Harlequins . Brown is determined not to suffer an extended break - so will not rush himself back to action ahead of time. 'It was just after the France game, there wasn't one incident where I was dizzy or concussed, but after the game I just didn't feel quite right,' said Brown. 'I had a headache the Sunday and Monday, so just being cautious with it, I don't want to get into the situation where you get a few knockouts or something. 'You don't want to be into a situation where you're out for a long time like Johnny Sexton or Geoff Parling or something like that. 'So with what's coming up at the end of the year, everyone's being cautious, and I'm being cautious as well. George North will not play against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday and will see a neurosurgeon . North suffered his fourth quick-fire concussion after being knocked out against Wasps on Friday night . 'I think it's just ongoing to see how I am stage by stage. 'I'll just see how I am with the stages, do the 20-minute bike, see how I am after that and take it from there.' Brown was knocked out cold in England's 47-17 victory over Italy at Twickenham in the second round of RBS 6 Nations action in February. The Harlequins flyer had hoped to recover in time to face Ireland in Dublin on March 1, but pulled out in the build-up. Brown said increased awareness of the symptoms of concussion, driven by players undergoing World Rugby online modules, helped him realise he would not be ready to face Ireland. Brown (left) was knocked out cold in England's 47-17 victory over Italy at Twickenham in February .

'Learning about all the symptoms was massive,' said Brown, speaking for Land Rover's 'We Deal In Real' campaign. 'I pulled out on the Tuesday before the Ireland game with the symptoms, and I could maybe have tried to carry on with training, but being aware of the symptoms was important. 'So just knowing the dangers of the long and short-term dangers, how important it is to be honest and how serious it can be, I think those are the main things I took from the online courses. 'After the France game I had a headache and could (have) easily thought ""it's Sarries, it's Wembley and I'll give it a go"", but we're so clued up on it now that I don't think anyone would risk it. Brown (right) says he suffered a headache after playing in England's clash against France last month . 'If I can do it, pulling out of England-Ireland, the biggest game of the Six Nations at that point, then I think anyone can do it, and should do it. 'Now I've been through it I would definitely talk to team-mates urging them not to play on if I thought they were showing symptoms.

"From the moment Jack Johnson beat Tommy Burns to win the world heavyweight title in 1908, a frenzied search began. While Johnson's victory wouldn't raise an eyebrow nowadays, it caused consternation in America for one simple reason: Johnson was black — and a black man had never held sport's greatest prize. Racism was rife in America: black people were not supposed to rule over whites in any sphere of life. As the great boxing pundit Bert Sugar put it, 'This was the white man's crown. (To white America), it was as if the white man's slave had become his master.' After beating Tommy Burns in 1908, Jack Johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion . It is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that Johnson's victory caused. Even liberal newspapers, such as The New York Times, were openly hostile to the giant Texan. It mattered little that Johnson was American. His skin was deemed the wrong colour and a great cry went up from white America to find a white challenger — a 'Great White Hope' — who could unseat the new champion. But little did white America know that it would take over six years before Johnson would be defeated, on April 5, 1915, 100 years ago on Sunday. Most had believed Johnson would be dispatched quickly. However, he made short work of his first four title defences, his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion Stanley Ketchel who made the massive step up in weight and even managed to knock Johnson down. Yet Johnson had been fighting in second gear until that point and, as soon as he returned to his feet, scored a brutal knockout, uprooting several of Ketchel's teeth in the process. Attention immediately turned to finding another 'white hope'. There seemed an obvious choice: former world heavyweight champion James J Jeffries, who had retired undefeated in 1904. Jeffries, who as champion had dodged Johnson, was seen as someone who could quickly defeat the title holder and return things to the way they were. Things didn't go as planned. Six years out of the ring had taken its toll on Jeffries and in 1910 Johnson stopped the former champion in 15 rounds, further enraging whites who rioted, taking out their anger on blacks who had the temerity to celebrate Johnson's win. As many as 26 black people would be killed by lynch mobs. What made Johnson even more unbearable to white America was the way he lived his life. A fun-loving character, Johnson dated and married white women, and refused to live according to the social norms of the time. He was intelligent, eloquent and ambitious and saw no reason why his being black should hold him back from doing whatever he wanted. American heavyweight boxer Jess Willard (left) with his manager Tom Jones in Havana, Cuba in April 1915 . Johnson loses his world heavyweight title to Willard (left) over the course of 26 rounds in Havana in 1915 . Like Muhammad Ali years later, he was a trailblazer. He suffered dreadful discrimination, death threats and later persecution at the hands of the government. He took most of it in his stride. The same cannot be said of his detractors whose efforts to unseat him became increasingly desperate. In 1912, one opponent, 'Fireman' Jim Flynn, was disqualified for repeatedly trying to headbutt Johnson. Things were getting ridiculous, but Johnson's life outside the ring was unravelling. He spent money like it grew on trees and was being investigated by the US government on the spurious charge of abducting his future second wife under what was known as the Mann Act, a dubious piece of legislation designed to prevent 'white slavery'. He was found guilty by an all-white jury and sentenced to a year in prison. Johnson had other ideas. He fled to Canada and then to Europe, fighting three times in Paris, where he made history by beating 'Battling' Jim Johnson in the first-ever all-black heavyweight championship bout. Next he outpointed American Frank Moran over 20 rounds, though the purses for the fight were frozen after a dispute. With his money running low and the First World War breaking out in Europe, he accepted the challenge of another 'white hope' from America. His name was Jess Willard, a 6ft 6in fighter, known as 'The Pottawatomie Giant.' To put Willard's size into perspective, the average height of an American man at the time was 5ft 7in. The fight would take place in Cuba and was scheduled for 45 three-minute rounds, a hell of a distance given the 40-degree heat on the day. How would Johnson, now 37, handle a challenger four years his junior? The champion had, quite arrogantly, barely trained for the fight. Still, Willard was certainly the underdog: his size meant he was not particularly agile and he did not like hurting opponents unless they had hurt him first. Johnson was supremely confident. Johnson dominated the opening 10 rounds but his lack of conditioning soon began to tell. His breathing became heavy, amid the sweltering heat, and Willard grew in confidence. The writing was on the wall at the end of round 25. Johnson, sat on his stool, called over fight promoter Jack Curley. 'Jack, go take my wife away...tell her I'm awful weak and I want her to leave.' In the next round Willard seized his chance. He faked to throw a left to the body and then swung a mighty overhand right that connected perfectly with Johnson's jaw. Johnson slumped to the canvas and took the count flat on his back. It was the victory that white America had been waiting for but was all as it seemed? Action from the world heavyweight title fight between Johnson and Willard in Havana, Cuba in 1915 . Photographs of the knockout appeared to show Johnson shielding his eyes from the sun and he would later claim this was because he had deliberately taken a fall. His motivation, Johnson said, was a $50,000 payout and a promise from the American authorities that he could finally return to his homeland without having to serve his prison sentence. Johnson's 'confession' was sold for a fee to Nat Fleischer, the respected founder of The Ring magazine. But Fleischer never believed Johnson, while Willard was bitter about Johnson's claim, especially as the victory was his finest hour. 'If he was going to throw the fight I wish he'd done it sooner,' Willard said. 'It was hotter than hell out there.' Much of the public believed Johnson and they had not seen the film of the contest as there was a ban on it being shown. It would take 40 years for the footage to see the light of day. When it did surface, Willard was vindicated, the film clearly showing him land a powerful blow. 'I've waited a long time but at last people are beginning to believe me when I say I that I beat Johnson fair and square.' Willard confronted Johnson over his claims in 1944. 'I asked him why he made his false statement,' Willard recalled. 'He just shrugged and gave me that gold-toothed smile of his. Jack knew and I knew he was lying. But the fella was desperate for money, so who could blame him.' Johnson would eventually end his exile and continue fighting into the 1930s. Tragically he would die in a car crash in 1946, speeding away from a diner that refused him service on account of his race. Willard would lose his world title in only his second defence, suffering an awful beating at the hands of Jack Dempsey before retiring to his farm in Kansas. Johnson was defeated after enduring 26 rounds in the sweltering Cuban heat, compared to 'hell'","After beating Tommy Burns in 1908, Jack Johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion .

"Cancer-stricken basketball player Lauren Hill is spending her final days helping to raise money for cancer research and has already accumulated over $1.5million. Lauren, 19, uses a wheelchair and sleeps for many hours at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati where she is being treated for a brain tumor. She has expressed her desire to help others there as she continues to fight her disease. During her senior year of high school, Lauren was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent. Scroll down for video . Tracking her progress: Lauren Hill's mother Lisa posts photos of her daughter along with . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19, made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.5 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . But she still made it through a full season at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati while raising more than $1.5 million for others with her condition. CBS reports that Hill has a new goal which is to raise a total of $2.2 million for treatment and research. Her mother Lisa updates her followers on the Facebook page for Lauren's Fight For Cure about her daughter's progress and said that Lauren had a wonderful Easter but that she is still struggling. 'Not much has change in Laurens status since she aired on The View. Occasional headache and still very tired but humor remains intact when she can work it in. This week we are getting ready for Easter and have been enjoying some time in the spring sunshine. Some of her teammates decided to get things hopping to make sure she was ready for Sunday. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend,' Lisa wrote on April 1. Blonde for Easter: Despite Lauren's disease getting worse, she has posted photos of herself on Facebook . Most recently on April 7 Lauren's mother Lisa wrote, 'Today was Brent's Birthday. Lauren greeted him this morning with a huge smile and open arms. Hugs for dad on his birthday. I so wish with all my heart I could give him the gift he really wished for. What we all wish for..... The CURE! My heart is breaking and I wish someone would wake us all up from this nightmare.' Lauren has maintained her resilient spirit throughout this tragic struggle even though doctors have not yet found a cure. Lauren recently appeared on ABC's The View where she spoke about basketball and her condition. Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 — a date that matches Hill's uniform number — but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.'

"First impressions are not necessarily the best. When Adam Lyth scratched around for 22 in a Championship match against Nottinghamshire in 2008, Graeme Swann branded him a ‘walking wicket’. ‘But then,’ Swann added. ‘He proved us all wrong.’ Lyth, one of six Yorkshire players in the England squad that left Heathrow on Thursday for three Tests in the Caribbean, hit back in that match seven years ago with a second-innings of 132. Wisden later called him ‘the find of the season’. Yorkshire's Adam Lyth fields during day three of the Champion County match against the MCC . Now he finds himself competing with Jonathan Trott to be Alastair Cook’s opening partner at the first Test in Antigua on April 13. It has been quite a rise. ‘I was over the moon when I was told about my selection,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I can’t wait to get going.’ The story of Lyth’s ascent, from a talented but inconsistent left-hander to the ballast behind Yorkshire’s charge to the Championship last season is one of grit, nous and no little skill. He finished with 1,489 runs — more than anyone in the country — six hundreds and a welter of awards. In fact, much of the hard work had been done before the season began, prompted by a moderate 2013 which forced him to work on his concentration levels. Yorkshire’s sports psychologist Scott Hartley came up with the idea of harnessing Lyth’s love of golf — his handicap is eight — to get him holing one short putt after another. The challenge lay not in the task itself, but in its repetition. ‘There’s no skill in sinking a two-foot putt,’ said Lyth. ‘It’s just about concentration. It’s a bit like batting and not giving your wicket away. You try not to do something silly.’ After 213 successful putts, he missed. But the point had been made. Lyth set about 2014 with renewed focus. ‘It wasn’t just the concentration side of the game — my confidence changed, too,’ he said. ‘I got runs early on against the university sides, then played well at Taunton. It just snowballed from there.’ Lyth plays a shot while batting for Yorkshire against the MCC at the Sheik Zayed Stadium last month . At a time when England’s Test batsmen have lost the knack of scoring the ‘daddy hundreds’ once espoused by former batting coach Graham Gooch, Lyth’s remorselessness caught the selectors’ eye. He made 230 at Northampton, putting on 375 for the first wicket with the highly rated Alex Lees, then 251 against Lancashire at Old Trafford, one short of Darren Lehmann’s Roses record. ‘One of my things is that I’ve never got enough runs,’ said Lyth. ‘If you’re going to get a hundred, you may as well make it a big one.’ Lyth’s dedication has been evident for years. His mum Christine would drive him from game to game in his teenage years, and he spent two seasons trialling as a midfielder with Manchester City before deciding to throw in his lot with cricket (his brother Ashley played for Leicester and Scarborough). And his reluctance to talk about his footballing days tells of a man who wants to be judged by his run-making alone. When he phoned his mum to tell her about his selection, she was ‘very emotional’. Lyth bowls during day three of the Champion County match against the MCC . As the home summer got under way with six university fixtures across the country, it was easy to forget that the first-class season actually began late last month in the Middle East. And, in the now annual fixture in Abu Dhabi between MCC and the champion county, Lyth made 113 and 46 not out as Yorkshire won by nine wickets. Watching on was Cook, who will have a big say in whether he walks out to bat in Antigua with Lyth or Trott, ready to play again after leaving the Ashes tour in November 2013 because of a stress-related condition. Lyth is suitably complimentary about a player with 49 Test caps to his name and an average pushing 47. ‘He deserves his recall. He had a fantastic summer with Warwickshire and showed his class in South Africa with the Lions. ‘It’ll be very hard to keep the likes of him out of the side. I’ve just got to concentrate on myself and impress in the nets.’ The putting green may get a visit, too.

'A Single guy, drunk, we can possibly overlook, but certainly inappropriate for a Head Coach representing my university and most definitely not a married man with two children. I am certain she would not appreciate his behavior. 'As the night continued, we had hoped that the behavior was a fluke or a joke amongst friends ad we continued enjoying each others company until he made advances toward another female, petter her backside and proceeded to as/tell her to walk in front of him so that he could evaluate her assets.' An assistant coach reportedly helped him out of the local bar in Bowling Green, Ohio. Jans recently led the team to its first postseason win in 40 years . Fox Sports Ohio's Zac Jackson reported that he'd been in the bar perhaps three hours and the woman who struck him did not speak with either police or university officials. However a cell phone video of the incident was recorded and upwards of 50 witnesses were in the bar. No charges have been filed. According to The Washington Post, a university press release announced the termination Thursday morning. 'Jans was terminated following an investigation into his recent public conduct,' the statement read. 'The University concluded that Jans' public conduct failed to meet his obligations as a head coach and the expectations that BGSU Athletics has for its coaches.' Jans leaves the school after a single season, taking the team to its first postseason victory in 40 years. His final record there stands at 21-12. He was formerly an assistant at Wichita State before he signed with Bowling Green. His six year contract was valued at $325,000.","Chris Jans was fired for 'acting aggressively and inappropriately' at the bar on March 21 .

"Mesut Ozil has avoided a fine after being spotted in a nightclub just hours after missing the win at Newcastle through illness. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has spoken to Ozil about the incident and insists he is satisfied with the £42.5million man's explanation. Given he missed the clash at St James' Park with a cold, his appearance at a Berlin nightspot raised eyebrows, but Wenger said: 'He went out for 30 minutes for a friends birthday, I was satisfied with his explanation.' Arsene Wenger has chosen not to sanction Mesut Ozil for going to a Berlin nightclub hours after missing Arsenal's Premier League clash with Newcastle United last month . Ozil explained to Wenger that he had attended a friend's birthday and was only in the club for 30 minutes . Quizzed on whether he was getting soft on discipline, Wenger bristled: 'I’m not going soft on discipline. I’ve fined people when they work for us and don’t respect the discipline. 'On that front I don’t think you can stop anybody from wishing happy birthday to a friend when he is in his own country.' Speaking ahead of Saturday's showdown with Liverpool, the Frenchman confirmed that Mikel Arteta, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jack Wilshere, Mathieu Debuchy and Abou Diaby had all returned to training but weren't yet ready to make their return. Forward Danny Welbeck could make the side at the Emirates after missing England's friendly with Italy on Tuesday with a knee injury sustained in the Euro 2016 qualifying win over Lithuania. Wenger praised Welbeck's contribution to the side, despite scoring just eight times in 29 club appearances since his £16m move from Manchester United on deadline day back in September. When asked whether Welbeck had been unfairly overlooked for England, Wenger said: 'Maybe. I don’t overlook him personally because he’s played many, many games for us and I think he’s an important player who contributes a lot. 'Not only does he now score goals, but as well contributes a lot to the team work. He’s a team player and I believe technically he has improved a lot. Danny Welbeck could return to the Arsenal side for Saturday's showdown with Liverpool after a knee injury . Wenger confirmed that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had returned to training after injury . April 4 Liverpool (H) April 11 Burnley (A) April 18 Reading (Wembley) FA Cup semi-final . April 26 Chelsea (H) May 2 Hull City (A) May 9 Swansea City (H) May 16 Manchester United (A) May 20 Sunderland (H) May 24 West Bromwich Albion (H) 'When you look at him now I believe that technically he is much more mature, more composed in front of goal, the quality of his runs is getting better and he has huge, huge attributes.' The talk of the international fortnight has been about whether Welbeck will lose his place in the England side to Tottenham hotshot Harry Kane, who also found the net at Wembley on Friday night. Wenger said: 'We are not there yet. Harry Kane played one game and it’s good for England to have many options and to choose the best one. 'Welbeck until now has always been the chosen best one and I don’t see how on Friday night Roy Hodgson could change his mind.' Arsenal have won their last six Premier League matches, leaving them third in the table, some seven points behind leaders Chelsea. But Wenger believes it is still a tall order to win the league despite their excellent recent form. Arsenal are currently seven points behind leaders Chelsea in the Premier League table . Wenger backed Welbeck to keep his England place despite Tottenham striker Harry Kane's scoring debut . He said: 'We have the aspiration to win the next game and that’s quite good enough. After that, win the next one. 'What is mathematically possible you have to try to achieve but that doesn’t depend only on us. What does only depend on us in the final run is our performances and our results, so let’s focus on that. 'After that if everything goes for us, you never know, but you can only master your own performances so let’s focus on that and be realistic and continue to earn the right to win the games. That’s what we want.' Martin Skrtel powered home a stoppage time header to earn Liverpool a 2-2 draw against Arsenal at Anfield . Mathieu Debuchy had earlier been on target for Arsenal when the teams met back in December . While Arsenal are unlikely to claim the title, they could put another dent in Liverpool's top four ambitions, bruised after their 2-1 home defeat to Manchester United before the international break. Wenger said: 'Liverpool is a good side, there is always a good game at the Emirates and at Liverpool as well. 'I have a big respect for the club, but I am just focused on the game and focused to produce the performance we have produced recently, and make sure that the right commitment is there to win the game.'","Ozil will not be sanctioned for being spotted in Berlin nightclub .

"As eight teams prepare to battle it out for a place in the semi-finals of this season's European Rugby Champions Cup, Sportsmail's Nik Simon gives us a run-down of each of the sides left in the competition. LEINSTER VS BATH . STRENGTHS . Fronted by captain Jamie Heaslip, Leinster are armed with international experience and had 11 players in the Ireland squad who beat England last month. Bath's qualities are channeled through their attack, with Mike Ford giving the likes of England backs George Ford, Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson a licence to play with flair. WEAKNESSES . Poor league form has stunted Leinster's season, with the Dublin side currently fifth in the Pro12 competition after winning just one of their last five fixtures. Bath are short of experience in some key positions, particularly their up and coming backline. DANGERMEN . Leinster: Sean O'Brien Bath: Jonathan Joseph . RECORD . Leinster: Champions 2008-09, 2010-11, 2011-12 Bath: Champions 1997-98 . Leinster's Jamie Heaslip is tackled by Wasps' Sailosi Tagicakibau at the RDS Arena in October 2014 . Bath's Jonathan Joseph runs with  the ball during an open training session at the Farleigh House complex . CLERMONT VS NORTHAMPTON . STRENGTHS . The Stade Marcel Michelin is a fortress, with Clermont not having lost a European game in the Massif Central since a 32-15 defeat by Sale in 2008. Saints' Jim Mallinder has one of the most settled groups in the Aviva Premiership, boasting a strong core of squad players who maintain consistently high standards. WEAKNESSES . The Top 14 side were left with a worrying injury list after the Six Nations, with France backs Morgan Parra, Camille Lopez and Wesley Fofana among those missing. Saints try to play on the edge with enforcers such as Dylan Hartley and Calum Clarke, however discipline has previously tipped over the edge in big games. DANGERMEN . Clermont: Napolioni Nalaga Northampton: Courtney Lawes . RECORD . Clermont: Runners-up 2012-13 Northampton: Champions 1999-00, runners-up 2010-11 .

Clermont's Fiji winger Napolioni Nalaga charges forward with the ball for Clermont at the Michelin Stadium . RACING METRO VS SARACENS . STRENGTHS . Racing are flush with money, investing heavily in overseas players such as Jonathan Sexton, Jamie Roberts and, as of next season, Dan Carter. As well as their famous 'Wolf Pack' defence, Saracens pride themselves on the set-piece and use the scrum and line-out as dangerous attacking weapons. WEAKNESSES . The nouveau-riche Parisian outfit are inexperienced at knockout European rugby, having never progressed from the group stages before this season. Mark McCall's suffered heartbreak against Toulon last season and must show more mental fortitude to better their defeat in last season's final. DANGERMEN . Racing Metro: Jamie Roberts Saracens: Billy Vunipola . RECORD . Racing: First time in knockout Saracens: Runners-up 2013-14 .

Funded by tycoon Mourad Boudjellal, the Cote d'Azur club have invested heavily to create the world's most star-studded squad. Since relocating to Coventry, Wasps have been driven on by the powerful back row of James Haskell, Ashley Johnson and Nathan Hughes, though Hughes is suspended for kneeing George North in the head. WEAKNESSES . Toulon are in danger of having too many players to choose from, depriving some squad members of the chance to build up consistency. Dai Young has the opposite problem at Wasps, who are not blessed with the same depth and could struggle to fill the void left by Hughes' three-week ban. DANGERMEN .

"Harry Kane will play for England’s Under 21 team in this summer’s European Championships after holding talks with Gareth Southgate. England’s head coach Roy Hodgson has confirmed that Kane, 21, will join up with the junior squad when he returns from Tottenham’s post-season trip to Malaysia and Australia. Kane made an instant impact on the England team with a goal on his debut against Lithuania at Wembley and he has impressed with his committed attitude. Harry Kane, in action for England against Italy, will play for the U21s at this year's European Championships . Kane made his first start for England against Italy after coming off the bench, and scoring, against Lithuania . Hodgson said: ‘Harry wants to finish the job he has done, but the main reason is because Harry wants to go with the Under 21s. ‘He has been a major part of their qualifying campaign for the last 18 months. He’s even had to work his way into the team and in my conversations with him it has been pretty obvious to me he would like to play in this tournament. ‘We will miss him because he has done well for us in these 10 days. But I said very early on I was more than happy to accept Gareth would have the first pick of Harry certainly and people like John Stones might come into that category. ‘So if Gareth wants to pick them, that is fine by me. He is going to be important for Gareth I know.’ Ross Barkley is excused from the championships despite being eligible to play for Gareth Southgate's side . Raheem Sterling, who missed England's draw in Italy, will also be absent from this summer's tournament . Although Southgate will turn to Kane this summer, Everton midfielder Ross Barkley and Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling - both eligible for the European Championship - will both be excused. Kane will be in the squad, despite a warning from Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino that his forward risks burn-out if he is forced to play through the summer. Hodgson added: ‘I’m not a great lover of the burn-out argument, I’ve got to say. If you want to be an international player then you’ve got to accept football tournaments take place in the summer at the end of the season. ‘In my lifetime in football, as soon as the season has finished footballers have gone to tournaments, so anyone who wants to be a top-class international footballer and really believes he can help his country get to these tournaments, can’t then come and talk about burn-out. ‘I would like to think that if the Under 21s can continue to do as well as they have been doing, and Harry can play an important part and maybe help them go far in the tournament, that certainly won’t hurt his chances in the first national team and I am happy to back him.' Kane, pictured in action against Leicester in March, has been hugely impressive for Tottenham this season . Kane, celebrating after he scored against Arsenal in February, will be available to play for the Under 21s .","Harry Kane will play for Gareth Southgate's side at this year's tournament .

"Andros Townsend hailed Harry Kane as the 'best finisher' he has played with and predicted a bright international career for his Tottenham Hotspur team-mate. Kane made his England debut as a substitute on Friday against Lithuania, scoring after only 79 seconds, and started last night's friendly against Italy in Turin when Townsend scored in a 1-1 draw. Townsend said: 'I've known Harry for the last four, five or six years, I've grown up in the youth team with him and he is a fantastic talent and a player who, if you give him a chance, he is always going to put it away. Andros Townsend hailed Harry Kane (pictured greeting each other) as the 'best finisher' he has played with . Kane and Townsend played for England on Tuesday night during their 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin . Andros Townsend scored England's equaliser and poked fun at Paul Merson after the former midfielder said he 'should be nowhere near the England squad'. Click here for the full story . 'I think a few years ago, the main criticism was that he was lacking half a yard of pace and he has seemed to sort that out. He has bulked up and is now an animal and hopefully Spurs and England can benefit from that. 'I have always said to people that he is the best finisher I have ever played with. 'People used to laugh at me but now I think I should get a job as a scout. 'Even in training, left or right foot he is always working the 'keeper. He can find himself in almost any position and he will hit the bottom or top corner. 'That part of the game he has always had but the other side of the game to be fair to him, he has really worked on and I think Spurs and England are seeing the benefits of that.' Townsend insists he has always told people that Kane is the 'best finisher I have ever played with' Kane celebrates scoring against Lithuania but was unable to add to his tally against Italy on Tuesday night . Ryan Mason won his first cap in Turin and with Kyle Walker also coming off the bench it meant England finished the game with four Spurs players on the pitch, three from the academy. Danny Rose had pulled out of the squad with hip and hamstring injuries. Townsend added: 'The management, the coaches and the academy managers should be proud. 'They have brought through four or five players - Danny Rose as well - who are in the England squad and four players on the pitch at one time tonight is fantastic for the club and hopefully it can be an inspiration to the younger players, the likes of Josh Onomah and Harry Winks who are coming through, that they can be in the first team.'

"For any players who have featured for 90 minutes in a match under Pasquale Marino, the next day at training is dedicated to ‘scarico’ — recovery. Try telling that to Alexis Sanchez. Marino was the manager who brought Sanchez into Udinese’s first team in 2008 after he had been signed from Chilean club side Cobreloa two years earlier. Udinese had Italy internationals Antonio di Natale, Simone Pepe and Fabio Quagliarella vying for places up front, but Marino knew in Sanchez he had a ‘jewel’ on his hands. Alexis Sanchez has impressed for Arsenal this season following his £30million switch from Barcelona . Pasquale Marino, pictured managing Pescara in 2013, brought Sanchez into the Udinese first team  in 2008 . The main problem he encountered, however, was that he could not keep Sanchez off the pitch. ‘Alexis could easily play three matches per day,’ Marino, now in charge of Vicenza, said. ‘As soon as the (training) match started, Alexis used to abandon the scarico and would run up to me, almost imploring: “Mister, let me play, just for a few minutes. Please, please, please. I promise I won’t get injured.” Football is an enormous pleasure for him.’ That hunger earned him two £30million moves, first to Barcelona in 2011 and then to Arsenal last summer. It is also why Sanchez, Arsenal’s stand-out player this season, found it so difficult when he was rested for two games by Arsene Wenger — against Aston Villa and Tottenham — with a sore hamstring. Sanchez spent five years with Serie A side Udinese before earning a move to Spanish giants Barcelona . Sanchez takes on  defender Miranda during Chile's friendly with Brazil at the Emirates Stadium last week . ‘Putting him on the bench is like taking a toy from a child,’ Marino warned. ‘There was just one thing that worried me when he joined Barcelona — they were full of amazing forwards and it was by no means a given that Alexis would be in the starting 11. ‘Since I know how important it is for him to play, I feared that without regular football he could become discouraged. But he proved he was good enough to become an essential part of the team and fitted into the Barca way of playing.’ Big money moves have not sapped any of Sanchez’s energy. Speak to Arsenal players and they describe the same enthusiasm in training, the same refusal to embrace rest days, the same disregard for ‘scarico.’ Sanchez found it difficult when he had to be rested for Arsenal's matches with Aston Villa and Tottenham . They warned him that when the games rained down over the winter it would soon catch up with him, but Sanchez, bar that short Wenger-enforced break, has not stopped, even if he hasn’t been as prolific as he was in the first half of the season. That is why Marino believes Sanchez, still only 26, could elevate himself alongside the planet’s greatest. ‘He’s never looked as strong as he does now,’ Marino said. ‘Personally, I think he could score more than 35 goals a season in any league he plays in. ‘If he succeeded in doing that, he would be at the same level as two monsters of the modern game: Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Nowadays only those two, and maybe Zlatan Ibrahimovic, can claim to be better than Alexis.’ Marino believes Sanchez is looking strong and capable of scoring 35 goals  in any league he's played in .","Alexis Sanchez has starred for Barcelona and Arsenal since Udinese days .

"An eagle demonstrated its footwork after gate-crashing a football team’s training session and enjoying a solo kick-about. Filmed in North Vancouver, the bird - which appears to be a golden eagle, despite some speculation that it is a young bald - is captured standing over a football during its try-out before giving it a slight peck with its beak. After standing and shaking its head, the big bird then moves forwards and rolls the ball to the left with its foot. The bird interrupts the training session by approaching a football and giving it a peck before enjoying a kick-about . Excited by the movement, it runs after it and rolls the ball to the right before jumping up on it with both feet. As the ball rolls away the members of the North Shore Football Club, whose training session had been interrupted by the eagle, can be heard laughing. The bird then runs back over to the football and a youngster can be heard saying: ‘The eagle has landed.’ The eagle gets excited and after rolling the ball, jumps up onto it with both feet and causes it to move . Rolling the ball back a few more times, the bird once again jumps onto it before stopping to give it another peck. Upping the quality, the eagle rolls the ball to the left once more but this time keeps its foot on top of it so that it is controlled underneath. It then successfully jumps up onto the ball with two feet and balances for a moment before its momentum causes the ball to roll away - as if it had given it a kick. The eagle successfully attempts to roll the football with both feet on a number of occasions . The ball is then passed back to the bird by the video maker, but the eagle seems to have lost interest and lets the ball roll by. Before turning and running over towards it with an unmeasured amount of excitement. The video concludes with what must be the team’s coach saying: ‘Okay guys let’s get back in the grid, let’s go.’ The majestic bird finishes its kick-about and sits beside the ball before deciding to fly away . And the bird, who sits majestically next to the football for a moment, flying away. According to National Post Canada, the boys from the North Shore Football team, delighted by the eagle, were from Sutherland secondary school in Vancouver.","The big bird swoops in and demonstrates how to roll ball .

"At the age of 37, and getting on for eight years after he was told that his career was over, Michael Duff probably hadn’t expected to be chasing the bright young hope of English football around Turf Moor this weekend. Harry Kane couldn’t be hotter right now and veteran Burnley defender Duff will need all his experience to put out the fire when Tottenham come to town on Sunday. ‘I played against him when he was on loan at Millwall,’ says Duff. ‘He was a young lad and you could see he was a decent player but I don’t think anyone could have foreseen what’s happened to him in the last 12 months. ‘I don’t think it’s disrespectful to say he’s come from nowhere.’ Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . Duff will be tasked with stopping Spurs scoring sensation Harry Kane, 16 years his junior, on Sunday . Duff knows a thing or two about coming from nowhere, although it took him significantly longer than Kane to make it to the top. Spotted playing for Oxfordshire-based Carterton Town in the Hellenic League in the mid-90s, he spent eight years at Cheltenham Town, including a loan spell at Cirencester, before joining Burnley for £30,000 in 2004. The second oldest outfield player in the Premier League — 26 days younger than Everton’s Sylvain Distin — Duff is the only man to appear in all eight top tiers of English football. And yet his career was almost ended prematurely after he suffered a serious knee injury against Crystal Palace in September 2007. A ruptured anterior cruciate ligament was the worst of the damage and he will never forget his first meeting with the surgeon. ‘His bedside manner wasn’t the best,’ recalls Duff. ‘He held up the scan and the first thing he said was “Look at the f*****g state of that!” I still remember those words to this day. It was devastating to be given that news. ‘Being told I was finished at 29 had a big influence because you can take things for granted. I nearly had it taken away from me, so I really appreciate what I’ve got. I don’t know if I would still be playing if that didn’t happen.’ The defender's former clubs include an eight year spell with Cheltenham Town . Duff is the only survivor of Burnley's Championship promotion and Premier League relegation sides . Duff is the second oldest  outfield player in the Premier League behind Sylvain Distin (right) by 26 days . Born in Belfast but raised in North Yorkshire, Duff was 11 years old when he witnessed the Hillsborough tragedy — standing in the Nottingham Forest end alongside his dad, John, who had taken him to his first big game. His experiences provide a useful perspective when it comes to handling Burnley’s season-long battle against relegation. After playing Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Southampton in five of their last six games, Sean Dyche’s side face Tottenham and Arsenal in the next two. Duff, the only survivor of Burnley’s previous promotion to and relegation from the Premier League, is not one to listen to the pessimists. Nor does he pay too much attention to the hype that comes as part of the package, such as the storm that surrounded team-mate Ashley Barnes following his bust-up with Chelsea’s Nemanja Matic at Stamford Bridge in February. ‘What’s the worst that can happen?’ asked Duff. ‘You could lose a game of football, but we’re expected to lose it anyway. The high point of Burnley's season thus far has been the 1-0 defeat of defending champions Manchester City . Burnley's challenging run in will see the Tykes face high flying Arsenal after the Tottenham game . ‘Every game we play is a free hit from the outside looking in. I can’t imagine we start many games as the bookies’ favourite. No-one gave us a prayer at the start of the season, so we’ll give it a go. ‘It’s been tough this year with the intense scrutiny that comes with the league. For instance, the incident with Barnesy at Chelsea. No one reacted in the ground, but a week later it was the worst tackle in football history, so it’s something we cannot get obsessed with. ‘There are different pressures at different levels. I’ve played with lads who have been released and can’t afford to pay a mortgage.’ Relegation in 2010 has clearly left a scar, however, and not least because of the controversial departure of manager Owen Coyle down the road to Bolton in mid-season. ‘It ripped the heart out of the club,’ says Duff. ‘He had everyone buying into what he thought and then he decided to leave for his own reasons in the January. It didn’t matter who came in, it was going to be an uphill task. ‘This is completely different. There is definitely a stronger mentality in this squad which reflects the manager. There’s a real belief that we can achieve something this year against all the odds.’ Losing manager Owen Coyle after relegation from the Premier League knocked the wind out of Duff . Duff’s knee injury taught him to prepare for life after a playing career and he already has his coaching badges. Articulate and forthright, he is management material. ‘You look at the game differently when you get to my age,’ he says. ‘I want to stay in football after I’ve finished playing, but I have no plans to stop. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It’s not a bad job running around chasing after a football.’","Burnley host Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday .

"Keith Curle tells the kind of stories about management that might explain why retiring players are stampeding towards the pundits’ couch. Except that is not his intention. Quite the opposite, in fact. The Carlisle manager loves a job that over the years has seen him break and rebuild a toilet, man a hose and pay salaries from his own pocket. ‘It’s the life I want for myself,’ he said. ‘It gets me out of bed.’ But there is no escaping the fact that Curle is in a shrinking minority, being one of only four managers in the country’s top 92 clubs who has played for England. The drain of leading English players to television rather than management was the key finding of a Sportsmail study. It seems that talking about the game is more appealing to former players than a life orchestrating it — easier money, less time and pressure. Many ex-players simply have no financial need to work but for Curle, money has only ever been just a part of it. Keith Curle insists football management was always his priority after ending his playing career . Curle has taken charge of Carlisle after learning his trade in the lower league backwaters . ‘Football was all I had and all I wanted,’ he said. ‘As for ex-internationals, I guess there will be fewer going to management now because of the money they earn. You’d think they don’t need a wage but some will have only a passion for football. ‘That might mean being in front of a camera. I have done a bit for Sky and I really enjoyed it but first and foremost I am a coach and manager. That’s how it is for some managers – it’s what you are. ‘But if you are like that you have to like a challenge.’ Few are better placed to illustrate the challenge of management than Curle. He won three England caps but has spent most of the past 13 years in places where TV rights do not sell for billions. He started at Mansfield and went on to Chester, Torquay and Notts County before joining League Two Carlisle United last September after nearly five years coaching Crystal Palace and QPR under Neil Warnock. Curle (right) is one of only four former England players to currently manage in the football league . The well-travelled defender played for a total of 10 clubs during his career, including Manchester City . Curle claims to have caught the management bug after playing for Wolves under Colin Lee and John Ward . The 51-year-old’s days are long and his experiences would not seem such fond memories to everyone. ‘At Chester, I drove around looking for places to train,’ Curle said. ‘Elsewhere, I’ve raised money to pay bills for training facilities that haven’t been paid for. You are also lending people money for wages that have not been paid. ‘At Mansfield, we had a toilet in the middle of the changing room so I helped knock it down and rehouse it.’ It was at Mansfield that Curle used a fireman’s hose to water the training pitch. ‘You do everything you can,’ he added. ‘You get your hands dirty. ‘It’s hard. Most days I’ll be in my office at 8.15am and I’ll usually leave at 5.15pm. Not bad. Then I’m often in the car to go and watch a game. ‘Sometimes you’ll go to three in a week. Being in Carlisle that’s a lot of time in the car, getting home after midnight.’ It’s all part of the puzzle of turning thoughts into performances and performances into results. That’s what keeps managers like Curle hooked. Curle started his management career at Mansfield where he missed out on promotion to Division Two . Curle returned to former club Torquay as manager but could not save them from relegation in 2007 . Curle tooks Notts County on a run of 22 consecutive away games without defeat before being sacked . ‘Winning matches is what I love,’ Curle said. ‘I got a bug for coaching when I was playing at Wolves (in the late 1990s) under Colin Lee and John Ward. ‘I wanted to understand why we were doing something. ‘John started showing me his coaching journals that he had kept for years, logging every session. All my coaching sessions now are logged. ‘The development plans I have for every player now are also logged. I am plotting their development on my own graphs, watching how they reach targets. ‘There is nothing better than improving a player and seeing it on the Saturday.’ The 51-year-old spent five years working as a coach under Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace and then QPR . Curle believes there is no better feeling than developing a player to reach their targets . And nothing worse than getting the sack. It has already happened to Curle and will probably happen again. ‘The overall challenge is to build a team but that takes 18 months,’ he said. ‘How often do you get 18 months in a job? Summer is best — you talk about philosophies and there is no pressure. Then the season starts and you need results. It’s a challenge, a good challenge.’ And obviously it’s not for everyone. For others, it’s a peculiar part of the charm.","Keith Curle is one of only four England players to currently manage .

"PGA Tour star Rickie Fowler has earned extra brownie points with his growing legion of fans after calling out an online hater who accused his girlfriend of being a 'gold digger.' The golfer's girlfriend, bikini model Alexis Randock, had posted a photo on her Instagram account of her and sister Nicole on the beach last week. The photo was shared with her 25,000 followers, which included an abusive commenter known as 'fatalsplash' who was quick to judge and accused Alexis of being a 'gold digger.'

It wasn't long before Fowler came to his girlfriend's defense and responded to the troll that he 'might want to get your facts straight before you talk to my girl friend like that', reports the Golf Channel. Alexis also wasn't shy about standing up for herself. 'That's hilarious. I work my butt off to be able to fully support myself in NYC, I'm out here grinding to live a nice life,' she posted. Fowler received a number of positive comments from other posters who commended him on standing up for his girlfriend. 'Fatalsplash' - who has since changed his user name to - '@dont_hava_usename' - was roundly criticized, being called a moron and accused of working at McDonald's. The troll even attempted to backtrack by offering Alexis congratulations for supporting herself. A troll called 'fatalsplash' then accused Alexis of being a 'gold digger' who didn't have to work .

"Forget helicopters and BMWs, could the ultimate symbol of wealth be clothes made from gold? On a catwalk show which took place in Xi'an, the capital city of north-western China's Shaanxi province, models strutted their stuff in items made from the precious metal. Including underwear and a chain-mail style shirt which it has been revealed would be worth around £40,000. And this was no lightweight affair either. On a catwalk in Xi'an in China models strutted their stuff in gold underwear, it is thought the look is influenced by royal women in history . The shirt alone worn by the male model weighed in at 7lbs and the matching bra and underwear for the female model also came in at 7lbs. The idea for real gold clothing takes its inspiration from royal women in history, including Cleopatra, Marie Antoinette and Tsarina Alexandra who all reportedly had gold clothing. The organisers of the event said that it took 30 craftsmen three months to make the gold shirt and the women's clothing which is also worth around £40,000. Fashion photographer Manchu Peng, 30, who attended event said: 'There were some good designs there but the gold clothing items really stole the show.' It took 30 craftsmen three month to make this shirt which is mean out of real gold and has a chain-mail style . The model showed off his shirt as on-lookers checked out how the design was made . The idea came after a Chinese designer unveiled an extraordinary set of underwear made entirely of gold last year. The items however were produced as a work of art and not intended for sale. They were modelled by an unnamed woman who was joined by two other models - both of whom posed with glittering gold accessories, including necklaces, a shoe and a rabbit at a store in China. These two women proudly showed off their gold underwear, the items are not for sale but are said to be worth around £40,000 . This gold underwear set has an intricate design with the model wearing a pair of white pants underneath it to protect her modesty . And prior to that a Turkish jeweller unveiled a series glamorous gold dresses - each worth a staggering £85,000. Artisan Ahmet Atakan, based in Izmir, a city in Turkey, crafted each frock out of a total of 78,000 pieces of the expensive metal to form a mesh-like fabric. Despite the eye-watering price tag of 300 thousand Turkish Liras (about £84,800), eight of the unique gowns have already been sold.","Designs made from real gold were shown on the catwalk in Xi'an China .

"As Brendan Rodgers sat down to have his say on Thursday, it was easy to forget that Liverpool have a critical game against their top-four rivals Arsenal on Saturday. Instead, there was only one issue on the agenda, brought about by Raheem Sterling's television interview 24 hours earlier. The interview in which he suddenly seemed happy to discuss that unsigned £100,000-a-week contract, assert he is a trophy-hunter rather than a money-grabber and, perhaps most alarming of all, admit he is flattered by interest from Saturday's opponents from north London. Raheem Sterling looks relaxed during Liverpool's training session on Thursday morning . Sterling shakes hands with his manager Brendan Rodgers during the Melwood training session . Sterling appeared to give his manager a pat on the back as they talked during training . Rodgers issues instructions to Sterling as Liverpool prepare for Saturday's match with Arsenal . Instead of talking about the race for a Champions League pot of gold, Rodgers found himself again discussing the subject of Sterling's silver. The response seemed well prepared, a message of solidarity combined with a show of strength. Sterling is going nowhere was the emphatic statement. And if there were any suggestion from the 20-year-old that Liverpool need to convince him they can match his ambition, the message from Rodgers was equally clear: count yourself lucky to be here. 'Arsenal is a fantastic football club, of course, but this is Liverpool, one of the great clubs of the football world,' said the Anfield boss . 'It's an honour for Raheem to play here at a club like Liverpool in front of our great supporters and he understands that. He sees that. 'If Raheem has said his ambition is to win trophies and be successful, then it's perfectly aligned with what we're trying to do.' There was a reminder to Sterling and his representatives that his stock has risen on the back of the work Liverpool have done with him and the faith Rodgers has placed in the player. He is, Rodgers remarked, not yet the finished article. Not yet of the same calibre as Luis Suarez who eventually got his move away from Merseyside. Sterling admitted he was 'flattered' by interest from Arsenal as his contract talks are put on hold . Sterling and Daniel Sturridge share a joke on the training ground during Thursday morning's session . The players were in a relaxed mood despite the continued speculation over Sterling's future at the club . The England international cast doubt on his Liverpool future in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday . 'Now, as a 20-year-old, no he's not at that level,' said Rodgers. 'Raheem has been involved with the first team for two-and-a-half years and the player he is today — and he still has a lot of improvements to make — is because of the environment and what we've created here. 'He's still got learning and development to make on and off the pitch. We feel this is a great place for him. We'll very much focus on trying to make him the best player we can. 'He's a young player who has developed a lot and that's because of one reason, which is Liverpool. So we're quite relaxed on that and we'll concentrate on his football, hopefully. 'For us it's really about continuing to nurture the development of a young player who has made huge strides and someone who we believe we still have a lot of input into his development to come so he can be consistently a player playing at the top of his game.' There is a growing feeling that Sterling and his representatives are attempting to force Liverpool's hand here and orchestrate a move back to London, where Arsenal and Chelsea would welcome him home with open arms. Certainly the mixed messages over the contract stalemate in recent months have been confusing. Is it about money? Is it about trophies? Is it about Sterling's best position? Sterling trains alongside Brazilian Philippe Coutinho as the Liverpool team get ready for Saturday's match . Sterling and Emre Can leap during one of the training ground exercises on Thursday morning . Sterling takes his turn on the ladders as Liverpool prepare for Saturday's vital match against Arsenal . The latter, according to Rodgers, should not be an issue. Most important of all is that Sterling is a first-team regular getting the kind of opportunities that young players do not elsewhere. The manager drew comparisons with Steven Gerrard. 'Every player will have a position to play,' he said. 'I pick the best team and what is key for him — and I'm sure he understands — is that he's getting the opportunity to play. 'If you look through this league and in Europe, there aren't many playing at 17, 18, 19 or 20. 'Every player will want to play but he only needs to look at Steven Gerrard in his time here. He played in a back three, as a wing back, right back, left back, central midfield, as a No 10. 'It doesn't bother me. I pick the best team and he will probably sit back, reflect and think he is playing, which not many young kids are. 'He's a boy who genuinely loves his football. He's played all over the field for me but he understands and respects the opportunity that he's had to play all over the field. It's been great for him and his career.' Sterling denied he was a 'money-grabber' in the interview, saying he was only concerned about football . Liverpool find themselves five points behind Manchester United in the battle for the top four places . Rodgers organises the footballs during Liverpool's Thursday morning training session . There is little doubt that Sterling's interview has been unhelpful in the extreme, but there remains a determination at Anfield to keep the player onside and head off a contract crisis. To that end, Rodgers struck a conciliatory tone on Thursday. 'We speak regularly with Raheem and I just see him work and work well,' Rodgers said. 'He's been injured and there is probably a bit of frustration there because he's not been totally clear and he's a boy who just loves to play, train and be on the field. 'You have seen what can happen with players and representatives, but I can only speak openly and honestly with Raheem. He has made it clear he is happy and hopefully he can do his talking on the field. 'My concentration is on working with the player. He is a young man. He has had trauma in his life and he is a tough boy and you see that in how he plays, but he is still very young. He still needs guidance and help — that is pretty clear.'

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists he is not concerned that Romelu Lukaku has joined forces with high-powered agent Mino Raiola ahead of a potential summer of transfer speculation surrounding the striker. Raiola, steeped in Italian and Dutch football, is one of the most influential agents in the game, with Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba and Liverpool’s Mario Balotelli among his high-profile clients. The Italian middleman has been involved in transfer deals worth over £400million and Lukaku’s decision to sever his links with Christophe Henrotay, who oversaw his Everton club record £28m move from Chelsea last summer, adds a possible new dimension to his career. Romelu Lukaku (left) poses alongside his new agent Mino Raiola in an Instagram picture . The appointment of Raiola as agent fuels speculation Lukaku (left) could be set for a move away from Everton . Roberto Martinez, the Everton manager, is unconcerned by Lukaku joining Raiola . The Belgium striker, 21, has scored only eight times in the Premier League so far this season compared with 15 last term. But he has netted 18 in total, including eight in the Europa League which spearheaded Everton’s run to the last 16. With Everton 13th in the Barclays Premier League there will be no European adventure next season but Martinez, who persuaded Lukaku to turn a season-long loan into a permanent five-year deal last summer, is adamant that the player’s switch of agents has not set the alarm bells ringing. Martinez said: ‘He has changed his agent, yes, but we are not concerned, no. Rom is entitled to do that. ‘Everyone speaks about the colourful character that Mino Raiola is but he has a lot of players who are very much people who are happy to stay at one club. ‘I dealt with Mino Raiola at Wigan and not many people know that he had Danny de Ridder or Vladimir Weiss, players who have been happy to stay at a club. I don’t think there is anything to read into that.’ Martinez does not expect a summer of upheaval at Goodison Park, despite the team’s disappointing campaign. Veteran defender Sylvain Distin, 37, who has not featured in the league since late December, will leave at the end of his contract but, according to Martinez, fellow centre back Antolin Alcaraz still has a chance to earn a new deal during the closing weeks of the season. Meanwhile, the manager insists 21-year-old midfielder Ross Barkley can build on his performances from the bench for England against Lithuania and Italy to finish an indifferent season on a high. ‘He will benefit from the experiences of this difficult season,’ added Martinez, whose side entertain Southampton on Saturday. Raiola has engineered big money moves for players such as Mario Balotelli at Liverpool . Martinez believes that Ross Barkley (left) will benefit from the difficult season that he has endured . ‘This is his second full season in an important role in the squad. ‘He enjoys that responsibility and taking responsibility in big games. ‘He has an incredible technical ability and, with the physicality he has, you don’t see many players in world football with those capabilities. ‘We know who Ross is and how important he is for the future of Everton.’","Roberto Martinez unconcerned by Romelu Lukaku's link with Mino Raiola .

"Real Madrid are desperate to land Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, but they are prepared to wait until next summer if Louis van Gaal won't negotiate, according to reports in Spain. De Gea has been in fantastic form this season, while Real's legendary stopper Iker Casillas has long been seen as unreliable. Although the European champions would like to sign De Gea this June, they are looking at the possibility of picking up Chelsea's Petr Cech to fill the gap in between, while the Spaniard runs down his contract at Old Trafford, which expires next year. Real Madrid's attempt to nab David De Gea is the big story in AS, while Marca focus on James Rodriguez . In a move that Spanish paper AS calls 'Operation De Gea', the paper claims Real are only prepared to pay for the keeper if United 'fix a reasonable price' - otherwise they will nab him for free in a year. De Gea's contract is up at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016, and he is yet to sign a new deal, with United still uncertain of Champions League football for next season. Cech, meanwhile, looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the Czech keeper likely to command a fee of around £10million. Elsewhere in Spain the focus is on Lionel Messi's injury, which is still causing him some problems ahead of Barcelona's trip to Celta Vigo on Sunday. Sport say 'Messi is OK', with the news that 'all tests were positive' on his injured foot, and Marca add that the Barca star has 'overcome the pain'. Lionel Messi's injury dominates in Sport, while in Italy there is more news on Palermo's Paulo Dybala . However, the Madrid-based paper also report that 'he still can’t put his boot on' because of the injury to his metatarsal. There is better news for James Rodriguez, who is also set to return from injury, with Marca reporting that he will start for Real Madrid on Sunday, his first game for 59 days. In Italy there are reports that Palermo striker Paulo Dybala, who has been linked with Arsenal, could join up with former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan.

"John Carver knows only too well that a Tyne-Wear derby can make or break a manager. His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory – or a loss – could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday . Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 . Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 . His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park . 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.'

"Frank Lampard has revealed he'd 'love' to see a gay footballer come out and be fully respected by the public, saying that the game is changing and losing it's macho persona. Taking part on Channel Four's 'Alan Carr's Chatty Man' alongside Denise van Outen, Noel Fielding and Lethal Bizzle, the on-loan Manchester City star spoke of his support and feels that football in evolving for the better. When host Carr said: 'Do you think we will ever see a gay footballer? Statistically there should be loads. One in ten are gay aren't they? Fifty-thousand professional footballers, one of them must be.' Frank Lampard showed his support for gay footballers in an interview on Alan Carr's Chatty Man .

Former West Ham United midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger also came out as being gay not long after Rogers . Lampard responded: 'Well we have had a couple. Thomas Hitzlsperger who played in the Premier League, came out after having moved back to Germany or Italy. 'In America, Robbie Rogers played there. 'I think a lot of the problem is, as you say, it's a fact that it will be out there, as it is in all modern life at all times, but I think we are probably at fault as a sport. 'I think that it's that old syndrome where it's a mans game and you can't talk about that. I have to say the game's changing a lot. There are a lot of campaigns. I feel it in the dressing room. There's a different feel about it. 'Yeah there should be. I would love it if someone came out and everyone treated it with respect. You know that thing about 'we're macho we play football,' is very old hat.' With Lampard's career nearing the end, the New York City man is already thinking about what his next step will be - refusing to rule out the chance of becoming a manager. He said: 'I'll maybe do my coaching badges which is a bit of a process as that's two years worth of work to get that and maybe be a manager but I'm not completely sure whether to go down that route or down certain other routes- bit of TV maybe. The City midfielder was joined on the show by Noel Fielding (left, Lethal Bizzle and Denis van Outen . 'Everyone's lining up to do that at the moment you know the punditry thing is the thing to do. Everyone that retires wants to go in, and it's not an easy thing. It looks quite easy to talk about football but it's not.' Following England's disappointing 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Carr pressed Lampard on why we perform so bad - despite the quality in the country. Lampard, who made one appearance during the finals, believes that a lack of squad cohesion may have been the catalyst causing England to finish bottom of group D. 'I think we didn’t gel as much as we should have done,' he said. 'When you look at the individuals in those pictures (on screen) you know you're talking about some of the best individuals in world football at different times. We've had them and we haven't done it.' Van Outen and Noel Fielding also took part on the show where Lampard scored a penalty against Carr .

"Dick Advocaat will not make the same mistake he did during his first season at Rangers by playing down the significance of the Old Firm derby. The 67-year-old takes charge of Sunderland for the first time on home soil tomorrow with North-East adversaries Newcastle the visitors. It was back in 1998 that Advocaat said the Old Firm clash was just another game. Celtic won 5-1 and the Dutch boss was criticised by fans and the media for under-estimating the intensity of the rivalry.

Rangers' Rod Wallace (centre) runs forward with the ball as his side are thrashed 5-1 by Celtic in 1998 . Advocaat had failed to recognise the significance of the Old Firm fixture and this led to a humiliating loss . He recalled: 'To be honest, I did not realise at that moment it was so huge. 'We lost that game and I remember saying in the press conference when they were really upset, 'It is no problem for me because it is just one of 38 games and we will not lose any more'. 'I would not say that anymore! But we became champions that year, six points ahead of Celtic, and won the treble.' Advocaat, though, does admit that his thoughts are trained on three points and not the notion of regional bragging rights. Indeed, the Black Cats are one point above the relegation zone and could be in the bottom three by kick-off. 'Every game is a chance to get a result – and that starts on Sunday,' said Advocaat, who could start Adam Johnson for the first time following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Sunderland's Adam Johnson was recently arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with an under-age girl . Advocaat is still considering starting the 27-year-old England international in the Wear-Tyne derby . 'If we win the fans might like me, yes, but I would prefer it if they loved me at the end of the season because that would mean we have stayed up.' Sunderland have won just twice at home all season. They have struggled amid an atmosphere of unrest at the Stadium of Light, but that should change tomorrow given the unveiling of Advocaat and the opponents. 'For us, this must be a weapon,' said Advocaat when asked about the home crowd. 'That is the reason I said it is so important to get them behind us, because it is an extra weapon. If the players feel that, they will give even more and I expect that the fans will do that. This is a special game.' Sunderland midfielder Will Buckley (centre) dribbles with the ball during training at the Academy of Light .","Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat insists he is not underestimating the significance of Sunday's game against local rivals Newcastle .

"After helping Sale Sharks to a 23-6 victory against Gloucester last Saturday, Danny Cipriani has taken advantage of a rare free weekend from rugby by jetting off to Dubai for a short break. Cipriani contributed 13 points from the boot in a fine display against the Cherry and Whites and with Sale out of contention in Europe, Cipriani and his team-mates have the weekend off to recharge ahead of a crucial final four rounds of Aviva Premiership action. Steve Diamond's side will face London Irish, Harlequins, Newcastle and Exeter in the coming weeks as they look to secure a top-six finish and qualification for next season's European Champions Cup - and a short break looks to be the perfect preparation for Cipriani who has been integral to Sale's improved form this season. Danny Cipriani is currently relaxing on holiday in Dubai before Sale's last four Aviva Premiership games . With Sale out of contention in Europe, Cipriani took advantage off a free weekend to chill out on holiday . Sale are currently seventh in the league standings and although a play-off place is not out of the question, head coach Diamond conceded that a top-six finish looks more likely. 'The first goal is to qualify for the Champions Cup and we want to finish in sixth to do that,' Diamond said earlier this week. 'We'll just try to win every game. If we do then we will finish in the top six, but I do think the top four is a bit away from us and we're probably just off that. Cipriani fires over a conversion during Sale's 23-6 victory against Gloucester last Saturday . Cipriani tackles Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees during the clash at the AJ Bell Stadium . 'We've not got a squad that can compete with the top four, but at home we're a good side and it's difficult (to come here) as we've proven against Gloucester, Northampton and Saracens. Cipriani has been in superb form for Sale this season and was rewarded with a call-up to Stuart Lancaster's squad for the 2015 RBS 6 Nations campaign. George Ford was very much the first choice fly half for the tournament, but Cipriani made a number of impressive cameos from the bench against Italy, Scotland and France. Cipriani crosses for a late try during England's 47-17 victory against Italy at Twickenham in February . The Sale playmaker capped off his first appearance at Twickenham since November 2008 with a late try in the 47-17 victory against the Azzurri in February.

"At 12, she became the youngest player to appear in the U.S Women's Open. Now 20, Lexi Thompson can boast six professional championships and most recently, a provocative magazine cover. The LPGA player, who has career earnings of almost $3million, will appear topless on the front of the May edition of Golf Digest - using only a towel to cover her torso. Professional golfer Lexi Thompson, 20, will appear on the front of May's edition of Golf Digest . She appeared in the Women's U.S. Open when she was just 12. At the time she was the youngest player ever to have appeared in the major tournament . She celebrated the shoot by tweeting: 'I landed on the May cover of @GolfDigest ! So pumped to represent fitness & power.' The decision has sparked a mixed response from readers. PGA teaching pro Chance Scheffing told CBS New York: 'I wasn’t sure if it was a Playboy ad, or if it was a Golf Digest ad.' Golfer Morella Carta added: 'I just think that this is a detriment to women, because I’d like to be recognized by being a good golfer; not about how my body looks like in the front page of a magazine. 'I think that if we allow this to happen, we will never get to the place where we should be.' It is the first time a pro-golfer has appeared on a 'Fitness and Power' issue cover - with past choices embroiling the publication in controversy. Thompson (pictured in 2014) turned professional in June 2010 at age 15 and in September 2011, she set a new record as the youngest-ever winner of an LPGA tournament - 16 years, seven months, and eight days . Fox Sports golf reporter Holly Sonders, who was with the Golf Channel at the time, appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in 2013. The next year, the magazine featured Paulina Gretzky, who was only connected to the sport as PGA tour professional Dustin Johnson's fiancee. LPGA Tour Commissioner Mike Whan said he was 'disappointed' in Golf Digest's position to put Gretzky on the cover. Lorena Ochoa was the last female golfer to appear on the cover back in 2008. Editor-in-chief Jerry Tarde said in a publisher's note: 'We've come a long way from a year ago when the LPGA condemned our choice of Paulina Gretzky (and Holly Sonders in 2013) as the cover images for Golf Digest's annual fitness issue. Mea culpa, ladies. 'You can have stunning beauty and the highest level of golf performance at the same time, as demonstrated this year by Lexi, Stacy Lewis, Cheyenne Woods and Michelle Wie.' Thompson celebrated the shoot by tweeting: 'I landed on the May cover of @GolfDigest ! So pumped to represent fitness & power' He added: 'LPGA players not only outdrive the average guy by 20-plus yards, but they do it with the same clubhead speed we have. We can learn more from them not because they swing like us, but because we should swing like them. 'They don't just muscle the ball and make up for swing flaws with strength.' The publication also confirmed that the shoot took place in a closed set and Thompson's mother was in attendance so she could discard any shots. Thompson made the news last year after jumping into Poppie's Pond, a tradition for tournament winners at the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California. She has just completed a faultless win in the Kraft Nabisco Championship. She turned professional in June 2010 at age 15 and in September 2011, she set a new record as the youngest-ever winner of an LPGA tournament - 16 years, seven months, and eight days - when she won the Navistar LPGA Classic. Thompson was the youngest player to play in the Women's U.S. Open in 2007 when she was just 12. However her record was beaten last year when 11-year-old Lucy Li qualified.

"A supporter waits the best part of an hour for five seconds with Ryan Taylor. There is a quick picture and good-luck message ahead of Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby. He is, evidently, one of the few players genuinely respected by Newcastle's disillusioned fans. Taylor scored the winner at the Stadium of Light three seasons ago, affording him a terrace tribute – 'Ryan Taylor, over the wall' – as well as a place in black-and-white folklore. But there is more to the Toon Army's admiration than one free-kick against the enemy. A working-class Scouser who came through the ranks at Tranmere and made 100 appearances by the time he was 21 before beating three career-threatening injuries, Taylor 'gets' the proud principles of the North East – appreciation, hard graft, honesty and enjoyment. He has himself been a fan in the crowd during three of the last four derby defeats - he watched the other from a hotel room in America after undergoing surgery on the second of the cruciate ligament injuries which kept him out for 26 months. Newcastle utility player Ryan Taylor (right) shields the ball from Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck . Taylor scores with a superb free-kick against Sunderland to win the game 1-0 at the Stadium of Light . Taylor is congratulated by Newcastle defender Steven Taylor  in the club's last victory over Sunderland . Newcastle supported him through that long rehabilitation, something for which Taylor will always be grateful. But with his current contract at St James' Park set to expire this summer, the 30-year-old does not know what the future holds. He would like to remain on Tyneside. He accepts, though, that this could be his final taste of the fixture which has guaranteed him lifelong worship. 'I have to be realistic, this could be my last derby,' he told Sportsmail. 'I don't want it to be, but that will be in my mind. So I'm not going to let it go the way of the last four - that cannot carry on. 'I've left the stadium gutted after every one of them and I've felt it like a fan. So we owe it to them now. 'I grew up with Liverpool and Everton, but that isn't as big because you live in the same house a lot of the time. 'So I'll be doing everything I can personally do to make sure we're up for it, because our performances in the last four just haven't been good enough.' Taylor returned after more than two years of painstaking gym sessions alone for October's 2-0 win at Manchester City in the League Cup. He was man-of-the-match and was greeted by a standing ovation in the dressing-room, where text messages from the likes of Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen awaited. Ninety minutes against the champions, however, had taken its toll. In the next game, at home to QPR, St James' was stunned into silence when, after half an hour, a tearful Taylor sat himself on the turf clutching the same ill-fated knee. Taylor's injury record at Newcastle has severely limited his first-team appearances over the past few years . The 30-year-old is incredibly grateful to Newcastle for sticking by him and hopes to repay them on Sunday . 'I thought to myself, 'Why me?',' he reflects. 'You start doubting whether the knee will ever be strong enough. I was thinking, 'What have I skipped? What have I done wrong?'. 'Within an hour of the game I'd had a scan and the cruciate was fine, relief isn't the word. I'd probably got through the City game on pure adrenaline. So I think it was my body telling me just take your time. 'I won't lie, the fact I'm out of contract was on my mind and I wanted to be back sooner than the three months it took. 'Every game felt like another game off my career. But we did what was right and now there are no problems at all. 'I'll admit there were times when I thought I couldn't do it and my old man just told me 'no'. 'So when you've had the tears and those dark days, you appreciate every minute.' On the subject of dark days, both Newcastle and Sunderland are horribly out of form going into what has been billed as 'The Desperation Derby'. The Black Cats could be in the relegation zone by the time kick-off arrives, while Newcastle have lost their last three under John Carver. To suffer another loss in the derby could prove unforgivable in the eyes of supporters whose last victory arrived courtesy of Taylor's right boot in August, 2011. 'The good thing is we've got a cracking game now and if anything can rally us for the rest of the season then this is it,' says Taylor, who will start at right back. 'To be on a winning team on the ground where it all started for me would make everything worthwhile, all of the hard work and long days during those two years. 'But I remember that day so well. It was my first derby. I've played in two now and I'm yet to lose. 'Jonas (Gutierrez) won a foul just on the corner of the box. My first Premier League goal – for Wigan against Newcastle – was from that exact position, so I fancied it. 'I remember seeing Simon Mignolet edging out, almost inviting me to put it in the top corner. That's what I did. Steven Taylor tried to claim it, but he was nowhere near it. He tried to celebrate my goal by himself! 'I knew my dad and brother were in the away end celebrating and I just thought, 'Wow. They will be having some time in there'. Taylor is one of the most popular players at Newcastle for his consistent and hard working performances . 'Dan Gosling – one of my best mates – went through on goal in the last minute. Looking back, I'm probably relieved he didn't score to make it 2-0! 'I didn't realise at the time how big scoring the winner was and how much I would be remembered for just one goal. 'It'll be amazing if I'm coming back here in 10 years' time with my two boys and they're still singing that song.' Taylor adds: 'I'll always be a Newcastle fan. This club has been brilliant with me. I could have been the forgotten man but they stuck by me. 'Now I need to show them that I can stay fit. I've had some terrible luck, but I'd like to think I've got a lot left in me. 'So this final part of the season is massive for me – I would love to stay here.' And with that the supporter has his photo. 'What's going to happen on Sunday?' Taylor is asked. '1-0. Ryan Taylor. Over the wall,' he laughs. You can see why they like him in these parts. Taylor is out of contract at the end of the season and admits he does not know what the future has in store .","Ryan Taylor's injury record has severely limited the number of first-team appearances he has made for Newcastle .

But Wenger said: 'Yes, I'm worried about Theo's confidence. He's sensitive and I'm a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. 'He's not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. 'At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger does not know the exact reason Alexis Sanchez chose the Emirates Stadium over Anfield - but he is glad the Chile forward will be lining up for his side rather than against them for Liverpool on Saturday. Sanchez had his selection of clubs once Barcelona had decided to let him leave, and following the World Cup, the 26-year-old was convinced to continue his career under Wenger's expert guidance, going on to make an instant impression in English football. The French coach, however, admits the possibility Liverpool could use their interest in Sanchez as leverage during negotiations over Luis Suarez's move to the Nou Camp last summer was always on the cards. Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal . Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (right) is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club . 'At the end of the day, only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us. I don't know why he did that, but we are happy that he made that decision,' said Wenger of the £32million Chile forward, who has netted 19 goals so far. 'I was (aware of Liverpool's interest), but you never know if it is really true, but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez (from Barcelona). 'In the negotiations, yes, it is a strength - and it makes sense, an exchange and some money for Liverpool.' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around. 'If you look at the qualities, efficiency, work-rate, fighting spirit - (he is at the) top,' the Arsenal boss added. 'When it (the game) becomes flat, he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters.' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash, Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, who has so far rejected a new contract offer. Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish, Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge. 'He has done very well. I think he found a solution at the right time,' the Arsenal manager said. 'They did well last season too, they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League, which is absolutely fantastic.' Wenger has moved to play down speculation linking him with Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling .","Alexis Sanchez had offers from several clubs when he left Barcelona last summer, including Arsenal and Liverpool .

"Sometime in the next few weeks, Louis van Gaal has a lunch appointment with Sir Alex Ferguson. On Friday he expressed a tongue-in-cheek hope that Ferguson will pay but, more pertinently, the current Manchester United manager hopes to have some genuine and tangible progress to talk about. Ferguson, it must be said, has waited a long time for such news. The United team he left to David Moyes moved only backwards while this season’s version has only occasionally appeared genuinely purposeful under Van Gaal. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal revealed he is set to discuss the club with Sir Alex Ferguson soon . Van Gaal is preparing his side for Saturday's  clash against Aston Villa as they bid to finish in the top four . How the Premier League table looks ahead of April 4 . Now, though, towards the end of this peculiar Barclays Premier League season, life at the business end of the table has become a little more interesting. Successive United victories over Tottenham and Liverpool have left both those teams listing a little. In second, meanwhile, Manchester City, one senses, have stopped looking ahead and started to glance over their shoulder. On Saturday, for example, a win for United over Aston Villa would take Van Gaal’s team above City, who don’t play until Monday night’s engagement at Crystal Palace. Then, a week on Sunday, the two Manchester teams meet. No wonder Van Gaal was sounding perky on Friday. All of a sudden, places two, three and four in the Premier League have begun to look rather interchangeable and it’s United who look in decent shape to benefit. ‘The comments of United legends are always important because they have a lot of fans,’ said Van Gaal on Friday when asked about Gary Neville’s suggestion that the recent United performance at Liverpool was one of the best he could remember. Juan Mata (left) scored twice as United won 2-1 at top four rivals Liverpool in the league on March 22 . Van Gaal knows victory over Villa on Saturday could see them leapfrog Manchester City into second place . ‘And fans are listening to the legends so it’s nice for Manchester United. It’s nice for the players, and also nice for the manager when legends are saying that. But I think that if, for example, Sir Alex Ferguson says that then I am more proud because he can judge as a manager much better than ex-players what is the achievement in such a game. ‘Sir Alex is always on his way (travelling) so it’s difficult to speak with him. But we have made an appointment and he shall pay - that is very important!’ Back from a break in Amsterdam with his wife, Van Gaal looked ready for the challenges ahead. He remains cautious and understandably so. His team have let him down before this season and United still have each of the current top three to play between now and mid-May. While Van Gaal says United are mathematically in the title race, he says the top-four battle is not over either . Nevertheless, he is aware of problems that have currently mounted in front of Liverpool’s Brendan Rodgers since United beat his team 13 days ago and knows that defeat at Arsenal Saturday lunchtime could all but end the Merseyside club’s challenge for fourth place. All season United have been allowed to keep in touch with the top four simply because of other teams’ failings. Now Van Gaal has reason to hope his team’s improved form can take them somewhere more meaningful. Asked if second place was now a realistic possibility, the United manager said: ‘Of course. I cannot deny that because we have Manchester City at home next week. ‘We have the strongest record at home so it’s possible. But Manchester City is a top team so it shall not be easy. ‘It’s better to be second or third. I would be pleased with fourth, but I want to be first. And my players want to be first. And when it’s not first, it’s second.’ Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (third right) knows defeat at Arsenal  could end their top four bid . The Reds have fitness concerns over star striker Daniel Sturridge (right) ahead of the trip to the Emirates . For Rodgers and his staff, the last fortnight will have been a long one.

If his team are to get the result they need at Arsenal on Saturday they will have done very well indeed, given the absence of the suspended Martin Skrtel and Steven Gerrard and injury concerns over striker Daniel Sturridge. Arsenal remain well-placed. They have lost one domestic game in 14 since defeat at Southampton on New Year’s Day, leaving Manuel Pellegrini’s City team looking rather vulnerable in second position as they try to make something of a season that already has the word ‘disappointment’ written right through it. On Friday, Van Gaal conceded that it was ‘mathematically possible’ for United to win the league. Meanwhile, Danny Welbeck (left) will hoping to continue Arsenal's impressive league form . That is a fanciful notion and he knows it but he and everybody else associated with the club would certainly enjoy the sense of discomfort City will undoubtedly feel if they find themselves looking at the backs of United’s heads by the close of play on Saturday. City only have themselves to blame for what may yet become something of a predicament. United have, by common consensus, been scratchy at best this season but if City find themselves in their wake on Saturday then what does that say about them? At the root of all this, of course, is that this remains a rather average Premier League. It contains only one very good side and they, Chelsea, have waned themselves a little recently. From a morass of mediocrity, however, somebody could yet benefit. Van Gaal will only hope that he is on course for an interesting lunch with the one man who has seen it all, and much more, many times before.","Manchester United host Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday .

"Northampton's maligned hit man is primed to go big-game hunting again  with no intention of toning down his use of legitimate force in the wake of renewed criticism. Courtney Lawes arrived in France with the Saints, ahead of the Champions Cup quarter-final against mighty Clermont Auvergne, carrying notoriety as excess baggage. His brutal tackle on France fly-half Jules Plisson at Twickenham last month, in the Six Nations finale, angered the visitors to the extent that they tried to have him banned. While the match officials and citing officer deemed that no action was needed, the England lock has been derided as a thug across the Channel and there were cries of protest in these parts, too. England lock Courtney Lawes made a trademark hit on France fly-half Jules Plisson . Click here to read Jeff's article on Lawes' tackle . Writing in these pages, Jeff Powell suggested that Lawes should apologise for an offence that he argued would put parents off allowing their children to play such a brutal, damaging game. The comments found their target but the 26-year-old is a laid-back character and was unfazed by the storm he had created. ‘I just took it on the chin and thought, “People are going to say what they think sometimes, and sometimes people are going to view things differently”,’ said Lawes as he prepared for another momentous Anglo-French encounter. ‘Obviously he has the outlet of the Daily Mail to post his thoughts. I tweeted him. I wasn’t fussed about it but I thought I’d send him a little tweet, just to get my own back a bit!’ Aside from that particular outburst of condemnation, there were widespread concerns expressed about the timing and legality of his tackling style, but Lawes is unperturbed and emphasised his largely clean disciplinary record. ‘To be honest, as long as it is legal and I’m not putting my team in any jeopardy doing it, in terms of me getting booked or sent off or anything like that, I’m going to do anything I can to help the team,’ he said. ‘I’m not the sort of person who is fussed about what people think of me. I’m only bothered about what I can do for my team and for myself as a player. Coaches know how good you are, no matter what things other people are saying outside the room. Lawes crumples Plisson in the aftermath of his monstrous tackle on the French fly half . ‘The fact is that my record is very clean. I’ve only been cited once and I’ve never been red-carded. I don’t think I’ve had many yellows, if any, this year. I don’t have a malicious streak. I know I’m not a thug, I don’t go around punching or fighting, any of that rubbish. ‘I just get on with the game. I don’t even allow people to get me too aggravated, I just get on with my own thing. I’m comfortable being who I am. If people want to say I’m something else, that’s fair enough.’ One of the accusations levelled at Lawes is that he sets out to intimidate smaller opponents, notably half-backs, leading to a multitude of one-sided collisions. He argues that trying to unsettle and nullify these primary decision- makers is a reasonable and vital aspect of his repertoire. ‘If you can put pressure on the 10, then you go out and put pressure on the 10, and if you can do it legally then why can’t you do it?’ he said. ‘That’s the way I see it. I’ve got that kind of timing around the ruck and I’ve got the speed to get to the 10. My size is the reason that the impact is so big, but I don’t go looking for it. A livid Yoann Maestri pushed Lawes in the face and grapples with the England man following his challenge . Lawes and Maestri continue their disagreement on their feet as matters threaten to boil over . ‘It makes a big difference to the game if you can stop the 10 from passing or stop that particular play. It doesn’t even have to be a big hit, it just makes a difference if that 10 knows that he has pressure on him. ‘There is obviously a line between a legitimate and a late tackle because people get yellow-carded for late tackles. ‘You watch the replay of the hit on Plisson and the other player has not caught the ball before we’ve hit the ground. The fact is, had the tackle not looked as severe as it did no-one would have said anything. ‘The only reason is because of the impact, which looks bad because he’s landed on his head. I haven’t tipped him up or anything like that — I’ve just followed through with my tackle. I didn’t even know he didn’t have the ball until I looked up afterwards.’ 26-year-old Lawes passes the ball during a Northampton Saints training session earlier this week . Lawes has revealed that he intends to maintain his destructive style of play for Northampton on Saturday . Asked if he intended to resume normal, destructive service for Northampton on Saturday — in defiance of the criticism — he added: ‘Yeah, of course. I’ve never done anything to get myself sent off in terms of my tackle timing or whatever, so why would I stop if it is legal?’ Northampton, the champions of England, face a colossal challenge against a French club who simply do not lose at home, especially in Europe. The Saints and three of their fellow Aviva Premiership teams have daunting ties away from home, but captain Dylan Hartley has hope for the quartet. ‘I am fully confident in ourselves,’ Hartley said. ‘I think Wasps have a big ask in Toulon but we saw with 14 men the other night how dangerous they can be. I think Sarries against Racing could get a result there. And Bath v Leinster, who knows? I think there could be a few upsets.’","Courtney Lawes has been derided as a thug across the Channel .

"Juan Mata has revealed that Wayne Rooney believes England can win Euro 2016 in France - and he tells him so every day. In an interview with Football Focus, Manchester United's player of the month for March lifted the lid on England captain Rooney's bullish attitude looking ahead to the tournament in June next year. And Mata, who has not played for Spain since their exit from the 2014 World Cup in the group stages in Brazil, admitted England could be a team to look out for.

Mata (left) has spoken of his desire to earn a recall to the Spain squad after missing out since the World Cup . 'I think England has that potential,' Mata said. 'You have a lot of good players, talented players already paying in the Premier League for a long time so maybe the next Euros - as Rooney is telling me every day - you will do a great job in France. 'He keeps telling me that, ""We can win, we can win, we have a great team, we have a young team, quick team, I'm the captain and we can win!"" He has that confidence.'

"Anthony Joshua believes his 'hunger and determination' will more than make up for Jason Gavern's superior experience when the pair go head to head in Newcastle on Saturday. Joshua will be entering the ring for the first time in 2015, after he was forced to pull out of a January fight against Kevin Johnson due to a stress fracture in his back. The London 2012 gold medallist is unbeaten in 10 professional bouts but yet to go past round three, while Gavern is walking into the ring for the 50th time in his career. Anthony Joshua poses at his weigh-in ahead of the fight with Jason Gavern at the Newcastle Metro Arena . 'At 11 fights he's probably looking at me like I'm a raw novice in the professional world,' Joshua told IFL TV. 'He's got 50 fights and he's looking at himself like he has so much experience but hunger and determination has got me through a lot of the time. 'I'm 10 fights in now - double figures. I can definitely say I'm learning and everything will be second nature on Saturday. 'I'll try not to let the nerves get to me. I'm going to stay calm. It's a mental thing. 'Sparring has been really good. I've been sparring with guys who are sharp and I've been handling business in sparring so I should be good to go on Saturday night.' Gavern's last fight in the UK came in November 2013, when he lost the Prizefighter final to Michael Sprott - an opponent Joshua took just 90 seconds to knock out in November. The British heavyweight is, however, taking nothing for granted this weekend. 'There's no sparring you can do to prepare for Gavern,' Joshua said. 'With 50 fights and so much experience, he's a very awkward opponent. 'I've watched his videos and he's awkward to hit. 'He's entertaining as well - he can get in your head mentally. 'I've been out five months so I'll probably have a bit of ring rust myself while he'll be sharp so there will be some heavyweight blows and may the best man win.'

Gavern has not had long to prepare for Joshua as he was only confirmed on the card a week ago but the 37-year-old American has vowed to put on a show at the Metro Radio Arena. 'Boxing is about opportunities and I'm looking forward to this fight,' Gavern said. 'I saw the odds on Facebook of me getting knocked out within 15 seconds, or 20 seconds or 30 seconds - it's kind of funny. 'It's the heavyweight division, Anthony Joshua is here for a reason.

"Raheem Sterling and Theo Walcott will likely go head-to-head at the Emirates on Saturday. They are at starkly different places in their careers with 26-year-old Walcott perhaps acting as a cautionary tale for Sterling, 20, that early promise can sometimes give way to unfulfilled potential. Both are in the process of negotiating contracts with their respective clubs. Brendan Rodgers has spoken in the past of his admiration for Walcott while Wenger has made no secret he is a fan of Sterling. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the clubs could do a direct swap. Although Wenger would have to deviate from his usually cautious financial approach to win the race to sign Sterling while Rodgers would be hard pushed to sell Walcott as a worthy replacement for Sterling. Here Sportsmail looks at the merits of the two English wingers. Theo Walcott and Raheem Sterling, England's leading wingers, are both in contract negotians with their clubs . Sterling has been one of Liverpool's best players this season, but his contract dispute has caused problems . THIS SEASON SO FAR . Sterling: He has been one of Liverpool’s best players throughout the season, making 28 Premier League appearances and scoring six top-flight goals while boasting an impressive 81% pass completion rate. He has as struggled to make an impact since being used as a wing-back. Walcott: There’s not a lot to go on for Walcott, who has played just 13 games in all competitions, struggling for game time after returning from a long-term layoff for a knee injury. Arsenal do seem to perform slightly better when Walcott features, winning 62.50% of their Premier League games when he is in the team, compared to 59.1% without him. TEAM PLAYER? Sterling: While Sterling’s contract negotiations might be viewed as a distraction to the team he has been an unselfish and determined player during his career so far, providing seven assists in the Premier League this season. He has linked up well with Daniel Sturridge before the striker was injured and happily played second fiddle to Luis Suarez last season when Brendan Rodgers built his team around the Uruguayan. Walcott: Is always encouraging to younger players and a good influence to have in the dressing room but he has failed to provide one assist this season and rarely contributes to defensive duties. Walcott looked out of sorts for England this week, and has not yet provided an assist this season . Sterling turns away from Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs when the two clubs met earlier this season . WOW FACTOR . Sterling: Sterling is undoubtedly exciting, can provoke disbelief with his mazy runs and deceptive strength for someone so slight. But his biggest strength is his pace. His top speed this season of 21.77 mph puts him sixth in the Premier League rankings. The problem could lie in the fact he may not be as good as he thinks he is. Walcott: The off-the-mark pace and an eye for the unconventional yet effective pass which made Walcott a sensation as a 16-year-old playing for Southampton have waned somewhat. Although he is still quick, his fastest sprint this season registering at 21.11 mph, a series of injuries have impacted his speed. His inventiveness off-the-ball has been dulled by a lack of confidence. If he can have a period of uninterrupted play he might be able to recapture some of his ‘wow factor’ but he is never going to be a world-class player or a game changer. First team opportunities have been limited for Walcott this season, with the winger frustrated by injury . Sterling has scored six times and created 62 chances in the Premier League this season . FANS' FAVOURITE? Sterling: Sterling has damaged his public image, possibly irreparably, in the red half of Merseyside with protracted contract wrangling over recent weeks. He said in an interview with the BBC’s Natalie Perks that he wanted to dispel the idea he was a greedy 20-year-old. But he could have done that simply by signing a £100,000 a week contract at a club where he plays regularly and the manager is proven at developing young talent, if that really was the case. Walcott: He is a likeable personality, rarely in the headlines for the wrong reasons, but fans will ultimately judge him on his play and Walcott seems to divide opinion. He has flashes of brilliance but his form is erratic and fans want someone they can count on. THE FUTURE . Sterling: It is easy to forget Sterling, who made his full Liverpool debut at 17 years, 107 days, is still only 20. On the face of it his future is blindingly bright and his potential boundless. Sterling has hit a top speed of 21.77 mph this season, ranking him sixth in the Premier League.  Walcott's fastest speed this season is 21.11 mph. Clubs all over Europe are said to be monitoring him and he has admitted it is his dream to play for a big club ‘somewhere warm’ but we have seen all too many times young talent going unrealised. The decisions Sterling and his advisors make in the coming months could be crucial. Walcott: For Walcott, who was selected for his first World Cup at 16, the last six years have been marred by a failure to deliver on his promise. Those clubs who might be interested in signing him should take encouragement from the fact we might not have seen the best of Walcott yet. Sterling might have permanently damaged his relationship with the Liverpool fans with his interview . The 20-year-old could still stay at Anfield beyond this summer if manager Brendan Rodgers gets his way .","Arsene Wenger is a great admirer of Raheem Sterling, while both he and Theo Walcott are struggling to negotiate new deals .
Sterling has scored more goals and provided more assists this season .

"As the man who brought through the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo, Sir Alex Ferguson knows a thing or two about producing world-class talent. And the former Manchester United boss has tipped Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar to be the next man to challenge for the title of world's best player, competing with Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. But Ferguson says the 23-year-old, who has been a star since joining Barca from Santos in his homeland two years ago, is still some way off. Sir Alex Ferguson has picked Neymar as the player to reach the level of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo . Neymar is the Brazil captain and has been in superb form for both club and country this season . Since joining Barcelona Neymar has been behind Messi in the pecking order, but he could emerge soon . 'You'll always look at clubs like Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United to produce that kind of player you're talking about,' he told radio station SiriusXM FC when asked who can rival Messi and Ronaldo. 'But to be honest I'm not sure there's one sticking out at the moment. The boy Neymar gets a lot of publicity about the potential he's got, but I think that's still to be seen, still to be fulfilled. 'Certainly, most people I speak to speak highly of the boy. When I had Anderson at United, he spoke volumes about the boy's ability. 'So hopefully he'll be the next one who'll produce the type of talent we see in Messi and Ronaldo.' Ferguson insisted that there is no standout player capable of rivaling Messi or Ronaldo at the moment . The two stars are undisputedly the top two players in world football, sharing the last seven Ballon d'Ors . The Premier League's most successful ever manager also backed Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, and revealed that the Italian reached out to Ferguson's son, Darren, when he was sacked by Peterborough in February. 'Carlo is a top man,' said Ferguson. 'I was over at the Real Madrid game with Schalke and he was fantastic. 'He came up and he knew Darren had lost his job at Peterborough and said ""Why doesn't Darren come and spend a few days at Real Madrid training? It will do him the world of good"". 'He was fantastic. I can't say enough about that man. He is top drawer - a fantastic human being and a great coach. 'Carlo is one of the best coaches I've ever come across and one of my biggest opponents, so I wouldn't worry about his future, that's for sure.'","Former Manchester United boss says no-one is close to world's top two .

"Spain manager Vicente del Bosque was flabbergasted as to how his star-studded side failed to find the back of the net despite taking 'command' of their friendly defeat by Holland on Tuesday night. Despite the visitors dominating significant periods of the match, it was goals to Holland's Stefan de Vrij and Davy Klaassen that proved decisive at the Amsterdam ArenA. But it's Spain's lack of composure in front of goal that most frustrated Del Bosque. Holland's Stefan de Vrij meets a cross from Wesley Sneijder to opening the scoring against Spain . Within four minutes Davy Klaasen pounced on the rebound from his own shot after David de Gea's save . Vicente del Bosque says his Spanish side were made to pay for a lacklustre opening 20 minutes . 'It seems impossible not to have scored ... The first 20 minutes have burdened us,' Del Bosque said after the match. Guus Hiddink's side scored twice in the space of four minutes through a 13th-minute De Vrij header from Wesley Sneijder's cross before  Klaassen finished off the rebound from his own shot after it was saved by Manchester United's David De Gea. 'We have taken command of the game, we've been all over them, we have reached the penalty area but we lacked a goal.' Spain's Mario Suarez puts his hands on his head after a failed attempt on goal at Amsterdam ArenA . Gerard Pique shoots into Dutch keeper Kenneth Vermeer in one a number of good chances for Spain .

Del Bosque's side were unable to atone for the 5-1 World Cup thrashing by the same side, a rematch of the 2010 final they won, which was the beginning of the end of their title defence in Brazil . On the bright side, Del Bosque was impressed with the debuts of Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla winger Vitolo. 'The two rookies have had a good performance. Vitolo has been very active and Juanmi looked like scoring,' Del Bosque added. Sevilla winger Vitolo runs into space as he makes his full international debut for Spain on Tuesday night .

"An inmate at an Arizona jail left one officer hospitalized with brain bleeding and broken bones in his face after a psychiatric ward assault. The 18-year-old, who was booked into Lower Buckeye Jail in Phoenix two weeks ago, is seen on surveillance video walking in a room he was not authorized to be in before being approached by two officers. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said that the two jail employees began telling the young man to go back to his cell before he began taking swings at them. Scroll down for video . An assault on an officer at a jail in Phoenix has left one officer in intensive care with brain bleeding. Above, the inmate is captured on video in a psychiatric ward area where he is not authorized . Officers including Scott Beaty (center) approached the unidentified 18-year-old inmate and told him to go back to his cell . The inmate then began punching Beatty and the other officer in the room, who used a Taser but could not subdue the young man . The unnamed inmate, who was not immediately affected by four taser shots, was eventually subdued by a large group of officers who came to the scene. Three detention officers were taken to a nearby hospital, and two of them had been knocked unconscious. Scott Beaty, a 15-year-veteran, was taken to the intensive care unit and will need reconstructive surgery after suffering a brain bleed and broken bones in his face. The inmate, who did not have any prior incidents of bad behavior, was not injured. After knocking Beaty to the ground, the inmate is seen attacking the other officer, who was also taken to a nearby hospital . More officers arrived on the scene where the assault took place, though additional taser shots did not immediately affect the 18-year-old . The unidentified inmate was eventually subdued by a group of officers, who saw their colleague knocked out on the ground after being hit repeatedly . 'Sometimes when you have a mental condition you fight and get super mad,' Arpaio said during a press conference, though he did not elaborate on the mental condition. Arpaio said he could not speculate on what led to the attack. The prisoner became 'very violent' according to officials, and was reportedly fighting until he was put in lock down in the psychiatric ward, where he remains. He will only be allowed out for one hour a day. Though he was booked into Lower Buckeye for a minor felony charge, the prisoner will now face aggravated assault charges. Arpaio said that there have been 178 incidents of assault at his county's jails in the last 12 months. Beaty was taken to the intensive care unit after the incident, where he suffered broken bones in his face and brain bleeding . Three of four officers injured in the attack went to the hospital.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic would have been idolised at the Stade Velodrome if he had followed in the same footsteps at Eric Cantona, according to former Marseille boss Jose Anigo.

"Cape Verde's 2-0 win over Portugal was the most eye-catching international result of the week. So, who are Cape Verde and why has this tiny island off the west coast of Africa suddenly become an international football force? Where are the Cape Verde Islands? Cape Verde is a group of islands 400 miles from Senegal off the west coast of Africa. Its population is around 500,000 and boasts both beautiful beaches and striking volcanic landscapes, making it a haven for tourism . Cape Verde is a picturesque island off the African coast with a population of just 500,000 people . Does it have any footballing tradition? More than you think. Manchester United winger Nani is from Cape Verde and could have played for them instead of Portugal. Celtic and Sweden legend Henrik Larsson's mum is from Cape Verde. Being a former Portuguese colony, most people support the big Lisbon clubs Benfica and Sporting, you see the club's scarves and banners hanging from cafes and bars . Sporting Lisbon ace Nani (centre) is from Cape Verde but decided to represent Portugal at national team level . Former Barcelona star Henrik Larsson could have played for Cape Verde as his mother was born on the island . Why the sudden success? Like a lot of African countries including Algeria and Ghana, Cape Verde decided to start recruiting players who grew up in Europe, mostly Portugal in their case, but were eligible for them through family ties. Around a quarter of the Cape Verde squad are European, although 14 of the 19 players used in Portugal were born on the island. They qualified for their first Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 and reached the quarter-finals, and qualified again this year. They are the smallest nation ever to play in the continental finals. Cape Verde were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of their first ever Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 . Who are the star players? Every member of the squad plays club football outside Cape Verde, mostly in Europe and particularly Portugal. Striker Heldon plays for Sporting Lisbon and midfield set-piece specialist Babanco is with Estoril. Odair Fortes, who scored their second goal against the Portuguese, plays in French football for Reims. Other members of the squad ply their trade from Romania, Angola, Cyprus, Hungary, Holland, Bulgaria and Mexico . Sporting Lisbon striker Heldon, currently on loan at Cordoba, is one of Cape Verde's key players . What can Cape Verde offer visitors? Firstly, sunshine. The temperatures rarely dip below 21 degrees Celsius (70 F) even in the December and January winger months. The name of the main beach Boa Vista (beautiful view) says it all. It is beginning to become a big tourist destination, just a six-hour flight from the UK. Visitors are encouraged to sample the excellent local fish and admire the spectacular dunes and volcanic mountains. Boa Vista beach, pictured, is one of the main attractions on the small island of Cape Verde . Are they a flash-in-the-pan? The FIFA rankings would suggest not. Cape Verde currently stand 38th in the world, one place ahead of Scotland. Although they failed to make the knockout stages of this year's Africa Cup of Nations, they did return home unbeaten after three draws against Tunisia, Congo and former winners Zambia. Cape Verde celebrate during their 2-0 friendly victory over Portugal on Tuesday evening . What is the special relationship with Portugal? Portuguese explorers discovered the island in 1456 and it stayed a Portuguese colony until independence in 1975. But famine and lack of economic opportunity around the same time meant many young Cape Verde men were forced to go to Portugal to build new lives there. Now the country's football team is helping them re-establish their roots. The reason for Tuesday night's friendly in the first place was to raise money for the victims of a volcanic eruption on the Cape Verdean island of Fogo. And the only saving grace for Portugal... Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't playing. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was rested for Portgual's clash against Cape Verde .","Cape Verde defeated Portugal 2-0 in an international friendly match .

"A Chinese villager who was desperate to become a grandfather has been arrested for buying a wife for his son, then reselling her to another family after realising she was infertile. The man, known only as Xu, even tried to impregnate the 'daughter-in-law' himself after discovering his son had not slept with his wife a single time. Xu is currently under arrest for human trafficking by the police of Lianyungang city in eastern China, according to the People's Daily Online. Desperate for a grandchild, Xu (pictured) bought a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties . Xu and his son live outside Yancheng, a city of 1.6 million in eastern China. Hoping for a grandchild to carry on the bloodline, he spent 12,000 yuan (£1,311) purchasing a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties, through a middleman at the beginning of 2014. It's reported that the young bride, known only as Wang, is also mentally impaired. Six months after Wang 'married' into the family, Xu discovered that the young couple had not slept together at all. Desperate to have a 'grandson', Xu decided to have sex with her himself. After spending six months trying to get Wang pregnant, he realised that the young bride was likely to be infertile. The wife (pictured), known as Wang, was resold to another family after failing to get pregnant . Worrying that Wang, whose mental health was getting worse, might be a drain to the family without 'any concrete contribution', Xu sold her off to another family through a middleman in his village for 10,000 yuan (£1,093). The astonishing incident only emerged after a regular home visit by the community policemen at Guanyun County. The local policemen discovered the incident while paying a visit to the family who bought Wang from Xu . 'We asked her (Wang) name and age, but she couldn't answer,' said Gao Ming, a policeman at Guanyun County police station. This put Gao and his colleagues on alert and it took them two weeks to find out how Wang had been trafficked into the village. 'The whole thing is pathetic and detestable,' said Guo Jialun, head of the Guanyun County police station. The police is currently trying to track down Wang's real family.","The man, known only as Xu, was keen to have a grandchild .

"Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United at Elland Road after the Welsh club backed their fans in handing back their allocation of 500 tickets. Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United . The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game . Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets . The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets . 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were . Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon . West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday . Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday . 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The ""bad old days"" of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of ""fans"" have thankfully been left far behind us now. This is now reflected in the respectful treatment received from the majority of clubs we visit.

"Sportsmail's Derek Lawrenson gives his predictions ahead of the 79th Masters at Augusta on Thursday. Best American . So many to choose from but given Augusta’s predilection for a tale of redemption — from Vijay ‘kiss my ass’ Singh to Adam ‘this one’s for you, Greg’ Scott — let’s go for the reformed party animal Dustin Johnson. Time for him to prove he can match his gargantuan yardage off the tee with the requisite amount of brain cells. Dustin Johnson watches his tee shot during a practice round on the Augusta course on Wednesday . Best European (Non-UK) Not so many to choose from, alas. Indeed, given Henrik Stenson spent a week in bed with flu recently and reckons his strength is still low, we’re almost empty-handed. Still, let’s hope the Swede can rise from his sick bed. Other than that, it’s time Victor Dubuisson returned to the limelight. Henrik Stenson has only recently recovered from flu but the Swede will be hoping to mount a serious challenge . Best from the UK . Let’s leave out the history man on the grounds he has his own category. Lee Westwood has got an impressive recent record at Augusta and Justin Rose has shown he can play well here. But I have a feeling Paul Casey is the most likely to join Rory and get into contention come Sunday afternoon. Best International . You can hardly have faith in Adam Scott to emulate Bubba Watson and win a second Masters in three years given he’s confused enough on the greens to be going back to the long putter. While Scott sorts himself out, compatriot Jason Day has an outstanding chance to grab another win for Australia. Jason Day has a great chance to become another Australian winner at the Masters . Best each way bet . When you think last year’s joint runner-up Jonas Blixt is 150-1, there are some tasty odds out there. How about Padraig Harrington at 80-1? Or Bernhard Langer to finish in the top six at 400-1? My particular favourite is three-time Masters champ Phil Mickelson at 25-1. A steal. Phil Mickelson watches his fairway shot on the 11th green during his practice round on Wednesday . How will Rory do? Given what it would do for the sport and what an achievement it would represent, I fervently hope Bubba Watson is slipping a size 38 regular jacket on to McIlroy’s shoulders come Sunday night. But this might prove the major where he falls just short — and we have to wait a couple of years to enjoy his Slam. Prediction: Third . Rory McIlroy will begin his quest for a Grand Slam when the Masters kicks into action on Thursday . How will Tiger do? Not as good as some American writers believe, who are fitting him up for his fifth green jacket already on the strength of shooting 33 for the front nine on a practice round on Monday. Not as bad as the doomsayers think either, though. He should make the halfway cut… and maybe scrape into the top 20. Prediction: 19th . Tiger Woods was joined by his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn (left) and his two children on the course on Wednesday .","Dustin Johnson can prove himself at this year's tournament .

"Santiago Vergini has indicated he may be ready to extend his stay at Sunderland after revealing Premier League survival could trigger the offer of a two-year permanent contract. The 26-year-old Argentinian returned to the Stadium of Light on a season-long loan deal from Costa Rican side Sport Uruguay de Coronado in August last year and has made 35 appearances to date this season. The last of them was a start in Sunday's 1-0 derby victory over Newcastle which provided a huge boost to the club's top-flight survival hopes.

Above, the Sunderland defender battles with Ayoze Perez for the ball . Vergini celebrates with team-mate Costel Pantilimon at the full-time whistle following the Wear-Tyne derby win . A successful completion of new head coach Dick Advocaat's mission to keep the Black Cats in the Premier League could have significant consequences for Vergini, and he is open to what might come his way. He told the Sunderland Echo: 'In the contract, it is written that if we stay in the Premier League, I can stay here for another two years. I feel very comfortable here, both at the club and outside the club, so I would be very keen to stay. 'The only downside is the climate and the weather, but even that has been good for the last few days! 'It has been very good to play regularly [this season] and I am very happy. I think with time, I have been able to adapt more to the style of play and also to my team-mates. Vergini helped Sunderland keep a clean sheet in the derby win as he makes a slide tackle on Perez . Sunderland initially signed Vergini on loan in January 2014, with the defender making his debut in an FA Cup fourth round clash with Kidderminster where he makes an attempt to tackle Jack Bryne . 'Apart from the struggles we are going through in the league, I have felt very comfortable.' Victory over the Magpies - their first in nine games in all competitions - eased Sunderland into 15th place and three points clear of the relegation zone. However, that could count for little if Advocaat's men fail to build upon it when Crystal Palace head north on Saturday. Vergini said: 'Every win brings with it a lot of confidence and with a derby game, that is even more the case. In our next game, we need to show the same character and the same spirit as we did on Sunday.'","Santiago Vergini is on a season-long loan at Sunderland .

"MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain’s nuclear, transport and public services after suicide pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster. And concerns are so great that one security source has warned: ‘However much physical security you have, if someone is already in there, there’s nothing you can do to stop them committing an act of sabotage or terrorism.’ MI5 is now giving advice on the risk posed by thousands of employees working in sensitive areas – known as ‘insiders’ – highlighted by the Germanwings disaster. Warning: MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain’s nuclear, transport and public services after co-pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster . Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was being treated for depression, was able to override a security system installed on flights following the 9/11 attacks as he flew the aircraft into the ground. Guidance issued by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), a security agency accountable to the director general of MI5, recommends continuous psychological assessment of key employees, with the highest priority given to workers whose jobs pose the greatest risk to the public. But a BA pilot, who has been with the company for several years and flies regularly around the world, claimed the airline did not carry out mental health checks. The pilot, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘British Airways is more interested in checking whether I have a hernia than mental health. ‘There is no testing regarding mental health.’ A BA spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots. The CPNI has identified a number of motives for employees becoming an insider threat, including theft, revenge, a hunger for notoriety, political or religious ideology and fear or coercion, where external pressure is exerted on a worker. Rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 . A CPNI study showed that three-quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation, but whose loyalties changed after recruitment. Disturbingly, it also found that in many circumstances the workers had been in their organisation for some years before going rogue. Some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information – such as in the case of US whistleblower Edward Snowden – process corruption (where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends) and corporate espionage. The security source said: ‘Years ago, the emphasis was on external security. Now ‘‘the insider’’ is the growing threat, as seen in the cases of Edward Snowden and Lubitz. ‘We advise companies to look closely at their personnel. The higher security clearance they gain over their time of employment, the closer they should be monitored.’","Alert issued over rogue workers in nuclear, transport and public services .
