"Armstrong, 26, pleaded guilty of trying to bring a stun gun, a baton and knuckle dusters back into the UK from Cyprus in his luggage (file picture) A holidaymaker who jetted off to Cyprus to celebrate his new job was sacked before starting after returning with a stun gun, baton and knuckle duster in his luggage. Paul Armstrong, 26, of Sunderland, flew to Cyprus with four friends before beginning his new role as an IT project manager. But after a spending spree on the trip, Armstrong was stopped at the airport with the stun gun disguised as a torch, extendable baton and knuckle duster stuffed in his luggage. A court heard how the stun gun was capable of administering an electrical discharge which would cause a victim to 'startle and repel'. Armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and two offensive weapons and lost his job before he even started it. Judge John Milford QC told Newcastle Crown Court: 'The general public need to be warned about the gravity of bringing home such souvenirs. 'What he did was foolish. It must be realised that the court takes very seriously the bringing into this country of those items. 'A stun gun is, within the legislation of this country, a firearm. It is an extremely serious offence to possess one. 'It is highly undesirable that they should be in circulation in this country.' The 26-year-old was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with £2,000 costs at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) The judge said a prison sentence was not necessary in Armstrong's case as there was no suggestion he would use the weapons, had never been in trouble before and had recently found employment. Judge Milford added: 'He had an extremely good job lined up. As a consequence of these proceedings, which he had to reveal to his perspective employers, he lost that job.' As such, Armstrong was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with £2,000 costs. Glen Gatland, defending, said; 'He has never been in trouble with the police and is of previous good character. 'He went on holiday to Cyprus with four friends (in the summer of 2013) who had been to primary school together. 'The reason he went was because he had been offered a job as IT project manager with retail branches in London and Zurich. 'He would have been moving away and not able to see his friends.' The court heard three of the friends who had been on the holiday with Armstrong received warnings after batons and knuckle dusters were found in their luggage. Mr Gatland said the weapons were bought from a 'corner shop' in Cyprus and Armstrong had been given the knuckle duster free with his other purchases.","Paul Armstrong flew to Cyprus to celebrate new job as IT project manager .

"The BBC has been accused of launching a Left-wing stitch-up on David Cameron after the Conservative party leader was repeatedly interrupted while trying to answer questions on Radio 1. Host Chris Smith was also accused of being hostile towards the Prime Minister, at one point offering to bet £1,000 that he would not win a majority. Listeners commenting on Twitter accused the programme of ‘leftist hostility’ and branded the interview ‘appalling’. Scroll down for video . The BBC has been accused of left-wing bias after David Cameron received a hostile reaction while being interviewed on Radio 1, including from host Chris Smith (right) who bet £1,000 he wouldn't win a majority . The Prime Minister was consistently interrupted while trying to answer questions on the Live Lounge programme, with some Twitter users branding it 'disgusting' At one point, the Prime Minister was asked to rule out a deal with Northern Ireland’s DUP because of its policies towards lesbian and gay people. Mr Cameron said he did not want a coalition with anybody and insisted he could win a majority – prompting Mr Smith to insist be forced into coalition. Clearly irritated, the Prime Minister replied: ‘You seem to know the outcome of the election. How do you know. Have you got some God-given right to declare what the result of the election is?’ Mr Smith then said: ‘I bet you a thousand pounds you don’t win a majority.’ The PM insisted: ‘I’m not going to start taking bets but there is every opportunity in the next 15 days for there to be a majority government.’ People used social media to complain about the programme, broadcast this evening, during which many felt like David Cameron got a hostile reaction . Users of social media criticised the presenter as ‘childish’ and ‘arrogant’. ‘Who is this guy? Simply shouldn’t be allowed to present,’ wrote one. Twitter user Calvin Robinson said: 'Wow, that BBC Radio 1 interview of David Cameron is disgusting. Talk about a biased and hostile interviewer, utter contempt from Chris Smith.' Meanwhile Adam Ewies added: 'Cameron ambushed by lefty presenter and audience on Radio 1 tonight, as was Farage with Evans. Lefty BBC has no credibility.' Mr Cameron also clashed with an audience member who accused him of adopting a policy of ‘let them drown’ over migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean. While some complained about the audience and their apparent reluctance to listen to the Prime Minister, others turned their ire on host Chris Smith .","David Cameron grilled by young voters on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge .

"Adam Gadahn, a former Little Leaguer who grew up to become a spokesman for Osama bin Laden, was born in 1978 in Oregon as Adam Pearlman. He converted to Islam at the age of 17 . Adam Gadahn, a former Little Leaguer who grew up to become a spokesman for Osama bin Laden, was born in 1978 in Oregon as Adam Pearlman. Gadahn, who had treason charges pending against him, was killed in a drone strike in January, the White House acknowledged on Thursday. Another January drone strike killed Ahmed Farouq, the operations leader for Al-Qaida in Pakistan, as well as an American hostage and an Italian hostage. Gadahn's father, a musician in California, changed his name from Pearlman to Gadahn in the 1970s. Gadahn, who was raised as a Protestant Christian, grew up and was home-schooled on a goat farm in Riverside County, California. In 1995, at age 17, he converted to Islam at a mosque in nearby Orange County. A few years later, he moved to Pakistan, where he joined al-Qaida as a propagandist. Using the name 'Azzam the American,' he appeared in numerous al-Qaida videos, denouncing U.S. moves in Afghanistan and elsewhere and threatening attacks on Western interests abroad. His work led to Gadahn becoming the only American charged with treason since the World War II era. U.S. authorities filed treason charges against him in 2006 and had offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction. The FBI's Reward for Justice program, which lists wanted terrorists, said Gadahn was 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed a little more than 200 pounds. He had brown hair, brown or hazel eyes and had scars on his chest and right forearm. Further details about Gadahn surfaced in documents leaked by former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden. He was killed during a drone strikes by US forces in January. He was the first American citizen to be charged with treason since the Second World War . U.S. authorities filed treason charges against him in 2006 and had offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction . The documents show that bin Laden's inner circle was frustrated when, in 2010, attention in the U.S. shifted to the economic downturn without linking al-Qaida to the damage. 'All the political talk in America is about the economy, forgetting or ignoring the war and its role in weakening the economy,' Gadahn wrote. The papers also showed that he was a student of U.S. media. Gadahn described ABC as 'all right, actually it could be one of the best channels as far as we are concerned,' criticized CNN as being too close to the government and heaped scorn on Fox News, which 'falls into the abyss, as you know, and lacks neutrality.'","Adam Gadahan was born in Oregon in 1978 as Adam Pearlman .

"Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran could face a firing squad within days after Indonesian officials sent letters ordering that preparations be made for their executions. Indonesia's head of General Crimes sent the letters to the prosecutors of 10 death row prisoners including Australians Chan and Sukumaran on Thursday. The Indonesian Attorney-General's spokesman, Tony Spontana, said the only thing left after this is to announce the execution date. The Australian Embassy has been summoned to Nusakambangan Island - where the executions will be carried out - on Saturday. Authorities in Indonesia give death row prisoners and their families 72 hours notice before they are executed, suggesting Chan and Sukumaran could face the firing squad as early as Monday or Tuesday. Scroll down for video . The execution of Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan got a step closer on Thursday . Time seems to be running out for Sukumaran who claims to be rehabilitated since he went to jail in 2005 . Meanwhile the lawyer for a Nigerian man scheduled for execution with Chan and Sukumaran says the embassy has been summoned to Central Java, a likely sign the date is imminent. Utomo Karim, lawyer for Raheem Salami, said on Thursday afternoon the Nigerian embassy received a letter asking it to go to Cilacap, the port closest to Nusakambangan, on Saturday. 'Based on experience from the previous execution, they're going to tell them the date for the execution,' he said. Indonesia is required to give 72 hours notice of the executions. Chan and Sukumaran are in the same cell block as Salami on Nusakambangan . Chan was arrested on April 17, 2005 in Bali for planning to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin valued at about A$4 million from Indonesia to Australia . Letters were sent by authorities to the prosecutors of all 10 death row prisoners, which includes Sukumaran, ordering them to prepare the executions . Earlier in the week Indonesian President Joko Widodo confirmed the executions were 'only a matter of time'. President Widodo told the Indonesian news agency Antara that while he would not interfere with the inmates' outstanding legal appeals, the executions would take place upon their conclusion. 'When it will be done is no longer a question,' he said.  'It is only awaiting the conclusion of all procedures and the legal process, which I will not interfere in. It is only a matter of time.' News of the letters were a huge setback for Chan and his family members . Sukumaran along with the other nine death row prisoners will be killed by firing squad . News.com reports the Attorney-General’s spokesman also indicated that of the 10 death row prisoners only one legal matter was now outstanding. The one remaining is of an Indonesian man whose judicial review is still before the Supreme Court but is expected to finalised within days. News of the letters will be a huge setback for Chan and Sukumaran and their families and lawyers, who had hoped they would be granted another legal challenge. The Attorney-General has already suggested that a Constitutional Court challenge by lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran will not be taken into account and will not delay the executions.

"Every family in the country will be left £350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government, George Osborne claimed today. The Chancellor warned of a 'dangerous cocktail' if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority, Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a 'constitutional crisis' if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne warned of a 'dangerous cocktail' if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon . Launching the SNP manifesto this week, Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post-election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK, raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a £140billion 'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add £6billion to Britain's interest bill, worth £350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority, so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. 'We've got a strong plan for a national recovery, but it's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as 'constitutional chaos'. 'The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them.' Alex Salmond boasted that he would write Labour's first budget because the SNP would hold the balance of power . He said global investors warn that an SNP-Labour deal 'will lead to higher market interest rates, which means higher mortgage rates for families, which means higher bills, cut incomes, it means businesses finding it more difficult to expand'. He added: 'Let's take one of Canada's largest banks, CIBC. They say a Labour government supported by the SNP would lead to a dangerous cocktail where taxes are going up, spending is going up, interest rates are going up. 'They have been joined by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, BlackRock, which is the largest pension fund in the world, Deutsche Bank, the largest German banks. These are pretty unsentimental people. 'These are economists and investors who make a living predicting what is going to happen to different economies around the world. And this week they have come out in a chorus to point out the consequences for the UK of departing from the economic plan we've pursued.' The warnings come after former SNP leader Alex Salmond boasted: 'I'm writing Labour's budget.' The former Scottish First Minister, who is set to be one of up to 50 SNP MPs elected next month, was filmed at a rally mocking Labour's weakness north of the border. He highlighted comments by the shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna – who tried to downplay claims the Scotland could avoid spending cuts by saying the party's leader north of the border Jim Murphy 'will not be in charge of the UK budget'. But Mr Salmond boasted that he already knew this – because that job would fall to the SNP. He said: 'Labour's financial secretary said the Scottish Labour leader will not be writing the Labour party budget. I knew that already, because I'm writing the Labour Party budget.' Labour leader Ed Miliband today warned voters in Scotland that every MP Labour does not win north of the border makes a Tory government more likely . It prompted David Cameron and Boris Johnson to join forces to warn of a looming 'constitutional crisis'. Mr Cameron said: 'You have now got Salmond saying he wants to write Ed Miliband's budget. That's before this has even happened. Imagine how much worse it would be, imagine how many pockets would be picked if this were to happen.' Mr Johnson warned it would mean 'truckfuls of taxpayers' dosh growling up the M1 to Scotland'. Mr Miliband today warned voters in Scotland that every MP Labour does not win north of the border makes a Tory government more likely. He told ITV's Lorraine: 'It's either a Labour government or a Conservative government after the election. 'And every one less Labour MP means it's more likely that David Cameron will be the Prime Minister again. People have to make their choice, but we will keep fighting that big argument about how we can create a better Scotland for working people and a better United Kingdom.' Challenged about why he is not willing to work with the SNP, he added: 'The reason why I am not going to have a coalition with the Scottish national party is we have got fundamental differences . 'And the most fundamental difference of all is they still want to break up the country. 'They have ruled out having another referendum on independence within the next five years. 'They used to say it was once in a lifetime. When you have got those big, big differences I can't see how having a coalition with them.' The Tories will tomorrow inflame the row over a potential Labour-SNP power-sharing deal by unveiling the party’s first ‘manifesto for England’. Mr Hague is expected to warn that England risks being ‘held to ransom’ by Scottish Nationalists unless Labour agrees to implement such a reform. The manifesto is also expected to commit the Tories to dozens of new road schemes in England and an extension of the Cancer Drugs Fund, which pays for expensive cancer treatments on the English NHS. Inflammatory: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) will be joined by William Hague (right) as they launch the English manifesto - with the latter expected to warn England risks being 'held to ransom' by SNP . The document will be seen as an attempt by the Tories to tap into growing English nationalism. Opponents are likely to criticise it as risking fostering division between the UK’s four nations. But a Tory strategist said: ‘We have separate Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish manifestos. Why shouldn’t there be one for England?’ The ‘English votes’ plan would seek to resolve a longstanding constitutional question which will become more urgent than ever once the Scottish Parliament is handed yet more powers. Mr Hague wants to strip Scottish MPs of the power to impose tax changes, education and health reforms on England, given Holyrood will soon control all these issues in Scotland. The reform would make it impossible for any future Labour government to press ahead with its plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in England without winning the support of a majority of English MPs. Tensions: The manifesto is expected to inflame tensions between the Tories and nationalist parties like Nicola Sturgeon's SNP and Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood . It could also make it difficult for a Scottish MP to again hold the office of Chancellor or Prime Minister, given they would be unable to vote on some of their own Government’s legislation. For decades, Labour has relied on the votes of its power base of Scottish MPs to rule Westminster. But since the creation of the Scottish Parliament, critics have questioned how it can be right for Scots MPs to have the crucial say on issues such as tuition fees and foundation hospitals which no longer affect their constituents. Both reforms passed under Tony Blair’s government thanks to the votes of Labour’s tartan army of MPs. Mr Hague is expected to say that the scale of devolution now to be given to Scotland means the question of the status of Scottish MPs at Westminster is unavoidable.","Chancellor warns global investors fear impact of SNP in UK government .

"DUI: Rand Paul's eldest son William Paul, 22, was cited for a DUI on Sunday in Lexington, Kentucky but not arrested . A son of Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence on Sunday. However William Hilton Paul, 22, was not arrested. Paul was driving a 2006 Honda Ridgeline at 11.24am when he crashed into the back of an unoccupied parked car, in Lexington, Kentucky, according to police. Some people nearby heard the crash and alerted authorities. Witnesses said Paul was 'revving his engine' while sitting alone in the truck, reported Kentucky.com. Lexington Police spokeswoman Sherelle Roberts said Paul was treated at the University of Kentucky hospital for minor injuries to his face. Paul failed a field sobriety test, reported Lex18.com. He refused blood and breathalyzer tests at the hospital. Although the 22-year-old had 'bloodshot, watery eyes' and was behaving in a 'belligerent' way according to the report, he was not arrested. Roberts said that is standard protocol for a case in which a DUI suspect is hospitalized. The 22-year-old student is scheduled to be arraigned in Fayette District Court on May 12. Paul,  a senior at the University of Kentucky majoring in communications, has two previous alcohol-related run-ins with the law. In October 2013, Paul was cited for possession of alcohol by a minor by the Kentucky Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control while drinking at a racetrack. In January 2013, Paul was charged with assaulting a female flight attendant, underage consumption, disorderly conduct, and being intoxicated and disruptive when his flight arrived at the airport. Those charges were dropped after Paul completed alcohol education classes and community service. On Sunday,  a police officer cited Paul for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and failure of a nonowner/operator to maintain insurance. Paul was alone at the time of the crash. A campaign spokesman said Senator Rand Paul does not comment on any private matters with regards to his family. Rand Paul, pictured on Saturday, a Republican 2016 presidential contender, refused to comment after his son  crashed into a parked car on Sunday in Lexington, Kentucky while under the influence of alcohol .","William Paul was 'revving his engine' while sitting alone in the truck Sunday when passersby alerted authorities in Lexington, Kentucky .

"The school exam season is nearly upon us; cue a nerve-jangling few months for parents and children alike. For many youngsters, the thought of a single desk with nothing more than a white paper on it and a ticking clock nearby fills them with dread. At best, students get jittery, at worst, their actual grade can be affected. A new survey by academics at Lancashire's Edge Hill University and the University of South Australia has charted a direct link between anxiety and performance, saying pupils who worry about their exam performance are more likely to do badly than those who are less anxious. Countdown to the exam season: A new study by Lancashire's Edge Hill University found a direct link between anxiety ahead of taking exams and grades achieved . The study, which has been published in the British Journal of Educational Psychology, questioned  705 pupils from 11 schools. Researcher Dr Dave Putwain, Reader in Education at Edge Hill University, said: 'There is no doubt that a high degree of worry over one’s performance, or the consequences of one´s performance, has a detrimental effect on GCSE results.' He continued: 'Our study, which was controlled for prior attainment and also how good students were at dealing with exam pressure, found that increased worry still predicted lower achievement.' With that in mind, how can you best ensure your offspring rides the exam storm and comes out the other end feeling happy and achieving what they'd hoped for? FEMAIL has enlisted the help of Michael Ribton, principal at Burlington Danes Academy in West London, which achieved an outstanding grade at its last OFSTED inspection, to offer some sage advice to parents and students on how to get through the tricky months ahead. If Ribton is more than used to getting teenagers to apply themselves in his day job, he's also used to it at home. This summer, his son Joe, 18, will sit A levels, while his daughter Maddy, 16, will take her GCSES. He says: 'Our May half-term holiday has been cancelled so that they are free to get on with revision. 'Their bedrooms are adorned with flashcards and files; their revision timetables and exam timetables are on display in the kitchen. It’s a busy time!' Principal at Burlington Danes Academy Michael Ribton, pictured above (left) helping a pupil to revise, says parents should pin their offspring's revision timetable on the fridge and really engage with them during the lead up to the stressful exam period . Here, he offers his essential guide to how to ease the passage of students bound for the exam hall: . DEVISE A BESPOKE REVISION PLAN THAT INCLUDES REWARDS OF TIME OFF . 'Draw up a revision timetable and stick to it. 'Set yourself goals and reward yourself with time off. A common error is forgetting to add up your cumulative hours on each subject so that you are not overly focusing on one subject. 'Parents need to be part of this as well. A revision timetable should be on the fridge at home! 'Students also need to find the way that suits them best, though there are some foundation blocks to any revision programme that are essential. 'And know what to revise: exam websites are really useful, but do make sure you know the precise course and paper reference codes.' Parents should engage with their children at exam time: Test them on anything they need to learn by rote and make sure they get a healthy breakfast and plenty of weekend exercise . FIND A QUIET PLACE, SWITCH OFF THE INTERNET AND DO PRACTICE QUESTIONS . 'Students need a place to revise, free from distractions and that includes the internet. Though it contains lots of great support material, it can be quite a distraction. 'Revision is not simply re-reading exercise books! It ought to be complemented by undertaking practice questions; challenging oneself is an essential core component of revision too.' Burlington Danes Academy student Fatima Sharif, achieved 4As and 1B grade at AS Level last summer. The student, from White City in West London, currently has conditional offers from five of the country's top universities including Oxford to study English Literature. Although Fatima doesn't have a definite career plan, she is interested in teaching. Here, she explains how she's currently dealing with revising for her A Level exams: . Fatima Sharif is due to sit five A Levels this summer and has a conditional offer from Oxford . 'In order to motivate myself to revise, I think about what I really want to achieve; being really successful, or getting into a great university, and those thoughts really keeps me going. 'I set myself a goal, and my continual motivation is achieving that goal, because I know that it will all be worth it if I just put effort into it now. 'Personally, I don’t really benefit from timetables as I fear that if I am not strictly adhering to them, I am somehow not effectively revising. 'But I definitely recognise that timetables can be incredibly helpful for students as they give them a set time to work and rest, and they break down the huge amounts of work they have into effective revision time. I would definitely recommend a revision timetable to students.' 'Although my family hasn't offered me treats if I do well, I have promised myself them! During my AS exams I really wanted a Kindle, so I told myself that as soon as I got through the tough exams I’d treat myself to one. 'I think revision has more significance if you promise yourself something. It doesn’t have to be big, just something small to direct you on the right course. FATIMA'S TOP THREE TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL REVISION . USE REVISION AIDS INCLUDING FLASHCARDS, POST-IT NOTES AND HIGHLIGHTERS . 'Ensure your child has the tools they need to revise and keep in close contact with the school to find out what they advise you can do to help your child. 'At Ark Burlington Danes, we hand out revision booklets (that contain the basic knowledge for all subjects), flashcards, highlighters and post-it notes. 'We also send text messages, hold intervention classes, cram timetables and do mock exams and questions.'

'A Spaced Learning session consists of three identical ‘inputs’ on PowerPoint slides divided by 10-minute breaks filled with ‘brain gym’ activities. 'Watching a whole year group learn, say, about theories on the existence of God and then stand up to write their names in the air backwards with their non writing hand is hilarious!' Don't despair!

Try cram techniques such as 'Spaced Learning' which can train the brain into retaining information . FOR PARENTS . Get involved! Put your child's revision timetable on the fridge at home . Don't bribe your child: the best prize they can have is education . Ask your offspring to explain their work to you; it'll help them to understand it more fully . Offer to test them on the things that they need to learn by rote . Ensure they breakfast well and exercise together on the weekends . Be positive! HOW CAN PARENTS HELP WITH REVISION? 'Parents play a crucial part. 'Firstly, take a close interest in your child's learning, preferably always but especially at exam time. 'Ask your child to explain difficult concepts as teaching someone else is the best way to learn yourself. Test them on anything they need to learn by rote. 'Be positive: high expectations matter and you cannot get away from the fact that exams are a stressful time. 'All a parent can do is to help their child have the very best chance of success and provide every opportunity for their child to give it their best shot.' MAKE SURE THEY EAT WELL AND EXERCISE . 'Feed your child properly throughout the exam season; a good breakfast helps and ensure they get a proper night's sleep too. 'At ArkBDA we provide a healthy breakfast for all pupils and we've found that it really boosts levels of engagement. 'Know when their exams are, set your alarm clock and get up with them to help them get organised. 'At weekends, get some exercise together.' SHOULD YOU PAY FOR EXTRA TUITION? It ought not be necessary in good or better schools, but a tutor can help boost the confidence of a child. I would hope the parents at my school would talk with me first before investing money to support their child. An outstanding school would see this as a failure on their part.

"The TV channel E4 will shut down for 12 hours on the day of the general election to encourage more youngsters to vote. Cult US sitcoms like The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother will be taken off air for 12 hours – with viewers tuning in on 7 May shown instead an advert telling people to go to the polls. The specially-produced advert will be played, featuring 'Darren' – the man fictionally in charge of keeping E4 on air, sitting in the channel's control room. Scroll down for video . A specially-produced advert will be played on E4 on May 7 featuring 'Darren' – the man fictionally in charge of keeping the programme on air . The radical move could have a significant impact on the election with the advert set to be seen by millions of potential voters. E4 is the most popular channel for younger viewers, reaching 8.7 million 16-34 year olds every month – ahead of BBC2 and Channel 5. Its regular schedule will be suspended from 7am, when polls open, to 7pm, three hours before polling closes, when the channel will return to normal with Hollyoaks. Dan Brooke, Channel 4's chief marketing officer said: 'Less than half of under-25s voted at the last election so we've engaged the most powerful weapon that we have at our disposal to try and boost that number - switching off their favourite TV channel for the day.' E4's sister station Channel 4 will also run a special advertising campaign encouraging youngsters to vote. Voters aged between 18-24 and 25-34 are by far the least likely to take part in elections, prompting fears that politicians have given up trying to appeal to their concerns . The adverts will ask viewers: 'How many times have you missed life-changing events because you wanted to watch your favourite show? 'May 7 is election day and Darren is going to turn E4 off so you might as well go and vote. You won't forget will you Darren?' But viewers will only be able to take advantage of the TV switch-off if they have already registered to vote – with the deadline having already passed. Meanwhile, Channel 4 will present an 'alternative' to the election night coverage on the BBC and ITV, with a programme co-anchored by Jeremy Paxman and comedian David Mitchell. Paxman, who left BBC Two's Newsnight last June, said: 'Elections matter. But that doesn't mean the coverage has to be dull. I hope there'll be room for both insight and laughter.' The election-day shut down on E4 will see programmes including 'How I Met Your Mother' (pictured) taken off air for 12 hours . Fans of the US sitcom The Big Bang Theory will also be hit by the E4 decision to switch off its coverage between 7am and 7pm . Mitchell added: 'Our aim is to keep people watching much later than they intended and we will be judged by the dip in the nation's productivity on Friday 8 May.' The show will also include special election-themed episodes of Gogglebox and The Last Leg. The BBC's coverage of the election will be anchored by David Dimbleby, while Tom Bradby presides over ITV's election show and Adam Boulton anchors Sky's coverage.","Cult US shows like The Big Bang Theory  will be axed for 12 hours on May 7 .

"Counterterrorism agencies have arrested two suspected Australian terrorists in Turkey on Thursday after they were caught trying to sneak into Syria to join the Islamic State. The Daily Telegraph reports that the two were found trying to use what has become a familiar potential route taken by Australian jihadists going to the Middle East. It happened a day after Turkey agreed to a new extradition treaty and an intelligence-sharing agreement with Australia. Australian officials confirmed the arrest of the two men. Two men were caught on a familiar route leading into the Middle East from Turkey. It's claimed they were on their way to join with the Islamic State . The new agreement was also initiated to close the Turkish border to radicalised Australians and have them sent back to Australia to face possible jail terms under new foreign fighter legislation. Two men are believed to be still detained in Turkey. Officials could not confirm if and when they would be returned to Australia. The new extradition treaty and an intelligence-sharing agreement was struck on Wednesday during a meeting between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in the Turkish capital Ankara. The men were arrested in Turkey by counterterrorism agencies after being caught trying to sneak into Syria to join terror groups such as Islamic State . The extradition treaty specifically covers the detention and extradition of Australian foreign fighters. It would also cover criminal activity such as drug trafficking. Currently there are now an estimated 100 in Syria and Iraq, the majority of these make their way to the Middle east through Turkey. Australia has also agreed to expand its intelligence sharing with Turkish counterterrorism agencies. To counter the Islamic State, a new extradition treaty and an intelligence-sharing agreement deal was struck on Wednesday between Australia and Turkey . 'The important thing is to ensure that if Australians are tempted to go overseas and do the wrong thing we stop them — and that is happening,' Mr Abbott said. 'If people seek to return to Australia we want them arrested, prosecuted and jailed.' Mr Davutoglu said: 'If Australia wants anyone detained or deported then we are ready to take those steps.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the new deal was to ensure that 'if Australians are tempted to go overseas and do the wrong thing we stop them' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Two men were caught on a familiar route leading into the Middle East .

"Patients are being put at risk because paramedics are leaving firemen to deal with 999 calls, healthcare leaders warn. Many firemen have not been trained in basic first aid – yet they are being left to care for seriously ill elderly patients for hours while they wait for an ambulance. The Fire Brigades Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous but is becoming increasingly common because the ambulance service is so overstretched. The ambulance service is becoming increasingly reliant on firemen to attend life-threatening emergencies . The Fire Brigade Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous and becoming more common . Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E. They normally carry a few blankets, oxygen masks to protect against smokes and a defibrillator – to restart the heart. In one case earlier this year an elderly lady is feared to have died because she was left in the hands of fire crews for nearly 40 minutes while paramedics were delayed. The ambulance service is facing unprecedented demand from the rising and aging population and in some areas 999 calls are up by 15 per cent on last year. Paramedics are also having to respond to rising numbers of non-urgent calls from patients frustrated that they cannot get an appointment with their GP. They are also having to waste much of their time queued up outside A&E units which cannot accept their patients because staff there are also very busy. This has all led to the ambulance service increasingly relying on firemen to attend potentially life-threatening emergencies. The Fire Brigades Union yesterday warned that South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue were sending firemen with no medical training to 999 calls instead of ambulances. It pointed out that only a third of firefighters at this branch had any medical training – and even this only consisted of a four day course of basic first aid. Yet in one case they were left to help an elderly lady who had stopped breathing for 45 minutes whilst they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E . In another, they tended to a pensioner who had fallen and banged her head for two hours before they were forced to leave her on her own – to attend a fire. The practice is occurring across the country and last July, firemen took a 16-year-old girl with suspected bleeding on the brain to A&E in Warrington, Cheshire . In December, crews were sent to a care home in Ryde on the Isle of Wight where an elderly woman had a stroke and were ordered to cut the rings off her fingers which were turning blue because of poor blood flow. Ian Murray, vice-president of the Fire Brigades Union – which represents 44,000 firemen – said: 'We know only a small percentage of firefighters are trained to give basic first aid. 'It is irresponsible and dangerous to put untrained firefighters in the position of attending incidents to assist the ambulance service, with the knowledge that it is highly unlikely one will arrive for some considerable time.' In January, a woman of 84 from Doncaster is feared to have died because firemen were sent to her home rather than an ambulance. Paramedics did not show up for 40 minutes after which time her pulse had stopped. Last month the Mail revealed how London Ambulance Service had resorted to flying half way round the world to Australia to hire 225 paramedics because it is so overstretched.","The Fire Brigades Union say practice is irresponsible and dangerous .

"A GP has warned the health service is at 'breaking point' as he faces the challenge of providing a safe standard of care for 4,300 patients on his books. Dr Arfon Williams is now the only doctor available across two rural practices in North Wales, after his partner and colleague of 20 years retired at the end of March. His surgery has been unable to attract a replacement and is currently functioning with a skeleton service, Dr Williams said. Health bosses responsible for North Wales said difficulties recruiting GPs is a national issue, adding they are exploring a number of options. Welsh GP, Dr Arfon Williams, is now the only doctor available across two rural practices, that serve 4,300 patients in North Wales (file picture posed by models) Dr Williams is based at Ty Doctor in Nefyn, Gwynedd, pictured. He said: 'We cover a rural area from two sites so it is now going to prove incredibly difficult to provide a realistic, safe service for our patients, but we will endeavour to do so' 'We used to be a three-partner practice, which cares for 4,300 patients and a very large holiday population in the summer,' Dr Williams said. 'We cover a rural area from two sites so it is now going to prove incredibly difficult to provide a realistic, safe service for our patients, but we will endeavour to do so.' Dr Williams, who is based at Ty Doctor in Nefyn, Gwynedd, said he fears areas such as the Llŷn Peninsula in north Wales will become 'no-go' areas for young, aspiring GPs as none of them want to jump on a 'sinking ship'. He added: 'I want the health board to recognise the severity of the situation here. 'We have been informing the health authority of this impending recruitment crisis for many years. 'Unfortunately little, if anything, has been done and the system is now at breaking point. 'I would be grateful if the health board could use all resources at their disposal to do all that they can so that we can retain a decent service to our patients which is safe, and provide it to the highest possible standards. 'Ninety per cent of NHS consultations are provided in primary care. 'It is inevitable that the continued lack of investment in primary care is having a knock-on effect on secondary care. 'When there are 10 ambulances sat outside the A&E department of the local district general hospital on a daily basis, it does not take a genius to work out that the system is broken. 'Subsequently, response times for ambulances are not met, A&E departments are full to bursting, every hospital bed is taken as there is chronic under capacity. 'GPs are sent daily e-mails requesting that we shouldn't admit patients unnecessarily. 'Due to unrelenting pressure on beds, patients are often discharged too soon, and without adequate social care provision. 'This is a year-round problem, no longer to be blamed on winter pressures. 'The system is broken. Anyone who denies this simply does not understand.' A spokesperson for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said: 'Senior medical staff and managers recently met with Dr Williams to discuss his concerns. Dr Williams said ambulances queuing at A&E departments is a sign that the system is broken . 'Difficulties in recruiting GPs is a national issue; however, there are particular problems in specific areas of north Wales. 'We fully recognise these issues and work is ongoing to identify and agree measures to alleviate the immediate problems and to develop a strong recruitment base. 'We are currently exploring a number of short and long-term ideas to address the local shortage of GPs, including taking advantage of the opportunities arising from cluster working and working together with other practices. 'We work very closely with the Wales Deanery and university medical schools to provide good training opportunities for doctors in north Wales and encourage them to then apply for jobs in the region.'","Rural practice in North Wales left with one GP to care for 4,300 patients .

"A second spectacular blast from the Calbuco volcano in southern Chile has covered nearby towns and villages in a thick layer of ash. The first eruption in over four decades yesterday sent vast clouds of dust more than six miles into the air, creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night's sky. Another unexpected eruption in the Los Lagos Region today heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated, residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded. The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway. Previous and equally violent eruptions at Calbuco have continued for up to a week, according to a volcanologist from Oxford University who told MailOnline it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The volcano is one of the most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes but was not under any special observation before it suddenly sprung into life at around 6pm local time yesterday. Emergency officials were taken by surprise and had only a few minutes to issue an alert. Scroll down for video . Ghost town: Most people have abandoned the La Ensenada locality in Puerto Varas (pictured) which has been caked in ash despite being over 18 miles away from the massive eruption at Calbuco volcano . Scared: A 30-year-old from Puerto Varas (pictured) said she saw 'the column of smoke rising up' from the volcano when she looked out of her window' Aftermath: The two violent explosions shot billions of cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere, caking nearby localities like La Ensenada in mounds of abrasive soot . Colossal: Two massive explosions from Calbuco volcano in southern Chile have shot up to ten billion cubic metres of ash over six miles into the atmosphere (pictured) Dangerous: Many people in Puerto Varas (pictured) have become worried about the damage the ash will cause to their health . Stuck: As tractors try to clear the mounds of ash that have blocked the roads, one local said: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared... We have a layer of smoke above us' Contaminated: Ash from the second blast seriously impared the visibility of drivers fleeing the city of La Ensenada (pictured) near the volcano . Isolated: A masked and hooded woman stands alone among the ash falling in the San Marin de Los Andes area near Calbuco . Evacuation: Thousands have fled their homes after Calbuco erupted unexpectedly on Wednesday and was still pouring ash into the sky on Thursday . Explosion: A second eruption from the Calbuco volcano in Chile (pictured) has forced over 4,000 people to abandoned their homes and covered nearby communities in ash . Dramatic: 4,000 people were evacuated from cities around Calbuco following a second spectacular and frightening eruption today (pictured) Eruption: Residents of Puerto Montt had a clear view of the first terrifying explosion yesterday (pictured) which threw ash and smoke a staggering six miles into the air . Spectacle: The dense ash cloud from Calbuco today created an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night sky . Local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano which lies near the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt - 620 miles south of the capital Santiago. Even Professor David Pyle who has studied over a century of eruptions across Chile's 1000-mile stretch of volcanoes ranks this one  among the strongest - and claims its ash could cross the Pacific to Australia. He ranked this particular explosion 'a three or four' on the Volcanic Explosivity Index which means it could unleash an astonishing ten billion cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere. Professor Pyle told MailOnline: 'Based on a 15km-high plume and an eruption of around an hour and a half, that’s quite strong. This particular volcano has erupted a number of times over the last hundred years. 'Sometimes it has lasted a day and other times it has bubbled on for a few weeks. The activity’s died down for the moment but we don’t know what’s going to happen next.' Many people in Chile are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health, adding: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us.' A 30-year-old from Puerto Varas admitted many people in Chile are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health, adding: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us.' 'People went into a state of panic' as the ash cloud spread, according to Miguel Diaz who lives in Puerto Montt 14 miles away. He added: 'I heard a loud noise as if somebody had detonated an atomic bomb.' Abandoned: Chile's President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured since the first explosion yesterday . Volatile: Bachelet said this eruption at Calbuco is 'more serious and unpredictable' than that of the Villarica volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people . Covered: Resident of the Ensenada locality (pictured) near Calbuco struggled to clear the mountains of ash that had built up on their rooves . Locked out: Local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano . Protection: Even residents in the Argentinian city of San Carlos de Bariloche (pictured) donned gas masks to avoid the respiratory damage caused by the ash from Calbuco . Deadly: Smoke and lava spew from the Calbuco volcano, as seen from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas which is over 18 miles away . 'Even small amounts of ash can be really quite disruptive,' according to Professor Pyle who added: 'It affects power supplies and it can be disruptive to agriculture. You don’t need particularly thick accumulations of ash to start to have physical consequences.' Chile's President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured and the only person who went missing since the first explosion was found on Thursday. She said this eruption at Calbuco is 'more serious and unpredictable' than that of the Villarica volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people. The director of a radio station in Puerto Montt described how hundreds of locals rushed to get gas following the eruption, forcing stations to ration their sales. And supermarkets closed their doors to avoid being looted. LATAM airlines has cancelled flights to and from Puerto Montt because airborne ash can severely damage jet engines. A volcano in the Caulle Cordon of southern Chile erupted violently in 2011, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the evacuation of more than 3,500 people. Stiff winds blew the ash from that explosion over the border to Argentina where the thick, abrasive soot coated slopes in the sky resort city of San Carlos de Bariloche. And by Thursday afternoon, much ash had made its way to Villa La Angostura, Argentina, a small town about 56 miles (90 kilometers) northeast of the volcano. Cars and streets were coated with a thin layer of ash, but people were otherwise going about their business. 'We are praying that the volcanic activity will be as short as possible,' said mayor Roberto Cacault. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert on Wednesday and set up an exclusion zone of 12 miles around the volcano. Ominous: The first eruption (pictured) sent a huge plume of gas and ash soaring into the atmosphere which was visible from up to 100 miles away . Active: Calbuco (pictured yesterday) is one of Chile's three most dangerous volcanoes and part of an active chain of around 500 that cover the south of the country . Incredible: Smoke and lava shot out of Calbuco yesterday as people watched on from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas (pictured) Explosion: Residents in nearby Puerto Varas (pictured) went about their business as Calbuco exploded, but local authorities setting up a 12.5-mile exclusion zone around it . Destructive: Volcanoes like Calbuco (pictured) occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust . Plume: While most people think of volcanoes as spewing lava, many eruptions take the form of super-heated gas and ash (pictured) which is pushed through the earth's crust, covering the sky . Trevor Moffat who lives in Ensenada - some six miles from the volcano - said the eruption yesterday happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' Television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom-shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it. The eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring Argentina. Derek Way, a resident of Puerto Varas, said: 'There are a lot of people out in the streets, many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas. A friend told me to fill everything we have with water.' Chile, on the Pacific 'Rim of Fire', has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active. In March, volcano Villarrica, also in southern Chile, erupted in spectacular fashion, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, but quickly subsided. Volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust, either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another. Eruptions occur when magma from the Earth's core forces its way to the surface, exploding through weak points in the crust. Danger: Residents from nearby towns said people were crying in the streets after the volcano erupted without warning at 6pm local time . Shocking: While the first eruption occurred in the middle of the afternoon, the plume of ash and smoke was visible well into the evening from towns 100 miles away in Argentina . Blanket: The last major eruption here was in 1961 when lava flows filled the top crater before spilling down the sides and into a nearby lake .

"This is the moment an aeroplane touched down on a runway without deploying its landing gear and skidded along the runway on its belly. Captured in Fort Pierce, Florida, the shocking footage shows the light general aviation aircraft approaching the Aero Acres residential airpark. Despite the fact the Aerostar plane travels at speed, its descent towards the landing strip appears normal until the video maker makes a startling observation. The light general aviation aircraft approaches the Aero Acres residential airpark and touches down without its landing gear deployed . He states that the landing gear has not been deployed and at that very moment the plane touches down with a bump and scratches along the tarmac. Its propellers can be heard ricocheting off the ground as the wings bounce up and down from the impact. Suddenly the pilot re-engages the engines and rather unceremoniously takes off back into the air. The plane's propellers can be heard ricocheting off the ground as the wings bounce up and down from the impact . The video maker can be heard saying that the plane’s propellers have been damaged in the collision with the runway and that more than likely, the pilot will crash. He later said: ‘I was walking down the flight line of aircraft that flew in for the day, which is close to the main runway and noticed this light twin aircraft coming in low. ‘I noticed he did not have his landing gear down and thought he was going to do a fly-by, but then noticed the power was pulled back with the aircraft approaching for a landing with no landing gear. The plane scratches along the runway and the video maker describes the sound as 'one you will not forget' ‘The belly and tips of the propellers impacted the runway (the sound of the propellers hitting the surface was one sound you will not forget). ‘Once the pilot realized his mistake, he gave what appeared to be full throttle and both propellers pulled the front of the aircraft down with the propellers making a second impact with the runway. ‘Somehow the engines stayed on and running and the pilot was able to regain control while leaving the airport. The video maker noted that once the pilot realized his mistake he began re-engaging the engine . He added: ‘It’s amazing the aeroplane engines did not get destroyed during the propellers impact and the pilot did not stall during the forced take-off with the high angle of attack and damaged propellers.’ According to WPBF 25 News, the plane’s pilot, Chris Georgaklis, 85, managed to fly 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale after the incident and landed safely. Mr Georgaklis is said to have flown for almost 50 years and was accompanied on the trip by his dog, Buddy. People look on as the damaged aircraft takes off from the runway and flies 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale, where it landed safely . The most common cause of a gear-up landing, also known as a belly landing or pancake landing, is human error – when the pilot simply forgets to deploy the landing gear before touchdown. Another cause is mechanical fault, when an electric motor or a hydraulic actuator fails. The FAA is said to be investigating the incident.","Video captures light general aviation aircraft approaching at speed .

"An intrepid motorist has hit the highway to fame after being seen hauling a van with his tiny three-wheel scooter. Footage of the unusual scene was released by Chinese traffic police last week in attempt to warn the public of the dangerous stunts that could be seen on the roads. Traffic authorities in eastern China said they were shocked when spotting this scene on CCTV footage, according to the People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video . Zoom zoom: The formidable motorist becomes the talk of the internet for his incredible road stunt . The footage was taken at 10am on March 19 near the Erdun Port intersection in Yangzhou city, Jiangsu Province. The unidentified man is seen calmly driving alongside the pedestrian pavement while carrying a minibus strapped to the back of his tiny vehicle with strings. The silver minivan, also known as a 'bread vehicle' in China due to its resemblance to a load of bread, is estimated to weight around one ton. A flat tyre at the rear indicates the driver was probably carrying it to the garage. Quick fix: The van is seen with a flat tyre, prompting the police to believe the driver was on his way to garage . While the police were astonished by how the man had managed to hoist up the van, they also stated that he has broken the overloading regulations by a serious measure. 'It is extremely dangerous for a small tricycle as such to carry a van that size,' said Sun Bin, supervisor at the traffic police brigade of Yangzhong, to China Central TV Station. Sun added that such behaviour could lead to an accident any second. The driver has not been tracked down as the police were not able to see clearly the plate number of his tricycle from the footage.","Image is released by Chinese traffic police to warn dangerous road stunts .

"A prisoner who has finally been freed after spending half his life in jail for a crime he did not commit has said all he wants to do is spent time with his wife and go fishing. Michael Hanline, 69, was convicted of murder for the  fatal shooting  of truck driver J.T. McGarr in 1980. But more than three decades after he was incarcerated, it emerged that crucial DNA analysis and investigative reports were withheld from his original trial. Michael Hanline, 69, pictured with wife Sandy, has been released from jail after spending 36 years behind bars for a murder he did not commit . Michael Hanline answers questions from the media outside court yesterday after his murder charges were formally dismissed . The new evidence proved that Hanline was innocent and the longest-serving wrongfully imprisoned inmate in Californian history was finally released last November. After his murder charges were formally dismissed yesterday, Hanline who appeared with a white beard and pony tail outside court with his wife, Sandy, where he said he was hoping to return to a normal life. 'I feel good,' he added. 'All I want to do is go fishing and ride my bike and spend time with  Sandy and do a little gardening.' 'Hopefully everything is going to be like it used to be.' He added that he had been riding a motorcycle ever since his release and complained that California roads had gotten bumpier during his years behind bars. Mugshot: Hanline was convicted of murder for the fatal shooting of truck driver J.T. McGarr in 1980 . After decades behind bars, Hanline was also coming to terms with 21st century living and talked about 'Buck Rogers' gadgets such as cellphones. 'Gas isn't 32 cents and a pack of cigarettes isn't 30 cents,' he said. 'It's a whole new ball game.' Hanline was in his early thirties when he was charged with killing  friend, Ventura resident J.T. McGarry in 1978. He said he kept waiting for justice to prevail but had no idea that he would spent the next 36 years in prison. 'When I first got arrested, I figured it might take a year or two to get this all straightened around but not 36,' he said, including two years he spent in jail after his arrest but before his conviction. He added: 'I never believed I'd spend the rest of my life in prison, but man, 36 years is a long, long time.' McGarry, a Ventura resident who also used the name Michael Mathers, dealt in drugs and ran motorcycle-oriented swap meets for the publishers of Easyriders magazine, according to court papers. He went missing on November 10, 1978, and was found shot to death two days later by a highway. Hanline, who was romantically involved with McGarry's ex-girlfriend, was arrested on an unrelated charge that month after traveling to Northern California and using McGarry's credit card, court papers stated. He was charged with murder by prosecutors who suggested his motive was jealousy over McGarry's on-again, off-again relationship with the ex-girlfriend. But more than three decades after he was incarcerated, it emerged that crucial DNA analysis and investigative reports were withheld from his original trial . The evidence proved that Hanline was innocent and the longest-serving wrongfully imprisoned inmate in Californian history was finally released last November with charges only officially dropped yesterday . Hanline's then-girlfriend, Mary Bischoff, was granted immunity and was a key witness at his trial. She testified that McGarry had skimmed thousands of dollars from motorcycle swap meets and that Hanline had threatened to 'blow his brains out.' She also claimed that Hanline left home with a handgun the night of the killing and returned covered in mud. He said he worked on motorcycles at home all night except for leaving to get beer. In 1980, Hanline was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. DNA analysis was not conducted at the scene where McGarry's body was discovered because the technology did not exist then. But Ventura County prosecutors said in court papers an analysis this year found the DNA profile of an unidentified male, not Hanline. In addition, evidence that should have been disclosed to Hanline during the trial was withheld from him. Special Assistant District Attorney Michael Schwartz said 'flaws in the trial and the totality of evidence cast sufficient doubt to warrant vacating the jury's guilty verdict.' Lawyers from the California Innocence Project had been working for 15 years to free him and it was them who persuaded local prosecutors to re-examine the evidence. 'The conviction was based on 'paper-thin evidence,' said Justin Brooks, director of the California Innocence Project. Prosecutors had said Hanlin, pictured in 1974,  kidnapped McGarry, shot him and dumped his body off of a highway . 'He is 100 percent innocent,' Brooks said outside court. Testing showed DNA found at the crime scene did not come from Hanline or his alleged accomplice. In addition, prosecutors withheld evidence that should have been disclosed to Hanline's legal team during the trial. Hanline's conviction was overturned and he was freed from prison on November 24 after prosecutors told a judge doubts had been raised about the case. However, he had been required to wear a GPS ankle bracelet and had faced the possibility of a retrial. A Ventura County Superior Court judge dismissed the charges at the request of prosecutors, telling the courtroom it was done because the allegations can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Prosecutors are still investigating who might have killed McGarry, who had ties to a motorcycle gang, he said. Hanline is at least the third person in recent years to be freed from a California prison after serving long sentences for murder. Last fall Susan Mellen, a 59-year-old mother of three, was freed after spending 17 years in prison for the death of a homeless man in Lawndale. A Los Angeles County judge said she was convicted on the word of a liar. In 2013, Kash Register was freed after spending 34 years in prison. The judge said prosecutors used false testimony from an alleged eyewitness. In 2007, Timothy Atkins was freed after spending 20 years in prison for a 1987 robbery and murder in Los Angeles. A key witness who claimed she heard him confess recanted her testimony.","Michael Hanline was serving life without parole for killing JT McGarry .

"US authorities suspected that a British man accused this week of causing the 2010 'flash crash' was making illicit trades back in 2009 it's been revealed, with experts expressing shock that it took six years for charges to be brought. Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, is accused of making £26million from illegal trades over five years and an investigation team involving six agencies in the US and Britain want him put on trial in New York. But analysts are bewildered that it's taken this long for action to be taken. US authorities suspected that British man Navinder Singh Sarao (circled) accused this week of causing the 2010 'flash crash' was making illicit trades back in 2009 . US prosecutors believe Mr Sarao used special computer software to manipulate the market on Wall Street . 'Flash crash': Sarao is accused of causing the Wall Street 'Flash Crash' on May 6, 2010, when £570billion ($850 billion) was wiped from the value of America's biggest companies in five minutes . Sarao was warned about his trading in 2009 by officials at the self-regulatory Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where he was making transactions. However, he continued his alleged manipulation well into this year. Dave Lauer, president of lobbying and research firm Kor Group, told Bloomberg that he was gobsmacked at the pace of the investigation. He said: 'How this continued for six years when the CME appeared to know about it, it kind of boggles my mind. This is about as simple and easy as you can get, and it took them this long to do anything about it.' Edgar Perez, author of Knightmare on Wall Street and The Speed Traders, meanwhile, asked: 'Why would regulators let Sarao operate in the markets and engage in similar trading strategies as in the Flash Crash eight more times?' Sarao allegedly triggered – from his home computer in Hounslow, London – the Wall Street 'Flash Crash' of May 2010, in which almost a trillion dollars was wiped from global share prices, using a series of fake transactions. Trader Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, is shown here at Westminster Magistrates' Court after being arrested over illicit trading . A flash crash is a sudden plunge in stock prices. On May 6, 2010, the US stock market dramatically collapsed – wiping billions off the world's biggest companies. Between 2.42pm and 2.47pm, the Dow Jones shed 600 points, having already been down more than 300 points – a startling 6 per cent fall in just five minutes. Very soon it had recorded an almost 1,000-point loss on the day. But, by 3.07pm, the market had miraculously regained most of the 600-point drop – making the flash crash the second-largest point swing ever recorded. Hours later, European markets opened and crashed in similar fashion. The UK's FTSE 100 fell 138 points, France's Cac shed 163 points, and Germany's Dax dropped 193 points. The cause of the crash puzzled US officials. Theories included technical glitches, high frequency trading or changes in market structure – but never criminal activity. He allegedly used automated trading software to 'spoof' the market by placing up to 19,000 orders and then cancelling them, all in under one second. However, manipulation wasn't identified as the cause of the crash in a September 2010 report, suggesting that regulators did not see his activity at that time. Tim Massad, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the trading of futures and swaps, said on Wednesday that it took so long to charge Sarao because of the size and complexity of U.S. derivatives markets. 'These are huge markets,' he said. 'There's a lot going on.' The agency, which oversees self-regulatory bodies such as the CME, brought civil charges against Sarao alongside criminal charges by the Department of Justice. The many years it took for the CFTC to come out with its findings, and the fact that manipulation wasn't mentioned in the 2010 report, suggested that the help of a whistleblower was essential in bringing the charges, one lawyer said. 'This can't have been a five-year continuous investigation, can't have been,' said the lawyer, who is familiar with the CFTC's thinking, and who asked to remain anonymous. 'Something happened some period later where this came up again. 'If there was any indication that there was manipulation behind this, given the profile of this, the agency would have proceeded. It wouldn't have taken five years.' Scotland Yard's extradition unit arrested Sarao on Tuesday night at the request of the FBI, which claims he set up an offshore company in the Caribbean called 'Nav Sarao Milking Markets' and arrogantly told financial officials to 'kiss my a***'. In West London, neighbours of the man now dubbed the 'Hound of Hounslow' were puzzled by his supposed wealth, saying he lived humbly.","Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, is accused of causing the May 2010 'flash crash'

"Veterinarians have criticised EU rules on organic farming that demands that fish are treated with homoeopathic remedies. In line with EU regulations, the first line of treatment for organic fish should be 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution', before . British and Norwegian vets have called the directives 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' 'Risk': Under EU regulations, organic farmers must first use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution' to treat ill fish, which has been criticised by British and Norwegian vets (stock image) The directives, outlined in the 2009 European regulation on organic aquaculture, are set to be brought into national law in non-EU Norway, which has caused vets to see red. Section 7 of the regulations calls for organic farmers to use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homoeopathic dilution', as their first port of call when their fish are ill . After this, the 'veterinary treatments' section outlines that farmers may use  'plants and their extracts not having anaesthetic effects'. As well as the directive to use homeopathic treatments, organic fish farmers are only allowed to resort to mainstream medical treatments a maximum of twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification. This has been criticised by the  Norwegian Veterinary Association (NVA) as could mean that fish are not getting the correct treatment in time, causing them unnecessary suffering. Danger: British and Norwegian vets have called the EU directives on organic fish treatment 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment' 'We think it's totally unacceptable from a scientific point of view because there's no scientific basis for using homeopathy,' Ellef Blakstad, the head of the Norwegian Veterinary Association, told The Local.no. 'If you start using homeopathy, you prolong the time when the animals are not getting adequate treatment and that's a threat to animal welfare.' Harsh: Farmers are only allowed to use mainstream medical treatments a twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification (stock image) The criticism from Norway has been echoed by the British Veterinary Association, saying use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' The British Veterinary Association (BVA) cannot endorse the use of homeopathic remedies, or indeed any products, making therapeutic claims, which have no proven efficacy,' British Veterinary Association President John Blackwell told MailOnline. 'As with any treatment for disease using medicines, BVA believes that veterinary medicinal products must be evidence-based, with any medicinal claims made by a manufacturer supported. 'If homeopathic remedies are used without proven effectiveness on farmed fish across the EU, including the UK, the consequence could be serious animal health and welfare detriment, which would be counterproductive to both animal health and to the farmed fish industry in the UK.' Homepathic treatments are based on the principle that 'like cures like', whereby a highly diluted substance that causes the symptoms  in a healthy person, can also cure similar symptoms in a sick person. A 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report on homeopathy said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos, and that the principles on which homeopathy is based are 'scientifically implausible'.","Norwegian vets criticise EU regulations on treatment of organic fish .

"Being crammed into cattle class is one of the most dreadful experiences for travellers, but aeroplane seats of the future are poised to make it a little more enjoyable. Designers around the world are creating economy and premium economy seats that are comfier and provide more legroom, and some of them have radical changes from today’s chairs. But passengers shouldn’t expect any instant relief – these seats with reclining backrests, innovative armrests and ergonomic designs are still a few years off – and there’s nothing they can do to stop a crying baby or noisy sleeper. Crawley-based Acro Aircraft Seating recently unveiled the design for its new premium economy seat . Acro's 'Series 7' seat has hand-stitched leather armrests, an aluminium chassis and composite materials . The seats were designed to eliminate the sources of discomfort and provide more space for the occupants . Passengers who are willing to pay a little extra for a seat in premium economy – which brings more legroom and some of the perks of business class – could one day sit in seats designed by Crawley-based Acro Aircraft Seating. Located next to Gatwick Airport, the firm is reshaping the future of the cabin that straddles business and economy with thinner and lighter seats that are designed with comfort and safety in mind. The ‘Series 7’ seats, unveiled at last week’s Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany, . Managing director Chris Brady said the seats were designed to eliminate the sources of discomfort and provide more space for the occupants. He told MailOnline Travel: ‘We believe that comfort is found in the spaces between seats. Chris Brady, Acro's managing director, said big seats that are 'lazily padded' take up legroom . Acro currently makes thousands of economy class seats for airlines such as KLM, Thomas Cook and Spirit . ‘Padding is not a proxy for comfort, padding is a lazy way of delivering the right shape. What you really want to do is deliver a shape that is ergonomically proper – so the hips aren’t shifted forward and the back is a little bit reclined.’ He added: ‘If you have a big, fat six-inch seat that is lazily padded you are taking five inches of legroom. In our case our seat is less than half an inch thick at its thickest.’ Mr Brady said the seats – with an aluminium chassis, composite materials and hand-stitched leather armrests – must pass an onerous certification process, meaning they won’t actually fly until 2017. The firm, which received a Queen’s Award for Enterprise this week, currently makes thousands of economy class seats for airlines such as KLM, Thomas Cook and Spirit. Thompson Aero Seating has come up with a way to make the middle seat a less punishing experience . The 'Cozy Suite' has seats positioned at a slight diagonal angle, with dedicated sleeping positions . In Northern Ireland, Thompson Aero Seating has come up with a way to make the middle seat a less punishing experience. The firm’s ‘Cozy Suite’ would see seats positioned at a slight diagonal angle to give the passenger in the middle a little more breathing room. Based south-west of Belfast, the company said the ‘innovative and flexible solution’ could be applied to economy and premium economy cabins. It said the unconventional design offers increased seat and shoulder width, individual armrests, a dedicated sleeping position, improved egress and easier access to the aisle. Hong Kong’s Paperclip Design may have solved the elbow war problem with a dual-user armrest . The 'Meerkat Seat' concept has a number of features to improve comfort and store belongings . One of passengers’ biggest gripes – especially for those stuck in the middle seat – is the battle for the armrest. But Hong Kong’s Paperclip Design may have solved the elbow war problem with a unique ‘double-decker’ armrest on long-haul economy seats designed by James Lee. The armrest is shaped like a paperclip, allowing two passengers to use the armrest. Mr Lee’s ‘Meerkat Seat’ concept is intended for long-haul flights in economy, with a number of features to help those who bring too many of their possessions on board. The backrest  allowing passengers to relax without crushing the knees of the person seated behind them . The reclining seats have enough space for belongings, plus a stand for tablets and a fixed cup holder . Passengers in the 'Meerkat Seat' have a footrest and a personal cabinet instead of a seat pocket . It features a reclining backrest for sleeping, a tray with a stand for tablet computers and a footrest under the chair in front. The backrest seats offer an alternative to the traditional recliner mode – allowing passengers to relax without crushing the knees of the person seated behind them. The lower portion of the backrest cushion detaches, pushing the traveller forward in a 'deep recline' position, allowing them to stretch their legs out in front. Mr Lee's design include a fixed cup holder – meaning the tray could be stowed – a personal cabinet instead of a seat pocket, a hook for headphones, a vanity mirror and a shared literary rack between every two seats.","Designers are looking to ease passengers' woes with comfier seats .

"With her mother by her side and nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo already in charge of the nursery, the Duchess of Cambridge won't be short of help when the new baby arrives. But Carole Middleton and Ms Borrallo aren't the only ones on standby as the birth of the spare to Prince George's heir approaches. Waiting in the wings is Kate's fiercely loyal inner circle, a mix of school friends, society types and family members such as younger sister Pippa. So who's who? FEMAIL reveals who will be helping the Duchess as she gets to grips with life as a mother of two. PIPPA MIDDLETON . More than just sisters, the Duchess of Cambridge and her younger sibling are also best friends who spend as much time together as possible. 31-year-old Pippa recently returned to London after spending several days with boyfriend Nico Jackson in Geneva and will be close at hand when the baby arrives. Close: The Duchess of Cambridge is extremely close to her 31-year-old sister Pippa Middleton . Her role will echo the one she has played with Prince George, who was described as being 'amazing' by his besotted aunt in an interview last July. Speaking to  the Today show last July, Pippa said: 'He's amazing, a very dear boy. He has brought a lot of pleasure and fun for all of us, the whole family.' Despite her busy schedule, author and athlete, Miss Middleton is a regular visitor to Kensington Palace and Anmer Hall and was part of the party that holidayed with William, Kate and George in Mustique in January. Friends: Pippa, pictured laughing at Wimbledon with her sister, could be godmother to Kate's second child . Quality time: Pippa, seen  ahead of Kate's 2011 wedding, says she still spends a lot of time with her sister . Added Pippa: 'We spend a lot of time together. We still do a lot together as a family. And I think that's really the heart for all of us is having a really close family that we can sort of be normal with each other, treat each other normally. 'And that's sort of kept us all, you know, affixed to the ground.' But it hasn't been all smooth sailing for Pippa, who sources revealed has been a cause of concern to her royal in-laws thanks to her high profile. As a result, she was not among the godparents chosen for Prince George, with royal insiders saying it would have piled even more pressure onto her shoulders. Nevertheless, she has been widely tipped to make it onto the list for royal baby number two - possibly alongside Prince Harry. Wider family: Pippa, behind Kate, posed for Prince George's official christening in October 2013 . CAROLE MIDDLETON . She's been described as a 'super-granny' who boasts a starring role in Prince George's life and oversight of the royal nursery. Now Carole Middleton, 60, is set to do the same for her second grandchild and, according to royal sources, will be part of his or her first few days. Although the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge decamped to the Middleton's Berkshire home shortly after the birth of Prince George, this time they will head to Anmer Hall in Norfolk instead. Mrs Middleton is expected to join them there along with proud grandfather Michael and will help Prince George adjust to life as a big brother. Matriarch: Carole Middleton has made no secret of her desire to be a hands-on grandmother . First on the scene: Carole has a central role in Kate's life and was among the first to meet Prince George . Involved: Carole, who helped plan the 2011 Royal Wedding, is expected to spend more time at Anmer Hall . The baby is also likely to spend time at the Middletons' £4.5m country pile, which frequently sees visits from William and Kate. Carole, who to her credit provided a happy and secure childhood for her three children, has made no secret of her desire to be a hands-on grandmother and, as she has with Prince George, is likely to take the new arrival on jaunts to farmers' markets and to the zoo. EMILIA JARDINE-PATERSON . A friend of William’s from his teenage years and a schoolfriend of Kate’s from Marlborough College, glamorous Emilia Jardine-Paterson has been credited with introducing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Her husband David Jardine-Paterson is the scion of a Scottish landowning family descended from the illustrious Hong Kong banking Jardines and was a contemporary of Prince William's at Eton. Like his wife, Mr Jardine-Paterson also has a Middleton connection: his younger brother, JJ, went out with Pippa  for four years. Close connection: David and Emila Jardine-Paterson are old school friends of William and Kate . Although there have been a few bumps over the years, Mrs Jardine-Paterson, who is one of Prince George's seven godparents, has become a fixture in royal circles. Mrs Jardine-Paterson, an interior designer, is also thought to be partly responsible for the recent redecoration of Anmer Hall, having provided the Duchess with design tips for fabrics, trimmings and furniture. ALICIA FOX-PITT . A 6ft redhead, Alicia Fox-Pitt, the younger sister of Olympic eventing star William, is a loyal friend of Kate’s from her Marlborough College days. Indeed, it was Ms Fox-Pitt who recruited Kate for the now famous Sisterhood rowing team, which planned to cross the Channel for charity. 'She's been training with us,' said Ms Fox-Pitt at the time. 'All being well she will be in the boat. She is a very gifted sportswoman and we played a lot of sport together at school.' The Duchess, who was midway through her temporary separation from Prince William at the time, bowed out when the couple reunited. Nevertheless, the pair remain close friends and Alicia, who married entrepreneur Sebastian Stoddart in 2013, shares Kate's love of all things sport. Close: Alicia Fox-Pitt is a loyal friend of Kate's from her Marlborough College days and a keen athlete . Rowing: Alicia recruited Kate for the  famous Sisterhood rowing team, which planned to cross the Channel . ZARA TINDALL . Princess Anne’s daughter Zara  might be William’s first cousin but the Olympic silver medallist is just as close to Kate. The two, who had their first children just six months apart, are said to be really ‘good chums’ who were thrilled to have had babies so near each other. They are on the ‘same wavelength’, a source told the Mail on Sunday. ‘They like to live and eat organically and Zara has helped Kate get over her fear of horses. 'They share many jokes and Kate can relax in her presence more than any other royal cousin.’ 'Good chums': Kate and Zara are said to have been thrilled to have had babies so close to each other . Godmother: Zara, seen here with husband Mike Tindall at the Chapel Royal, is godmother to Prince George . NATASHA ARCHER . Her job title might be Kensington Palace PA but Natasha - or Tash as she is fondly known  - has become a close confidante and travels around the world with the Duchess. Miss Archer's first foray into the public eye came in July 2013 when she was one of the few people to visit the then newborn Prince George while still at the Lindo Wing. The 28-year-old, who studied Hispanic Studies at King's College London, was seen carrying a dress bag and baby car seat as she made her way inside alongside hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker. PA: Natasha Archer - or Tash as she is fondly known  - has become a close confidante of Kate . Stylist: Although officially Kate's PA, she also dispenses fashion advice to the Duchess of Cambridge . Miss Archer was also a key part of the team to travel Down Under last April and was seen hauling an armful of garment bags off the Royal Australian Air Force jet that flew the couple to Wellington, New Zealand for the first leg of the tour. 'Natasha’s main role is as a PA, but over the last few months she has assisted Kate as a style adviser,' a source told Grazia magazine. 'Natasha and Kate get on very well. She has always supported and advised Kate - and the Duchess loves Natasha’s style, so it seemed like an obvious appointment. 'Natasha has been helping Kate pick outfits for the tour.’ Helping out: The 28-year-old, pictured here in Wellington, also accompanied Kate on the tour Down Under . NATASHA RUFUS ISAACS AND LAVINIA BRENNAN . Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs is an old friend of the Duchess - and is married to Kate's former boyfriend Rupert Finch with whom she recently welcomed baby daughter Georgia. Her father, the Marquess of Reading, is also close to Prince Charles and as a result, Lady Natasha has known Prince William since she was a little girl. Lady Natasha also has a fashion connection to the Duchess and runs one of  Kate and Pippa's favourite brands, Beulah London, alongside fashion designer and best friend, Lavinia Brennan. Chum: Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs is an old friend of Kate's and runs Beulah London with Lavinia Brennan . The design duo are part of an exclusive group of designers to be worn regularly by the Duchess, who memorably opted for a bespoke Beulah London dress for her visit to a Malaysian mosque in 2012. ‘We never know when she is going to wear something, but we do know she has when we see a push on the website,' said Miss Brennan of the Kate effect. 'It’s only ever a little one and it’s always from the US. We don’t sell out overnight.' ALICE ST JOHN WEBSTER . Alice was in the same year as Kate at Marlborough College, the Wiltshire public school that Pippa also attended. During their school years, Ms St. John Webster was in the school tennis team with Pippa and Kate and also attended Edinburgh University with Miss Middleton, where she studied French and Spanish. An integral member of the ‘Glosse Posse’, the young and glamorous Gloucestershire polo set, she is also a close friend of  Guy Pelly and Alicia Fox-Pitt. At the Royal Wedding, Ms St John Webster was given a prime seat in the Statesmen’s Aisle, next to Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs, and behind Prince William’s ex-girlfriend, Arabella Musgrave. The mother-of-one, who is married to Gerald Alvenel, a French banker at Merrill Lynch, now lives in Fulham (well-placed for visits to Kensington Palace) and teaches French and Spanish.","School friends and Prince William's family  will play crucial supporting role .

"Robert Durst has been absolved of state gun charges in Louisiana. The ruling on Thursday clears the way for federal proceedings on similar charges in New Orleans, which local lawyers believe he can win. Durst, 72, who faces a murder charge in an unrelated California case, remains jailed without bond in Louisiana. Scroll down for video . Next step: Jailed millionaire Robert Durst has been absolved of state gun charges in Louisiana. He will now face federal charges, which lawyers believe he can win, before a murder trial in California . He was arrested at a hotel in the New Orleans capital in March a day before the finale of his HBO docu-series The Jinx. Authorities said he had a gun and marijuana in his room. Defense Attorney Dick DeGuerin said state and federal prosecutors had been discussing the possibility of the state case being dismissed. He says he was pleased with the decision. 'It makes sense to try this case in federal court because FBI agents arrested Mr. Durst, and there shouldn't be two prosecutions, state and federal, at the same time for the same crime,' DeGuerin said in an email. 'We're looking forward to our day in court.' A spokesman for District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro confirmed the move, saying Cannizzaro has a close working relationship with federal authorities in New Orleans. 'The District Attorney did reserve the right to look at the case again upon its conclusion in federal court,' assistant prosecutor Christopher Bowman said. Durst had faced state charges of possessing a handgun with drugs and illegal possession of a handgun by a felon. Legal battle: The 72-year-old was arrested in March the day before the finale of an HBO docu-series about him . Durst (right) was arrested for the murder of his friend and writer Susan Berman (left) in 2000, which some believe he may have committed to stop her from talking to authorities about the disappearance of his wife . Durst, the heir to a vast real estate fortune before becoming estranged from his family, is also connected to the 1982 disappearance of first wife Kathy McCormack (left, with Durst) and the killing of Morris Black (right) The charge in the federal indictment says Durst violated the federal gun-control act because he was in possession of a firearm after being convicted of earlier felonies. His lawyers say the arrest in mid-March was timed to mesh with the finale of The Jinx, HBO's six-part series about Durst, his wife's disappearance, Berman's death, and the death and dismemberment of Durst's neighbor Morris Black in 2001. Authorities found more than $44,000 in Durst's hotel room, according to legal papers filed Wednesday. After his arrest, they intercepted a package containing personal items and $117,000 that was sent to the hotel for Everette Ward — the name Durst used to register there. During a hearing last month, a prosecutor said the package of $100 bills, a head-and-chest latex mask and a map folded to show Louisiana, Florida and Cuba were evidence that Durst was likely to flee if bond was set for him.

"Hazmat teams tested a white powdery substance sent to U.S. Rep Mike Doyle's office on Wednesday causing the building to temporarily close down. A staff member in Doyle's Washington D.C. office opened a letter containing a grainy white substance and immediately alerted Capitol police. The tests of the substance came back negative and the quarantine of Room 239 of the Cannon House Office building was removed at 3:37 p.m. on Wednesday, reports Triblive. Temporary shutdown: Capitol Police secure as officers begin to remove hazmat suits in a hallway in the Cannon House Office Building after a suspicious powder was discovered on Wednesday . A powdery white substance was found in the office of Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills (pictured) but it was found to be a non-harmful substance . The congressman said that the Capitol police were 'prompt and professional.' The white substance was cause for concern after powdered anthrax was mailed to members of congress in 2001 following the September 11 attacks. After testing, assistant who opened the envelope was not advised to seek medical attention and was simply told to wash her hands. Doyle was concerned for the well-being of his staffer but remained calm throughout the ordeal and maintained a sense of humor.

"Car-congested cities could become a thing of the past, provided people are prepared to ride-share with a robot driver. A new study claims these 'taxibots' could cut the number of cars needed to perform the same number of journeys per day by 90 per cent. The finding comes amid reports that companies such as Google and Uber are working on technology to develop driverless taxis. Scroll down for video . Car-congested cities could become a thing of the past, provided people are prepared to ride-share with a robot driver. Pictured is an interior view of a Google self-driving car showing the video and the data the car uses to 'see' the road. Google is believed to be working on technology for self-driving cabs, but hasn't revealed details . The study, by Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  used data from Lisbon in Portugal. By plugging the data into a computer model, they simulated how such self-driving, communal cabs would affect traffic. Even with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport, the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent. The authors said replacing personal cars with self-driving cabs would also free valuable real estate currently used for public parking - equivalent to over 200 football pitches in Lisbon’s case. Major technology firms are already banking on self-driving taxis to be the future of transportation. Even with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport, the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent. In this image is one Google's autonomous vehicles pictured with Google Chairman Eric Schmidt (left) and  US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx (right) Last year, for instance, ride-sharing service Uber said it could replace all of its drivers with autonomous vehicles. CEO Travis Kalanick admitted the technology would keep costs down, and these savings could then be passed on to its customers. Corey Clothier, who is co-ordinating the trials told DailyMail.com that an accident involved a driverless car is inevitable - although he added none have taken place in his pilots. 'Systems will fail, people's judgements will fail,' he said. 'If someone jumps out from a blind spot from a vehicle, if it can't stop, it can't stop.' A recent report by the Institution of Engineering and Technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars. Motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front, but were less able to react quickly. However, many experts say that driverless cars could actually reduce the risk of accidents as computers are able to react a lot faster than humans. Google has also been teaching its vehicles to drive more safely by giving them instructions on 'defensive driving' styles. They have also been experimenting with teaching the vehicles 'body language' to communicate with other drivers what its intentions are. Speaking at the Code Conference in California, Kalanick said: ‘The reason Uber could be expensive is because you're not just paying for the car - you're paying for the other dude in the car. ‘When there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.’ Google was an early backer of the San Francisco-based firm, investing $258 million (£170 million) in the controversial ride-sharing service through its venture capital arm in August 2013. But last month unnamed source told Bloomberg that Google is preparing to offer its own taxi service, and it was likely to use its driverless cars. The report said that Google had told Uber's board of this possibility, and executives had seen screenshots of what appears to be a Google ride-sharing app, currently being used by employees. While driverless taxis are still some way off from becoming a reality, a separate report last month found they could soon find their way into our airports and campuses. Ten US cities will roll out automated vehicle pilot projects this year, with the first being unveiled in Tampa Bay, Florida in the spring. Meanwhile, trials will launch in another 12 to 20 US locations by the end of next year, which means driverless cars could be on the roads in up to 30 US cities by 2017. As well as the US, the UK will also be trialing the vehicles in Greenwich as part of the $9 million project called Gateway, shuttling people to the O2 Arena. The finding comes amid reports that companies such as Google and Uber are working on technology to develop driverless taxis . Some will be on the roads where it's legal,' Corey Clothier, a strategist Comet LLC, who is running the trials told DailyMail.com. Passengers can set their destination on some of the vehicles by typing it into a map or using commands. A combination of radar, lasers gives the car a 360-degree 'view', with sensors linked to computer software able to 'see' and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights. 'It's interesting to see people's reactions', said Clothier. 'Very few are nervous, or noticeably nervous. 'We've had interesting reactions from non-riders too. We were in the Silicon Valley and we had hundreds of people step in front of the vehicle to see what would happen.' 'The vehicles stopped. We've never had an accident.'

"Barry Beavis, 48, lost his case at the Court of Appeal . Millions of motorists face spiralling parking fines after judges ruled yesterday that £85 was not an 'excessively high' penalty for staying too long in a car park. Barry Beavis launched a legal bid to overturn his fine, saying it was unfair, disproportionate and unenforceable. But in a landmark ruling, appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither 'extravagant or unconscionable'. Motoring groups reacted in fury to the decision, accusing the judges – who are thought to earn more than £200,000 a year – of being 'out of touch'. Mr Beavis, from Chelmsford, Essex, had gone to court to fight what he called the 'bullying and threatening' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces. The 48-year-old, who runs a fish and chip shop, got the £85 fine in April 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the Riverside Retail park in Chelmsford. The car park, run by parking firm ParkingEye Ltd, allowed two hours of free parking, but Mr Beavis stayed for three. He claimed the £85 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who 'extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up'. But yesterday judges said the fine was enforceable because it was not 'excessively high'. Mr Beavis said he was 'absolutely furious' and planned to appeal. Meanwhile motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys and would open the floodgates for unscrupulous profit-hungry firms 'falling over themselves' to ramp up the already hefty penalties they impose. Ian Taylor, of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'I think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think £85 isn't extravagant. 'An £85 penalty may not seem much to a rich lawyer – it's probably less than many charge for an hour. But for the average hard-pressed motorist trying to make ends meet, it's a very heavy and unfair burden.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said the ruling would hand parking firms a 'blank cheque' to milk drivers, adding: 'This decision could cost motorists millions. 'If judges believe £85 is not an extravagant amount then what is? £100? £200? Our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers.' Mr Beavis had parked his car at the Riverside Retail Park in Chelmsford, pictured above, on April 15, 2013, . The retail site, pictured above, offers two free hours of parking and Mr Beavis was fined after he returned 56 minutes late . Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: 'We are concerned that this decision waters down the law on penalty charges and may encourage excessive default charges.' And AA president Edmund King said: 'Britain's motorists really will think judges are out of touch with everyday life if they consider £85 to be a reasonable amount of money for a parking penalty. £85 may not seem much to highly paid lawyers but it represents a great deal of money to cash-strapped motorists.' He added: 'This is a licence to print money for people who have now been handed an open cheque-book and invited to make up the figures as they like.' Speaking outside of the Court of Appeal Mr Beavis said he would now be taking the case to the Supreme Court . Parking trap: Many motorists face steep fines for running a few minutes over their allotted time . The three judges who unanimously dismissed the challenge – Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Patten and Sir Timothy Lloyd – are all thought to earn around £202,000 a year. Yesterday ParkingEye welcomed the judgment, saying it gave 'clarity to motorists and the parking industry' and 'further confirms that our parking charges are fair, reasonable and legally enforceable'. But speaking outside court, Mr Beavis said: 'These firms are not run on a moral basis, they're only out to make as much money as they can, to profiteer from unsuspecting motorists. I am utterly furious and will continue the fight.' Mr Beavis's action comes after the Daily Mail revealed how rogue firms are making millions of pounds from fines handed to motorists who overstay – sometimes for only a few minutes – in car parks at hospitals, railway stations and shopping centres. Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatments have over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking firms. Three judges unanimously dismissed his challenge at the Court of Appeal, saying the amount he was charged 'is not extravagant or unconscionable'.","Barry Beavis took on private car park operators over 'unfair' charges .

"David Cameron likes to project an image as the 'chillaxing' statesman unruffled by political troubles - but this morning his usual demeanour seemed to desert him as he donned a bizarre outfit on the campaign trail. The Prime Minister looked  exhausted as he stepped off the sleeper train at Penzance today, ahead of a speech in which he delivered his 'plan for Cornwall'. The Conservatives are battling against their Coalition partners in the South-West as they seek to wrest control of key constituencies from the Liberal Democrats. But Mr Cameron is still trailing Ed Miliband's Labour Party nationally, with just 14 days to go until polling day. Get-up: David Cameron stepped off the sleeper train at Penzance this morning wearing jeans, smart shoes and a navy jacket . Journey: The Prime Minister travelled for eight hours from Paddington station to reach Cornwall . Tired out: The Tory leader did not appear to have enjoyed a good night's sleep on the train and was wearing an unusual combination of solely dark colours . A YouGov poll published this morning put Labour on 34 per cent - one point ahead of the Tories. The Lib Dems trail on 7 per cent with Ukip in third on 14 per cent. Mr Cameron said in an interview this week that he 'always manages to portray a calm smoothness' - however, he looked anything but smooth at Penzance station. The Prime Minister seemed as if he had had trouble sleeping on the eight-hour journey from London's Paddington station. His hair was unkempt and he was wearing an unusual combination of jeans with shiny loafers which might be considered more appropriate for a smart business suit. Destination: He apparently chose the sleeper to avoid taking time out of his schedule to travel . Outfit: Mr Cameron wore a navy jacket, dark blue shirt, jeans and smart black shoes - as well as a red box . Inspiration? Mr Cameron may have been trying to channel the style sense of US President Barack Obama . Mr Cameron sported a navy jacket with a dark blue polo shirt, and set off his outfit with the ultimate status symbol - a red box holding ministerial papers, which only a few dozen people are entitled to carry. While the jacket may have looked inoffensive, the Tory leader may have been making a political statement in support of the Union, as it appears to have been made by Scottish firm Lyle & Scott. Similar models retail online for around £125. Speaking at a factory later, he insisted that he had in fact slept very well - because his wife Samantha was not there to complain about him talking in his sleep. Mr Cameron said: 'It was very comfortable, very nice it was too, to have a night without the children waking me up or Mrs Cameron nudging me in the ribs and telling me to shut up for talking in my sleep.' In an interview with the Spectator published yesterday, Mr Cameron was asked why he has a reputation for lacking passion while on the campaign trail. Changed: The leader put on a more formal outfit for his speech at a company in Penzance . Gimmick: Mr Cameron tried out a selfie stick during a visit to radio station Pirate FM today . Snap: The Prime Minister used the gadget to take this photograph of himself with the station's staff . He replied: 'I don't know. There is something about me - I always manage to portray a calm smoothness or something.' But he went on to point to his hectic campaigning schedule - as shown by his decision to spend the night on the sleeper train in order to reduce his travel time in the day. While the overnight journey from London to Penzance lasts eight hours, Mr Cameron would have had to carve out five hours from his schedule if he had travelled to Cornwall in the daytime. There is also a 70-minute flight from Gatwick to Newquay Airport, not far from Penzance, but the Prime Minister may have calculated that taking the train is likely to project a more down-to-earth image. Fun: The Prime Minister took part in selfies with Tory activists during one of his Cornish campaign stops . Speech: Workers at the Rodda dairy factory in Redruth watch Mr Cameron address them . Back to business: In the afternoon the Prime Minister flew to Brussels for a summit on the ongoing Mediterranean migrant crisis . The constituency of St Ives, where Penzance is located, is the most remote in the UK because it also contains the Scilly Isles. It is typically the last area to declare its results after a General Election, due to the need to transport ballots from the islands to the mainland the morning after the vote. The seat is currently held by Lib Dem Andrew George, but the Tories will be keen to overturn his 1,719 majority as part of efforts to drive the party out of the South-West. In his speech at a scaffolding firm this morning, Mr Cameron told activists that Labour do not care about anything 'west of Bristol', adding: 'Now imagine what it would be like if Alex Salmond was calling the shots.' How the true blue PM takes refuge in navy outfits for work and play . The Prime Minister is known for his love of navy outfits - nearly all of his suits are dark blue, and he also sports the inoffensive colour when on holiday in Britain or abroad. He often resorts to navy polo shirts even while wearing casual attire such as shorts or flip-flops, having apparently calculated that the shade suits him and is unlikely to cause a political stir compared to more outlandish choices. On the campaign trail in recent weeks he has usually donned a navy suit - with the main exception being when he puts on high-viz jacket and hard hat for a visit to a factory. Favourite: Mr Cameron often wears navy blue when he is off duty, like in this photograph from his Cornish holiday in summer 2013 . Relaxed: The Prime Minister wore dark blue again while on holiday with wife Samantha in Portugal last year . Suit: Mr Cameron was wearing a dark jacket and trousers at a campaign event in Bedford yesterday . Superspy: David Cameron has backed William Hague to take over the role of James Bond . David Cameron has backed his Cabinet colleague William Hague to be the next James Bond - saying that it's time for Britain's most famous spy to be portrayed by a Yorkshireman. Speaking to Magic Radio's Nick Snaith, the Prime Minister was asked who he thought should take over from Daniel Craig when he gives up the role of 007. Mr Cameron replied: 'I'm a Sean Connery man so who is most like Sean Connery? Is it time for a Yorkshire James Bond? Is it time for William Hague to step forward? 'He's fit, he's healthy, he does yoga, he can probably crack a man's skull between his knee caps. I'd go for William Hague. 'You know we might have to sort out one or two things but I think he'd be good.' Mr Hague, the former Tory leader and Foreign Secretary, is set to have time on his hand after the Election because he is retiring from Government. Mr Cameron's rivals have previously weighed in on the Bond question - Ed Miliband said he thought Rosamund Pike should become the first female 007, while Nigel Farage proposed himself for the action role. In today's interview, the Prime Minister also confessed to his love of Game of Thrones, saying: 'I am a big Throny, I think it's great. I went to the set the other day. 'So I've stood on the wall. I've held Oath Keeper... Brienne of Tarth's sword. I was in Tyrion Lannister's bedroom. 'Well it's a bit like politics but actually, you know, you die even faster in Game of Thrones than you do in my chosen profession.'","The Prime Minister travelled from London to Penzance on the sleeper train .

"To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Hubble Space Telescope tomorrow, Nasa has released an image of a fantastic tapestry of stars snapped by the orbiting observatory. The image shows a giant distant cluster of about 3,000 stars called Westerlund 2 inside a stellar 'breeding ground' called Gum 29, 20,000 light-years from Earth. In the image massive young stars can be seen feeding a nearby region with the fuel it needs to form new stars. Scroll down for video . A stellar nursery of about 3,000 stars called Westerlund 2 located about 20,000 light-years from the planet earth in the constellation Carina is shown in this image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, released today to celebrate the silver anniversary of Hubble's launch . Hubble was launched on 24 April 1990 aboard Space Shuttle Discovery. Despite a shaky start, when its primary mirror was ground to the wrong shape, Hubble soon began returning fantastic images of the distant universe, to the delight of scientists and the public alike on Earth. And this latest image is no exception, revealing a fascinating cluster of stars in the constellation Carina. The telescope, when it was first devised, was ambitious to say the least - it is 43ft (12.3 metres) long and 14ft (4.2 metres wide). It orbits Earth at a height of about 345 miles (555km) at a speed of 16,000 mph (27,750km/h), with its instruments finely tuned to account for its movement. It is able to image the universe in near-infrared, visible light and ultraviolet. It’s estimated that the telescope can continue operating until 2020, when it will overlap with the James Webb Space Telescope, which is set to launch in 2018. 'Hubble has completely transformed our view of the universe,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator of Nasa's Science Mission Directorate. 'This vista of starry fireworks and glowing gas is a fitting image for our celebration of 25 years of amazing Hubble science.' Hubble captured the image using its Wide Field Camera 3, which pierced through the dusty veil of dust and gas around the stellar nursery using near-infrared light. The cluster is between six and 13 light-years across but only two million years old, and thus contains some of the hottest, brightest and most massive stars in the galaxy. Some of the biggest stars in the cluster unleash torrents of ultraviolet light and hurricane-force winds of charged particles that disrupt the surrounding cloud of hydrogen gas. Inside the nebula is a fantasy landscape of pillars, ridges and valleys made of gas - the fuel for new stars. Some of the pillars are several light-years tall and point towards the centre of the cluster, while other dense regions surround the pillars. As the clusters is very young in astronomical terms, it has not had time to disperse its stars into deep space, so it provides astronomers an opportunity to gather information on how clusters like this form. Hubble's near-infrared imaging camera pierces through the dusty veil enshrouding the stellar nursery, giving astronomers a clear view of the dense concentration of stars in the central cluster, shown . Westerlund 2 is surrounded by the star-forming region Gum 29. The heaviest cluster stars are unleashing a torrent of ultraviolet radiation and hurricane-force winds streaming with charged particles, etching away the enveloping hydrogen gas cloud from where the cluster formed . The red dots scattered throughout the landscape around Westerlund 2 are a rich population of newly forming stars still wrapped in their gas-and-dust cocoons. These tiny, faint stars are between 1 million and 2 million years old and have not yet ignited the hydrogen in their cores. Hubble's near-infrared vision allows astronomers to identify these fledgling stars . The pillars in the star-forming region surrounding Westerlund 2, composed of dense gas, are a few light-years tall and point to the central cluster. They are thought to be incubators for new stars. Besides sculpting the gaseous terrain, intense radiation from the most brilliant of the cluster stars is creating a successive generation of baby stars. The bluish haze is an indicator of oxygen gas in the nebula . The image is part of a week of celebrations by Nasa to commemorate what is widely regarded as the most important space telescope of all. 'This is really an exciting week for astronomers and people who love astronomy all over the world,' said Hubble scientist Jennifer Wiseman at a televised anniversary celebration at the Newseum in Washington, DC. Learning about the life cycle of stars was one of the reasons Hubble was built. By operating above distortions and blocking effects of Earth's atmosphere, astronomers hoped to look farther back in time, at generations of stars and galaxies that formed closer to the Big Bang, some 13.7 billion years ago. But the mission almost start in disaster, when Nasa discovered a manufacturing flaw in the telescope's 7.9ft (2.4-meter) diameter mirror. Corrective optics, installed by space-walking astronauts, saved the day in 1993, the first of five servicing calls by Space Shuttle crews. 'We never thought it would last this long,' said Nasa administrator and former astronaut Charlie Bolden, the pilot on the mission that launched Hubble. Nasa is celebrating the Hubble Space Telescope's (pictured) 25th anniversary with a variety of events highlighting its groundbreaking achievements and scientific contributions with activities running April 20-26.  In its quarter-century in orbit, the observatory has transformed our understanding of our solar system and beyond, and helped us find our place among the stars . This is one of Hubble's most iconic images: the Eagle Nebula's Pillars of Creation. It shows the pillars as seen in visible light, capturing the multi-coloured glow of gas clouds, wispy tendrils of dark cosmic dust, and the rust-coloured elephants trunks of the nebulas famous pillars. The dust and gas in the pillars is seared by the intense radiation from young stars and eroded by strong winds . Here we see one of the universe's most stately and photogenic galaxies, the Sombrero galaxy, Messier 104 (M104).  The galaxy's hallmark is a brilliant white, bulbous core encircled by the thick dust lanes comprising the spiral structure of the galaxy. As seen from Earth, the galaxy is tilted nearly edge-on . This dramatic image offers a peek inside a cavern of roiling dust and gas where thousands of stars are forming. The image, taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard Hubble, represents the sharpest view ever taken of this region, called the Orion Nebula. More than 3,000 stars of various sizes appear in this image. Some of them have never been seen in visible light . Many of the telescope's most important discoveries turned out to be in areas that didn't even exist when it was launched. Hubble's observations of a particular kind of exploded star helped astronomers realise that the pace of the universe's expansion is ramping up, propelled by some unknown force referred to as 'dark energy.' Hubble also has imaged a planet beyond the solar system and scanned other planets' atmospheres for telltale chemical fingerprints. The first so-called exoplanet was discovered in 1992, two years after Hubble's launch. 'Hubble has fundamentally changed our human understanding of our universe,' Bolden said. Nasa hopes to keep Hubble operating through 2020 to overlap with its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch in October 2018.","Nasa scientists in California have released an image of distant giant cluster of 3,000 stars called Westerlund 2 .

"David Cameron (pictured) said he knows that when it comes to immigration, 'fears and worries' remain . Let me reassure you, I know that when it comes to immigration, fears and worries remain. They were set out on the front page of this newspaper yesterday. And I want to set out exactly the choice before you on May 7. I am not one of those politicians who says they ‘get’ how people feel about immigration then speaks differently in private. Sitting in the House of Commons from 2001, I had a ringside seat on Labour’s complete failure on immigration – and it was infuriating. Fake colleges, bogus visas, wide open loopholes, the wrong welfare incentives, sham marriages, an abject failure to deport foreign criminals, migrants bringing family members to Britain even if they couldn’t speak a word of English – a litany of failure. Underpinning it all was contempt for the views of most British people. We all remember Peter Mandelson’s boast that Labour was practically ‘sending out search parties’ for migrants. The mess took 13 years to create – and over the past five years we have been working to turn this around. Economic migration from outside the EU has been capped at 20,700 skilled professionals a year. We have closed down over 850 of those bogus colleges that were basically visa factories. There are new charges for migrants using the NHS; there is no social housing unless you’ve been in an area for two years; and there is no housing benefit full-stop for EU jobseekers. Critically, we now have proper exit checks at our borders so we know who is coming in and going out. On top of all this direct action to control immigration, we recognised that the rising immigration numbers weren’t just about lax borders and a system easily abused; it was about British people not being trained to get into the jobs that were becoming available – or not incentivised to work at all, because of Labour’s welfare system. So we have had a huge, unprecedented push on welfare and training, with two million young people starting apprenticeships, and vast numbers getting off welfare and into work. The result of all this? Consider these remarkable two facts. Under Labour, for years, 90 per cent of job growth was taken up by foreign workers. With the Conservatives, two-thirds of our job growth now benefits British citizens. That is a remarkable turnaround. I’m not saying there isn’t a lot more to do. It’s clear that, as our economy has taken off, the bigger issue has become migration from within Europe. And while we have not yet reduced net migration down to the tens of thousands each year, it remains the right ambition. So why have many more EU migrants come here? Partly it’s our extraordinary economic success, with Britain creating more jobs than 27 other European countries combined. But large numbers have also been drawn here because of incentives in things like tax credits and welfare. These have been a powerful draw to EU workers. Scroll down for video . David Cameron said under the Conservatives, two-thirds of the UK's job growth now benefits British citizens . That is why, in the manifesto we published last week, we had some very clear and hard-headed proposals. Elect a Conservative government, and I will start negotiating a new deal with Europe straight away. It will involve: no benefits at all for EU jobseekers. If you haven’t got a job within six months, you’ll be required to leave. If you’ve got a job, you will get no in-work benefits until you’ve been here and contributing to our country for at least four years. And no child benefit for children of EU migrants living abroad – ever. This is what I’m seeking. I will fight, negotiate, do all I can to secure a better deal for Britain. And then we would put this to the British people in an in-out referendum in 2017. The capsizing of a boat full of migrants in the Mediterranean at the weekend was absolutely shocking. Eight hundred people died in the most horrific of circumstances, so it’s also right that Britain – not just a compassionate country but a strong one too – does what it can to prevent such scenes from ever happening again. That’s why I went to Brussels yesterday to help deliver a response. Of course, we need more search and rescue missions – and our Royal Navy is ready to play its part alongside other navies. We need to hunt down the traffickers who prey on human misery, deal with the boats that bring people across the seas and help foster stable conditions in countries which export so much illegal immigration. Only then will we properly get to grips with this situation – building confidence at home that people can’t come here illegally; and helping people abroad life safe and secure lives. All of this is a serious, grown-up plan for reducing immigration long-term. And it is based on some straightforward values. Immigration should be about welcoming those who can contribute to our country; who want to come to Britain, pay their way, make a life here, and abide by British values. This is our approach. And this presents you with a clear choice on immigration on May 7. There can only be one Prime Minister in Number Ten, only one person ultimately responsible for controlling immigration: me, or Ed Miliband. Do you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased five-fold. His arrogant refusal even to discuss numbers – let alone speak about any reduction – tells you all you need to know. But the facts of this election have changed – and it’s even worse. The only way Ed Miliband can get into Downing Street is if he is propped up by the SNP – and they have made clear that they want higher levels of immigration. It’s clear: Ed Miliband in Downing Street would increase immigration, not reduce it. And if you’re someone considering voting Ukip because you want a referendum on Europe and controlled immigration, remember that a vote for Ukip makes it harder for Conservatives to win – and much more likely for Ed Miliband and the SNP to get into government. Then you will get no referendum, and a return to uncontrolled immigration. So this is the choice. If I am Prime Minister after May 7 I will see through this serious, sustained attempt to control immigration long-term. I will get Britain a better deal in Europe – and I will give the British people the final say in an in-out referendum. If you want those things, there’s only one way to get them: vote Conservative on May 7.","Cameron said he knows that 'fear and worries' remain over immigration .

"The mother of Nicholas Figueroa, a 23-year-old male model who died in a building explosion on New York City's 2nd Avenue last month, has spoken out . Ana Figueroa, 55, told Daily Mail Online that though she cries every night, those responsible for the explosion and handling its aftermath have not reached out to her. 'Nobody's spoken to me, no one has called to give condolences,' she said at a memorial to her son that was set up Thursday at the site of the disaster that killed two and destroyed three buildings on March 26. Scroll down for video . Ana Figueroa (pictured with husband Nixon) has spoken out for the first time since her son Nicholas, 23, died in a gas explosion on New York City's Second Avenue . The young man and recent college graduate was paying the bill on a blind date at a sushi restaurant when three buildings in New York's East Village were destroyed . Her Upper East Side family, which includes Nicholas's father Nixon, 52, and his three younger brothers Brandon, Neal and Tyler, says it still 'wants justice' and those responsible for the explosion to be punished. However, nearly one month after the blast that killed Nicholas when he was on a blind date at a sushi bar, answers about what exactly happened in the explosion remain unclear. In early April, according to the New York Post, a plumber allegedly admitted to law enforcement that he created an illegal gas connection in the building. allegedly at the request of Michael Hyrnenko, the son of landlord Maria Hyrnenko. Mrs Figueroa said that she had not been contacted by Ms Hyrnenko and has only learned about her life after reading it in media reports. She has learned that Ms Hyrnenko is also 55 and also has four children and said Thusday, 'I wonder how she would feel if she were to lose her kid'. While he said that they didn't want to 'blame' anyone, Mr Figueroa said that the family 'wants someone to come forward and say that they did this'. Nicholas's mother, who has not previously spoken at length to the press, said she had contacted a lawyer about filing charges against the landlord, though she is waiting until after the results of the city's investigation. The Figueroas say that neither the landlord of the demolished buildings, Mayor Bill de Blasio nor Con Edison have contacted them with condolences following their loss . The family, who are afraid that their son's death and its cause will be 'put under the rug' have set up a memorial at the site of the explosion . Mrs Figueroa, who was hugged by passersby who saw the memorial to her son, said that she still cries every night . A wall has been placed around the site of the explosion, which destroyed buildings at the corner of Second Avenue and Seventh Street and damaged windows on one adjacent . Attempts by Daily Mail Online to contact Mrs Hyrnenko, who switched lawyers after the explosion, for comment were unsuccessful. Beyond Ms Hyrnenko, the Figueroa family said that other parties such as utility company Con Edison and the owner of Sushi Park, where Nicholas was eating when he died, bear some responsibility for his death. Mrs Figueroa faulted them for not stopping gas flow to the building and continuing to run a restaurant in a dangerous situation. 'Everybody has a part of this', Nixon Figueroa said Thursday. Now the Figueroas are left with their son and brother's death as the story fades from headlines, and the feeling that swiftly finding the person responsible is not a priority for authorities. 'They're going to say ''It's only two lives, it could have been more'', but it was my son', Mrs Figueroa said on Thursday as passersby hugged her in consolation. The explosion resulted in the deaths of Nicholas and Moises Locon, 26, a busboy at Sushi Park. Her family was last contacted by New York City authorities before the April 7 funeral for Nicholas, when help with services were offered. A GoFundMe page in memory of Nicholas met it's $30,000 goal, and the Figueroas did not take the city's help. Despite the relatively small number of victims, Mrs Figueroa said that she had not received a phone call from Mayor Bill de Blasio. 'We're nobody,' she said. 'Now I really need their help if we don't want this to be pushed under the rug'. A spokesman for the Mayor released a statement to Daily Mail Online saying: 'Following the East Village building collapse members of the administration were in regular communication with the families of the victims . 'Additionally, the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City raised more than $150,000 for the victims of the tragedy and the administration's offer to assist with funeral arrangements was declined.' Nicholas Figueroa, (left) a former model, and Moises Locon, 26 (right), both died at Sushi Park restaurant . New York City officials offered to help pay for Nicholas's funeral in early April, though the family was able to pay for it with help from a GoFundMe page . Mrs Figueroa was in tears at the funeral as she held a red rose and wore a button remembering her oldest son . Though the memorial set up on Thursday is a sorrowful reminder of her family's loss, the mother says that her sadness has mixed with anger over fears that her son will have 'died in vain' and no one will be held responsible. Ms Figueroa referenced other New York City incidents such as a crane collapse in 2008 that killed two and a fire in 2010 where those judged responsible faced manslaughter charges. The owner of the crane company and three men connected to the 2010 fire were all acquitted. She knows that the odds of a criminal conviction are small, but hopes that those responsible will help establish a small park on the property in memory of her son, who loved nature and meditating. The grieving mother said that those responsible include Con Edison, the utilities giant that said part of the building's gas works failed inspection about an hour before the explosion. She has also yet to be contacted by officials from the company. Con Ed released a statement to Daily Mail Online saying: 'We said on the day of the explosion and since then, that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this tragedy, and we made a significant contribution to the Mayor's Fund to help those affected.' Ms Hyrnenko's building had previously failed a Con Ed inspection in August, when workers discovered that a pipe had been tapped in a dangerous way, the company told the New York Times. Mrs Figueroa said that illegal gas tapping should not be a 'three strike' policy and that gas to the building should have been shut off completely following the second failed inspection. A Con Edison spokesman told Daily Mail Online that the March 26 inspection was on 'work the building owner was doing in connection with the installation of a new service'. The spokesman said 'The work did not pass the inspection and our inspectors left. The new service was locked, meaning that gas could not be accessed by it.' A plumber allegedly admitted to law enforcement earlier this month that he had created an illegal gas connection at the site of the explosion . Smoke from the fire was visible from around New York City as firefighters worked to combat the blaze on March 26 . The investigation into the incident by police and fire authorities is ongoing, with much of the suspicion falling on the buildings' gasworks . Con Edison has previously said that it was replacing a small pipe with a larger one that would allow both the building residents and the sushi restaurant to receive gas. Restaurant owner Hyeonil Kim told the New York Times he believed that the residents had been getting gas since the summer from a pipe coming from Ms Hyrnenko's other building next door. Gas is thought to have still been flowing through the old piping after the inspectors left. After the inspectors left, Ms Hrynenko's son Michael was down in the basement investigating a gas leak during the explosion. He was carried out by a general contractor with him. 'Our understanding is that the criminal investigation continues,' the company said in a statement. For now the mother is left with only pictures and messages from her son. Her last texts from Nicholas, with whom she would talk about 'everything' including  include message where he asks her to cook his favorite chicken for dinner. The young man had just gotten his bachelor's from Buffalo State College and had been home for three months before he died. Right before meeting his blind date at Sushi Park, Nicholas, a former model, had texted that he was about to have an 'interesting experience'. Ms Figueroa did not hear from her son again, and was knew that he was in the blast when she saw that his debit card had been used at the restaurant right before the explosion. After spending a long night at a nearby school hoping that her son would be found in the wreckage, Mrs Figueroa was later shown the place where he died. While the family may worry that officials will forget about their son's death, she is grateful for public support. Visitors to the Second Avenue memorial can now read testaments to the loving brother and son and see the spot where the explosion took his life, which the family has marked with white roses. The family was shown the spot where their son died and planted white roses in memory of the 23-year-old . The recent Buffalo State College graduate had texted his mother saying that he was going on an 'interesting experience' before his blind date .

"Devotees endure searing heat, holding their bodies in challenging poses leaving them dripping with sweat but exhilarated at the culmination of a tough workout. Bikram yoga improves mindfulness, flexibility, strength, muscle tone and general fitness, advocates boast. But a new study has warned the practise, which involves performing 26 poses, can raise a person's body temperature and heart rate to dangerous levels. A typical session lasts for 90 minutes and is performed in a room heated to 40°C (105°F), with 40 per cent humidity. Scroll down for video . Scientists at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse have warned that Bikram yoga, which involves 26 poses performed in a room heated to 40°C (105°F), raises the risk of participants suffering heat stroke . A team of researchers at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse has found hot yoga can place pressure cause a person's heart rate to fluctuate and their core body temperature to reach potentially dangerous levels. Emily Quandt, who led the study, working under John Porcari, said: 'The dramatic increases in heart rate and core temperature are alarming when you consider that there is very little movement, and therefore little cardiovascular training, going on during class.' Twenty apparently healthy volunteers - seven men and 13 women - ranging in age from 28 to 67 took part in the study. All regularly practised Bikram yoga and as such were familiar with the 26 standard poses. They were also all acclimatised to the hot, humid environment. Before taking part in a session each volunteer swallowed a core body temperature sensor, and was given a heart-rate monitor to wear during the class. Body temperature was recorded before the class started, as well as at 10-minute intervals throughout the session. Meanwhile heart rate was recorded every minute. The researchers found heart rate fluctuated throughout the class, depending on the difficulty of the pose being performed. But body temperature was found to steadily increase throughout the 90-minute class, in both men and women. The average body temperature for men was 39°C (103°F) and 38°C (102°F) for women. Scientists advise that the standard 90-minute class is reduced to just an hour to reduce risks . A male participant recorded the highest core temperature of 40°C (104°F), while seven volunteers' temperature reached 39°C (103°F), the scientists said. They noted that while none of their volunteers exhibited signs or symptoms of heat intolerance, body temperatures such as these can pose a danger for some people. They said the risk for heat-related illness, such as heat stroke, increases at 40°C (104°F). Dr Quandt said while the excessive perspiration experienced by people doing Bikram yoga is often cited as a benefit because it releases toxins, the results of the new study show this sweating was insufficient to cool down the body. She advises three ways to improve the safety of Bikram yoga classes - duration, temperature and hydration. Dr Quandt noted that  participants started to experience dangerous core temperatures around 60 minutes into the session. Therefore, shortening the length of the typical class to just an hour could help minimise the risk of heat intolerance. In addition lowering the temperature of the room may appear obvious, but would help reduce the risk Dr Quandt said. Furthermore, hydration lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding Bikram yoga, she said. In many classes, participants are designated just one water break. Though, many teachers do acknowledge students should hydrate as required throughout their class. Some Bikram enthusiasts believe that by minimising their water intake they augment the mindful aspects of the practise, with fewer water breaks decreasing the potential for mental distraction. Dr Porcari, said: 'Nothing is gained from withholding water in any setting. 'Exercise leaders must actively encourage hydration, particularly when classes take place in extreme environments like those seen in Bikram yoga classes.' He said Bikram yoga teachers must be familiar with essential science principles surrounding exercise, including a clear understanding of the physiology of the thermo-regulation. 'Knowing the risks associated with things like blood pooling and vasodilation, as well as the signs and symptoms of heat-related illness, is absolutely essential,' he added. And the researchers said it would be wise to reduce the temperatures in classes, while ensuring all participants are properly hydrated. One male study volunteer recorded a core temperature of 40°C (104°F) WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF HEAT EXHAUSTION? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF HEAT STROKE? Suspected heat stroke should always be treated as a medical emergency, health experts warn, advising an ambulance is called in extreme cases. Dr Cedric Bryant, chief science officer at the American Council on Exercise, which commissioned the study, agreed. He said: 'Bikram teachers should recognise that participants' thermoregulatory systems will be challenged in this environment. 'It is essential that they are aware of the early warning signs of heat intolerance.' The signs include cramps, headache, dizziness and general weakness. It is important that teachers respond appropriately and are trained in what to do in the event of an emergency to keep the participant's safety as the top priority, Dr Bryant added. The researchers concluded: 'Exercising in hot and humid environments - whether inside a studio while practising Bikram yoga, or outside running during the warm months - can place participants at risk for heat-related illness, especially if those individuals do not adequately hydrate before, during and after exercise. 'Not only does it take time for the body to acclimatise to activity performed in hot and humid environments, proper hydration is crucial.' 'Given the popularity of Bikram yoga and its proven benefits, it is likely here to stay,' said Dr Bryant. 'It is our job to make sure it is done safely.'","Bikram yoga involves 26 poses performed in a room heated to 40°C (105°F)

"Wellness warrior Belle Gibson sensationally admitted yesterday in a tell-all interview that she had made up her terminal brain cancer diagnosis. The 23-year-old founder of The Whole Pantry app came clean about her circumstances, telling the Australian Women's Weekly, 'none of it's true'. In the interview, Gibson asked her former fans and customers who purchased her app and books to see her as only 'human'. Leading psychologist Jo Lamble told Daily Mail Australia that this is a common reaction from people who are suffering from anti-social personality and narcissism disorders. Scroll down for video . Life-long struggle with the truth: Belle Gibson sensationally admitted that her terminal cancer was a lie in an interview with the Australian Women's Weekly . Lamble has not treated Gibson personally but said, in her professional opinion, she believes Gibson could be displaying signs of both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder. Lack of remorse is a common trait seen in those with anti-social personalities, Lamble says. 'A lack of remorse definitely fits in. It's like - you do what you need to do to get what you want,' she said. 'So if they need money they will commit fraudulent acts and steal, for example.' While other experts suggested to AWW that she could be suffering Munchhausen Syndrome, Lamble believes this isn't likely to be the case for Gibson. Changing times: 'In the past, a need for that love and attention may have been in less dangerous ways... but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand,' says Lamble . 'With Munchhausen, they normally don’t just lie, they go much further to be sick. 'While they definitely fake illness, they also self-harm and don’t normally do it for money purposes, they do it for attention,' she said. 'For example, they will go to lots of different doctors and shop around until someone believes their symptoms. They also might drink poison or swallow things or stab themselves, then ask, ""what’s wrong with me?'' 'So I think in this particular case,  she’s made up a story for fame, fortune, signing book deals - which suggests more narcissism and anti-socialism,' added Lamble. Another common trait shared by narcissists is that sufferers are often very charismatic. 'A lack or remorse definitely fits in... you do want you need to do to get what you want': Leading psychologist Jo Lamble says that Gibson's actions point to both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder . 'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune. They love to believe they are special and need all this admiration and attention,' the psychologist said. Lamble says this can often be a sign of neglect. This fits with Gibson's account of a troubled childhood - she was quoted in the Women's Weekly saying she had to bring herself up - doing the dishes and cooking her own food from a very young age, for example. According to Lamble, the common signs of someone showing an anti-social personality disorder are... 1. They deceive and lie . 2. They lack remorse . 3. They can be  impulsive and irresponsible . 4. They don’t respect the law . 5. They don’t mind if they hurt family and friends, anyone is open to being deceived . 6. They are very charming and charismatic . 7. They have a certain attractiveness and draw people in . 8. They show a real interest in people . 9. Passionate about things . 'Neglect can lead someone to develop really unhealthy strategies to seek the love and attention they missed out on,' says Lamble. 'In the past, a need for love and attention may have emerged in less dangerous ways  - a lie here, a lie there - but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand. 'Social media has become the perfect way to gain that, we know anyone is thrilled when they get new followers -  let alone hero worship, worldwide fans and book deals,' she said. 'I worry about future generations with things like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and people constantly needing excessive praise.' Lamble says our social media culture is fuelling unhealthy expectations for young girls but also a way of accessing information that could be misleading. 'Everyone laughs about Dr Google and how if you have some condition you should see an expert but that goes for all these self styled gurus in anything. 'We might want to buy into a story, it's very appealing for people to love somebody who can turn something around and survive and particularly so if they are very marketable but any idolisation of someone isn't healthy. 'With massive followings and a glamorous story, young minds will follow that and believe it. Our poor doctors must have people coming in every day and people saying this is what I'm doing and why. Let’s look at the science,' she said. 'They love to believe they are special': 'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune, says psychologist Jo Lamble (pictured left). She believes Belle Gibson (pictured right) may suffer from a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder. Lamble also believes that Gibson could struggle to change without help. 'She might change her name and come up with some other scheme unless she shows genuine remorse, seeks help, and develops some insight. With what she is displaying, the prognosis is quite poor.' According to the interview, Gibson's new management will be organising for a psychologist to see her.","Wellness guru and app developer Belle Gibson lied about having cancer .

"It was a vision that apparently led the biblical Paul to become one of the most influential figures in early Christianity by helping to spread the religion around the world. But now astronomers believe the bright light in the sky that triggered the conversion of Paul the Apostle may have actually been a falling meteor 2,000 years ago. They say descriptions of Paul's experience - in which he was blinded for three days after seeing a bright light - match accounts of the fireball that streaked across the sky above Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013. Scroll down for video . Paul converted to Christianity after experiencing a bright light and a divine voice while he traveled on a road towards Damascus in Syria, as depicted in this painting by Michelangelo, but it may have been a meteor . Dr William Hartmann, co-founder of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, examined three accounts of Paul's conversion in the Bible. Writing in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, he said: 'The first-century book, Acts of the Apostles, gives three separate descriptions of a bright light ""from heaven"", which occurred probably in the 30s (C.E.) near Damascus, Syria. A meteor that blazed across southern Urals in February was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century. More than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion, estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs, as it landed near the city of Chelyabinsk. The fireball measuring 18 meters across, screamed into Earth's atmosphere at 41,600 mph. Much of the meteor landed in a local lake called Chebarkul. Scientists have already uncovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the February 15 incident. However, only five of them turned out being real meteorites. The Chelyabinsk asteroid caused the second most powerful explosion in recorded history. The first was in 1908 when a suspected asteroid exploded with a force about 1,000 times more powerful than Hiroshima, levelling about 80m trees over 772 sq miles (2,000 sq km) near Russia's Podkamennaya Tunguska river in Siberia. It is thought the Chelyabinsk meteor may have formed after breaking off a 656 feet wide asteroid called 2011 EO. Researchers have also found that it may have collided with another asteroid around 290 million years ago. 'The details offer a strikingly good match to a Chelyabinsk-class or Tunguska-class fireball.' In the accounts given in the Bible, Paul had been one of the zealous persecutors of the followers of Jesus. However, during a journey to Damascus, Syria, he and his companions saw a bright light in the sky. Paul was blinded for three days and he heard a divine voice or sound. The experience apparently so affected Paul that he converted to Christianity and undertook several influential missions to spread the word of Christ around the Mediterranean. Many believe Paul's preaching led to the rise of much of the theology and traditions in the Roman and Protestant faith strands that exist today. However, some have attempted to explain Paul's vision as being the result of some kind of seizure or of sunstroke. Dr Hartmann, however, says the description of the light in the sky, the thunderous sound and the temporary blindness all match the events of a meteorite. He said the Cheyabinsk meteor, which exploded in the atmosphere close to the Russian city, is a good example of what Paul may have experienced. He said that the bright light in the sky - which was 'brighter than the sun, shining round me' - matches videos of the Chelyabinsk meteor, which was estimated to be three times as bright as the sun. Its movement across the sky created fast moving shadows that would have given the impression of the light moving around Paul. The meteorite that streaked across the sky above Chelyabinsk in Russia (above) created a bright light and noise that may have been similar to those experienced by Paul the Apostle in 30 AD, claims astronomer . The shockwave caused by exploding meterorite over Chelyabinsk shattered windows and apparently caused the roof of this zinc factory in the city to collapse. 100 people were injured by flying glass from the blast . Dr Hartmann says that the shockwave created by an exploding meteor could also have been responsible for knocking Paul and his companions to the ground after the light. The shock wave created by the meteor that exploded above Chelyabinsk shattered windows, rocked cars and knocked people over. Dr Hartmann also argues that the sound of the explosion could also have been the source of the 'voice' Paul heard. The three accounts of his experience in the Bible differ, with some saying it was a voice and others a sound. The fireball that above Chelyabinsk (above) was captured by a number of dashboard cameras in cars . Paul's temporary blindness could also have been caused by the intense ultraviolet radiation from the meteor - creating a condition called photokeratitis. Dr Hartmann said: 'Among the most impressive, unexpected consistencies with modern knowledge is the first-century description of symptoms of temporary blindness caused by exposure to intense radiation, matching a condition now known as photokeratitis.' In Chelyabinsk the radiation given off by the meteor was strong enough to cause sunburn and some temporary blindness. Speaking to New Scientist, Dr Hartmann said: 'Everything they are describing in those three accounts in the book of Acts are exactly the sequence you see with a fireball. 'If that first-century document had been anything other than part of the Bible, that would have been a straightforward story.' The 20-ft-wide hole in the ice of a frozen lake was created by the falling fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor . He added that unfamiliar natural phenomena like an exploding meteor are often interpreted in the context of 'current cultural conceptions'. He added however that he does not intend to discredit Christianity with his interpretation, but hopes to show how a meteor may have changed the course of the religion. Other researchers said that a search for meteorites in and around Syria could help to prove his theories. Even if his theory does prove to be correct, others say that it is unlikely that Christianity would not have spread if Paul had not encountered the meteor. However, Justin Meggitt, a religious historian at the University of Cambridge, said that the religion could have been very different. He told New Scientist: 'People's interpretation of Paul is absolutely fundamental to some of the central figures of Christianity. 'Christianity probably would be very different without him.'","Astronomer claims bright light and divine voice heard by Paul 2,000 years ago may have been exploding meteor similar to the one over Chelyabinsk .

"Matt Dunford, 30, who claimed to be 'Britain's vainest man', has been ordered to carry out 120 hours unpaid work for harassing an ex-girlfriend, pictured today outside court . A fitness fanatic dubbed 'Britain's vainest man' who set up a fake website claiming his ex-girlfriend was a prostitute has been ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work for harassing her. Matt Dunford, 30, bombarded Brazilian model Amanda Branco with up to 50 messages a day and tried to blackmail her out of £5,000 after their six-month relationship broke down. When she refused to pay the bodybuilder, from Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, he mocked-up an escort website profile on Facebook and sent it to her mother and sister. Dunford failed to appear at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court in February but was found guilty of two counts of harassment without violence in his absence. The model, who claims he spends £100,000-a-year on his looks and is now working as a stripper, says he took an overdose and suffered a seizure days before the hearing, causing him to miss it. Sentencing him today, Amanda Barron, chair of the bench, said: 'It involves two periods of harassment over a long period of time, it also involves harassment electronically and wide dissemination. 'This has had caused a great deal of distress for the complainant and possible impact on her work. 'We have decided that these two offences are serious enough to sentence you to a community order.' Dunford, dressed in a black jacket, a multi-coloured scarf, and black trousers, was given a 12 month community order and told to do 120 hours of unpaid work. Ms Barron added: 'We also decided we are going to impose a restraining order, we feel it's a necessary precaution.' The pair had met in Ireland and then went on to work at the same branch of Gymbox in Holborn, central London but the six month relationship ended in October 2013. The personal trainer bombarded Ms Branco, from Rio de Janeiro, with calls, texts and emails, then tried to blackmail her - although the blackmail did not form part of the harassment charge. She estimated she was receiving at least 30 phone calls and 50 text messages a day from Dunford trying to get her to meet up with him. Giving evidence Ms Branco told magistrates: 'I went to Brazil for three months to get away from him. The day I got back - I don't know how he found out - he left me a voicemail screaming ""Are you back, are you back, are you back?"" 'He kept asking me to meet him, he said he had problems with drugs and needed my friendship to move on and go back to the gym and move on my life. I was getting 30 calls a day.' Brazilian model Amanda Branco (pictured left and right) says her ex-boyfriend bombarded her with messages and calls and even set up a fake escort profile of her and sent it to her mother and sister . She added: 'In February 2014 he said he found out I wasn't just a stripper, [he thought] I was an escort. 'He started blackmailing me, saying he wanted £5,000 for what I did to his life. I felt scared and then he started saying if you don't reply, wait and watch what is going to happen. 'He said you have until midnight and he gave me an address for a hotel just five minutes from my house.' Ms Branco told the court: 'He photoshopped a website saying I was an escort, he sent it to my mum and my sister.' Describing the harassment Doreen Bogle, prosecuting,said in one text message Dunford said: 'I think you need to go back to Brazil, you are hurting too many people here,' The fitness fanatic once said he spends more than £100,000 on his beauty regime, including £18,000 on clothes and £10,800 on his hair . Dunford had denied two charges of harassment without violence but was found guilty at an earlier hearing and today told to pay a £120 victim surcharge and £920 in costs. He's also banned from contacting Ms Branco . In another text he said: 'Police hate escorts, they're all druggies and liars.' Miss Bogle said Dunford had also emailed a friend called Alex, saying Branco was 'pure evil, she literally tried to ruin me.' He added: 'She's a disgrace, I'm going to make sure she's deported back to Brazil, I have Jack Tweedy's lawyer working for me.' He also posted a Facebook message 'referring to her as an escort, a prostitute, and a drug user,' said Ms Bogle. The World Beauty Fitness & Fashion World Championship contestant called police when Dunford arrived her flat demanding to be let in - claiming he wanted to collect his nutritional supplements. Dunford's career, which the court heard he has worked 'exceptionally hard' for 12 years for, has been left 'literally in tatters' - with only two fitness clients remaining. His barrister, Jess Ward, said Dunford took an overdose the day before he was found guilty of a charge of harassment last month. He suffered a seizure and was unable to talk because he had violently chewed the inside of his mouth during the convulsion. Dunford's (right) barrister said his life had been left 'literally in tatters' after the charges were brought against him by Ms Branco (left) and he is now living at home with his parents in Bedfordshire. Dunford was only discharged at 1am on 2 February, where he returned to his parents' house in Leighton Buzzard. In the meantime he has been convalescing with his father, who is a retired GP, and his mother, who is a nurse. Dunford had denied the charges but was ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge and £920 in costs. Magistrates also placed a restraining order on Dunford and ordered that he does not contact Ms Branco. He was told the order will remain in place until further order is made.","Matt Dunford bombarded Amanda Branco with 50 texts messages a day .

One day after graduation, Amelia was at her sister's house for a meal. 'Something just clicked', she says. 'A friend of mine had done Cambridge while we were students and it had worked really well for her so I thought I would give it a go' 'He said it out of concern really because he was worried that people would be mean to me if I put on too much weight. 'And him, and my sister, were really supportive and encouraging when I decided to lose weight.' She added: 'My sister is really slim and one day after I graduated I was at her house for a meal and something just clicked. 'A friend of mine had done Cambridge while we were students and it had worked really well for her so I thought I would give it a go.

"As Prime Minister David Cameron puts it, on St George’s Day  we should ‘celebrate everything it is to be English’. But what does it mean to be English? From the Romans, Saxons and Normans many hundreds of years ago to those from Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Philippines today, England has always been shaped by migration. To mark St George’s Day today, with a little help from WorldRemit, FEMAIL reveals the seemingly very English things that have actually been brought to England by people from abroad - and you may be surprised by the origins of your favourite things. Scroll down for video . Fish and chips has become a  British institution, as well as a national money-spinner, but it is actually believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian . FISH AND CHIPS . They're a British institution as well as a national money-spinner, but how much do we really know about fish and chips? For most of us, the classic combination of battered fish and chipped potatoes deep-fried in beef fat or vegetable oil is as English as the cup of tea that washes it down. But just as tea originates in India or China, fish and chips is partly Portuguese and partly Belgian. The British can take credit for uniting these two Continental imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1860, on the streets of the East End of London, 13-year-old Jewish boy called Joseph Malin had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips. Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house. It was Joseph's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in London - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop. Fried fish already had a long history in London. In a letter written at the end of the 18th Century, future American President Thomas Jefferson described eating 'fried fish in the Jewish fashion' on a visit to the capital. Battered fried fish had first arrived in London 200 years earlier with Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain. They brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as British as Sherlock Holmes. The actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia and was introduced to Brits by locals in the Indian state of Assam . By the 1830s, the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among London's poor. It was tasty, cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold. In 1846, a Jewish cookbook published in London included a recipe for fried fish. Eight years later, A Shilling Cookery For The People by French chef Alexis Soyer contained the first printed recipe for 'fried cooked potatoes'. The seal of respectability came when Victorian cook Eliza Acton, the forerunner of Mrs Beeton, suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste. No one knows exactly how and where chips first originated. The most popular story credits a poor Belgian housewife from the Meuse Valley with their invention. In the winter of 1680, the river froze. Unable to get hold of any fish for her family, she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead. POLO . Is anything more English than rubbing shoulders with the high-rollers at a polo match at the height of summer? The actual origins of the game are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in  Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia. The first-ever recorded polo tournament was way back in 600BC when the Turkomans beat the Persians in a match. The game of polo spread quickly across the eastern world and became popular among Indians, who were introduced to the sport by the early Mohammedan invaders in the 13th century. Did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Yet English plantation owners actually learned polo from locals in the Indian state of Assam in the 19th century. Later popularised by royalty, it became the sport of wealthy Englishmen. TEA . We all know the English love a good cuppa. A lot of people know that tea was first grown in China, which was then taken to India by the British. But did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Invented by tea merchant Thomas Sullivan in New York City in June 1908, they can now be found in virtually every one of Britain's  homes. But if it wasn't for a handful of confused Americans, the tea bag may never have made it into our cups at all. They came about only after Mr Sullivan, in an attempt to cut costs, sent samples of tea leaves to potential customers in small silk pouch-like purses. Unsure quite what to do with the strange little bag, the Americans dunked it into a cup of hot water. And so was born the tea bag. After complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine, Mr Sullivan developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today's tea bag design. But it was not until 1953, when British tea producer Tetley spotted the commercial potential of the bag, that it began to take off here. The firm now sells around 200million tea bags every week. PUBS . Long have the British population relished a pint in the local pub, but their creation is all thanks to the arrival of the Romans almost two thousand years ago. When they created the Roman road network, they opened little inns where a passer-by could enjoy a refreshing beverage en route to their destination. Originally called Tabernae, they began selling food and wine as well as ale. After the departure of the Romans, Alehouses began opening up all over the country. Saint George himself is thought to have been born in Syria during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD . ST GEORGE . Believe it or not, even Saint George himself is thought to have been born abroad during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD. Although historians have argued the Roman soldier's place of birth for over a century, it is believed that Saint George was born to a Greek Christian noble family in Syria. ENIGMA CODE . To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years - and one depicted in award-winning movie The Imitation Game starring Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch. But in 2012, the Polish Government launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. Poles claim that Polish code breakers in Warsaw were the first ones to break Germany’s Enigma code by understanding the mathematics, left. People from Liverpool, like the Rooneys, right, are often called 'Scousers', which is short for ‘Lobscouse’, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port . In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings. Seven years later, just before war broke out, the Poles handed over their knowledge of the Enigma codes, as well as Polish-built replicas of the machines, to British and French Intelligence officers near Warsaw. SCOUSERS . People from Liverpool are often called ‘Scousers’. The name is short for ‘Lobscouse’, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port.

"While sunseekers across Britain have been making the most of the clear skies recently to soak up some sunshine, the lack of clouds has also proved a bonus for stargazers in Scotland hoping to catch sight of shooting stars. This incredible image was captured above Pitcaple in Aberdeenshire yesterday as photographer Graeme Whipps picked up two meteors which were part of the Lyrid meteor shower. The annual celestial event has been observed for the last 2,700 years across the globe, but is most visible in the northern hemisphere, and is expected to peak tonight with between 10 and 20 meteors an hour.

The strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than five to 20 meteors an hour, but in 1982 Americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour. The Lyrids are created by debris from comet Thatcher, which takes about 415 years to orbit around the Sun, and appear to radiate outwards from a star known as Vega and the constellation Lyra in which it sits - which gives the meteors their name. Mr Whipps, a 50-year-old meteorologist, said: 'I was out photographing the sky and saw the meteor, which was amazing.' While the Lyrid shower has been known to produce up to 100 meteors sightings per hour, most years the peak, which occurs tonight, only produces between five and 20 per hour (the Lyrid shower pictured from space)","Lyrid meteor display is visible in skies across the globe every year in April, and has been observed for 2,700 years .

"The number of women in Britain becoming nuns is at a 25-year high. Figures from the Catholic Church show the number of women taking Holy Vows has trebled from 15 in 2009 to 45 last year. From a low of only seven in 2004, the figure has been rising for the past decade. Theodora Hawksley, 29, was until recently a post-doctoral researcher in theology at the University of Edinburgh. But at the beginning of the year she decided to become a nun. Figures from the Catholic Church show the number of women becoming nuns in Britain has trebled from 15 in 2009 to 45 last year. From a low of seven in 2004, the figure has been rising for the past decade (file image) She joined the Congregation of Jesus in January and is now living in their house in Willesden, North London, while taking the first steps towards making vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Miss Hawksley, from Hertfordshire, said: ‘In one sense, it is a bit like trying to explain to somebody why you are marrying the person you are. You can list their qualities, but in the end it is a relationship of love. ‘But on the other hand, I was drawn to it by wanting a greater freedom in being able to give myself to God and the world. 'I don’t have to worry now about practical things like making a career for myself. I’m free to go where I’m needed and meet people at the margins.’ She is not the only young woman choosing the religious life. According to Church figures, 14 of the 45 women who entered convents last year were aged 30 or under. The next moderator of the Free Church has claimed the Church of Scotland is ‘literally dying’ because of falling congregation numbers. The Rev David Robertson said the departure of ministers and ‘concerns’ over issues such as same-sex marriage are linked to a ‘theological and moral decline’ in the Kirk. The Dundee minister, who will become Moderator next month, made the remarks on his blog site The Wee Flea as the Church of Scotland prepares to hold the General Assembly 2015 in May. The Free Church has seen modest growth over six years, with about 13,000 people currently attending services. Mr Robertson said the Kirk is losing ‘around 16,000 members per year’. But the Church of Scotland yesterday hit back, saying it remains one of the country’s ‘largest and most robust organisations’. Miss Hawksley said: ‘There is another person in an order in London and she is 27 and we meet to chat. You are not on your own. It is an unusual life choice, but you are not the only one making it. There are plenty of people asking themselves the same questions.’ She admitted some of her friends were ‘a bit bewildered’, but most had been very supportive. Far from being trapped in traditional habits, Miss Hawksley said her order tends to dress down in T-shirts and jeans. Father Christopher Jamison, director of the National Office for Vocation of England and Wales, said: ‘There is a gap in the market for meaning in our culture. One of the ways women may find that meaning is through religious life.’ Sister Cathy Jones, religious life vocations promoter at the office, said: ‘We are never going to be at the place we were at 50 years ago, Catholic culture was at a very different place. ‘But the fact that more women are becoming nuns than in the past 25 years shows that as a generation we have turned a corner.’ Last year, BBC Northern Ireland political reporter Martina Purdy quit her 25-year career in journalism to become a nun. She said: ‘I know many people will not understand this decision. It is a decision I have not come to lightly, but it is one I make with love and great joy.’","Figures from the Catholic Church show more and more becoming nuns .

"NHS worker Stacey Tipler embezzled nearly £650,000 from a cancer hospital. Pictured during her trial at Southwark Crown Court last summer . An NHS worker who conned a hospital out of more than half a million pounds earmarked for life-saving cancer drugs has been ordered to pay back just £28,737. Stacey Tipler, 33, used her job to steal £642,000 from the Royal Marsden NHS Trust which she spent on designer shopping sprees, mortgage payments and her planned wedding. But she and partner Scott Chaplin, 34, who was the ringleader of the plot, were caught and both jailed last summer. At Southwark Crown Court today, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said Tipler had made £54,852 from the scheme. At the proceeds of crime hearing, he ordered her to repay £28,737.90 within six months or spend another 18 months in jail. She's already serving four years. Chaplin claimed he 'made nothing' from the scam but was ordered to repay £115,000 form the the £310,000 the judge said he made. Judge Leonard said: 'In my judgement it must have been the two people who received the majority of the proceeds of the fraud were this defendant and his Common Law wife Ms Tipler.' For several months after December 2011, she substituted account numbers of pharmaceutical firms who were due payment with the details of men recruited by her partner and the ringleader of the plot, 34-year-old Scott Chaplin. He was jailed for five-and-a-half years after being found guilty of the same offence and one count of conspiracy to money launder. Passing sentence in July last year, Judge Leonard said that while Chaplin from Carshalton in Surrey was the 'main instigator', Tipler was 'invaluable' to the scam, which he said could have been 'catastrophic' for the hospital's patients. He told her: 'It could only have been you who could have come up with the sophisticated and ingenious methods to ensure that your fraud went undetected. 'I am satisfied that it was not you who had the idea to defraud the hospital. It is my judgment that on your own this fraud would not have been committed. 'That said, once the idea was there, the position of trust you held made you invaluable in achieving the fraud. 'The skill which you showed in trying to ensure the fraud would go undiscovered was very great and very dishonest. It was a very clever but dishonest fraud.' The Judge accepted that the crime was hatched by Scott Chaplin, 34, right, but said the position of trust Tipler held was invaluable in the fraud. Pictured outside Southwark Crown Court during trial last summer . Some of the money taken from the hospital was recovered but it was left £310,000 out of pocket. It was also ordered that part of the money Tipler is to pay back go towards compensating the hospital. The Royal Marsden is a prominent hospital for cancer care, with past patients including the reality TV star Jade Goody and the actress Susannah York. Later Chaplin, dressed in a short-sleeved blue and white striped shirt, stepped into the witness box and insisted he 'didn't make nothing' from the hospital fraud. Judge Leonard said: 'The defendant maintains that he received nothing from the fraud that required his wife to act, as the jury found, to act fraudulently in her role as an accountant for the Royal Marsden Hospital. 'Tipler's defence was that she acted under duress and that was rejected by the jury and indeed I reject it too.' Royal Marsden Hospital, a specialist in cancer care. It's one of the places that benefitted from cancer drugs that the funds Tipler stole were intended to pay for. The trust was left £310,000 out of pocket by the scam . He added that the couple must have seen the majority of the proceeds. Judge Leonard refused to accept his account and ordered him to repay £115,000 from the £310,857 he defrauded within six months or face two more years in jail. Money of varying amounts was passed to the accounts of Adrian Horan, 43, Clinton Woollery, 36, Thomas Quinlan, 27, Russell Baker, 33, and William Flynn, 38. Woollery was ordered to repay just £3,062 despite netting £59,525 from the scam. He will face just six weeks in jail if he does not pay the money within four months. Fourth defendant Flynn will return to Southwark Crown Court at a later date for his hearing. Tipler and Chaplin were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and Horan pleaded guilty to the same charge.

"Honesty is key in any relationship – but almost half of us lie to our partners about our finances, a study has revealed. Forty-five per cent of Britons have lied about their earnings, spending, bills or credit cards. And 41 per cent said they were in the dark about their partner's finances. Around one in five have lied to a partner about what they earn, with 10 per cent of those surveyed having understated their salary, four per cent having overstated it and another four per cent admitting to lying in both ways. The survey by financial guide Money Advice Service found 45 per cent of Brion have lied about their earnings, spending and credit cars, and 41 per cent of people surveyed din't know how much their partner earned . Of those who downplayed their wages, the main reason was to spare the feelings of a partner who earned less. However some said they lied to make sure their partner was with them for the right reasons – and not because of their bank account. The majority of insecure workers who exaggerated their salary to a partner because they didn't think they would stand a chance otherwise. Not wanting a partner to think they earned more came in second. The research by financial guide Money Advice Service also found that 24 per cent lied to their partners about what they spend on themselves. For women clothes were the biggest reason for lying, with 66 per cent fibbing about the cost of their wardrobe, while for men, technology purchases had caused 27 per cent to lie. The main reason for lying, the survey found, was to spare the feelings of a partner who earned less . Of the women who lied about how much they spend on themselves, two-thirds weren't honest with their partners about how much they spent on clothes and shoes. One in four men lied about technology purchases . Nick Hill, from Money Advice Service, says: 'For many couples, honesty is key to their relationship, but our research shows that many people hide the truth from their other half. 'Some people are comfortable telling their partner the truth about their finances, while others opt to hide their income or spending in order to avoid having a difficult conversation. 'The important thing to take away from this research is that money should not be a taboo subject within a relationship. 'It is vital to know where you stand in order to protect your finances both during a relationship and when coming out of one and you'll feel much more positive, open and honest about your relationship as a result.'","Poll found 45 per cent of Briton lied about their spending to their partner .

"The reserve deputy who shot a suspect dead after firing his gun instead of his Taser was investigated in 2009 over his questionable training and erratic behavior in the field. Robert Bates, 73, appeared in Tulsa district court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter over the death of Eric Harris, who was killed during a botched sting on April 2. Since the incident there have been allegations Bates was not properly trained and it is now emerged that when previously confronted by other deputies over his behavior, he told them he could do whatever he wanted. Scroll down for video . Heading to court: Robert Bates, left, is seen walking to court on Tuesday morning with his attorney Corbin Brewster, right, before he entered his not-guilty plea in the death of Eric Harris earlier this month . 'Mistake': The 73-year-old reserve deputy claims he mistakenly pulled out his gun instead of his Taser and shot dead the man as he fled the scene of an undercover operation on April 2 . In 2009, the Tulsa Sheriff's Office concluded after an internal investigation that Bates had received special treatment during training and while working as a reserve deputy, CBS News reports. The investigation found that other deputies raised concerns about Bates' behavior in the field, almost from the start of his tenure. He was said to have used his personal car while on duty and made unauthorized vehicle stops. The inquiry came to the conclusion that high-ranking officers created an atmosphere where employees were intimidated about reporting violations of department policy. Dan Smolen, the attorney for Eric Harris, claimed that if the investigation's findings had been acted on in 2009 Harris might still be alive. He told CBS News: 'I think there are so many people who look on at so much corruption it's more than just a couple of people.' Charged: Bates (left in his mug shot) shot Harris (pictured right) and faces four years in prison if convicted . A spokesman for the Tulsa Sheriff acknowledged that some type of internal review was conducted, but that there was no further action taken. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said this week he believes that Bates received his required training. Bates, a Tulsa County volunteer, shot Harris, 44, after the man was confronted during an undercover gun-sale operation and ran past him. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after Harris. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the disturbing clip, which was released by the sheriff's office, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him! I'm sorry.' The fatally-wounded father can be heard saying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' Earlier this week the Harris family expressed their anger after learning that retired insurance executive Bates, who is out on $25,000 bond, would be allowed to take a month-long vacation to the Bahamas. A statement released by the family read: 'Whether intended or not, Mr. Bates' vacationing in the Bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and Eric's life,' they said. Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' 'At a time when we are still mourning the death of a loved one that he shot down in the street, Mr. Bates will be relaxing and enjoying his wealth and privilege.' It is not clear when he is leaving for the holiday but Bates will next appear in court on July 2. He has previously visited the Bahamas with the sheriff, Stanley Glanz, and another reserve deputy and paid for part of Glanz's trip. In separate news conferences on Monday, the county sheriff and lawyers for Harris' family disagreed on whether the reserve officer should have been allowed to conduct police work. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Bates, his long-time insurance agent and former campaign manager, had been properly trained and passed annual firearms certifications required by the state. Dan Smolen, the lawyer for Harris' family, said the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office violated a number of its internal policies by letting Bates carry his personal handgun after training with another weapon. Smolen also said the department failed to keep a permanent record of Bates' training, in violation of local policies. Records Bates released during the weekend showed that the volunteer officer was trained on a .45, not the weapon used in Harris' death. Bates, who sold his insurance business for $6 million in 1999, was trained to be a Tulsa Police Department patrolman in 1964 but left in 1965. He was out of law enforcement for 35 years, returning for volunteer work in Florida in 2000 before joining the Tulsa County force in 2008 and making a number of donations to the agency. He also was Glanz's campaign manager during the 2012 election. Anger: Harris' son Aidan Fraley (pictured right with his uncle Andre Harris a week after his father's death), has said the police officers who allowed Bates to become a cop should be held accountable for his death . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . During an appearance on the Today show last week, he apologized to Harris' family. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' He also insisted that, despite keeping his gun and Taser on different parts of his uniform, it was easy to confuse the two. 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates said. 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, 'I don't understand how this can happen'. You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' Harris' son responded by saying that the volunteer deputy was too old to be on the police force. 'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad,' Aidan Fraley said, NBC reported.

"South Yorkshire Police missed 'intelligence and investigative opportunities' to tackle child sex exploitation in Rotherham, a report has found. A host of failings left gangs  free to rape, traffic and sexually abuse at least 1,400 children  in the town between 1997 and 2013, an inquiry by the National Crime Agency (NCA) concluded. The NCA said the police force did not use 'alternative strategies' to protect victims or gather evidence, and failed to work effectively with local licencing and community safety officers. South Yorkshire Police missed 'intelligence and investigative opportunities' to tackle child sex exploitation in Rotherham, pictured, a report has found. At least 1,400 children were abused in the town over 16 years . The review was launched last December in the wake of the damning Jay report, which exposed widespread failures of the council, police and social services in tackling child sex exploitation. The controversy that followed the publication of the report led to Rotherham council leader Roger Stone leaving his post. The most high profile resignation was that of South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright, who was the Rotherham councillor overseeing children's services between 2005 and 2010. The NCA review examined three current South Yorkshire Police investigations into child sex exploitation. 'Over the years, intelligence and investigative opportunities in relation to child sexual exploitation have been overlooked by South Yorkshire Police,' it stated. It added that the officers working on Operations Clover, Monroe and Mark are 'conscientious, enthusiastic and focused upon providing good outcomes'. The report acknowledged that the force had begun to make progress in protecting vulnerable children, but set out 48 recommendations of areas that need further improvement. Among them were record keeping, additional investigative opportunities, and engagement with victims. NCA director Trevor Pearce said: 'A review of these three investigations has identified improvements that need to be made at both strategic and operational level. 'Many of the issues identified by the review team have already been addressed by the force or work is in hand to do so. 'South Yorkshire Police has already made a number of arrests in relation to these matters and other offenders who believe that their past actions will never catch up with them should think again.' The NCA will now take over Operation Mark, deeming it to be 'not as developed' as the other two. Operations Monroe and Clover which will remain under police command on a day-to-day basis. Operation Mark will be integrated into the agency's Operation Stovewood, which will look at historic sex abuse cases in the South Yorkshire town. In light of its findings, the NCA will now also expand their investigation to include three further police operations, with the aim of bringing more offenders to justice. File image . In light of its findings, the NCA will now also expand their investigation to include three further police operations, with the aim of bringing more offenders to justice. Two of the investigations into child sex exploitation did not result in any cases being brought to court. South Yorkshire Police Chief Constable David Crompton has accepted the findings of the review. He said: 'The independent review of three South Yorkshire Police investigations into non-recent allegations of child sexual exploitation was something I requested as part of the NCA's investigation to ensure transparency and openness. 'The review found that the force had made a number of improvements and that staff working on the investigations were conscientious and focused and that strategic leadership was professional and appropriate. 'This highlights the significant progress the force has made in protecting vulnerable people and tackling child sexual exploitation. 'We have dedicated officers working tirelessly to support the victims and bring the offenders to justice and have made a number of arrests as part of these investigations. 'However, the NCA has made a number of recommendations for further improvements. 'We accept these recommendations and, as the NCA have recognised, the force has already addressed many of these and put steps in place to ensure other issues are dealt with in a timely manner.'

"Barefoot  Louis Tomlinson perches on the edge of a sofa as he appears to roll a joint in a shocking new picture obtained by Daily Mail Online and seen here for the first time today. The image which shows the One Direction member poised with the suspicious roll-up and sitting next to a plastic tub containing a dry, green weed-like substance and rolling paper was taken on Wednesday amid 48 hours during which Tomlinson has been seen partying hard. That same day Tomlinson, 23, was photographed returning to his London hotel in a disheveled state clutching a glass of water. Louis, newly single having split from long-term girlfriend Eleanor Calder, left London’s Cirque du Soir nightclub at 4am this morning and returned to his hotel in the company of five girls. Scroll down for video . After the party: Louis Tomlinson returns to his hotel in London's Soho yesterday, after partying. It appears to be after the pictures were taken . In today’s new picture, apparently taken in London  during this two-day party session, Tomlinson appears to be smiling as he balances a magazine on his lap, smiling distractedly at a girl by his side as he prepares the suspicious cigarette. It is the latest blow to the boy band just one month after Zayn Malik announced his decision to quit the band. Shortly before his announcement it had emerged that Zayn, 22, and Louis were being forced to post bonds worth close to $12,000 to be allowed into the Philippines where they were due to play a concert in Manila. The money was to be forfeited if either were caught using illegal drugs while there. And today’s picture comes in the wake of a video filmed last April where the pair were seen joking about drugs as they appeared to share a joint during the Latin American Leg of their 2014 stadium tour. The explosive video obtained by Daily Mail Online last May sent shock waves through One Direction’s young fan base. 'Happy days': What Louis Tomlinson was heard saying as Zayn Malik smoked what appeared to be marijuana as the band was ferried to a stadium in Lima, the capital of Peru, for a concert . Still partying: Louis Tomlinson heading for a night on the town in London yesterday . Crowd in: One Direction star Louis Tomlinson leaves London's Cirque Du Soir with five girls, who went back with him to his hotel in Soho . Louis could be heard narrating from behind the camera as he filmed his bandmate on their way to a One Direction concert in Lima, Peru. At one point he announced: ‘So here we are, leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days!’ Fellow band members Harry Styles, Liam Payn and Niall Horan were not present as, during the 15 minute journey in a smoke filled SUV, Louis, from Doncaster, and Zayn, from Bradford, joked with each other and three members of their crew who are travelling with them. A member of the team asked about the filming: ‘Are we allowed to talk contraband in this?’ Louis replied: ‘Yes, that’s what it is about.’ Current line-up: The four-member version of One Direction performs in South Africa last month after the departure of Zayn Malik to pursue a solo career . The way they were: Clean-cut One Direction - from left Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne . Adopting a faux serious tone as he focused on Zayn who sat beside him wearing jeans and a Bob Marley T-shirt, Louis said: ‘Zayn takes his job very seriously. He makes sure he goes through a two hour intense warm-up before every show. Just to get himself in the zone for the show. ‘One very, very important factor of Zayn’s warm up of course is Mary J herself. IN fact I will present it to him now for some fantastic singing.’ The band faced heavy criticism after the video leak with thousands of fans dumping tickets to their shows. Liam Payne tweeted an apology saying, ‘I love my boys and maybe things have gone a little sideways. I apologize for that.’ He added: ‘We are only in our 20s and we all do stupid things at this age.’ Daily Mail Online has approached the band's spokesman for comment.","Photograph taken of 23-year-old boy band star partying in London .

"Photographers have captured some remarkable pictures of the Lyrid meteor shower above the UK last night. The meteor shower, visible around the world but best seen from Europe, has been observed for the past 2,700 years and peaked overnight with between ten and 20 an hour. And the cosmic show will continue on into Saturday, so it is still possible to catch a glimpse of some meteors if you didn't last night. Scroll down for video explanation . John Phelan took this picture, showing the Lyrid  meteor  at Porthcurno Beach in Cornwall in the early hours of this morning . Nick Watson, a semi-professional photographer from Newcastle, captured an amazing picture of the meteor over Lindisfarne Castle on Holy Island in Northumberland. He took his photo around 1am BST this morning and incredibly managed to get the colourful Northern Lights in the picture too. 'It was an amazing display and I saw quite a few shooting stars. It was the first time I had seen the Lyrid meteor shower and I'm really pleased to have got a shooting star on camera,' said Nick. The Lyrids are so-called because they occur in the constellation Lyra. Amateur photographer and astronomer Stephen Cheatley also took a photo of the meteor at the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire. He spent around one-and-a-half hours watching the meteor and managed to get his incredible picture at around midnight. 'I was very lucky to capture that particular meteor as it was extremely bright,' he said. John Phelan also took a series of meteor shots at Porthcurno Beach in Cornwall in the early hours of this morning as the sun was rising. This picture by Stephen Cheatley shows the Lyrid meteor at the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire on the early hours of 23 April. Photographers captured some remarkable pictures of the Lyrid meteor shower above the UK last night . Here a Lyrid meteor is seen by by Lindisfarne Castle on Holy Island in Northumberland, as captured by Nick Watson. He took his photo around 1am this morning and incredibly managed to get the colourful Northern Lights in the picture too . Gemma Lavender, All About Space magazine: . 'The Lyrid meteor shower - while not as strong as the Quadrantids, which were visible earlier on in the year - are still a worthwhile meteor shower to watch especially since it can offer up a sudden burst in meteor rate. 'In general, the Lyrids usually peak at ten meteors per hour but one of these unpredictable bursts could mean that you’ll see anywhere up to 100 meteors per hour. 'These sudden bursts are fairly unpredictable, so you really need to wait and see if this shower will offer up any surprises this year! 'The Lyrids are active through to 25 April, although activity would have weakened by then, but it is possible to catch stray meteors over the next few nights. 'Comet Thatcher (C/1861 G1) is the source of the Lyrid meteors. 'Earth crosses the orbital path of the comet and bits of rock and ice that Thatcher sheds smash into our planet’s upper atmosphere at around 110,000 mph (177,000 km/h). 'Those ""shooting stars"" that you see are debris being vaporised.' This picture by John Phelan shows the Lyrid  meteor  at Porthcurno Beach in Cornwall in the early hours of this morning . Another picture by John Phelan shows Lyrid  meteors at Porthcurno Beach in Cornwall . The strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than five to 20 meteors an hour. But in 1982 Americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour. This year was particularly good for the Lyrids as the moon was a waxing crescent and wasn't in the way. The Lyrids occur when Earth passes through debris left by Comet Thatcher, which orbits the solar system every 415 years. The meteors are sand-like particles and leave luminous streaks across the sky as they burn up in the atmosphere. They are most active in the night sky between April 16 and 25, peaking this week. The meteor shower is visible around the world but best seen from Europe. Several meteors are visible here . This year was particularly good for the Lyrids as the moon was a waxing crescent and wasn't in the way . Graeme Whipps captured this stunning picture of the Lyrid meteor shower  above Pitcaple in Aberdeenshire last night. 'I was out photographing the sky and saw the meteor, which was amazing,' said Mr Whipps, 50, who works as a meteorologist . Chris Burton, meteorologist with forecasting service The Weather Network, said: 'With high pressure dominating the weather this week, much of the [UK] has seen clear skies, providing perfect viewing conditions for the meteor shower.' Dr Radmila Topalovic, an astronomer from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in London, added: 'The best place to see the Lyrids is to find an open field where you can see the whole of the night sky. The best time is a few hours after midnight where you can expect to see most of the bright streaks in the early hours of the morning. 'Scan the sky over the course of the night as the meteors can pop out from any direction.'","Photographers in the UK captured the Lyrid meteor shower in the sky last night .

"A teacher was suspended on paid leave on Monday after he allegedly told his 11-year-old students that he raped his first wife. The teacher, who had not been named, was teaching the fifth grade at Hawthorne Elementary in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he made the chilling remark around a week ago. Some students were so distressed by what they heard, that they immediately went to the school office to report the teacher, ABC7 reported. A male teacher reportedly told his fifth grade at Hawthorne Elementary in Albuquerque, New Mexico (pictured) that he raped his first wife . Mother Margie Brooks, whose son was in the class, told the local station that she was horrified by what the teacher told the students and felt the school waited too long to deal with the problem. She said: 'The minute that allegation was made by these kids I would have done something about it.' Daily Mail Online was awaiting comment from the elementary school on Thursday. A spokesperson for Albuquerque Public Schools (APS) confirmed that a fifth-grade teacher, who had been full-time employee at the school since January, was suspended on paid leave on Monday. An internal investigation was taking place into the alleged employee misconduct with the APS police department. The teacher has worked in the school district since August last year. He subbed as a special education teacher at Taft Middle School in August. He then worked at Hayes Middle School as a maths and science teacher from October to January.

"Candlestick Park is no more. The iconic sports field, completed in 1960 and home to first the San Francisco Giants and later the San Francisco 49ers, has been torn down to make way for houses, a hotel and a shopping center. And in 55 years there was a lot of wind and a whole lot of fog, but there were also some remarkable moments thanks to the one of the greatest to every play football, the music of The Beatles, and one incredibly ill-times natural disaster. Scroll down for video . Candlestick park, which has been home to the San Francisco Giants and San Francisco 49ers, has been torn down . The area is now set to become houses, a hotel and a shopping center . Members of the Oakland A's and San Francisco Giants gather on the field with their families and security personnel after an earthquake struck prior to game three of the World Series on October 17, 1989 . Joe Montana (above in 1989) led the 49ers to four Super Bowls while playing at Candlestick . While Candlestick began as the home of the Giants, it also became home to the 49ers beginning in 1971. It had previously served as the home field for the Oakland Raiders for part of the 1960 and all of the 1961 season, but it was the 49ers who truly made their mark. And in their 43 seasons at candlestick, no player was bigger to the organization than Joe Montana, who would ultimately lead the team to four Super Bowl victories, a quarterback record that is shared by only Terry Bradshaw and, very recently, Tom Brady. And while Candlestick never saw an actual Super Bowl, it did get to host eight NFC Championship games. Montana was of course not the only great to grace the field, with Jerry Rice, Steve Young, Ronnie Lott, and Terrell Owens just a few of the other esteemed 49ers to play at Candlestick.

As for baseball, two World Series were played at Candlestick, in 1962 and 1989, with the Giants losing to the New York Yankees and Oakland raiders respectively. The 1989 World Series went down in history however when during Game 3 a massive earthquake, which measured 7.1 on the Richter Scale, occurred shortly before play began. It was later said that the design of the stadium saved the thousands of fans who had turned out for the game. The Giants left however at the end of the 1999 season, and the 49ers after 2013, and the last appearance at the park came not from an athlete, but a musician.

"Untrained home carers are putting the elderly and disabled ‘at risk of serious harm’ while giving medication, performing intimate procedures and looking after patients with dementia, warns a survey today. Care staff say they are increasingly being asked to perform tasks previously only carried out by nurses. These include changing catheter and colostomy bags, feeding through a tube and even administering morphine. 'Frankly terrifying': Care staff (not pictured, file image) say they are increasingly being asked to perform tasks previously only carried out by nurses. These include changing colostomy bags and administering morphine . The worrying conclusions come in a survey of 1,000 workers employed by councils and private firms by trade union Unison. Almost a quarter – 24 per cent –giving medication such as morphine and insulin had received no training while 27 per cent said they were not trained in working with dementia patients. More than three-quarters asked for more training to cope with the extra procedures but only 49 per cent had received any. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ‘The idea that untrained care workers are administering drugs like morphine is frankly terrifying. ‘It is no exaggeration to say that frail older people are being put at risk of serious harm or worse.’ George McNamara, of the Alzheimer’s Society, added: ‘Two-thirds of people with dementia live in the community and it is a disgrace that these people are being let down so profoundly. Survey findings: Almost a quarter giving medication such as morphine or insulin had received no training . ‘It can also have devastating consequences if care workers don’t have enough training to be able to appropriately communicate – with people with dementia often ending up in hospital as a result.’ Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said: ‘This is further evidence of how our care system is in crisis.’ Other findings include that more than half of home carers have not been shown how to care for people with colostomy bags and 45 per cent have not been trained to change a catheter bag. Nearly four in ten had not been shown how to carry out peg feeding, where food is inserted directly into the stomach via a tube. One female home care worker in south-east England said: ‘I see clients with dementia despite having never had any training. ‘When administering medicine, you often have to phone the office to ask what to do.’ A Midlands-based male worker reported: ‘I’ve been a care worker for almost 20 years and received formal qualifications working for other companies in the past. ‘Now, there are people who have never been trained. ‘They are just sent out with another carer to show them how things are done.’ Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: ‘If homecare workers aren’t receiving adequate training, there could be fatal consequences.’ The UK Homecare Association, which represents firms running services for councils, admits workers are ‘often called upon to undertake roles previously undertaken by registered nurses’. It blames spending cuts, forcing its members to do more with less money. A spokesman said it had ‘repeatedly drawn attention to the risks posed by a grossly-under-funded care system’. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, declined to comment.","Care staff 'increasingly being asked to perform tasks nurses used to do'

"A couple have transformed a 600-year-old castle they bought for £65,000 into a luxurious home worth £700,000. Janet and John Brennan have spent eight years and hundreds of thousands of pounds turning Barholm Castle, in Dumfries and Galloway, from a ruin into a stylish castle home. They bought the 15th Century fort, reputed to have been used by leader of the Scottish Protestant Reformation John Knox as a hiding place, for just £65,000. Barnholm Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, which has gone on the market for £695,000 after being transformed from old ruins . John and Janet Brennan (right) bought Barnholm Castle (left) for just £65,000 in 1997 and have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renovating it . But now it is on the market for offers over £695,000 even though at that price the couple will lose a six-figure sum. However, despite that, Janet, 60, and John, 64, insist the project was a 'labour of love' and they have 'no regrets'. The Brennans first stumbled upon the castle near Gatehouse of Fleet - once home to a branch of the powerful McCulloch clan - in 1997 when it was just a shell of crumbling stone walls. It took two years to complete the purchase, four years to get planning permission and three years of restoration. The castle's large living area, pictured, was formerly the great hall in the fortress, which is thought to have once housed Scottish minister John Knox . Barnholm Castle's great vault is now the luxury home's kitchen, which is big enough for a dining table and all modern appliances . One of the four bedrooms in the £700,000 property. The Brennan's bought the fortress in 1997 and spent four years getting planning permission and two years carrying out the renovation . Even though the property is on the market for £695,000, the couple have spent hundreds of thousands restoring the castle meaning they will actually incur a loss . The grade A-listed building was lovingly transformed into a stunning home while staying true to its historical roots. Mrs Brennan, the chairwoman of the Scottish Castles Association, admitted: 'The restoration cost more than the asking price but it was a labour of love - we were not doing it for profit. 'We've no regrets. Other people take up golf and they buy boats. We bought a castle.' The retired university lecturer added: 'It was a massive project.

It took two years to fully restore the castle after planning permission was granted. It also has stunning sea views over Wigtown Bay . A decorator paints the ceiling during the castle's restoration. Mrs Brennan says the newly refurbished property would be a fabulous holiday home . 'We were driving and saw a sign on the road saying castle for sale. 'When we drove up the narrow, winding track and saw it we fell in love with it. It was love at first sight. 'We were always interested in castles and visited them over the years. But it was a spur of the moment decision. 'We saved it. It was described as being in a precarious condition.' The castle now has rooms over four floors as well as stunning sea views over Wigtown Bay. The ground floor vaulted chamber has been converted into a kitchen while the great hall has been transformed into a large living space. Four bedrooms are found on the upper floors, including one said to have been used to shelter John Knox.

She described the restoration project as a labour of love . Meanwhile a staircase in the turret leads to upper cap house chamber, with a door to the roof parapet. Mrs Brennan, who has written a book on the subject of restoring castle, added: 'It's an enjoyable experience living in the house. 'It's not that we're selling because we want to leave it - we want to be closer to family. 'I think it would make a fabulous holiday home for someone with deep pockets. 'Or a home for a retired couple who want to live somewhere really special.' John Knox was a Scottish clergyman, who was the leader of the Protestant Reformation in Scotland and often considered the founder of the Presbyterian denomination. He was a Catholic deacon and priest but first joined the movement to reform the Scottish church in the early 1500s. He then went on to teach a number of sons of Protestants who had been captured in St Andrews Castle and called on Knox to become their minister. It was at this time that he is believed to have used Barholm as a place of refuge. In 1547 he was captured by the French, who attacked St Andrews Castle and was kept as a prisoner for over a year. On his release, he travelled to London, where he continued to attack the Roman Catholic faith but left the UK again in 1553 when Mary I became Queen. When he returned to Scotland, he realised how much the teaching of the Reformers was spreading. He then became one of the most well-known preachers in Scotland, with the Scottish Reformation taking place n 1560. Knox is credited with helping to write the Scots Confession of Faith, one of the first formal documents of the Church of Scotland.","Janet and John Brennan bought a crumbling Barholm Castle in Dumfries and Galloway for just £65,000 in 1997 .

"Lawyers for the parents of Michael Brown, the unarmed, black 18-year-old who was fatally shot by a white police officer in a St. Louis suburb, announced Wednesday night that they planned to file a civil lawsuit the following day against the city of Ferguson. Attorneys for the family said in a statement Wednesday night that the wrongful death lawsuit would be filed Thursday. The lawsuit had been expected. Attorneys for Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and his father, Michael Brown Sr., announced at a press conference in early March that a wrongful death lawsuit would be filed 'soon.' Scroll down for video . Plans: Lawyers for the parents of Michael Brown announced Wednesday night that they planned to file a civil lawsuit the following day against the city of Ferguson . Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, in a St. Louis suburb in August 2014. Wilson resigned in November . Attorneys said at the time that the lawsuit would also name former Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Brown. The statement Wednesday did not mention Brown, and a spokesman for the law firm said he could not provide any additional information about the lawsuit. Brown's shooting led to sometimes-violent protests and spawned a national 'Black Lives Matter' movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities. A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November.

"The Wikipedia official who accused Grant Shapps of doctoring his own online biography was exposed yesterday as a former Liberal Democrat member. The Tory party chairman had been accused this week of using an anonymous user ID to delete embarrassing facts about his past and add unflattering details about his political rivals. But yesterday it emerged that the senior Wikipedia administrator who investigated the allegations - following a tip-off from the left-wing Guardian - was a former Lib-Dem member. Richard Symonds, 29, who goes by the online name 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry', is one of the UK's top administrators for the website. He once described himself as 'Liberal Democrat to the last'. Scroll down for video . Volunteer: Richard Symonds, who joined the Wikipedia project in 2004, says he was not being political . Mr Symonds decided to block a user called 'Contribsx' on Tuesday after concluding the account was probably operated either by Mr Shapps or under his 'clear direction'. Mr Shapps angrily denied the claims, insisting the story was 'untrue from start to finish'. Mr Symonds' decision was also criticised by other Wikipedia activists, who warned that the site should not be used to 'play politics' and referred the case to an internal arbitration committee. One user wrote: 'I don't know if 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry' did anything wrong but it's just rather obscure, and doing this during the peak campaign time for the UK 2015 elections as some sort of assignment from a journalist seems odd.' Mr Symonds, from Bow, East London, described himself on Twitter as 'Liberal Democrat (to the last)' before deleting his profile yesterday. He joined other party members who signed a letter to The Guardian in January last year calling for Lord Rennard to have the Lib-Dem whip withdrawn over his refusal to apologise for making unwanted advances to female activists. The internet expert, who has served in the Royal Naval Reserve, has been a Wikipedia volunteer since 2004 and became an administrator for the website in 2007. He is also a paid employee of Wikimedia UK, a charity which promotes the volunteer-written encyclopedia. Furious denials: Grant Shapps yesterday continued to deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes . Among his Facebook friends is Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who married Tony Blair's former diary secretary Kate Garvey in 2012. He was once featured in a BBC profile that called him 'one of the UK's top Wikipedians' and reported that he spent up to eight hours a day working on the site. Responding to the criticism yesterday, Mr Symonds insisted he was not a Lib-Dem activist and said he would never let his political views interfere with his Wikipedia work. He added: 'I have never considered myself 'active' in any party, although I have been a lapsed member of the Lib Dems on and off, for probably a year in total since 2010.' Mr Symonds toned down his conclusions about Mr Shapps' possible connections to 'Contribsx', revisions to one of his Wikipedia pages show. At first he claimed the Tory chairman ran the account either directly or indirectly, but later he changed this to suggest simply that the account was run by a user called 'Hackneymarsh' who was linked to Mr Shapps' office by The Guardian in 2012. Mr Symonds admitted that Wikipedia's top officials had 'chastised' him for his handling of the case, although he refused to back down yesterday. He said: 'While a link has clearly been drawn between Hackneymarsh and Contribsx, it is impossible to know who was sitting behind the keyboard of Contribsx. 'But given the nature of edits, I suspect that it was Mr Shapps or someone close to him.' The Liberal Democrats used the claims to poke fun at the Tory chairman when the story broke on Tuesday night, and senior figures in the party continued mocking him yesterday. Lib-Dem leader Nick Clegg said he believed the denials but then joked that the person behind the account could have been 'Michael Green', the pseudonym used by Mr Shapps to promote get-rich-quick schemes before he became an MP. A Lib-Dem spokesman said Mr Symonds had 'no connection to Lib Dem HQ'. 'The first time we saw this story was in the Guardian, and the first time we know about him was when we were asked about him this afternoon,' he added. Minister Justine Greening, left, and Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby, right, were among those mentioned in the Wikipedia edits . Mr Shapps yesterday continued to furiously deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes, and Tory cabinet ministers rallied behind him. He said: 'It's categorically untrue. It's absolutely nothing to do with me. It's just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.' David Cameron came to his defence, insisting the Welwyn Hatfield MP was doing a 'great job'. Wikimedia UK spokesman Stevie Benton said to the best of his knowledge Mr Symonds did not brief the Liberal Democrats about his actions. 'I would be incredibly surprised if he had done and would say it's out of character,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'I've worked with Richard for three and a half years and his politics have never entered into anything in that time.' The Guardian rejected criticism that its story did not made it plain that it had prompted the Wikipedia inquiry into alleged links between 'Contribsx' and Mr Shapps. A spokeswoman for the paper said: 'The article clearly states that this was a Guardian investigation which brought to light some potential breaches of Wikipedia's own rules, which were then communicated to the site's administrators.' Unite leader Len McCluskey has become embroiled in a claim against his trade union for bullying and sexual harassment. As part of a constructive dismissal claim under investigation by an employment tribunal, former union official Sally Nailard has accused the Unite general secretary of calling her a ‘scab’. The 50-year-old former regional officer based at Heathrow is seeking undisclosed compensation. The case lifts the lid on alleged ‘discrimination, misogyny and bullying’ at the hard-Left union. The chairman of the employment tribunal in Watford, Isabel Manley, described the case as a ‘sad and sorry tale’. More than half of Labour candidates in its 106 target seats are linked to Unite. Mr McCluskey is one of several union officials cited in Miss Nailard’s claim. She resigned from her £47,000 position last August, following an alleged 18-month campaign of bullying and harassment. Her evidence submitted to the tribunal, seen by the Independent, relates to a copy of an interview she gave to Sky News in 1997 after a cabin crew strike which she didn’t take part in. Her evidence states: ‘If I was such a “scab” as Len McCluskey later said, I would have volunteered to operate as crew over the strike.’ The tribunal continues.","Official who accused Mr Shapps of doctoring his profile a former Lib Dem .

"The Tories have accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from a businessman whose company duped thousands of families in a mis-selling scandal. Multi-millionaire Richard Harpin has given the Tories £375,000 since 2008 – including £50,000 in the first week of the election campaign, official records show. The revelation will raise fresh questions for David Cameron over his links to millionaire donors. Multi-millionaire Richard Harpin has given the Tories £375,000 since 2008 – including £50,000 in the first week of the election campaign . Mr Harpin is the chief executive of HomeServe – the maintenance firm which styles itself as the UK's 'fifth emergency service'. But the firm was handed a record £30million fine last year for selling families expensive home insurance cover using misleading information and hard sell tactics. The fine came on top of some £40million it is paying in refunds to thousands of wronged customers who took out the policies. Industry regulator the Financial Conduct Authority found customers were misled or bullied into taking out policies they did not need or did not cover all the problems claimed. The company – which claims it offers peace of mind to consumers who are worried about losing their boiler or water supply in the dead of winter – has three million customers in the UK, holding 7.5million policies. Tory donor Mr Harpin founded the company in 1993. The firm today employs over 2,500 people in the UK and nearly 4,000 globally and is the biggest employer in Walsall. HomeServe said the investigation was closed over a year ago, in February 2014, and related to mis-selling in the period prior to October 2011. A spokesperson said: 'Richard Harpin has been a supporter of the Conservative party for a number of years and his political donations are made in a personal capacity.' But Labour said the donation showed the Tories were out to support their wealthy friends. Jon Ashworth, Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: 'We all know that the Tories put the interests of their big money donors before those of hardworking families.' The Tories under David Cameron have  accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from a businessman whose company duped thousands of families in a mis-selling scandal . A Tory spokesman said: 'All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with Electoral Commission rules. 'Any suggestion of impropriety by the party is malicious and defamatory and will be treated as such.' The revelation comes just two days after the Tories were forced to return a donation of £50,000 from a wealthy hotelier who the American authorities once wanted to extradite to face tax fraud charges. Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of £20,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers. But it emerged that she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge. However on the same day in 2008 her husband Stanley Tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion. Mr Tollman repaid more than 100 million US dollars to America after the couple spent five years fighting off attempts to extradite Mrs Tollman from the UK over claims the South African couple had millions stashed in the Channel Islands. The Tollman's son, Brett, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2003 and was sentenced to more than two years in prison, as well as a $3.5 million penalty. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We were not aware of this issue but in light of these findings we will be returning donations from the Tollmans. Donations from the Tollmans were fully declared and in strict accordance with electoral law.' Since 2011, Mrs Tollman has donated more than £50,000 to the Conservatives.","EXCLUSIVE: Richard Harpin has given the Tories £375,000 since 2008 .

"Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.","A psychology expert has revealed that the stress of a visit to the store can cause serious friction between couples .

"While being white, blonde and an attractive Anglo-Saxon shouldn't ensue judgement, according to Ellie Laing, SBS news reporter, it does come with a barrage of unfair perceptions. In an article by The Australian written on Monday, Jim Carroll, the News and Current Affairs Director of SBS, was reported to be taking a more 'commercial' approach to the network by hiring 'good-looking, female, Anglo-Celtic' journalists. While Carroll denies  he is hiring based on these standards, many of the journalists hired since his appointment in 2013 have fit the above bill. 'Never mind the fact that I work damned hard': SBS reporter Ellie Laing has launched a scathing attack on an article in The Australian that suggested she and other journalists were hired for being young, white and female . Ellie Laing,  SBS news reporter who was hired by Carroll, has now hit back at claims she was hired for her beauty over her brains in an open letter to critics. 'When a compliment suggesting I might be, in some way “attractive,"" I’ll take it, with delight,' she wrote in an open letter circulated to several news outlets. 'What I won’t take is a suggestion that because I'm “attractive”, white and a woman it somehow detracts from the credibility and substance of the news service I work for.' Laing also wrote that despite a near decade of experience, hard work, established contacts and a regular six day week gig working as a journalism teacher at Macleay College on the side, none of this was taken into account. Diversity: The SBS was criticised for hiring young attractive reporters, with Sarah Abo one of the journalists mentioned in the article . 'In my case it didn't mention the near decade of experience I could bring to the newsroom after enjoying a long career across radio and TV at the ABC, Seven and Ten. Never mind the fact that I work damned hard.' The article also commented on the SBS content taking a more 'fluffy' lifestyle approach , which Laing shot back at by insisting  a need for an inclusion of the arts and a more balanced approach to hard news. Beyond the affront on her looks, credibility and the content, Laing made sure to clear up one thing  - she was hired for passion, not because she 'scrubs up alright.' Alyshia Gates is another of the SBS journalists whose position were questioned by The Australian . Finishing her letter with a fiery response for The Australian journalist behind the controversial article, Laing said: 'If he’d watched the bulletin a bit closer he would have seen I’ve changed my name to Ellie Laing (too). I got married late last year. And yes, on my wedding day, I looked the most “attractive” I've ever been.' While Laing stands by Carroll and claims that suggest the over importance her looks play, this article comes at the same week Karen Middleton,  SBS political correspondent announced her departure from the network. It's believed by insiders she didn't have the right 'profile' to fit Carroll's new criterion. Whether it's sexism based on attractiveness or unattractiveness, age or cultural background it could be said the head of network's values to be 'independent from external pressures to conform or favour' and 'provide a real multi cultural and contemporary Australia' are coming under question.","Ellie Laing spoke out against claims of being hired for looks alone .

"The baggage handler who caused an emergency landing when he woke up inside the cargo hold of an airborne flight has come forward for the first time to detail the frightening experience, but still won't explain how he fell asleep to begin with. Willa Junior sat down with ABC News for an interview, and says he was exhausted and dozed off while loading a plane at Seattle-Tacoma Airport on April 13 and woke up when a piece of luggage landed on his head.

Taking responsibility: Willa Junior is the Seattle-Tacoma baggage handler who fell asleep in the cargo hold of a plane earlier this month, and became trapped inside when the plane took off . Making headlines: Junior, who appears to be in his early 20s according to Facebook, sat down for an interview with ABC News to speak about the harrowing and embarrassing experience .

Above, a picture of Junior being rescued from the cargo hold after the plane was forced to turn around . Rude awakening: Junior woke up when a piece of luggage landed on him and then he called 911 - but his call cut out after just 44 seconds . Since it was pitch black inside the cargo hold, Junior was at first confused and disoriented but then quickly realized that the plane was moving. 'In my mind, I said, ""This is not happening. This is just a joke.""' Junior . His first move was to call his company, Menzies Aviation, which provides baggage services for airlines. But the person who answered the call at the office thought it was a prank call and just hung up. Desperately, Junior next called 911 and struggled to communicate to the dispatcher his unusual and unlikely situation. 'Hello, I'm trapped in this plane,' Junior tells the operator in audio released of the 911 call. 'You're where?' the dispatcher asks. 'I'm inside a plane.I feel like it's moving in the air. Flight 448. Can you please sent someone to stop it?' Junior says. Unfortunately the phone call cut out after 44 seconds and then Junior was on his own. That's when he started to lose hope, sending a text message to his mother saying he loved her, afraid he was going to die. Last words: Junior says he was scared he was going to die, so he sent a text message to his mother, saying he loved her. The area Junior was trapped in was pressurized and temperature controlled, so his life was never threatened . Help me! After his call to 911 cut out, Junior started banging on the ceiling of the cargo hold and passengers and crew heard, prompting the flight to turn around . Turn around: The pilot headed back to Seattle after just 14 minutes in the air. Junior says he is sorry for the passengers whose flight to Los Angeles he delayed . Luckily that was never the case since the cargo hold where Junior fell asleep is temperature controlled and pressurized, so he was never in danger of freezing or running out of oxygen. What saved Junior from being trapped on the flight for it's two and a half hour journey to Los Angeles was his decision to start banging on the roof of the cargo floor. 'I was yelling, ""Help me, somebody’s down here,""' he said. Junior's cries for help were so loud that passengers and crew members heard and the plane was turned around after just 14 minutes in the air. Junior is currently still employed at Menzies, but he has been permanently banned from working on Alaska Airlines flights - one of the biggest airlines that fly our of Sea-Tac Airport.

"A farmer who has constructed a rather suggestive hay bale structure, which is fully exposed out the front of his property, could face pornographic charges.

"Security researchers have discovered a way to intercept a person's fingerprints on a Samsung Galaxy S5 running Android 4.4 and older . Fingerprint scanners are often touted as the future of security and an alternative to the notoriously flawed password. But experts have discovered they may not be as secure as first thought after a number of Android devices, including Samsung's Galaxy S5, were said to be potentially 'leaking' fingerprints. The security researchers have found a way to intercept a person's biometric data after it is captured by a built-in scanner, but before it becomes encrypted. Tao Wei and Yulong Zhang from security firm FireEye are expected to discuss their findings at this week's RSA conference in San Francisco. The pair told Thomas Fox-Brewster from Forbes that the flaw lies in older versions of the Android operating system, up to and including Android 4.4. Subsequently, anyone running Android 5.0 or above are not at risk and the security experts are advising people on older models to update as soon as possible. The vulnerability means that a hacker can access the kernel, or core, of the Android operating system. Once inside they can monitor all data sent to and from the phone, as well as data recorded by the handset's built-in sensors, including the fingerprint scanner. Typically, when a fingerprint is scanned it is encrypted and separated from the rest of the device in a secure folder. Hackers can't get access to this folder even with access to the kernel, but they can collect scans immediately from the fingerprint sensor before they reach this folder. In addition to using these fingerprints to access the phone, for example, they can be used to make payments with PayPal. Scroll down for video . The flaw means that once a hacker has access they can monitor data recorded by built-in sensors, including the fingerprint scanner. When a fingerprint is scanned it is encrypted. Hackers typically can't access this encrypted file, but the flaw allows them to collect scans from the sensor before being encrypted . During tests, Mr Wei and Mr Zhang confirmed the flaw was present on Samsung Galaxy S5. They have not yet tested it on other Android smartphones with built-in fingerprint scanners, including the Galaxy Note 4, Note Edge and Huawei Ascend Mate 7. However, they believe the problem to be 'more widespread'  than the Galaxy S5 and are planning to put this to the test. FireEye's research isn't the first time the Samsung Galaxy S5's scanner has been exposed as vulnerable. In April last year a group of German hackers managed to spoof the scanner using a dummy print. Apple's TouchID isn't without flaws either. It took hackers just two days and a small collection of everyday household items to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an Apple iPhone 5S following its launch in 2013. Chaos Computer Club, based in Berlin, took a high-resolution photograph of a fingerprint from the side of a glass. They then scanned it, before laser printing it onto a transparent sheet and covering it in woodglue. Once the glue had dried, they peeled off the print copy and pressed it on the scanner. Mr Wei and Mr Zhang said they have alerted Samsung to the issue but not received an update. Samsung told MailOnline 'it takes consumer privacy and data security very seriously' and is currently investigating FireEye’s claims. Security expert Graham Cluely said: 'It's worth remembering that fingerprints are not secrets. 'Relying on your fingerprints to secure a device may be okay for casual security - but you shouldn't depend upon it if you have sensitive data you wish to protect.' This isn't the first time Samsung's S5 scanner has been exposed as vulnerable. In April last year a group of German hackers managed to spoof the scanner using a dummy print. This situation is made worse by the fact that once a password has been initially used to access PayPal and Samsung phones, the fingerprint can be continually used for access without re-entering the password - even if the phone is rebooted. Alternatively, on Apple phones a password is required following every reboot. That doesn't mean that Apple's TouchID scanner is without flaws. It took hackers just two days and a small collection of everyday household items to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an Apple iPhone 5S following its launch in 2013.

They then scanned it, before laser printing it onto a transparent sheet and covering it in woodglue. Once the glue had dried, they peeled off the print copy and pressed it on the scanner. Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble told MailOnline: 'This underpins the importance of security research. 'There’s no room for flaws in fingerprint ID systems now that mobile payments are becoming commonplace. In a survey we carried out, almost a third (31 per cent) of UK mobile users told us they want to wait until mobile payment technology is more advanced before trying it themselves and, with a step back like this, it may take even more time to assuage consumer fears over security and fraud.' Matt White, senior manager in KPMG's cyber security practice added: 'Replacing passwords with biometric alternatives such as fingerprints provides better security, however it doesn't completely eliminate the risk posed by cyber criminals. 'The largest hurdle with biometrics going forward will be the establishment of consumer trust. A fingerprint was photographed using 2400 dpi resolution. The image was inverted and laser printed onto a transparent sheet with a thick toner setting. Hackers then poured woodglue onto the print pattern, pictured top. After it dried, the sheet was lifted and pressed onto the sensor, pictured bottom, to unlock the phone . 'Trying to convince the average person to implant a piece of technology to increase security of their perceived already secure account is a battle unlikely to be won.' And Andy Kemshall, co-founder and technical director at SecurEnvoy said: 'Biometric authentication is not yet near the level it needs to be for the majority of consumer facing organisations to implement it in their products. 'Fingerprint scanning, eyeball scanning, voice and face recognition are all at least a decade away from being reliable enough to use as authentication methods. 'The technology simply isn't sophisticated enough.","Experts have discovered a flaw in older versions of the Android system .

"This video captures the dramatic struggle faced by villagers as they attempted to rescue an female elephant trapped in a treacherous muddy bog in southern China. The animal became stuck in the quagmire during the night and was lying on her side in a state of desperation when locals came across her and raised the alarm. Using only ropes and wooden poles, more than 20 villagers and police officers teamed together to free the wild Asian elephant  before she died of starvation, dehydration or exhaustion. Scroll down for video . Rescue mission: The elephant was discovered stuck in a muddy quagmire by villagers in rural southern China . Reporters could see the animal - report to be around 15 years old - trying to push itself up using its two front legs but the boggy ground kept if firmly stuck in place, reports People's Daily Online. Police were called to lead the rescue operation and officer Wang Xingtao got the villagers to help drain the swamp to prevent the elephant from drowning. He said: 'This area is very boggy without any solid ground. The quagmire the elephant was trapped in is only around one metre deep.' The police and forestry officials on the scene then got the villagers to fetch long wooden poles and ropes to use in the difficult extraction. An Asian elephant weighs four to five tons on average. Exhausted: The female animal was found lying on its side after becoming trapped in the middle of the night . After three hours  and without any heavy machinery their efforts were finally rewarded when the elephant was dragged out of the swamp. Veterinarian Bao Mengwei said: 'After an extended period of time struggling in the quagmire the elephant has some blood circulation problems as well as the tremendous stress that has been put on the heart and lungs of the animal. 'And without food for over a day it is temporarily unable to stand up.' Rescuers quickly administered anti-infection and anti-shock drugs to help stabilise the elephant's condition and have pledged to do everything they can to bring it back to health.

"One of the Hillsborough samaritans sought by investigators has come forward after an appeal was launched to identify fans who tended to the wounded as they lay dying on the pitch at the 1989 disaster. The man was located after Operation Resolve launched the appeal on Thursday morning in the hope that the supporters might be able to supply crucial evidence for the ongoing inquest. Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy were released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal  is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner’s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed. The Home Secretary Theresa May launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year. Investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal . While the images are 26 years old, investigators believe they may help track down key witnesses. Above, a man in a dark coloured jacket (left) and another in a beige jacket and grey hooded sweatshirt (right) who police believe may be able to help . Another of the fans in a distinctive white and red hat and a man seen tending to one of the wounded as they lay helpless on the football pitch (right) A man in a light denim jacket with long brown hair (left) is another person investigators believe may be able to help. Right, another person pictured in the appeal who was stuck behind the enclosure where fans were crushed . Another fan pictured in the appeal. Anyone with information about those pictured is urged to contact Operation Resolve officers . While officers said it was 'unusual' to carry out such appeals as today's while legal proceedings are active they invited anyone who recognised the people photographed to make contact. 'I have a team of highly trained staff in place who will deal with witnesses sensitively as we understand how difficult some people will find this,' added Mr Stoddart. 'The Operation Resolve website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance. 'It is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason I urge people to remember the warning issued by the Coroner at the start of the fresh inquests, which he reiterated in February 2014. 'I also urge people to consider the advisory notice issued by the Attorney General’s office on 10 March 2014. 'It is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the Hillsborough disaster on social media and forums.' Among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in Warrington are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time. The inquest continues. Ninety-six people were killed in the 1989 disaster (above). The conclusions of previous inquests were thrown out in 2012 with the Home Office launching a fresh probe .

"An Army officer and his wife have admitted racially abusing hotel guests and workers after getting drunk at their own wedding reception. Jade and Aaron Badland asked an Asian family if they had Ebola and assaulted a Brazilian hotel employee, calling her a 'bloody foreigner'. The pair have been spared jail after a court heard that they were too drunk to remember what they had done at the Premier Inn at Stansted Airport. Assault: Aaron and Jade Badland have admitted assaulting a hotel worker after their wedding reception . Mr Badland, 24, a bomb disposal officer in the Engineering Regiment, was wearing his Army uniform during the drunken attack alongside his 29-year-old bride. Both newlyweds pleaded guilty to assault and were each ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work, while Mrs Badland was also found guilty of racially aggravated harassment. Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard that the couple got married in Malta last August, but held their wedding reception at Audley End, Essex in November. Afterwards they were staying at the Stansted branch of Premier Inn, where American guest David La Plante saw them abusing an Asian family. He told the court: 'Around the corner by some lifts we heard talk and the wife was making derogatory remarks to the family, calling them foreigners and asking if they had the Ebola virus. 'I positioned myself between her and the family and gave her a look saying ""enough is enough"". She asked me if I had the Ebola virus and my response was, ""Do you?"" 'Her husband came around, wrapped her up and told her we were Americans and not to talk to us.' Venue: The assault took place at a branch of Premier Inn in Stansted Airport, pictured . Harry Coleman, prosecuting, told the court that the Badlands staggered to their hotel room but could not work out how to use the electronic key. They then confronted Brazilian worker Christina Periera, but Mr Badland became angry when she told them she would have to reprogramme the key in order to open their door. Mr Badland then told Mrs Pereira: 'It's my room, open the f***ing door - bloody foreigners coming to our country.' Mr Coleman said: 'Ms Periera was upset and said she was going down to call the police, and he hit her on the nose with his open palm and again twice more.' Mrs Badland 'prodded' the worker with two bottles of alcohol as her husband continued to shout, the court heard. She told magistrates: 'I had a lot of drink. I had a good few pints and some shots and don't remember anything about the incident because of the level of intoxication. I was very drunk.' Gareth Hunter, mitigating, said the couple were 'ashamed' and Mr Badland would be disciplined by the Army. Mrs Badland was ordered to attend a 10-day education, training and employment programme and pay £625 costs and £60 victim surcharge, while her husband was told to pay £100 compensation and a £60 victim surcharge.","Jade Badland and her husband Aaron were drunk after wedding reception .

"A breakthrough has been made in the development of clean hydrogen power, scientists claim. At the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Hydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily . Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention. It uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. Lead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces. Water splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively. The energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two. The new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process. It can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner. The process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost. With this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency. ‘Oxygen is the most difficult bit,’ Dr Hintermair explained. Their catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn’t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is ‘almost non-existent’. The major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. ‘We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can’t store it very well,’ Dr Hintermair continued. ‘We can put it in a battery but you can’t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet. ‘So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.’ This, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical. On this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen . The team are in discussions with a number of energy companies about utilising this technology on a large scale and hope the breakthrough marks the start of contributing to providing the world with more sustainable fuels. ‘In theory it could be used on all systems, but it depends on cost and scale,’ said Dr Hintermair. As regulations tighten on the use of fossil fuels and their emissions, there is a growing focus on the need for cost effective and efficient ways of creating energy carriers from renewable sources. Solar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade. However, while the price of photovoltaic technology has dramatically decreased in recent years as demand has risen, solar energy is problematic as it is intermittent, meaning electricity is only created when it is light. One use of the newly developed catalyst could be to store the energy produced by solar power by using the electricity to produce hydrogen which can then be used on demand, regardless of the time of day. Solar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade (Wymeswold Solar Farm in Leicestershire, UK shown), but storing it is difficult. This new technology could store energy as hydrogen, which can then be used on demand . Dr Hintermair is a Whorrod research fellow at the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath. 'Hydrogen is a fantastically versatile and environmentally friendly fuel, however, hydrogen-powered applications are only as ""green"" as the hydrogen on which they run,' he said. 'Currently, over 90 per cent is derived from fossil fuels. If we want to bring about a clean hydrogen economy we must first generate clean hydrogen. 'This new molecular catalyst will hopefully play a large role in helping create hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar power. 'We are also interested in applying this technology to other forms of renewable energy such as tidal, wind and wave power.' Professor Matthew Davidson, head of the department of chemistry, added: 'Splitting water into its constituent parts is deceptively simple chemistry, but doing it in a sustainable way is one of the holy grails of chemistry because it is the key step in the goal of artificial photosynthesis. '[Dr Hintermair's] results are extremely exciting because of their potential for practical application.'","Bath and Yale University scientists reveal clean hydrogen power .

"Heroin dealer Patrick Revins was identified by undercover police because he has his initials - 'P' and 'R' - tattooed on either side of his forehead . A bungling drug dealer was caught selling heroin by an undercover police officer who recognised him because he has his initials tattooed on his face. Patrick Revins, 49, sold £10-worth of the Class A drug, which was hidden in a Kinder Egg, to the policeman in November 2013, a court was told. The detective was easily able to identify who sold him the drugs - as Revins has 'P' and 'R' tattooed on either side of his forehead. Revins, at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday, admitted one count of supplying heroin and was sentenced to a year in jail. That will be added to the 27-month prison sentence he is already serving for possession of knives. Revins' tattoos were also his downfall last year when he walked into a branch of Barclays in Hanley, Staffordshire, armed with a large bread knife. Bank staff asked him to leave after he was muttering about how he was 'going to do' someone. He then lifted his top and pulled the knife from the front of his trousers. Revins put the blade back into his trousers and left the bank but was arrested 20 minutes later after staff identified him by his distinctive tattoos. Police seized a large kitchen knife with an eight-inch blade. Two days later, while on bail, Revins was stopped again, and found to be carrying a bayonet and a large carving knife. Police arrested him again. At yesterday's hearing, prosecutor Joanne Barker told Judge Paul Glenn that Revins was caught by undercover police alongside fellow drug dealer Nathan Davenport, 37. Ms Barker said: 'Davenport first came to the attention of the police in September 2013. Revins, at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court (pictured) yesterday, admitted one count of supplying heroin and was sentenced to 12 months in jail. Revins was caught by undercover police alongside fellow drug dealer Nathan Davenport (pictured) 'The undercover police officer met with another man who took him to an address where the two defendants were living. 'Nathan Davenport took them to a van and wrote down his contact details before handing over £20 worth of heroin. 'The next occasion the police operative met up with Davenport, the operative saw Patrick Revins there. 'In November, the operative saw Patrick Revins. Mr Revins asked the operative what he wanted and he said heroin. Mr Revins took some from a Kinder Egg and gave it to him for £10.' Davenport pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs between September 2013 and March 2014 and was jailed for 45 months. Andrew Jackson, defending Davenport, said: 'He is a man who has been bedeviled by a strong addiction of drugs.' Joanne Wallbanks, representing Revins, added: 'This was a one-off supply from his own drugs with no indication of being involved with anybody else.","Patrick Revins was caught selling heroin to an undercover police officer .

"Labour received more than £1 every second from trades unions in the second week of the election campaign, official figures revealed this morning. Union barons gave more than £700,000 to Ed Miliband’s party, swelling Labour’s election war chest for the last 14 days of the campaign. Overall, Labour received £1.1million in donations between April 6 and April 12 – more than twice as much as the Conservative party which received just £492,512.

Unison general secretary Dave Prentis (left) and the Unite chief Len McCluskey (right) have boosted Labour's election campaign with donations worth more than £400,000 between them . Most of the Tory cash came from wealthy individuals, who handed over £460,000. Christopher Rokos, who was a co-founder of hedge fund Brevan Howard Asset Management, donated £170,000 - the largest single amount in the period - to the Tories. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, were given just £50,000 and Ukip £8,000, according to figures from the Electoral Commission. Most of the Lib Dem cash came from the Green energy company Ecotricity, founded by Dale Vince, provided £30,000 to the Lib Dems. Labour received 14 times more in union donations than the Lib Dems total cash gifts combined. Unison handed over £311,875, USDAW £300,480 and Len McCluskey’s Unite a further £112,000. The donations from unions equate to £105,420.80 a day – or £1.22 a second. The Tories said size of the union donations to Labour exposed the type of Government Mr Miliband would lead as Prime Minister. Overall, Labour received £1.1million in donations between April 6 and April 12 – more than twice as much as the Conservative party which received just £492,512 - in a blow to David Cameron, pictured in Penzance, Cornwall today . Nick Clegg, pictured in Talgarth, Brecon, Wales today, received just £50,000 over seven days - while Ukip took just £8,000, according to figures from the Electoral Commission . MP Bob Neill said: ‘Ed Miliband has taken another hefty wedge of cash from the union barons, which comes with strings attached. ‘More spending, more borrowing, higher taxes and a bigger welfare bill- all demands that he will bow to in exchange for their financial support. ‘Ed Miliband wants to sneak into Downing Street by the back door- funded by Len McCluskey’s union cash and propped up by Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP. They will call the tune and the British people will pay the price.’ By law, political parties must submit weekly donation and loan reports to the commission if they are standing candidates in the UK parliamentary election and they have received any donations or loans over £7,500. Parties must notify the commission if they are not standing candidates in order to be exempt from weekly reporting.","Union barons gave more than £700,000 to Ed Miliband’s party in a week .

NSW Premier Mike Baird is touring the area and says he is shocked at the devastation caused by flooding in the Hunter. The Premier admits it will be a long time before victims are back on their feet. 'Homes, cattle, this whole landscape has been completely and utterly devastated,' Mr Baird said in Maitland after a helicopter tour of the region. 'I was in shock... at the size and scale of what we are confronting.' The state's worst storms in a decade have ripped through Sydney and surrounding areas this week with four deaths in the Hunter region. 'I don't think many of us can imagine circumstances where our life is literally washed away,' Mr Baird said on Thursday. 'Personal possessions, all your memories are lost in an instant.'

"He has taken millions of selfies - including during this campaign. But yesterday the Prime Minister used a selfie stick for the first time. It happened as David Cameron toured Pirate FM during a visit to Cornwall to lay out Conservative plans for the southwest. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured, used a selfie stick for the first time during visit to Cornwall . The PM posed with the telescopic device to take a photograph with staff at Pirate FM . Selfie sticks work by fixing the camera to an adjustable clamp on a telescopic arm, allowing the users to feature in the wide angle photo they are taking. Mr Cameron travelled down to the south west on the sleeper train. He told staff that other world leaders have selfie sticks, including the Prime Minister of Finland. During his visit to the station Mr Cameron was presented with a Cornish t-shirts emblazoned 'If You Can Smell My Pasty, You're Too Close.' Mr Cameron kindly volunteered to give that to the chancellor - a reference to George Osborne's infamous budget in which he proposed a 'pasty tax'. Mr Cameron likes to project an image as the 'chillaxing' statesman unruffled by political troubles - but this morning his usual demeanour seemed to desert him as he donned a bizarre outfit on the campaign trail. The Prime Minister looked exhausted as he stepped off the sleeper train at Penzance today, ahead of a speech in which he delivered his 'plan for Cornwall'. Mr Cameron arrived in Penzance yesterday morning after spending eight hours on the train from Paddington . He was dressed very casually as he alighted the sleeper carriage after the eight-hour journey . Mr Cameron said it was nice to have a night without the children or Mrs Cameron nudging him in the ribs . The Conservatives are battling against their Coalition partners in the South-West as they seek to wrest control of key constituencies from the Liberal Democrats. But Mr Cameron is still trailing Ed Miliband's Labour Party nationally, with just 13 days to go until polling day. The Prime Minister seemed as if he had had trouble sleeping on the eight-hour journey from London's Paddington station. His hair was unkempt and he was wearing an unusual combination of jeans with shiny loafers which might be considered more appropriate for a smart business suit. Mr Cameron sported a navy jacket with a dark blue polo shirt, and set off his outfit with the ultimate status symbol - a red box holding ministerial papers, which only a few dozen people are entitled to carry. While the jacket may have looked inoffensive, the Tory leader may have been making a political statement in support of the Union, as it appears to have been made by Scottish firm Lyle & Scott. Similar models retail online for around £125. Speaking at a factory later, he insisted that he had in fact slept very well - because his wife Samantha was not there to complain about him talking in his sleep. Mr Cameron said: 'It was very comfortable, very nice it was too, to have a night without the children waking me up or Mrs Cameron nudging me in the ribs and telling me to shut up for talking in my sleep.'","David Cameron travelled to Cornwall overnight on Paddington sleeper .

"A husband was left so traumatised by his wife's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock, despite his wife already being given a hefty payout. In a case which could have huge financial consequences for the NHS, Julie Ronayne was awarded £160,000 after she was left 'looking like Michelin man' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008. Her husband Edward, who lives with Mrs Ronayne in Netherley, Liverpool, was awarded £9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife's appearance. Edward Ronayne was given £9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up 'like Michelin man' after botched surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured) The severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis, which the woman had contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation. The test case, being heard at London's Appeal Court, could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an NHS mishap. Mr Ronayne was awarded the damages from Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust in July 2013. Liverpool County Court heard how he had been a 'secondary victim' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife's new appearance. He had described her 'colloquially as looking like a Michelin man', the court heard. Mr Ronayne also described his wife's first two days in hospital as 'the worst days of my entire life'. He said he had been 'brought up not to complain' but had never fully recovered from the sight. He added that he had been left feeling tearful, overwhelmed, angry and powerless. The judge, who described him as 'an honest and reliable witness', said: 'His symptoms...were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife.' But in the appeal court today, Charles Cory-Wright QC, who represents the health trust, told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury. He said Mr Ronayne's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the cash-strapped NHS millions in compensation. The barrister argued that Mr Ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation. He added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell. He told the court: 'Hospitals on a day-to-day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable. They go there followed by their loved ones. It is unfortunately a matter of day-to-day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if Mr Ronayne is allowed to keep the money. The test case is being heard at the appeal court . 'The question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim.' Stressing the importance of the appeal, he told the judges: 'This appeal is not just about this case, but the concerns NHS Trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place. Peritonitis is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach. It is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency. Most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix or digestive disorders. Peritonitis can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications. Source: NHS . 'The effect of this judgement, if it stands, is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases, as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock. 'Often emotional illness follows, but there is not the necessary element of shock. There needs to be a suddenly shocking event which, because of its shocking nature, causes that psychiatric illness. That is often lost in the wash in these cases.' But Lord Justice Sullivan said the incident had no doubt been 'shocking' 'Simply going into hospital and seeing one's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough,' he said. 'But to see one's wife looking like the Michelin man is shocking.' Mr Cory-Wright then replied: 'If you saw your loved one looking like the Michelin man, swollen and all that, it would be shocking in an ordinary sense. 'But it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury.' The judges recognised the importance of the case by reserving their decision on the trust's appeal until a later date. The case was heard in front of Lord Justice Sullivan, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Beatson. Mrs Ronayne went on to make a good recovery.","Julie Ronayne was given £160,000 after a botched hysterectomy in 2008 .

"An associate dean of students at the University of Virginia said Wednesday a widely discredited Rolling Stone article caused her professional and personal harm by portraying her as insensitive and unresponsive to an alleged victim of a gang rape. Nicole P. Eramo said in an open letter Wednesday to the magazine's publisher, Jann S. Wenner, that the magazine has not done enough to make amends. 'Rolling Stone has deeply damaged me both personally and professionally,' Eramo wrote. 'Using me as the personification of a heartless administration, the Rolling Stone article attacked my life's work.' Scroll down to read full letter... Hitting back: U.Va. dean Nicole P. Eramo blasted Rolling Stone in an open letter on Wednesday over its retracted campus rape story . The magazine furthered its 'malicious and false allegations by accompanying the article with a cartoonish picture of me doctored to appear as though I was smiling and giving a ""thumbs up"" to a crying victim,' Eramo writes. The magazine retracted an article about sexual violence at U.Va. after the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism issued a scathing report this month concluding Rolling Stone had failed to meet journalistic standards. The magazine pledged to review its practices and removed 'A Rape on Campus' from its website. Wenner said he won't fire anyone. The Charlottesville police department has said it had found no evidence to back the claims of the victim identified in the story only as 'Jackie,' who said she was raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house. Not enough? Eramo said the article falsely said she tried to discourage victim 'Jackie' (left) from reporting or discussing the alleged assault. The article's author, Sabrina Rubin Erdely (right), has previously apologized, saying she would not repeat the same mistakes but has not been fired . Eramo said the article falsely said she tried to discourage Jackie from reporting or discussing the alleged assault. Eramo said she in fact 'arranged for Jackie to meet with detectives almost immediately after she provided information' about being victimized at the fraternity house. The fallout from the article's false portrayal has included emails 'expressing that hope that I be killed or raped, and commenting on that they hoped that I had a daughter so that she could be raped,' she wrote. Eramo said the article has also hurt her ability to work with students and victims with whom she'd developed relationships. A spokeswoman for Rolling Stone said Wednesday: 'We sincerely regret any pain we caused Dean Nicole Eramo and others affected by this story.' The article's author, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, has previously apologized, saying she would not repeat the same mistakes. Eramo has hired a law firm that specializes in defamation cases, but has not said what her legal plans are. Phi Kappa Psi announced after the Columbia report came out that it will 'pursue all available legal action' against Rolling Stone. To date, no lawsuit has been filed.

"Many people will know the feeling of spending hundreds of pounds on so-called 'miracle' products that claim to solve all-manner of beauty woes. While most of these products end up collecting dust in the back of a drawer, beauty has seen an insurgence of natural alternatives, with all-purpose ingredients such as coconut oil taking over in their place. One woman has promised to revolutionise beauty regimes with her creation of more than 100 products, all organic and natural, that can be concocted in your own kitchen. Fifi M. Maacaron's book, Natural Beauty Alchemy, contains over 100 ingredients which treat all-manner of skincare ailments such as acne, oil and dryness . Fifi M. Maacaron uses full-fat cream cheese in a face mask, which supposedly quenches the skin . Fifi M. Maacaron, 36, is a pharmacist and natural skincare expert who believes that natural alternatives are the way forward, especially in the midst of gimmicky expensive products. Maacaron, from Newport News, Virginia, created her book, Natural Beauty Alchemy, not only to showcase that there are inexpensive alternatives to store-bought products, but also to explain many myths surrounding skincare. For example, while cream-cheese is usually more used to seeing the top of a bagel, Maacaron proposes another use for it. Her Winter Rescue Mask is specially formulated for dry and weather-beaten skin and contains full-fat cream cheese. The 36-year-old author explains that the richness of the cheese will quench the skin and help protect it against weather-induced dryness. Apple cider vinegar has been cited as a great cleansing agent, and is included as an ingredient in the Subtle Bubble Shampoo . Sesame oil is another beneficial natural ingredient, containing antioxidants and is well-tolerated by most skin types, even the most sensitive ones . Apple cider is used in several of the recipes, in a toner for acne-prone skin and also in a shampoo - the acidic nature of the ingredient working as a great cleansing agent. Other recipes suggest alternatives to everything from cleansers to foot creams to even perfumes, which use a spread of natural products including green tea to rinse hair, potatoes for a face mask and coffee grounds for cellulite. Natural Beauty Alchemy was born when author Maacaron went on the search for a perfect product, and was shocked by the falsity of some store-bought products. She says: 'As I entered into my 30s, I felt that my skin needed more care. 'As a pharmacist, I read ingredients labels and many times I'd study each facial cream in the 'green and natural section' and come out empty handed and shocked at the extent of dishonesty and fraudulent marketing.' The natural skincare expert began formulating recipes herself and became a go-to for her friends and family. Honey and lemon juice are other products that are regularly featured as beneficial natural skincare ingredients . She explains: 'I reached a point where I was becoming a reference to friends and family and many would ask me for recipes. 'I've tried all of the recipes because I formulate them. I am a big fan of coconut oil and I include it in many formulations.' Maacaron's overarching argument simply rests at the fact that she finds natural products superior to store-bought products. She explains: 'In organic homemade products, skin irritants such as synthetic fragrances and dyes are left out. This helps soothe skin and avoid breakouts and makes us really love, enjoy and trust what we're applying on ourselves. 'Nature is pretty much a powerhouse with a lot of effective ingredients that do provide obvious results. I've seen people glow in just a week after switching to natural products. Many of them look younger, without fillers or botox.' Weather aggression is always noticeable, not only on hands, legs, and lips, but also on the face. This mask contains full-fat cream cheese, which will restore some of the skin’s lipid mantle and help protect skin against weather-induced dryness. The remaining ingredients will boost skin’s vitality and revive it. While wheat germ oil is extremely nourishing, moisturizing, and anti-aging, grapefruit juice will load your skin with antioxidants and vitamin C for a refreshed and younger-looking skin. Adding egg white is optional but strongly recommended if you wish to have proteins in your mask, as well. Prepare this formula when your skin feels dry and tight, or routinely during winter and harsh weather months. Ingredients . Instructions . 1. Allow the cheese to soften at room temperature—do not microwave. Flatten with a fork, and then add remaining ingredients one at a time while mixing with the fork. 2. Spread with a spatula on clean face and neck, directly or between double layers of precut gauze strips. (Prepare the gauze strips ahead of time by laying gauze in double layers and cutting four rectangles for the forehead and neck and four circles for the cheeks.) 3. Lie back or sit in a reclining chair and wait 15–20 minutes before removing gauze pads and rinsing off. 4. Repeat this mask on a weekly basis to sustain results and protect the skin. Follow with the application of daily moisturizer and a sunblock. This formula will transform concentrated liquid soap into a smooth and balanced hair shampoo. The argan oil restores shine and luster to dull hair. Ingredients . Instructions . 1. Mix the rosemary infusion and the vinegar. Then pour it into the soap base, in a thin stream, whisking very gently to prevent foaming. Blend in the argan oil, slowly, still whisking until all ingredients are well blended. 2. Use as a regular shampoo. This toner is named for its two key ingredients: vitamin C and cider. The acidic nature of apple cider allows skin to get rid of surface dead cells, while the vitamin C in lemon juice is a skin brightener that also acts as a powerful antioxidant; it can reverse sun damage and reduce wrinkles, for a more youthful look. Combined with the astringency of neroli and witch hazel in this formula, they will reduce oily secretions and help achieve a glowing and clearer skin. Ingredients . Instructions . 1. Start by dissolving the honey in ½ cup water. Add the remaining ingredients one at a time, mixing continuously. Then transfer to a bottle. 2. Shake well before each use. Using a cotton ball, apply to the face and neck in the evening. Rinse in the morning and wear sunscreen daily. This unscented oily serum is especially formulated for intolerant skin; it’s suitable for most skin types, however, and is a powerful moisturizer, packed with antioxidants. Sesame oil is a skin-friendly oil, well-tolerated by most skin types, even the most sensitive ones; it contains sesamol, which has antioxidant properties, as well as unsaturated essential fatty acids and many minerals such as magnesium, calcium, and iron. Grape seed oil is also a strong source of antioxidants and is a dry oil that absorbs quickly. This formula is kept simple by calling for ingredients that can be found in most grocery stores. Ingredients . Instructions . 1. Pour the oils into a glass bottle with a dropper, finishing with the vitamin E drops. 2. Close tightly and shake to blend the oils. 3. In the evening, after cleansing, and while the face is still moist, apply 2–3 drops to your hands, rub them together, and massage this serum onto your face and neck.","Fifi M.

"Two GOP presidential hopefuls - Ted Cruz and Ben Carson - want the Clinton Foundation to return every dollar its received from foreign governments since it launched more than a decade ago. The bum rush on the non-profit came about after a report cast a new shadow over the charity's fundraising practices while Hillary Clinton served as the United State's chief diplomat. A Reuters investigation that revealed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation had misreported millions of dollars in donations from foreign nations led the global charity to announce that it would refile more than five years of tax documents. Scroll down for video . A Reuters investigation that revealed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation had misreported millions of dollars in donations from foreign nations led the global charity to announce that it would refile more than five years of tax documents - Republicans pounced . The discovery came as separate financial reviews found that previously unreported foreign businesses either donated money directly to the family foundation or paid Bill to speak while their countries were doing official business with the State Department during Hillary's tenure. In one instance,  Bill Clinton received one of his biggest paychecks in $500,000 for a June 2010 speech in Moscow funded by an investment bank with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Clinton Foundation was barred by an agreement from accepting money from foreign governments it wasn't already in business while Mrs. Clinton was in President Barack Obama's cabinet. But that didn't stop it from doing so anyway. It fessed up in February to accepting a $500,000 donation from Algeria in 2010 without telling the State Department. And the agreement is not known to have put restraints on Mr. Clinton's ability to collect paychecks from foreign actors. Taking aim at Hillary Clinton, Cruz said in a Wednesday evening Facebook, 'Having raised tens of millions of dollars from foreign nations presents a clear conflict of interest for anyone running for President of the United States.' 'Add your name if you agree Hillary Clinton should return all money raised from foreign nations!' the Texas senator added, soliciting names for a petition urging the non-profit to give back the funds. Carson told Daily Mail Online today that he, too, believes the charity cough up the cash. 'It is my strong belief that not only should they definitely give back the money and cease accepting foreign donations, but should also make every effort to find missing documents that would shed light if in fact they are innocent,' he said.. Two GOP presidential hopefuls - Ted Cruz, left, and Ben Carson, right - want the Clinton Foundation to return every dollar its received from foreign governments since it launched more than a decade ago . 'It's the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep,' former business executive Carly Fiorina wrote on Facebook. 'Now they're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as Secretary of State.' After Clinton made official her candidacy for the Oval Office, the foundation said it would impose a moratorium on checks from foreign governments that it's not already partnered with - but it still plans to take money from governments it has recently done work with. Carson, who is expected to jump into the 2016 race on May 4, said in his statement that 'one of the things that has become clear' in his travels across the country 'is that the American people are sick of corruption and dishonesty within the government.' 'Doublespeak and redefining terms to fit a narrative is truly unacceptable and misleading. The Clinton Foundation and the appearance of wrongdoing reinforces these feelings,' the retired neurosurgeon and tea party icon said. 'Anyone who contemplates a leadership position in our great nation should thoroughly examine their motives to determine if they are simply interested in enriching themselves and enhancing their own power versus strengthening America and passing it on to the next generation in an improved and ethical condition,' he posited. 'Add your name if you agree Hillary Clinton should return all money raised from foreign nations!' Ted Cruz said in a Facebook post soliciting names for a petition urging the non-profit to give back the funds . Former business executive Carly Fiorina, who will reportedly announce her own candidacy the same day as Carson via social media, stopped short of demanding that the Clinton Foundation start writing checks for money it likely doesn't have in the bank if they were cashed. She did use the opportunity to levy an attack on Clinton, however, whom she's positioned herself next to in the field as an alternative to for voters looking to break the glass ceiling by electing a woman president. 'It's the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep,' Fiorina wrote on Facebook. 'Now they're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as Secretary of State.' 'The American people will have a choice. Are we going to demand trust and transparency from our leaders? Have we had enough of a ruling political class that doles out favors to the wealthy and well connected few?' she said, previewing her stump speech. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who is testing the waters for a 2016 campaign, said, 'These stories today raise some very serious questions about the donations and relationships around the Clintons and their foundation.' 'I believe Secretary Clinton owes the public some answers about any potential impropriety,' he told Daily Mail Online. COZY: Bill Clinton is seen here shaking the hand the then Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin, now the president of the country who the U.S. has a complicated relationship with, June 29, 2010. The former U.S. president received one of his biggest paychecks in $500,000 for a speech in Moscow that took place during this trip and was funded by an investment bank with ties to Putin . A new book that Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul promises will shed additional light on the non-profit's fundraising practices has had the entire 2016 field ready to pounce on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton for weeks. Paul told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Tuesday evening that the expose's author, Peter Schweizer, had briefed him 'and the facts are going to be alarming. They're going to be mind-boggling.' The Kentucky senator said he was bound to secrecy on the contents of the 186-page investigative book, Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.' 'But I think people are going to be blown away by the details in this book and how they link the Clintons into this enormous exchange of money from foreign countries, from donors to companies, and then it's all swirling around,' he told Hannity. 'And I don't think it would happen if you didn't have somebody who was a secretary of state and a former president, and they seem to be capitalizing on their service in government,' he contended. Continuing, Paul implied that the Clintons were 'using the system to enrich themselves,' and said, 'I think it looks unseemly. And I think a lot of Americans are going to agree with me.'","Ted Cruz and Ben Carson want the charity to return every dollar its received from foreign governments since its launch in 2001 .

"Police in Texas are investigating claims of excessive force after an officer was caught on camera throwing an intoxicated woman to the ground of a parking lot during an arrest. The officer, Ben Johnson, who has been on the force four years, was answering reports of a drunk woman inside Deluxe Nails at a strip mall in Red Rock on Tuesday. When he arrived, he contained 27-year-old Viviana Keith, who was walking toward her car, and began handcuffing her. Johnson claims the woman started resisting him, forcing him to pull a fast and forceful take-down, however video taken on his cash cam and by a person in a nearby shop appear to show a different story. Investigation: Police in Red Rock, Texas, are into this video to see if officer Ben Johnson used excessive force when taking down Viviana Keith, 27, who was arrested amid reports of drunken behavior and DUI . Excessive?: The dramatic video shows the moment Johnson slams Keith into the ground, knocking her out . Take-down: Johnson says that Keith was resisting him, so he threw her to the concrete of the parking lot . Out: The move immediately knocked Viviana Keith unconscious, as her daughter (left) watched on . Battered: Vivian Keith, seen here in her booking photo following the incident on Tuesday, has been charged with DWI with a child younger than 15 and interfering with pubic duties . Both videos show Johnson throwing Keith to the concrete ground of the parking lot. Her head can be seen hitting the hard surface in the video taken nearby, and she passes out on impact. The main who took the video, who wished to remain anonymous, said he believed it was an excessive use of force. 'When I look back at the tape, I can see her head bounce off the concrete because when he threw her down, she wasn't able to brace herself,' the man told KVUE. 'She was absolutely unconscious. 'There were a couple of other gentleman in the store with me and we were saying 'is she breathing?' 'Because at first we weren't seeing her stomach rise and fall.' Another witness, Viviana Garcia, said she thought the woman had died. Furthermore, the woman's daughter, who is six-years-old, also saw the incident unfold. 'It looked like she was dead,' Garcia told the network. 'The little girl was screaming, ''Mommy, mommy''.' Dash cam: A second roll of footage was captured inside Johnson's car showing Keith being arrested . Resisting?: Johnson claimed that Keith resisted him and that he was forced to take her down . Slam: This is the moment officer Ben Johnson throws Viviana Keith to the ground during the arrest Tuesday . Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks said the calls his department received about Keith said she was being 'very combative, very argumentative and also very intoxicated'. Callers also said that Keith had left her daughter in the car. They said she was driving 'erratic' and 'carelessly' when she arrived. Others claimed to have spoken to the daughter, who said she was hungry. Internal investigation: Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks says he has reviewed the footage and believes Johnson acted within his rights . After seeing the footage, Banks said he thinks the officer acted in the right way. 'The officer was very professional, was talking to her calm, he wasn't excited, he wasn't angry,' Banks told KVUE. 'It's unfortunate, the fact that this lady did what appears to hit her head and was knocked unconscious, but I'll tell you, the officer did what he was supposed to do in a situation like that.' Keith was arrested and charged with DWI with a child younger than 15 and interfering with pubic duties. She is being kept at Williamson County Jail for the time being.

"Two teenage cancer survivors have been left distraught after photographs they posted on Facebook to celebrate getting the all-clear were reported for nudity. Tiffany Williams and Jessica Versey, both 19 and from Chester, Cheshire, became close friends during their treatment and went into remission around the same time.

But, telling of what happened next, she said: ‘Feeling proud, I updated my friends on Facebook with the caption “I did it!” - and about two hours later found that someone had reported it for nudity. ‘It didn’t get deleted but I knew it must have been someone I had as a friend.

Survivors: Miss Williams is seen in a photo - not reported to Facebook - revealing she had got the all-clear (left), and Miss Versey's post with the image of her scar which was reported for nudity is also pictured (right) Feeling happy: Miss Versey, who received lifesaving bone marrow treatment from her ten-year-old sister Maisy, said it was 'a massive deal' for her chemotherapy catheter be taken out after her gruelling cancer battle . Joking around: Miss Williams regularly wrote on her struggle with losing hair to chemotherapy on Facebook . ‘All I was doing was trying to help others that might need that little boost to show that no one is different, with or without hair or scars.’ If a user wishes to tell Facebook that they believe a picture is breaching nudity guidelines, he or she can click on ‘options’ under the image and ‘report photo’. The user must then click on ‘nudity’ as the reason for a complaint, before confirming they want to report the image to Facebook. It is then sent to the website’s community operations team in Ireland, who consider every report and make a decision based on Facebook’s community standards. The user whose profile carries the photo will receive a notification to say their image has been reported – but it is only removed if Facebook find it breaches guidelines. And she was further shocked last week when leukaemia sufferer Miss Versey’s photo of the scar left by the removal of her chemotherapy catheter also got reported for nudity. Miss Versey, who received lifesaving bone marrow treatment from her ten-year-old sister Maisy, said it was ‘a massive deal’ for it be taken out after her gruelling cancer battle. She added: ‘Having that taken out was a big thing for me, as it essentially kept me alive for so long. I shared my scar to show people my body was one step further away from cancer. ‘As soon as I put it up it was reported for nudity, then straight away a selfie of my bald head was also reported - the first ever picture I posed with no hair. It really upset me as I didn’t see what the big deal was. 'It’s weird that people find it acceptable to post half-naked pictures but yet people get offended by me sharing my journey with cancer.’ Miss Williams added that she was distraught to know that ‘someone that knows me and Jess gets a kick’ out of reporting the photographs. A spokesman for Facebook said today that it does not comment on individual cases, but referred MailOnline to its community guidelines published online for ‘encouraging respectful behaviour’. The ‘nudity’ section states: ‘We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple. ‘But we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures and other art that depicts nude figures. ‘Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also apply to digitally-created content unless the content is posted for educational, humorous or satirical purposes. 'Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed.' Miss Versey has almost 4,200 friends on Facebook, with 80 of these mutual with Miss Williams.

"A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'","Stephen Munden, 54, has absconded from hospital, near Hook, Hampshire .

"Immigration controls in Australia are so tough that asylum seekers are rejected on board naval warships at sea before being returned immediately, it emerged yesterday. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott says the EU must ‘urgently’ follow his lead to stop migrants dying in the Mediterranean as they seek a new life in Europe. Yesterday Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said his country was ‘at war’ with migrant traffickers, describing them as ‘the slave traders of the 21st century’. Scroll down for video . The Australian Navy, pictured, is processing migrants' claims while at sea before returning them home . Australia has one of the toughest immigration policies in the developed world according to experts . Australian PM Tony Abbott, pictured, has said his country's immigration controls have been strengthened . EU leaders will hold a crisis summit in Brussels today to agree a strategy after up to 900 were killed when a fishing boat from Libya capsized. They are expected to double funding and equipment for EU border-patrol missions off the North African coast. But critics believe millions of impoverished Africans and Asians are happy to set off into the Mediterranean in leaky boats because they are confident humanitarian efforts will save them and speed them to their destination. Mr Abbott has insisted: ‘The only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats.’ Australia detains people on the Pacific islands of Nauru or Papua New Guinea while their asylum applications are considered, in order to avoid them absconding and staying on Australian soil while their cases are heard. Those on Nauru have the ‘opportunity’ to seek a life in Cambodia – which is paid by Australia to take them – while those in Papua New Guinea can stay there under a similar deal. Any who sneak past navy patrols to set foot on Australia are barred from staying for ignoring procedure, even if their asylum claim is genuine. But it emerged yesterday that Australian premier Mr Abbott’s immigration-control policy is even tougher than had been previously thought. It was revealed that officials rejected asylum claims of 46 Vietnamese aboard an Australian navy vessel – without setting foot on dry land – before the group was handed back to Vietnam last week. The screening aboard HMAS Choules is believed to have happened over a number of days after a boat was intercepted north of Australia. They were returned to the port city of Vung Tau, south of Ho Chi Minh City. Australia’s Vietnamese community leaders warned that the Abbott government would be ‘throwing people back to hell’ by returning the asylum seekers. There were reports last year that an asylum seeker from an ethnic minority hill tribe was badly beaten by Vietnamese government officials after being returned by Cambodia. And Amnesty International said that claims of persecution by the Vietnamese cannot have been adequately assessed while still at sea. Amnesty’s Graeme McGregor said: ‘These reports are extremely concerning and represent a fundamental violation of refugee rights. ‘Basic screening procedures at sea cannot be relied upon to make such life and death decisions. ‘Instead of digging itself deeper into disrepute by negotiating secretive deals to return asylum seekers, Australia should be helping those in need and identifying safe, practical ways for refugees to reach safety. The government has repeatedly excused its secretive boat turn-backs by trying to claim that they save lives. ‘The return of Vietnamese asylum seekers to the very country and government that they have escaped from exposes the truth about the government’s policies: that they do not save people, but repel people who may need our help.’ Immigration minister Peter Dutton refused to comment on the return of the Vietnamese but insisted people were not sent back to countries where they would face persecution. However, in a video to be shown to asylum seekers on Nauru, he can be seen urging them to take up the Australian offer for them to resettle in Cambodia. He tells the asylum seekers: ‘It is a fast-paced and vibrant country with a stable economy and varied employment opportunities.’","Migrant asylum claims are processed by the Australian navy while at sea .

"A students’ union has been accused of racism and sexism after banning white people and men from an event to promote equality. Those studying at Goldsmiths, University of London, were invited to the students’ union meeting to discuss ‘diversifying the curriculum’. But they were shocked when an organiser told white people and men ‘not to come’ as it was only open to BME [black and minority ethnic] women. Bahar Mustafa, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a 'diversity' meeting . The union eventually backed down after a backlash from students, one of whom described the exclusive policy as ‘patronising beyond belief’. The event, held on Wednesday, was organised by welfare and diversity officer Bahar Mustafa, who said she hoped to persuade academics to broaden courses to include more material relating to minority groups. She wrote on Facebook: ‘Invite loads of BME Women and non-binary people!! Also, if you’ve been invited and you’re a man and/or white PLEASE DON’T COME just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only.’ Non-binary is a term used to describe people who do not consider themselves exclusively male or female. Miss Mustafa, 27, added: ‘Don’t worry lads we will give you and allies things to do’, followed by a wink. The event’s online page said it was open to ‘self-defining BLACK and ETHNIC MINORITY women and non-binary people with gender identities that include “woman”.’ The ban on men and white students is surprising, since the organisers claim to promote ‘zero tolerance’ for ‘all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression’. A senior union member told student newspaper The Tab that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students. He said many white men felt they ‘could not say anything for fear of retribution’, adding: ‘For Bahar to have the nerve to write this is patronising beyond belief. The irony that she thinks that they are diversifying the student community in the name of feminism and multiculturalism is laughable.’ The event sparked a fierce backlash on social media, with one user writing: ‘Isn’t this racism – and why wasn’t she prosecuted?’ Another said: ‘Hypocrisy of the left ... When will people see it.’ Organisers later appeared to back down on the rules, with the statement ‘Allies now welcome!’ added to the meeting’s Facebook page. Miss Mustafa recently graduated from Goldsmiths with an MA in gender and media studies. She is understood to live with her mother Nursen, 55, father Ismail, 57, and sister Ipek, 23, in Enfield in a £450,000 three-bedroom terrace. Ms Mustafa appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this Facebook post . A notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped, stating: 'Allies now welcome!' A spokesman for Goldsmiths said the university had no part in the decisions of the union, adding: ‘We are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression, including racism, sexism or any other form of bigotry. ‘We have written to the students’ union to express our concern.’ The union said: ‘Goldsmiths Students’ Union places huge importance on equality and diversity. ‘It is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face. ‘The accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly.’ The Daily Mail tried to contact Miss Mustafa but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her Facebook account. Goldsmiths has insisted the Student Union is a separate organisation over which it has no control .","Goldsmiths University students organised meeting to 'diversify curriculum'

"President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner.

Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend.

"Bizarre pictures have emerged of two models posing seductively with a giant brown bear as part of an anti-hunting campaign. The photos, taken in a forest outside Moscow in Russia, show Maria Sidorova and Lidia Fetisova hugging and kissing the 650kg bear, named Stephen.

'We all need to live side-by-side in harmony and not hunt our fellow citizens who live in the forest.' In one shot, the bear wraps his paws around one of the models while she is lying in the snow wearing a swimming costume.

The models revealed that Stephen was free to do 'what he wanted' during the photo shoot but Lidia insisted the bear did not harm her at all . Stephen, the 18-year-old, 2.2metre tall bear, was rescued by his owner Yuriy Panteleenko, who found him barely alive in the hands of hunters. He negotiated the three-month-old bear's release, but soon discovered his mother had either abandoned him or been slaughtered and he was too weak. Instead Mr Panteleenko took him in and hand-raised him like a parent. But after being hand reared, Stephen was unable to reintegrate back into the wild. The professional circus trainer eventually trained Stephan to become a movie star - and the animal has since appeared in a host of Russian blockbusters including, Tsar.

"Comcast is abandoning its bid to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2billion and  create a mega-size TV and internet provider, it was reported today. The move comes after Federal Communications Commission decided that merger wasn't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like Disney and 21st Century Fox. Bloomberg, followed by the New York Times, reported Thursday afternoon that Comcast is planning to 'walk away' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government. An announcement from the telecoms giant, already the biggest cable company in the country, could come as early as tomorrow. Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Ding-dong: Experts, including Columbia University professor Tim Wu, declared the Comcast-Time Warner Cable murder dead after the FCC expressed skepticism . Mega-merger: The $45.2billion deal would have merged Comcast's 30million customers with Time Warner Cable's 11million. The new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers . The proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid TV market with more than 27million customers across the nation. On Wednesday night, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Federal Communications Commission regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size TV and internet provider was in the public interest. Staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars. The hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline, at the very least. Columbia University professor and net neutrality activist Tim Wu tweeted: 'Comcast merger is dead.' CNN's Brian Stelter reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the FCC decision. Combining the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable companies would put nearly 30 percent of TV and about 55 percent of broadband subscribers under one roof. That would give the resulting behemoth unprecedented power over what Americans watch and download. That has had competitors, consumer groups, and Senators lining up to oppose the deal. Time Warner Cable's shares dipped slightly in trading on Thursday - though Comcast stocks were actually up after the news . 'This is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal I can remember,' said S&P Capital IQ Tuna Amobi. One concern, for example, is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online-only video providers for connecting to its network. Dish, the satellite TV company behind the new Web video service Sling TV, and Netflix are opposed to the deal. Another charge is that Comcast hasn't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought NBCUniversal. The company says it has, except for one circumstance when the FCC found it wasn't promoting a stand-alone Internet service. Comcast says it fixed that. Pushback against the merger has picked up in the last couple weeks. Al Franken, D-Minn., along with five other Democratic senators and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, this week urged the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices. Recent media reports suggested that regulators aren't going to approve it. On Friday, Bloomberg, citing unidentified people, said Department of Justice staff attorneys were leaning against the deal. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said, also citing unidentified people, said that FCC staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge, although no final decision had been made. The FCC would send the deal to a judge if it didn't believe it serves the public interest. The company has the right to present its case to the judge. But a trial could take months and even then a decision could be appealed to the FCC. 'It's a dead end for Comcast,' said Rob McDowell, a former FCC commissioner. The Justice Department declined to comment. The FCC declined to comment and spokesman Neil Grace said the review is ongoing. Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice confirmed that company executives met Wednesday with Justice Department and FCC officials. But she would not comment on what occurred during the meetings or what other conversations the company is having with regulators. If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal falls through, a transaction with Charter Communications Inc. aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart. Charter's bid for Bright House Networks, which it announced in March, could also be killed. Many analysts expect that Charter, which lost out on its bid for Time Warner Cable to Comcast, to resurrect its effort if Comcast is rebuffed. 'Other cable deals that don't involve Comcast might be allowed to go through,' McDowell said. There 'seems to be an antipathy towards Comcast at the FCC' because the agency thinks Comcast didn't stick to the conditions of the NBCUniversal merger, he said. A combined Charter and Time Warner Cable would have 15 million video customers and 16.5 million Internet customers. That's still smaller than Comcast alone, which has 22.4 million video subscribers and 22 million Internet customers. Comcast wanted Time Warner Cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals Dish, DirecTV and Verizon's FiOS, as well as newer, cheaper online competitors like Netflix. The company had also said the deal would help it cut costs, including for programming — the shows and movies it pipes to subscribers. But Comcast may have to look overseas for future acquisitions. 'Washington's concern here is excessive control of broadband in the hands of a single company,' wrote analyst Craig Moffett in a client email. 'For all intents and purposes, their M&A ambitions would be on ice in the U.S.' Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3052969/Reports-say-Comcast-plans-drop-45B-Time-Warner-Cable-bid.html#ixzz3YAkxSfYl Follow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook .","Merger would have given the new company control of 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30percent of the paid TV market .

"It is a problem the average traveller doesn't often have to deal with. But for those lucky few who travel the world by private jet, the landing fees charged at airports can differ dramatically, with some surprising hubs asking for the highest fees. The high landings fees give an insight into some of the most unexpectedly popular transport hubs for the rich and famous, from Salzburg, in Austria, to Darwin, in Australia. Owning a private jet is a luxury only afford to the wealthy, and you'll need to be to continually fork out for landing charges which can reach thousands every time . Travelling by private jet is a growing trend, with 2.5 million private flights recorded in the US in 2013 (the latest statistics) and 705,000 in Europe. It a huge industry for the rich and famous, with its market worth $16.7trillion in the US and $15.8trillion in Europe. The busiest weekends unsurprisingly occur during huge sporting events, with the Super Bowl in America and the Monaco Grand Prix the priciest times of year to fly and the busiest weekends for private jets companies. Private jet companies such as PrivateFly were estimating costs from New York to Glendale for the Super Bowl this year at around $38,000 (£25,322) on a medium jet and $54,000 (£35,983) on a long-range jet for a round-trip. Salzburg Airport handled 1.6 million passengers in 2012. It charges £2,530 to land a 767-400 jet on its runways . For the Monaco Grand Prix in May, the trip is a more affordable £8,835 ($13,253) from London to Cannes and £8,895 (£13,343) from London to Nice. 1. Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan: £4,559 ($6,850) 2. Narita International Airport in Tokyo, Japan: £3,728 ($5,600) 3. Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan: £3,594 ($5,400) 4. Toronto Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Canada: £3,461 ($5,200) 5. Darwin International Airport in Darwin, Australia: £3,059 ($4,600) 6. Bristol Airport in Bristol, England: £2,929 ($4,400) 7. Chūbu Centrair International Airport in Nagoya, Japan: £2,863( $4,300) 8. Dublin Airport in Dublin, Ireland: £2,729 ($4,100) 9. La Guardia Airport in New York, United States: £2,630 ($3,950) 10. Salzburg Airport in Salzburg, Austria: £2,530 ($3,800) According to private jet charter company PrivateFly, one of the most popular routes in the world is the short hop from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, which costs around £2,890 ($4,340). While Milan dot Rome is the most popular in Europe, a 50-minute flight costing around $5,880 one way. But if you want to fly into any of these 10 airports, you'll be paying much more than that in landing fees. Website The Richest has compiled a list of the most expensive airports for landing fees, which are based on the 767-400 aircraft, which can hold up to 50 passengers but is often customised for private use. Surprisingly, the three most expensive airports for landing fees are in Japan. By far the most expensive airport is Haneda Airport, also known as Tokyo International Airport, where planes are charged a whopping £4,559 ($6,850) just for the privilege of landing. Welcoming almost 69million passengers a year, and still maintaining an incredibly high punctuality rating, it is perhaps understandable that fees can be high. Tokyo's Narita International Airprot comes second, charging £3,728 ($5,600), while Kansai International Airport in Osaka charges £3,594 ($5,400) per landing. Number eight on the list of the most expensive airport landing fees is Dublin Airport at £2,729 . Somewhat surprisingly, the UK's Bristol Airport makes it into the top 10 as the only British airport featured, charging £2,929 ($4,400) per private jet landing, just behind Toronto in Canada and Darwin, Australia. The only US airport to make it into the top 10 is LaGuardia, in New York, which charges $3,950 (£2,630) for private jets arriving in the city.

"Carriers of the BRCA1 gene, like Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, can reduce their risk of death once they have been diagnosed with breast cancer by having their ovaries removed . Women diagnosed with breast cancer caused by the gene carried by Angelina Jolie could be helped to beat the disease if they have their ovaries removed as she did. A study indicates that following the example of the Hollywood star cuts their risk of dying from breast cancer by more than 60 per cent. Miss Jolie, 39, had the procedure, known as an oophorectomy, in March. Two years before, she had a double mastectomy as she carries the BRCA1 gene variant which dramatically raises the risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. Women who carry a mutated version of BRCA1 or another gene known as BRCA2 face a life-time risk of breast cancer of up to 70 per cent. If diagnosed, they face a severe threat of ovarian tumours. The researchers in Canada analysed 676 breast cancer patients who had one of the mutated genes, Nearly half (345) underwent oophorectomy after their diagnosis. The study found the 20-year survival rate for the entire group was 77.4 per cent. Having an oophorectomy was associated with a significant drop of 62 per cent in breast cancer death in women with a BRCA1 mutation, But this did not occur in those with a BRCA2 mutation. There were nine deaths from ovarian cancer in the women who did not have oophorectomies. The scientists found a 65 per cent reduction in death from all causes associated with oophorectomy. According to the study, oophorectomies were performed an average of six years after breast cancer diagnosis. For the 70 BRCA1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years, there was a 73 per cent reduction in death compared with women with the mutation who never underwent the procedure. The authors, writing in the journal JAMA Oncology, said that the protective effect of oophorectomy against breast cancer was apparent immediately after diagnosis and lasted for 15 years. Dr Steven Narod, of the Women’s College Research Institute, Toronto, called for follow-up studies on women who undergo oophorectomy as part of their initial treatment, in particular, those who had the surgery within a year of finding out they have breast cancer. He added that more research was needed, especially on carriers of the BRCA2 variant. Journal editor Dr Mary Disis said the results were ‘compelling and suggest the potential of oophorectomy should become part of the treatment discussion at the time of diagnosis for BRCA mutation carriers with early stage breast cancers’. She added: ‘The results provide a validation of oophorectomy in coveying both a disease-free and overall survival benefit for BRCA1 carriers. ‘In the entire group, oophorectomy was particularly effective for survival benefit in women with oestrogen-receptor negative breast cancer.’ Those women diagnosed with the BRCA1 gene mutation have a 50 to 80 per cent risk of developing breast cancer, pictured, in their lifetime . Women with a significant family history of breast cancer may have an increased risk of getting the disease. A significant family history is defined by: . Women who inherit the faulty, or mutated, BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime. Genetic tests are available to women who are likely to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, or faults in two other genes called TP53 and PTEN. BRCA gene faults are more common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, about 2.3 per cent of Ashkenazi Jewish women have a BRCA gene mutation. Source: Breast Cancer Campaign . This type of the disease affects about one in four women diagnosed with breast cancer. It is an especially aggressive form which is often resilient to drug treatment and requires intensive chemotherapy. Other studies of the gene mutation carriers have found that reduced mortality is associated with ovary removal for women with a history of breast cancer. Speaking about her decision to have the procedure Miss Jolie, who has six children, said that having her ovaries removed did not make her feel any less womanly. In an article for the New York Times, she wrote: ‘I feel feminine, and grounded in the choices I am making for myself and my family.’","Carriers of BRCA1 gene mutation who are diagnosed with breast cancer are less likely to die if they have their ovaries removed, study found .
But the theory does not apply for those with BRCA2 gene mutation .
Having the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes increase risk of breast cancer by 70% .
Experts said benefits of having ovaries removed lasted for up to 15 years ."
"The adoptive grandparents of a Texas toddler who died after a brutal beating last month are speaking out against the boy's mother, who they say didn't do enough to protect her son from her boyfriend. Christian Tyrrell, 22, was arrested Wednesday on capital murder charges in connection to the March 19 death of 2-year-old Adrian Langlais, the son of his girlfriend Jessica Langlais. John Winkler and Laura Martinez considered themselves Adrian's grandparents, even though they weren't blood related to the little boy. Martinez's son - Winkler's stepson - started dating Langlais when she was six-months pregnant with Adrian and they continued to babysit the toddler when the two eventually broke up. In a heartbreaking interview with the Star-Telegram, the couple said they started noticing bruises on Adrian last fall, when Langlais started dating Tyrrell, and say the mother ignored them when they voiced concern. Eventually, they reported Adrian's injuries to Child Protective Services, but the agency closed the investigation in February, ruling out abuse from Adrian's parents or Tyrrell. A little over a month later, Adrian was dead. Scroll down for video . Abused: Christian Tyrrell, 22 (left), was arrested Wednesday on charges of murdering 2-year-old Adrian Langlais (right), the son of his girlfriend Jessica Langlais (center) Now Winkler and Martinez, who are now separated but remain friends, are working together to bring justice for the boy they considered family. While they are happy to see Tyrrell's arrest, both want CPS and Langlais held accountable for the role they played in Adrian's death. 'They left the child vulnerable. They made that decision and they made the wrong decision,' Winkler told the Star Telegram. Winkler and Martinez first met Langlais in late 2012, when she started dating Martinez's son. At the time, she was carrying Adrian, her son with former boyfriend Ulises Hererra. When Langlais gave birth three months later, Winkler and Martinez considered Adrian their grandson and started babysitting when his mother went back to work. At one point, Langlais broke up with Martinez's son and briefly got back together with Adrian's father. All the while, the couple continued their relationship with Langlais in order to be a part of Adrian's life. But last fall, both became seriously concerned when they noticed bruises and other injuries on the little boy's body after Langlais started dating Tyrrell. Adrian (right) died in the hospital on March 19,  the day after his second birthday, from head trauma. Tyrrell (left) has been accused of causing those injuries . 'I start noticing a change in Adrian's behavior,' Winkler said. 'He's starting to hit me in the face. Sometimes when she brings him over, he's like in shock. … He clings to me. I'm telling her [Langlais], ""I don't know what the deal is but there's something going on here.""' When they told Langlais about the marks, she dismissed them saying he got them roughhousing with some other children at Tyrrell's mother house. After highlighting the injuries with Hererra, the boy's biological father, and a lawyer, the two decided to go against Langlais' wishes and make a report to CPS on December 23. Three days later, they became even more concerned when Tyrrell came over to their house to pick up Adrian, and the boy appeared scared to leave. 'He immediately ran to me, grabbed me … and was holding on,' Winkler said. 'He would look over and look away from him, and he started crying. He dug into my arm with his little fingernails so much it broke the skin.' And then Tyrrell became angry when Winkler told him he would drop the boy off himself when Langlais got home. Winkler says Tyrrell went straight to Langlais' work, and she started sending Winkler a slew of text messages, chastising him for not handing Adrian over to her boyfriend. Laura Martinez (left) and John Winkler (right), who consider themselves adoptive grandparents of Adrian, say they started noticing bruises on the boy in November, when Langlais started dating Tyrrell . 'John you can't make decisions like that. I am his mother,' Langlais texted Winkler, in messages he shared with the Star-Telegram. 'And if you keep this up I'm gonna have to make other arrangement for Adrian.' Winkler went on to say that he loved Adrian and was just trying to do what's best for the boy. 'John I don't appreciate you insinuating that Christian is harmful to me and my child, Christian loves Adrian and is really good with him,' Langlais continued . 'Adrian is frightened of him, that is a fact … I am concerned you do not realize it,' Winkler replied. 'That's your opinion. Please mind your own business,' Langlais said. Shortly after that, Langlais banned Winkler from spending time with Adrian. Winkler says CPS never called to interview him after he reported the potential abuse at the end of December, and says he had to follow up in order to speak to an officer about his concerns. In a meeting on February 9, a CPS worker assured Winkler that the family was under investigation. But shortly after, the case was closed and Adrian's parents and Tyrrell were cleared of any wrongdoing. Winkler (above) made a report to Child Protective Services at the end of December, but the case was closed in February with Adrian's parents and Tyrrell being cleared of any wrong doing . Then, just a month later on March 18, Adrian's second birthday, the boy was rushed to the hospital after seizing in Tyrrell's care. Healthcare workers at the hospital reported that the boy showed signs of severe head trauma including multiple skull fractures, bleeding on the brain and swelling around the eyes, neck and head. There was also bruises and bite marks on his body. He died the next day. In separate interviews with police, both Adrian's mother and Tyrrell  said that the boy started acting strange the day before, after Tyrrell put the boy in a time out for not eating his lunch. Langlais says she heard Tyrrell yell at the boy after taking him into another room where his playpen was, and that Adrian immediately stopped crying or making noise. 'You need to start acting better. You know you need to eat,' Tyrrell says he told the boy, according to police. He added that Adrian was 'pretty pissed' off after being spanked and put in time out. Langlais says her boyfriend went back into the room about 10 to 20 minutes later and when Adrian was brought out, he had bruises on his face and his eyes kept rolling back. Tyrrell told his girlfriend and police that when he went back into the room, he found Adrian laying on the ground outside of the playpen as if he had crawled out and fell backwards. That night, Langlais says her son vomited and had a hard time standing on his own. And when she tried to feed him a slice of banana the next morning, he couldn't keep food down. She last saw Adrian when Tyrrell dropped her off at work around 10:30am and the boy was leaning his head against the side of his car seat 'like he couldn't move it' and only opened his eyes when his mom came to kiss him goodbye. Tyrrell's version of events differs slightly from Langlais', in that he claimed the boy could stand up and was acting normally after finding him on the ground next tot he playpen.  He does admit that the boy later vomited and appeared 'sleepy' but says the next morning Adrian was awake, talking and 'having fun'. While Winkler and Martinez are happy with Tyrrell's arrest, the two say they want to see CPS and Langlais held accountable for the role they plated in Adrian's death . Internet searches reveal that Tyrrell was more concerned that night than what he descirbed to police. Just after 11pm on March 17, someone searched on his phone 'how to tell if someone has went brain dead'. Similar searches continued that night and into the next morning, about head injuries, concussions, and 'toddler can't walk or use right side after hitting head'. After dropping Langlais off at work, Tyrrell says he played with the boy back and home. Around 1pm, 14 hours after his first suspicious cell phone search, Tyrrell called 911 and told a dispatcher that he saw Adrian 'stagger', fall and then roll his eyes. On Wednesday, Tyrrell was arrested on capital murder charges for allegedly inflicting injuries that caused Adrian's death. He is currently being held on $1million bond. In an attempt to bring Adrian'smother and CPS to justice, Winkler has created a Facebook page and written to multiple local politicians. While he is sad to lose Adrian, Winkler says he is comforted by the fact that the little boy can no longer be abused. 'To know he's gone is breaking me,' Martinez said in a recent interview. 'But on the other hand, I'm happy because he's not here anymore. He didn't deserve the life these people were giving to him. I'm glad he's with God.","Adrian Langlais died on March 19, the day after his second birthday, from head injuries allegedly caused by his mother's boyfriend Christian Tyrrell .

"This is the moment when a not-so-little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle. Charlene Fritz, 35, was visiting  Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach. Despite being no more than two months old, the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs, and Ms Fritz had a struggle sitting upright. Scroll down for video . One big cuddle: The elephant seal is thought to have been no more than two months old, but at a whopping 200lbs, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz still struggled to reciprocate the hug . Making friends: Ms Fritz had the surprise of a lifetime when the baby elephant seal came out of the water for a cuddle during an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula . Will you be my mummy? Elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at just one month to learn how to take care of themselves . Charlene, from Saskatchewan, Canada, said: 'The seal climbed on top of me without hesitation. We shared a very sweet moment in time I will never forget. 'Her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into. Like the deepest depths of the sea. I could have stared into her eyes forever.' She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath. She had never even eaten a fish at that point in her life. Rules: Ms Fritz explains that she badly wanted to hug the baby seal, but that regulations on the Antarctic expedition dictated that she in no way touch the pup .

Two young elephant selas have a rest on the shore of Snow Hill Island, Antarctic Peninsula . Charlene, whose 2011 encounter with the seal was filmed by a friend, had at first wondered why the seal was so friendly but later learned about the harsh weaning process. She said: 'Basically the mother fattens them up with her milk for a month or so, then abandons them on the beach. 'They have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea. 'This is why they can be so sweet and looking for love, I guess.' However, an encounter with a full-grown elephant would have been a different prospect. Males of the species can weigh up to two tonnes and are known to have a nasty temper during mating season as the battle to control harems of females.","The two-month-old baby seal came up for a hug on Antarctic Peninsula .

"Caller ID as we know it could be getting a revamp. Facebook has launched a new app called Hello designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers. Scroll down for video . Facebook has launched a new app called Hello (pictured) designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers . The free app is currently in testing and is only available on Android devices in the US. It is expected to roll out to other regions and devices if testing is successful. 'Billions of calls are made everyday on mobile phones and people often have very little information about who’s calling them,' explained Facebook's product manager Andrea Vaccari in a blog post. Facebook has tweaked its News Feed setting to make posts from friends more prominent. The rules about seeing multiple posts from the same person in a row have been relaxed to show more from friends. Content posted directly by friends who people interact with more or have a direct relationship with will now appear higher up  in News Feed so they are less likely to miss it. The latest update will also make posts and Pages that friends have liked and commented on appear lower down. Facebook said: 'The goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you. 'This means we need to give you the right mix of updates from friends and businesses. 'This balance is different for everyone [and] as more people and pages are sharing more content, we need to keep improving News Feed to get this balance right.' 'Today we are starting to test Hello, a new app built by the Messenger team. 'Hello connects with Facebook so you can see who’s calling, block unwanted calls and search for people and places.' When a user receives a call, Hello shows them info about who’s calling, even if they don’t have that number saved. Users will only see information that people have already shared on Facebook, and not everyone links their mobile number to their account so this could be the app's downfall. Callers must also have a Facebook account in order for the data to be shared but they don't necessarily have to be logged in at the time of the call. They also don't need to have Hello installed, either. Another feature of Hello includes making it easier to block unwanted calls. From the settings menu in Hello people can block specific numbers and adjust whether they want to automatically block calls from commonly blocked numbers. This is useful for blocking company phone numbers or spam callers, for example, and blocked calls go straight to voicemail. When a user receives a call Hello shows them info about who’s calling, even if they don’t have that number saved (pictured left). Hello also makes it easier to block unwanted calls and see which numbers have been blocked from other users (pictured right) in the app's settings menu . The list of blocked calls can also be reviewed in the recent calls list. If a call is made and the number isn't linked to a Facebook account,  Hello simply shows the number like a traditional caller ID. However, if other users have blocked this number the number of times it has been blocked is also shown. Elsewhere, when users search for people and businesses on Facebook they can call them with  one tap when Hello is installed. And in the case of searching for businesses, Hello will also show opening hours and web addresses where possible, on the user's screen.","When a user receives a call, Hello will show them info about who’s calling .
This includes any public information collated from their Facebook profile .

"The common ancestor of humans may have had tentacles, a scientist has claimed. Organisms that lived in the sea 635 to 541 million years ago, from which humans and other animals evolved, likely had flexible appendages and a complex nervous system. It seemingly puts to bed another theory that suggests our ancestors were much more simple, worm-like creatures. A Russian scientist says the distant ancestor of humans had tentacles. One such creature can be seen at the centre of this illustration. They lived more than 540 million years ago and used them for food. It's likely they also had a complex nervous system like we do today . The latest research was conducted by Dr Elena Temereva from the Department of Invertebrate Zoology at the Faculty of Biology of the Lomonosov Moscow State University. Today, humans and many other organisms are bilaterally symmetric - we have a clearly discernible top and bottom, and a left and a right. However, our distant ancestors hundreds of millions ago were not, with many of them thought to be worm-like creatures that swam in the seas or walked on the seafloor. A warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe 1.4 million years ago, a new study suggests. Researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors, the hominins, had been halted by colder and drier temperatures. But as conditions warmed, they were able to branch out from Africa into Spain, and ultimately spread across Europe. The research was led by Dr Jordi Agusti from the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA). How we evolved into bilateral creatures, and what we evolved from, has been a cause of some debate. One theory suggests that our common bilaterian ancestor was a worm without appendages and just a simple nervous system. Dr Temereva’s research, though, favours a different theory. She says that our ancestors had appendages - or tentacles - that were used for movement and food collection. And, she says, they also had a complex nervous system. To come to her conclusion she studied Lingula anatina, an ancient brachiopod found all over the world. Lingula is one of the oldest brachiopods having survived to the present day, originating in the Early Ordovician era 500 million years ago. For that reason, and as it has hardly changed over geological time, it is often referred to as a ‘living fossil’ of organisms in the distant past. Today, humans and many other organisms are bilaterally symmetric; we have a clearly discernible top and bottom, and a left and a right - such as depicted in da Vinci's The Vitruvian Man, shown left. Dr Elena Temereva came to her conclusion by studying the 'living fossil' Lingula anatina, shown right . ‘By virtue of the fact that there are tentacles among the two main taxons of bilaterally symmetrical animals, it is logical to assume that the common ancestor also had them,’ said Dr Temereva. ‘It means that the common ancestor of chordate animals [such as mammals, fish and birds] including people also had tentacles.’ She said that, therefore, it could be assumed that our ancestors had tentacular appendages. It is hoped that this research will help to more accurately classify various species.# . The results are published in the journal Plos One.","Russian scientist says distant ancestor of humans had tentacles .

"Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia put on a united front today, as they stepped out for the first time since explosive new claims about the 47-year-old monarch's father emerged. According to a new book by a former royal correspondent, the former King Juan Carlos II had a long-running affair with a German socialite during the final decade of his reign. But if Felipe and Letizia were upset about the revelations, they certainly weren't showing it as they arrived at the University of Alcala de Henares to present the Cervantes Prize for Literature. Scroll down for video . Claims: King Felipe and Queen Letizia present a united front following the latest Spanish royal scandal . Walking arm-in-arm with his 42-year-old wife, King Felipe, who took the Spanish throne last June, kept a straight face as he approached photographers. Later, as a group of ukulele-wielding students appeared to serenade the royal couple, Felipe even managed a small smile. Well-hidden though any private anguish may have been, the news will have undoubtedly come as a blow to the Spanish royal who has been attempting to overhaul the image of the monarchy in Spain since taking the throne. His father Juan-Carlos was famous for his love of freebies, even, on one occasion, accepting a yacht called Fortuna as a gift. Not good: A new book by journalist Ana Romero (left) says King Juan-Carlos had a decade-long affair . Divorce: It also claimed that Juan-Carlos contemplated divorcing Felipe's mother, Queen Sofia . Unruffled: The Spanish royal couple kept any worries about the allegations under wraps during the visit . Light relief: Felipe managed a small smile while being serenaded by a group of student musicians . In June 2012, with the Spanish economy in crisis and unemployment running at close to 50 per cent among the young, Juan-Carlos was photographed enjoying a lavish hunting safari in Botswana. The trip, which was not announced in advance, only became known to Spanish taxpayers when the 77-year-old was injured and had to charter a special plane in order to get home. Juan-Carlos' African jaunt, a freebie paid for by Syrian businessman Mohamed Eyad Kayali, led to widespread calls for his abdication, which he did less than a year later. Since taking the Spanish throne, Felipe has introduced a new code of conduct  which  bans royals from accepting lavish gifts and also outlaws private business activity - the latter in response to a fraud scandal that  enmeshed his sister Infanta Cristina in 2010. He has also included a stipulation that insists members of the Spanish royal family behave at all times in ways likely to 'please' and 'earn them the gratitude of'  the public. Blow: The  scandal is a set-back for Felipe who has been trying to change public perception of the monarchy . Freebies: Felipe's new rules include banning all royals, among them wife Letizia, from taking freebies . Behaviour: Royals are expected to behave in a way that earns them the gratitude of the Spanish public . Despite Felipe's best efforts, his father's legacy remains troublesome - in particular his record of extramarital affairs. Most recently, a Belgian woman named Ingrid Sartiau filed a paternity suit against him - a case only made possible because of his abdication. Juan-Carlos is also believed to have a second illegitimate son, Alberto Sola who was born in 1956 and lives in Barcelona. The latest scandal focuses on the final decade of his reign with Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, a German 28 years his junior, claiming to have had a lengthy affair with the royal. Speaking to Ana Romero, a former royal correspondent and the author of a new book called Final De Partida [End Game], Ms Sayn-Wittgenstein claimed that Juan-Carlos had contemplated divorcing his wife Queen Sofia in order to marry her.","King Felipe was making his first appearance since the claims emerged .

Expensive taste: This historic house in one of Britain's most exclusive postcodes is up for sale for £6.95million. Walton Canonry has been home to prominent figures of the church and the arts for nearly 300 years but is now on the market with property agent Savills . Inspiring view: The incredible view of Salisbury Cathedral from the front of the 18th century home that comes complete with 1.6 acres . Work of art: The painting inspired by a view from the meadow that was bought by The Tate for 23.1million in May 2013 . Built around 1720, it was named after Isaac Walton, son of the writer Izaak who wrote The Compleat Angler and lived in the medieval house that occupied the site beforehand. Cathedral Close was frequented by Constable in the 1820s after his close personal friend, the Bishop of Salisbury, commissioned him for another painting, Salisbury Cathedral From The Bishop's Grounds. But he later created the more dramatic painting from the meadow with an ominous sky that many art experts believe reflected the turbulent state of his life at the time. Walton Canonry is also known as Whistler's House, because it was home to the prominent 20th century painter Rex Whistler, who leased the home and featured many local landmarks in his work. The first freehold owner was Lesley MacDonagh, one of the City's top legal figures, who bought it in 2007 for £3.7million and after a painstaking renovation, made a £2.55million profit when she sold it for £6.3million to the current owners who run a charitable foundation. Through the keyhole: This is one of the luxurious rooms in Walton Cannonry, stylishly decorated in off-white with gold and wood trim . The wood-panelled walls are an insight into the tastes of the wealthy and powerful people throughout history who have lived in this classic home. Among the previous owners are artist Rex Whistler and author Leslie Thomas . Pristine gardens from the back of the property. With a water feature, perfectly trimmed hedges and paths arched with brick and trellis, the garden is one of the luxurious home's best features . The house, which is 8,147 sq ft, has six bedrooms, two kitchens, a drawing room, dining room, study, office, library, media room and wine cellar, as well as a separate guest wing with its own sitting room, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. It has spectacular views on both sides - towards the cathedral at the front and at the back the landscaped gardens lead to the River Avon and the water meadows beyond. Charles Stone from Savills, who are selling the property, said the house has a broad appeal, but the new owner will need deep pockets. He said houses in the close are so popular because you get the best of town and country living. Mr Stone added: 'It is quite rare to get a house like this on the market. There are probably about half a dozen houses of this value in the close. 'Some are still leasehold but a lot of the bigger ones now tend to be freehold. 'They all tend to front onto the river, which is nice, and a lot of them are very architecturally beautiful, which makes them very popular. 'But more than anything, what you're really buying is a slice of town and country. 'You've got the benefits of being within the enclave of the beautiful cathedral close but you're only a moment's walking distance into the city where you have access to all the amenities. 'And if you look the other way you've got beautiful gardens, the river and the water meadows, that's one of the reasons they are often very sought-after. 'This particular house is presented in immaculate order, everything is completely up-to-date and renovated, without ruining the character. 'It has quite a broad appeal - perhaps someone from London, or an ex-pat coming back from abroad. It could suit someone downsizing from a big estate or appeal to someone with a growing family.

"Nasa claims we'll find aliens in the next 10 to 20 years – and now the agency is revving up its efforts to track them down. The group has put together a team of 'extraterrestrial experts' to see if any of the planets discovered outside our solar system are habitable. And it says that amateur astronomers could help with its 'unprecedented' search for ET by accessing research data online. Scroll down for video . The Nexss team, includes those who study Earth as a life-bearing planet (lower right), those researching the diversity of solar system planets (left), and those on the new frontier, discovering worlds orbiting other stars in the galaxy (upper right) The initiative, dubbed Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (Nexss), will include scientists from 10 universities including Stanford, the University of California and Yale. The study of exoplanets is a relatively new field, and began with the discovery of the first exoplanet around a star like our sun in 1995. Since the launch of the Kepler space telescope six years ago, more than 1,000 exoplanets have been found, with thousands of additional candidates waiting to be confirmed. Nasa has set up a website for the public called Planet Hunters which allows anyone to search the data gathered by Kepler, which launched six years ago. Scientists are also developing new ways to confirm the habitability of these worlds and search for biosignatures, or signs of life. During a talk last month, Nasa said humanity will encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, (pictured) at a Washington panel discussion . By applying a 'system science' approach, the team hopes to understand an alien planet's biology interacts with the atmosphere, geology, oceans, and interior of a planet. The announcement comes just weeks after Nasa's top scientist predicted we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington last month, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. Alien hunters from the University of Berkeley, California and Stanford are tasked with answering the question: 'What are the properties of exoplanetary systems, as they relate to their formation, evolution, and potential to harbour life?' They will combine astronomical observations of exoplanets and forming planetary systems with powerful computer simulations and cutting-edge microscopic studies of meteorites. The team from Arizona State University in Phoenix will take a similar approach. This research group will place planetary habitability in a chemical context, with the goal of producing a 'periodic table of planets.' Researchers from Hampton University, Virginia, will be exploring the sources and sinks for volatiles on habitable worlds. This research will help determine the past and present habitability of Mars and even Venus. The team centered at Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies will investigate habitability on a more local scale. It will examine the habitability of solar system rocky planets through time. The team from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut,  will design new spectrometers - optical instruments that measure the spectrum of light - with the stability to reach Earth-detecting precision for nearby stars. A group led the University of Nebraska-Kearney will explore the existence and evolution of exospheres around exoplanets, the outer, 'unbound' portion of a planet's atmosphere. From the University of California, Santa Cruz, a group will investigate how novel maths equations can be used to extract information from light that is emitted and reflected by planetary atmospheres. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, said. 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' The announcement was prompted by the recent discovery of water by Nasa in surprising places. Jim Green, director of planetary science at Nasa, noted that a recent study of the Martian atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep. Scientists using the Hubble recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter's moon Ganymede (pictured) has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice . The same study found that water had been present on the red planet for up to 1.2 billion year. 'We think that long period of time is necessary for life to get more complex,' Stofan said. Nasa associate administrator John Grunsfeld said he is excited about seeing what form life beyond Earth may take. In their hunt for alien life, astronomers have so far focused on looking for Earth-like planets around smaller, cooler suns. But these exoplanets - despite having a chance of holding water - are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which causes only one side of their surface face the star. Now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars, and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day-night cycle similar to Earth – increasing the chance of finding alien life. Planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to Earth's than previously expected,' said Jérémy Leconte, a postdoctoral fellow at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) at the University of Toronto. 'If we are correct, there is no permanent, cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet,' he said. 'Whether this new understanding of exoplanets' climate increases the ability of these planets to develop life remains an open question.' 'Once we get beyond Mars, which formed from the same stuff as Earth, the likelihood that life is similar to what we find on this planet is very low,' he said. 'I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation [away] on a planet around a nearby star. At the same conference last year, Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden made a more conservative estimate. He claimed that we will find life within the next 20 years - with a high chance it will be outside our solar system. Nasa next Mars rover, scheduled to launch in 2020, will search for signs of past life and bring samples for a possible return to Earth for analysis. Nasa also hopes to land astronauts on Mars in the 2030s, which Stofan says is crucial key to the search for Mars life. 'I'm a field geologist; I go out and break open rocks and look for fossils,' Stofan said. 'Those are hard to find. 'So I have a bias that it's eventually going to take humans on the surface of Mars — field geologists, astrobiologists, chemists — actually out there looking for that good evidence of life that we can bring back to Earth for all the scientists to argue about.' The space agency is also planning a mission to Europa, which may launch as early as 2022. It hopes to find out whether the icy moon is habitable. Meanwhile, the agency's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will launch in 2018 to scope out the atmospheres of nearby 'super-Earth' alien planets. New Horizons took this image of the icy moon Europa rising above Jupiter's cloud tops. The space agency is planning a mission to Europa, which may launch as early as 2022, to find out whether the moon is habitable .","Alien search team, dubbed Nexss, includes scientists from 10 universities .

"This is the moment when an angry woman forced an elderly man to kneel in the street after he accidentally knocked her phone out of her hand. The video, filmed at an undisclosed location in China, sees the woman demand that the man pays compensation for her damaged phone as she slaps him in the middle of a busy road. Despite the elderly man promising to pay her back once he has the means to do so, she continues to berate him in front of witnesses, the People's Daily Online reports. Scroll down for video . Street attack: The shocking video was filmed after the elderly man knocked the woman's phone out of her hand, causing the screen to break . The shocking exchange was filmed by a witness and it had since gone viral on Chinese social media. The woman had allegedly been taking pictures of her children with her new iPhone 6 plus when the old man passed through on his moped. He accidentally bumped into the woman’s shoulder and her phone fell on the ground, and the screen cracked, the newspaper reports. The woman demanded the old man to compensate for repairing her phone, which he promised to do, but adding that it would have to wait as he did not have the money there and then. ‘The old man’s voice was trembling and he had tears in his eyes,’ a witnesses said, describing how the woman called four friends to the scene. Abuse: After being told that the man does not have the money to pay her back straight away, she is seen slapping him twice in the street . In the clip, the woman can be heard demanding that he pays her on the spot, despite his assurance that she will be compensated eventually . ‘The young woman’s friends hit the old man’s hat constantly and discussed whether they should really hit him,’the witness said. After a long verbal argument between the young woman and the old man, she is said to have demanded: ‘Kneel down for apology, then I will forget the money!’ The old man allegedly came off his moped, falling over as he kneeled down. 'His disability became apparent to the crowd but the young woman’s action became more infuriating,' a witness said. ‘The young lady just stood in front of the old man and slapped him twice.' In the clip, the woman can be heard demanding that he pays her on the spot, despite his assurance that she will be compensated eventually. Although no one called the police, the authority has investigated further after the clip went online. A user, posting under the username ‘The girl who sells tea eggs’, wrote: It was the old man’s fault that he bumped into the young woman but this is definitely not a reason to slap someone. 'The old man has to pay a compensation for sure but they could have called the police to settle the matter. If you stand in the old man’s shoes, you would be very angry as well. How can one compare the value of a phone and the old man’s dignity? How can people be so cold-hearted?

"A Florida university is investigating the death of a student who drowned in Daytona Beach to determine whether or not hazing was involved. Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, was reported missing after going swimming with student s at 3am on Sunday and students who were with him said strong currents pulled Parks out to sea. His body was found Monday morning. Students who were with Parks, who were all part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience, which formed last year, said no hazing was involved. Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, drowned in Daytona Beach on Sunday after going for a swim with friends at 3am. He was pulled out to see by a strong current and his body was later found on Monday morning . But Bethune-Cookman University is investigating Parks death after university administration 'heard rumors' that hazing was involved. Parks and the men he was swimming with were part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience, which formed last year . A Bethune-Cookman spokeswoman Keisha Boyd said that the university administration had 'heard rumors' about hazing and that Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue is investigating the student's death, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Parks' mother, Carolyn Parks, said she didn't know why her son would decide to swim in the ocean. 'I don't know why it happened, why he would go into the water like this, because he is not a good swimmer,' she told WESH 2. 'And I had talked to him just before he came out here and he told me he was tired and was going to rest, not knowing he was going to come out here to the beach.' Damian Parks is the second son Carolyn Parks has had to mourn in recent months. Her 16-year-old son died in Miami six months ago. Parks was with four other men in about 5ft of water near Sun Splash Park when he lost grip of a friend's clothing and a the current pulled him out to sea, according to a U.S. Coast Guard report. Parks' friends said that there was 'no foul play at all' and that is was not hazing. They added that the group was 'having fun' and that Parks had not been drinking before the incident . Uamil Turner, who was at the beach, said 'it wasn't hazing', and he was unsure where the rumor came from. Marquise Nelson, who was also at the beach with Parks, said that there 'was no foul play at all'. 'Damian didn't do anything he didn't want to do, and everyone knew that,' Nelson told the News-Journal. 'Everyone was having fun.' Parks friends said that the student had not been drinking the night he drowned nor was he impaired in any way. Deputy Chief Ray Manchester of Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue said there's no sign of hazing in the incident and that the men had, however, been out bar-hopping before going for a swim. He added that he believed 'they may have been drinking' and that the ocean was rough when the men entered the water. Students and staff at Bethune-Cookman University mourned Parks' death during a prayer vigil held on Monday after the student's body was found . The university said that though the investigation is ongoing, it still wants to celebrate Parks' life and support his family 'in this most difficult time' The university is investigating into hazing, while Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue is assisting with toxicology and witness statements, Manchester said. Bethune-Cookman spokeswoman Boyd said that though the investigation was ongoing, the university is still celebrating Parks' life. 'Once any additional information is provided by the Beach Patrol, the University will issue another statement. While information regarding the events of April 20th are continuing to surface, we ask that the public join B-CU in supporting the Parks family in this most difficult time,' she said. The university held a prayer vigil on Monday, in which University President Edison Jackson planted a tree in Parks' memory. Students at the vigil said that Parks 'never stopped laughing' and was both talented and artistic. During Monday's vigil, University President Edison planted a tree in Parks' memory.

"It was once the edgiest place in town, attracting the word's biggest bands to its iconic stage - but 30 years later Cleveland's Variety Theater is silent. The venue was renowned for its rock concerts but everything changed in 1984 when heavy metal band Motorhead played a gig so loud it literally began to bring the house down. As the crowd went wild over the group's unique ear-shattering brand of music, the ceiling cracked and pieces of plaster began to fall on the audience - ending the concert and the life of the Variety Theater in one deafening shriek. Abandoned for 30 years: The Variety Theater in Cleveland was once a buzzing music venue but was closed down after the ceiling cracked during a Motorhead gig in 1984 . The power was cut off to stop the band from playing and two years later a judge ordered the theater to be sealed off for good. Built in 1927, The Variety Theater was home to one of the earliest single screen cinemas in Cleveland, Ohio, before becoming an iconic music venue. The 20,000 sq ft main stage hosted the likes of  Metallica, the Dead Kennedy's and R.E.M. before Motorhead's fatal performance on December 2 1984. Since then it has stayed abandoned and hidden from public eye until now, thirty years later, a photographer has captured a collection of eery images offering a fascinating glimpse into music history. Seph Lawless, the 37-year-old photojournalist from Cleveland who took these incredible pictures, said: 'I'm Cleveland born and raised and I've always been into rock and roll. 'This theater has gone down in folklore in my hometown and it always had that air of mystery when we were kids growing up. Crumbling and rotting remains: The once-iconic Ohio venue was sealed off on the order of a judge in 1986, two years after Motorhead's gig . 'It was really inspiring to go in and photograph the theater, it's something I've always wanted to do and at times it actually felt like I was stepping back in time. 'I love rock and roll music so it was just incredible, it was like a time capsule to that era and that all the bands who performed there were captured in the fabric of the building.' Seph is a photojournalist specialising in nostalgic pictures. He recently completed a trip around the United States where he took photographs of abandoned or neglected buildings in every state. Due to the efforts of The Friends of the Historic Variety Theater, an organization that owns the huge building, a scheme to regenerate the venue have been given a new lease of life. The group is said to have plans to spruce up the theater section of the building, turning it into a music venue once more. Slow decay of time: Many of the theater's wooden seats have fallen into disrepair while the staircase shows the effects of years of decay . Renowned venue: Before its closure, the theater hosted concerts from bands including Metallica, the Dead Kennedy's and R.E.M. Hidden from view: The stunning pictures were taken by 37-year-old photojournalist Seph Lawless, who has lived in Cleveland all his life . Silent halls: The walls are cracked and chipped and the tiles on the floor have rotted after three decades of abandonment . Ruled to be unsafe: The venue was closed after the ceiling cracked and pieces of plaster began to fall on the audience during a 1984 gig . Open for half a century: Built in 1927, The Variety Theater was home to one of the earliest single screen cinemas in Cleveland, Ohio, before becoming an iconic music venue . Regeneration: The Friends of the Historic Variety Theater have plans to spruce up the theater section of the building and rent out the structure’s eight retail store-fronts . Dated equipment: Most of the building's machinery has been languishing for years since the venue's unfortunate closure . 1920s-style décor: The theater had kept its vintage style for decades and left everything untouched when it was sealed up in 1986 . Enticing: Mr Lawless said the theater 'has gone down in folklore' in Cleveland and always 'had that air of mystery' to it when he was a child .

"Unite baron Len McCluskey has boasted that trade unions ‘own’ the Labour party and its policies. ‘The Labour Party is our party. We built it, to serve us’, he declared and went on to say: ‘These are our policies…they are now within our grasp.’ The boast comes only 24 hours after Alex Salmond bragged that he would be writing Labour’s budget. The arrogant claim by the former Scottish first minister, who is running as an SNP candidate, was featured on the front page of yesterday’s Mail. Unite boss Len McCluskey, pictured, boasted that the trade union movement 'owns' the Labour Party . The intervention of Mr McCluskey, so soon after Mr Salmond’s mocking remarks, is another humiliation for Ed Miliband. It comes in a foreword to Unite’s magazine. Mr McCluskey urges his members to ‘take back our country’ and ‘restore decency, dignity and justice’. He says: ‘The Labour party is our party. We built it, to serve us, the people. Never forget, the rich and powerful have their party, the Tories. And Ukip is no friend – they are frauds, charlatans who will roll back every advance won by working people. ‘One May 7, we can vote for a government that will build homes, give our kids hope, save our NHS and attack the evil of zero hours, hire and fire working. ‘These are our policies. These are the changes that you have been fighting for these five long years. They are now within our grasp.’ He goes on to warn: ‘Do not for a moment forget this: should Cameron and his cronies win on May 7, they will change our nation forever – but not for better. ‘Cuts that will take us back to the darkest days of the 1930s. Attacks on unions will place us in chains so we cannot defend you, our members.’ The article is Mr McCluskey’s first major intervention in the election campaign. Trade unions gave Labour £737,948 out of the £1.1million the party raised this week – the second week of the election campaign. This is the equivalent of £1.22 every second from trade union. Unite gave £112,000 according to official figures published by the Electoral Commission. But this was dwarfed by health workers’ union Unison’s £311,875 and the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers’ £300,481. However, last week Unite gave Labour £1million and has provided £14.4million since Mr Miliband won the Labour leadership. He was a surprise victor in the 2010 leadership election thanks largely to the support of the unions. The Labour leader was even serenaded by Unite’s brass band at a rally in Yorkshire yesterday. Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman, right, is a fully paid up member of the Unite trade union . Other Unite members looking for a seat in cabinet are Andy Burnham, pictured, and Chuka Umunna . Reflecting Unite’s own programme, the party plans to ban zero hours contracts, impose rent controls, raise the minimum wage, scrap job tribunal fees and part-renationalise the railways. Earlier this week it emerged that more than half of Labour candidates in winnable seats are sponsored by Unite. Unite has also called on Labour to restore the 50p top rate of tax, ditch the so-called bedroom tax, or spare room subsidy, end all austerity measures and increase borrowing. Mr McCluskey, a former dock worker who has clawed himself up to the top of the super-union, threatened to axe funding to Labour unless it adopted his socialist policies. Of the 106 target constituencies, Unite has endorsed or partly bankrolled 54 of the contenders. Harriet Harman, Andy Burnham and former banker Chuka Umunna are paid up members of Unite. Labour also received a £300,000 boost from Allamhouse Limited, a company owned by Egyptian tycoon Aseem Allam, who is worth a reputed £300million. Mr Allam, owner of the premier Hull City football club, said he was ‘not necessarily’ voting Labour but had donated to the party to reduce its reliance on the trade unions. He said: ‘I like Ed Miliband, he is an honest politician. He means every word he says. I just don’t like what the words he is saying.’ He added that politicians, in particular Labour, ‘should stop talking about the gap between rich and poor. If the gap becomes too small then you will have communism. The only way to lift the standard of living is to create more rich people. Otherwise you make everybody poor.’ He recently praised David Cameron and said the Conservatives had the ‘best’ economic plan. A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘We are grateful to all those who donate to the Labour Party. He added: ‘Unlike the Conservatives who increasingly rely on the money of hedge funds and an exclusive group of super rich donors… Labour is proud to be supported by millions of teachers, nurses, builders, plumbers, supermarket workers and many others.’ The Conservatives received money from 17 donors, of which 14 were individuals – accounting for £460,000 of the £492,512. Among them was Brevan Howard Asset Management hedge fund founder Christopher Rokos, who gave £170,000.","Unite boss Len McCluskey told members that Unions created Labour .

"ABC released a fourth promo video on Thursday on the eve of Bruce Jenner's sitdown interview with Diane Sawyer airing in which he is expected to talk about his gender transition. The 30-second clip opens with the 65-year-old former decathlete greeting Sawyer at his home. Bruce - the ex-husband of Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner - appears somewhat anxious as he tells the Sawyer: 'It's going to be an emotional rollercoaster, but somehow I'm gonna get through it.' Scroll down for video... Nervous: Bruce Jenner is seen greeting Diane Sawyer at his home in the latest promo video released on Thursday ahead of the airing of his sit-down interview in which he is expected to address gender transition . Resolute: The former decathlete tells the journalist that it is 'going to be an emotional rollercoaster but somehow I'm gonna get through it' The video then included a previously aired snippet of him talking about his family. 'I can't let myself hurt them. They're the only ones I'm concerned with,' the reality star says. The video then shoots to footage of Bruce's older children; Burt, 36 and Casey, 34, (from his marriage to Chrystie Crownover)  along with Brandon, 33, and Brody, 31, (from his marriage to Linda Thompson) who all appear in the latest snippet from the show. Another frame includes a photograph of him with daughter Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, along with his stepdaughters Kourtney, 36, Kim, 34, and Khloe. 30. It ends with Bruce looking to the future, and asking how his 'story' will end. He says: 'I wanna know how this story ends, you know? How does my story end?' Looking to the future: The clip ends with Bruce asking 'how does my story end' ABC has kept a tight lid on Friday's much talked about broadcast, only releasing a couple of non specific quotes from Bruce. The network is not expected to reveal much more in advance of Friday's program, preferring to give him the opportunity to address the topic in the full context of the interview. Sawyer has not spoken to outside media about the interview, which was conducted in February — one day in Los Angeles, another in New York. She's scheduled to promote it on ABC properties on Friday: Good Morning America, Live with Kelly and Michael and The View. ABC News executives also haven't spoken about it, not even confirming publicly until April 6 that the interview had taken place, until this Friday's airdate was set. Tight lid: ABC has only released snippets with non-specific quotes from Bruce, paving the way for his story to air in full on Friday's air date . The tight lid enables ABC to avoid the touchy issue of potentially 'outing' a public figure before the person has had a chance to publicly address the topic himself. Not everyone is waiting: The New York Daily News on Wednesday published a front-page picture of a person they said was Jenner wearing a dress. The approach has left his syndicated entertainment newsmagazines starved for news. Bessey said they've done stories on the three 15- or 30-second promos that ABC has released. The first ABC promo showed two Jenner images — one from behind and the other from the side as he talked with Sawyer, his face obscured by shadows. In the second and third Jenner is heard more clearly, and with two soundbites. 'My whole life has been getting ready for this,' he said. He also talks of the importance of not hurting his children. Moral support: The 65-year-old father-of-six appears alongside his four oldest children  Burt, 36, Casey, 34, Brandon, 33, and Brody, 31; the latest clip reused this previously aired footage from another promo . The interview was conducted before Jenner was involved in an auto accident in which another motorist was killed. ABC is expected to address the topic, although the timing precludes it from being raised with Jenner. Some of Jenner's children, pictured in one of the promos, are also expected to be interviewed. Bessey predicted big ratings for the special. ABC is airing it on a Friday night, when TV-watching is usually low. Two big interviews are among the top 100 most-watched telecasts of all time in the U.S.: Oprah Winfrey's 1993 talk with Michael Jackson, seen in 36.6 million homes, and Barbara Walters' 1999 interview with Monica Lewinsky, seen in 33.2 million homes. Friday's interview likely won't approach those numbers, but should certainly exceed the Friday 20/20 average of 6.2 million viewers this season. Bruce Jenner The Interview airs on ABC on Friday 24 April at 9/8C. Not appearing in the interview: Kim, 34, Khloe, 30, and Kourtney Kardashian, 36, as well as Kendall, 19, and Kylie Jenner, 17, are not scheduled to talk during the interview .","ABC has kept a tight lid on details but interview is expected to address Bruce's gender transition .

"Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has hit out at people questioning why she doesn't have children – and claimed she would never be asked if she was a man. The SNP leader said her predecessor Alex Salmond did not have to field questions on why he has not started a family. Ms Sturgeon insisted she was not 'moaning' but also attacked the criticism she and other female politicians' have had to endure over their appearance. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has hit out at people questioning why she doesn't have children – and claimed she would never be asked if she was a man . Ms Sturgeon was interviewed by STV's Debi Edward for the special TV programme set to be aired in Scotland at 7.30pm tonight . The steely First Minister made the remarks in the latest of five special programmes profiling the main party leaders with their families at home. In the programme, set to air on STV in Scotland at 7.30pm tonight, Ms Sturgeon reveals how Margaret Thatcher inspired her to get in to politics – but not for the reasons the 'iron lady' would have wanted. She also reveals her low-brow TV viewing habits, love of steak and chips and recent image makeover. The First Minister also talks of her dream to be the first leader of an independent Scotland, but would not be drawn on when the SNP dream would become a reality. Ms Sturgeon, who is married to Peter Murrell, the SNP Chief Executive, said she understood the why people asked her about why she did not have any children. She said: 'I suppose people have an understandable curiosity and that's understandable.' Tonight's STV profile on the Scottish First Minister shows old footage of her as a young SNP activist (right), showing her dramatic transformation . The steely First Minister, pictured at her wedding to SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, made the remarks in the latest of five special programmes profiling the main party leaders with their families at home . Nicola Sturgeon's husband admitted his wife was not just in charge of the country - she also ruled the roost at home. Peter Murrell said the First Minister was 'in charge of the remote' when it came to what the couple watched to unwind. Ms Sturgeon said: 'Peter puts up with it.' She added: 'When I get the chance to watch the television I'd love to tell you it's high brow stuff I watch but it's not. 'I like watching soaps so I will catch up with Corrie or Eastenders or River City. On a Saturday night when things like X Factor or Strictly or more recently the Voice are on, that's the kind of stuff I watch.' Asked what her favourite meal on a Saturday night is, she said: 'Steak and chips.' But she added: 'On the other hand Alex Salmond doesn't have children. I'm not aware of reading an interview or seeing an interview with Alex Salmond asking that question. 'So yes, I understand it but I think it's just one of these things. I'm not moaning about this but it's just one of these things that I think is just a bit different if you're a woman in politics.' Her husband Peter added: 'A man would never get asked about clothes or hair or something else. It's just different.' Ms Sturgeon said she had learnt to deal with the pressures of being a woman in politics. She said: 'One of the things I live with in politics and public life is what you wear and I can't really stop people doing. 'It's one of the things women in politics have to deal with that men don't. Men, the colour of their tie is the most difficult decision they have to make every day. 'So you have to be thinking about what you're wearing but you don't want to be thinking about it at the expense of what you really need to be thinking about. 'It still annoys me when I read really derogatory things about how a women looks because you would usually not read these things about a man and that still has the potential to put women off public life and that's a real shame.' Perhaps, surprisingly Ms Sturgeon also revealed that former Tory Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher was 'one of the key reasons I'm in politics'. But she said: 'Not for the reasons she would have wanted but because I grew up opposed to everything she stood for and that motivated me to get involved. 'But more seriously, she was the first women leader of the UK and yet she did pretty much nothing to help other women get opportunities. I want to use my time in this job to be completely different.' Ms Sturgeon took part in First Minister's Questions at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh today, with just two weeks to go until the election next month . First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, pictured ahead of First Minister's Questions today, said she wanted to spend longer cutting the deficit than Labour or the Tories . Ms Sturgeon said like Mrs Thatcher, she also wanted to be the first female leader of her country – once it had declared independence from the UK. She said: 'Would I love to think that one day I would be First Minister of an independent Scotland. Of course. 'But does that mean that I think Scotland is going to be independent in the next five years, I don't know. 'I just want to concentrate on doing this job to the best of my ability with whatever powers and resources we happen to have at any given time. 'I'll make the most of that and do the best I can for the people I serve because ultimately I am a public servant and the people are the boss.' Ms Sturgeon, meanwhile, revealed that Twitter is her 'bad habit' as she offered an insight into her life away from the political spotlight. Asked about her bad habits, the First Minister said 'Twitter's probably my bad habit'. He husband chipped in, adding: 'Yes, switching off from social media, or not switching off and when in bed you make one final check when you should just switch off from these things and leave them behind.' Ms Sturgeon, meanwhile, was today forced to reject scathing criticised of the SNP's spending plans by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. The IFS said the party's spending commitments did 'not necessarily match' their anti-austerity rhetoric and could result in billions of pounds of cuts for UK government departments. It said the SNP's proposals implied the same reductions in spending as Labour, although they said the nationalists would 'cut less to start with', meaning that the 'period of austerity would be longer than under the other three parties we consider'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has left her boxy jackets (in 2012, left) and trouser suits (last year, centre) for the svelte power dresses which have come to define her style this election (pictured this week, right) Ms Sturgeon dismissed the IFS report as 'full of assumptions and speculations', adding that the think tank had got 'the SNP's plans wrong'. She told MSPs at Holyrood: 'I have said repeatedly I do want to take longer to eliminate the deficit than the other parties. Because I want to see us have the ability to invest more in our economy, in our public services and in lifting people out of poverty.' She added: 'That is the clear difference between my party and the other parties represented in this chamber.' Ms Sturgeon said the IFS report 'doesn't credit for any increases in revenue for the tax rises that we are proposing'. The First Minister continued: 'Secondly, it gives no credit for the revenue we would increase from cracking down on tax avoidance ... but the fundamental misassumption at the heart of the IFS report this morning is this one: it assumes that the SNP would cut borrowing by 2019/20 to 1.4% of GDP. 'That is not our plan, our plan is for borrowing in that year to be 1.6% of GDP.'","SNP leader said  Alex Salmond did not field questions over his family .

"As the world spotlight shines on a German courtroom in the trial of the 'Auschwitz bookkeeper' Oskar Groening, hidden in the shadows are the forgotten women who served as guards at Hitler’s death camps. Now, seven decades on and in the twilight of their lives, these former SS guards who ruled the human slaughterhouse Auschwitz with an iron fist will go to their graves having escaped justice. Of the 3,700 women who served at Nazi death camps, just three were investigated by prosecutors in Germany for their roles as accomplices to mass murder. Scroll down for video . No justice: Charlotte S, left, now 94, was an SS guard in the Nazi death camps Ravensbrück and Auschwitz, according to Stasi records, while Gisela S, is pictured right in her card index of concentration camp guards . Culpable: There were 3,700 women who served in the Nazi death camps during the Second World War - but only three have been investigated by prosecutors in Germany for their roles as accomplices to mass murder . And, in a crushing blow to the millions of Jews murdered at Nazi death camps across Europe, they are all deemed too ill or infirm to ever be punished. Those 'merciless' women who traded femininity, motherhood and marriage to wed themselves to the dark side of Hitler's Third Reich include Charlotte S. A guard at the notoriously brutal women’s concentration camp of Ravensbrueck, in northern Germany, she was remembered by survivors as a feared woman who beat prisoners and unleashed on them her Alsatian dog. A fanatical Nazi, the dog handler patrolled the camp with her Alsatian she had trained to bite at the inmates' genitals. She was transferred to Auschwitz where she and her teeth-baring dog were feared by the prisoners kept as slaves and worked in the sweatshop factories around the camp. One female prisoner after the war testified: 'There was a woman there with a kindly smile that masked a hideous nature. She was ramrod straight and had a snarling dog that was indoctrinated to hate the prisoners. 'We would be forced to stand stock still for hours and if anyone moved in the cold or the heat, the dog was unleashed. Many people did not survive the maulings.' Brutal: The women patrolling the death camps were just as bad as their male counterparts. Pictured: Female overseers  at Bergen-Belsen, having been taken prisoner by the British in April 1945 . Tortured: Prisoners look out from behind a barbed wire enclosure at the Dachau concentration camp - where 41,500 died - in Germany in 1945. They and their relatives look likely to never get the justice they deserve . Survivors: French prisoners pictured when the Nazi concentration camp of Dachau, near Munich, was liberated by Allied troops at the end of April 1945. Many of the Nazi guards got away with their crimes by claiming they were just following orders . She began an affair with an SS man while serving at the camp and was discharged from the service in 1943 when she fell pregnant. After the war, in Saxony-Anhalt, which was behind the iron curtain, the communist authorities tried her for her wartime role and she was sentenced to 15 months in jail for 'mistreatment of and thefts from prisoners in her charge'. Now 94, she still lives in the state and refuses to speak about her terrible past. Nevertheless, unlike 93-year-old Groening, a former SS sergeant being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder, Charlotte S has been told there is no case for her to answer. Another to get off scot free is Gisela S, a 'hard-faced' woman who worked in the feared SS under her maiden name of Demming. She was a harsh disciplinarian who beat prisoners as punishment for petty rule infractions. Gisela was also in charge of the standing cells - small, dark rooms where up to 15 people at a time were crammed into. It was not uncommon for her to leave prisoners in these rooms for days on end, causing the death of some or all of those confined. Demming formed a romantic relationship with SS Dr Franz Bernhard Lucas but she abruptly ended it when he criticised the hideous experiments on prisoners carried out by notorious 'Angel of Death' Dr Josef Mengele on inmates. She was a true believer in the Nazi racial policies that decreed Jews, gypsies and Slavs were 'lesser races' who deserved nothing else. She appeared at the Auschwitz Trial of former guards and overseers in Frankfurt in the 1960s - but escaped jail. And now prosecutors say she is also too old and frail to be tried in court. Court: SS Sergeant Oskar Groening, known as 'the bookkeeper of Auschwitz', pictured during the war and today. He is charged with complicity in the killing of 300,000 Jews at the camp . Groening, pictured, told the court that he is 'morally responsible' for the mass slaughter even though he did not participate personally in any violence . Trial: People like Auschwitz survivor Eva Pusztai-Fahidi, left, from Budapest and her 23-years-old granddaughter Luca Hartai, have traveled from all over the world to witness one of the few prosecutions held . Possibly most frightening of all is Gertrud Elli Senff, who revelled in the power she yielded to play 'God' in choosing who should live and who should be sent to the Auschwitz gas chambers. Now 92, she was formerly an SS guard at Majdanek in Lublin, Poland, where an estimated 235,000 people were murdered during WW2. Prosecutors have traced her SS identity card. The card, bearing the number 312, has been authenticated, which proves she was there. It carries the inscription: 'The holder is authorised to bear arms' - meaning she was a pay-grade above ordinary guards usually only sanctioned to carrying a 'schlagstock' - a 'beating stick.' After service in Majdanek she was sent to Auschwitz, where she was based at Birkenau - the gas chambers complex where 1.1million prisoners were exterminated. Before the camp fell to the Russians she was shipped back to Germany and escaped justice at the end of the war. But officials at the Ludwigsburg authority have, it is understood, testimony from several now deceased prisoners that she was a 'cruel' and 'merciless' guard who beat them with leather whips and who was present at the infamous railway ramp where daily 'selections' were made about who should live - and who was to be gassed. Now wheelchair bound, she was tracked down by the German daily newspaper, Bild. Her daughter said: ‘We know that my mother had something to do with Auschwitz. We have tried to talk with her about it but her memory doesn’t really function any more.’ A recent drive to find the last of the guards before they die of old age has seen posters put up around the country, and 30 arrests made in February of last year. And prosecutors have still to decide on his case and a handful of others, but few are convinced that justice will be done. To many, particularly Jews persecuted ruthlessly by the Nazis, this is all a case of 'too little, too late'. According to historian Andreas Eichmüller, of the 6,500 members of the SS who served in Auschwitz and survived the war, only 29 were convicted in West Germany and reunified Germany, while about 20 were convicted in East Germany. Efforts were no doubt hampered originally by the judiciary, police and civil service which were, in the post-war years, full of former Nazis. Vicious: Another was accused of making as many as 15 people stand for days on end in a tiny cell, a punishment which left people dead - but she will never be brought before the court to answer to the law . Getting away with it: Of the 6,500 members of the SS who served in Auschwitz and survived the war, only 29 were convicted in West Germany and reunified Germany, while about 20 were convicted in East Germany . 'Unfortunately, very few people who committed the crimes had to pay for them,' said Efraim Zuroff, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's top Nazi hunter. He added: 'The passage of time in no way diminishes the crimes.... It's only a shame that this kind of legal reasoning was not applied previously, because it would have led to many, many more cases of people who definitely deserved to be brought to justice.' Kurt Schrimm, the head of Germany’s special prosecutor’s office, which is responsible for investigating Nazi era war crimes, who has worked to locate the remaining SS criminals and bringing them to justice 1986. 'We owe it to the victims and to their families,"" he said. ""I want to do my job well for as long as it takes. The dead and the families of the dead deserve nothing less than to see justice done.'","SS guard Charlotte S trained her Alsatian to bite at inmates' private parts .

"From identical shirts to shaving razors, deodorant and even children's chocolate, a new website has exposed that Australian women are paying more than men for the same everyday consumer goods. Since campaigning group GetUp launched The Gender Price Gap website last week, members and everyday consumers have identified nine separate products that have identical female versions which cost more. Bonds has been identified as one of the main culprits, advertising a button-up shirt, that comes in both 'summer blue' and 'blue denim' colour options, on their Australian website for $59.95. GetUp's new website, The Gender Price Gap, has exposed nine everyday items that cost more for women . This is despite the products being identical in almost every way except whether they are targeted towards women or men . However, the exact same shirt advertised under the men's clothing section is advertised for only $49.95. Other examples highlighted on the website, which show increases from as little as 11c or even 1c for items marketed towards females, highlight the absurd and unexplained price difference even further. While some might argue that they don't mind paying an additional few cents now and again, GetUp's senior campaigner, Kelsey Cooke, told Daily Mail Australia that the costs accumulate significantly over a number of years. 'I don't mind paying an extra 60 cents for whatever item it might be that I like, but when you think about it in terms of weekly and yearly costs, it's hundreds or even thousands of dollars more than my partner would be paying - even if we had the same shopping list,' Ms Cooke said. Other examples highlighted on the website, which show price increases by as little as 11c or even 1c for items marketed towards females, highlight the absurd and unexplained price difference even further . Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs, for instance, which were advertised on Coles' website for $2.20, have a pink packaged 'girls' version for $2.30. Meanwhile a packet of five Gillette disposable razors for women was photographed costing $4.50 at a supermarket while the men's version, a packet of 10 disposables identical in everything but colour, cost $8.91. The reason for the 1c price difference per razor remains a mystery. When asked why companies would charge women more for the same items, Ms Cooke said there were two answers that GetUp had considered. While some might argue that they don't mind paying an additional few cents now and again, GetUp 's senior campaigner, Kelsey Cooke, told Daily Mail Australia that the costs accumulate significantly over the years . A children's mechanic set, sold by the same company, differs greatly in price. But is there really a difference? 'One is the idea that men's products are thought of as the standard product - the neutral or base product - but the women's version is usually a ""special"" version or a side product. It all comes down to a theory being debated, that women are considered ""the other"" and different, and thus it being OK to charge a premium for the product even if it's no different,' she said. 'The other reason is that they're probably just able to get away with it. I'm not privy to the conversations going on in these organisations, so I'm not sure, but I dare say that if they can find a way to make a profit on women's products by making them cost more, then they'll probably continue doing it.' Ms Cooke said that GetUp launched the website due to its interest in protesting against the gender pay gap, while drawing inspiration from similar campaigns being launched overseas. 'We know that the gender pay gap is growing at the moment and that it's only getting worse - right now it's at 18.8 per cent, and there's also a big superannuation gap so it's been on our members' minds for quite some time. We've also been hearing more examples about the cultural pressures for women to buy more products,' Ms Cooke said. Ms Cooke said that GetUp launched the website due to its interest in protesting against the gender pay gap, while drawing inspiration from similar campaigns being launched overseas . 'In France and the U.S. in particular, campaigns have started around the ""women's tax"" and we were curious to see if this was something Australian women were also experiencing,' Ms Cooke said . 'In France and the U.S. in particular, campaigns have started around the ""women's tax"" and we were curious to see if this was something Australian women were also experiencing.' The Gender Price Gap website aims to engage Australian women in the global conversation that is taking place around the 'pink tax' and encourage them to share their own experiences of the 'price gap' while seeing whether it's something they are interested in campaigning about. Ms Cooke warned that price differences were not always obvious due to items for different genders being held in different isles or floors, adding: 'it only becomes visible when you pay attention to it'. 'We've had a couple of submissions and we are starting to get a lot of attention drawn to the site, particularly in the last 48 hours, so we do expect the list to increase,' she said.

"A furious motorist has plastered his £35,000 Audi A5 with slogans and parked it outside the dealership he bought it from because it uses a litre of oil every time he fills it up. Ravi Beefnah, 34, parked his white Audi A5 - which is covered in red lettering - outside the entrance of the dealership in Chelmsford, Essex, in February as a warning to other buyers. Two months later and Mr Beefnah's protest is still there, with the owner claiming that Audi have failed to resolve his long-running complaint about the engine and fix the car. Scroll down for video . Ravi Beefnah plastered his £35,000 Audi A5 with slogans and parked it outside the dealership he bought it from because it uses a litre of oil every time he fills it up . Mr Beefnah's car has been parked outside the Audi dealership in Chelmsford, Essex, for two months . Mr Beefnah claims that Audi failed to resolve his long-running complaint about the engine and fix the car . The unhappy driver says he parked his car there as warning to other drivers considering buying an Audi. He said: 'I came up with the idea after becoming fed up with the dealership. 'You just don't expect problems when buying a brand new car from what is supposed to be a reputable company. Mr Beefnah says he parked his car there as warning to other drivers considering buying an Audi . 'I decided that the car's not fit for purpose and I'm not going to be able to drive it so I might as well get some use out of it.' One of the warnings written on the vehicle states: 'Audi acceptable oil consumption for this car is 12.75 pints (7.2 litres) of oil per every 9,000 miles. 'This car uses 1 litre every 250 miles = every petrol fill up!' Mr Beefnah, from Colchester, Essex, claims a fault with the Audi 2011 TFSI (turbo fuel stratified injection) petrol engine is widespread and is taking the dealership to court over their failure to fix it on his car. Audi admits there was a problem with some of the engines and has offered to fix cars with the issue free of charge, including Mr Beefnah's. But he intends to keep his car parked outside Chelmsford Audi until his civil case is resolved, and is demanding £9,000 to cover the costs of fixing the car, which can reach speeds of 150mph. Before professionally printing the signs onto the Audi, the motorist had the claims reviewed by a solicitor before checking the legality of long-term parking outside the dealership with police. His claim follows a class action in the US, which saw Audi agree to fix 126,000 A4s, A5s and Q5 models with the oil problem. Mr Beefnah added: 'The car is going to stay there until this is sorted. 'Even if I lose the case, which I think is extremely unlikely considering the evidence, the car will stay there. 'I don't want other drivers to have to go through what I have.'

Audi admits there was a problem with some of the engines and has offered to fix cars with the issue free of charge, including Mr Beefnah's . An Audi UK spokesman said: 'Audi UK is wholly confident that Chelmsford Audi has made every effort to resolve the issue involving Mr Beefnah's car in accordance with the guidelines it has set out. 'These relate to a small number of older Audi vehicles powered by the 2.0 TFSI engine which have exceeded our factory tolerance for oil usage and require rectification. Last year, following a class-action lawsuit in the US, Audi agreed to settle with motorists who complained their cars were consuming too much oil. The manufacturer settled to fix 2009-2010 Audi A4s and Audi A5s and 2011 Audi A4, Audi A5, and Audi Q5 with the engine code CAEB. The issue affects up to 126,000 cars. Under the settlement, Audi owners are entitled to repairs to the crankshaft of their cars. Audi will also reimburse the cost of any repairs carried out by owners of some of the vehicles. 'The majority of these cases have been resolved at no cost to the customer via our comprehensive Audi UK Warranty, and the remainder are being dealt with on a case-by-case basis with support levels based on important criteria such as the vehicle's service history in accordance with manufacturer recommendations . 'Unfortunately we are unable to make any further comment relating to the specific detail surrounding this case due to ongoing legal proceedings involving Mr Beefnah and Chelmsford Audi. 'Whilst this is a third party dispute we have attempted to assist the parties in resolving this issue fairly, reasonably and amicably.

Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given 'anything like full details' on how they will tackle the nations' debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about their deficit reduction plan, which relies on £30billion of cuts, while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra £26billion-a-year. Scroll down for video . The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on 'almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases'. The think-tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May's General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. 'Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. 'But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. 'While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition, its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year.' Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly £3 billion. Borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was £87.3 billion for the year to the end of March, down from £98.5 billion in 2013/14, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The result undershot the latest target of £90.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the time of last month's Budget. It means that annual borrowing (GDP) has fallen by more than £60 billion from £153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, underlying debt of £1.48 trillion is more than £500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of £956 billion. The nation's debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP, up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya Keynes said: 'The Conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it. 'They should be forthcoming on the £5 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance, the £10 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and, according to our calculations, further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £30 billion.' Turning to Labour, the IFS said the Opposition had been 'considerably more vague' about how much it wants to borrow. The pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income. Senior research economist Rowena Crawford said: 'Labour's proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest. 'But this would leave borrowing at £26billion a year in today's terms. 'If Labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there.' The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017-18, revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. The SNP's figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as Labour, the IFS said, although the reduction would be slower. This means the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity, the think-tank said. The independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy, with Labour accusing the Tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world's advanced economies and the Conservatives renewing warnings that Britain's economy would suffer from an 'SNP/Miliband nightmare'. Labour's Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party, with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years. 'The Tories might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim. They have borrowed £200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short.' But Mr Osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left £350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government. The Chancellor warned of a 'dangerous cocktail' if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority, Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a 'constitutional crisis' if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Launching the SNP manifesto this week, Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post-election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK, raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a £140billion 'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add £6billion to Britain's interest bill, worth £350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority, so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. 'We've got a strong plan for a national recovery, but it's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as 'constitutional chaos'. 'The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can, and cannot, afford. 'This candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign, with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges.'

"A stunning Italian political candidate who has posted dozens of pictures of herself  in skimpy bikinis has denied using her looks to get votes. The relatively unknown Stefania La Greca was suddenly catapulted into the limelight after the sexy shots of the Lega Sud Ausoni party candidate went viral. But the 36-year-old, who is hoping to represent Caldoro in Campania, southern Italy after May's regional elections, defended her photographs. Pictures of Stefania La Greca, who is running for local elections in southern Italy, have gone viral ahead of the elections in May . Ms La Greca (left) is a political candidate for the Lega Sud Ausonia party which wants independece while Nicola Sturgeon, is leader of the Scottish National Party . She told Italian TV show The Morning: 'I have not posted intimate photographs. The bikini? And what woman does not wear it?' 'We must go beyond appearance. The truth is that in this country women are still judged and only as a sexual object. On her Facebook page, where she refers to her self as 'Divine', she has posted numerous pouting selfies and pictures of her in swimwear. Even Ms La Greca's election poster features a picture of her wearing a skimpy black dress and pulling a sultry pose. On her social media page she said the snaps were not an attempt to boost her election campaign - she had simply been born beautiful. Ms La Greca added that she was 'free to express herself' but complained about Italian attitudes towards women. She said: 'Mother Nature gave me the good fortune of being beautiful. 'But unfortunately, I am born in a context where woman are perceived as easy. 'I want to be different. I want to help my region. I am and want to be free to express myself.' She also defended the name 'Divine' saying it had been a nickname since she was a young girl and was now 'part of her.' But the stunning 36-year-old has defended her pictures and denied she was using her looks to get votes . Ms La Greca's election poster features her in a very short, black dress pulling a sultry pose to the camera . Ms La Greca, from the region of Campania in southern Italy, is standing for Lega Sud Ausonia - a small independent party that wants to see the region of Ausonia become independent . Ms La Greca's sudden rise from obscurity to demand independence for her region echos the career of British politican Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish National Party leader, recently shot up the popularity charts to be referred to as 'the only party leader with positive approval ratings' after a series of election debates. She is also known for her style transformation and her cheeky side, after it was recently revealed she has an oil painting of 'Naughty Nicola' hanging in her home. The photographs have split the opinions of voters with some criticizing the aspiring politician, while many more praised the sexy candidate. Writing on her Facebook page, local Domenico Vastarelli, said: 'You have all the skills to be a councillor.' On her Facebook page she defended her pictures, claiming she had not chosen to be beautiful - it was simply down to nature . The photographs have split voters with some criticizing the aspiring politician, while many more praised the sexy candidate for Caldoro in Campania . Another, Fco Hernandez, posted: 'What a beauty you are. A beauty.' And Davide Fabbri wrote: 'Magnificent!! You look good in a mini... Sexy legs. Perfect... Many congratulations!!' Ms La Greca, from the region of Campania in southern Italy,  is standing for Lega Sud Ausonia -  a small independent party  that wants to see the region of Ausonia become independent. It is led by Gianfranco Vestuto who said the infamous bikini shot of the candidate was a 'few years old.' So far it has no representation in the Italian parliament, the European parliament or any regional or provincial assemblies but Ms La Greca is hoping to secure the first seat hen voters go the polls in the regional elections at the end of May.","Stefania La Greca is standing for election for the Lega Sud Ausonia party .

"A British ISIS fighter has complained about fellow jihadis fleeing the frontline then boasting of their bravery on Twitter while posing with their weapons. Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, regularly makes videos and posts on social media about life in the so-called Islamic State under the name Abu Sa'eed Al-Britani. Last month he complained about peeling potatoes and his troubles with washing his clothes. In his latest video the former Morrisons security guard, who used to live at home with his mother and has not managed to get himself a jihadi bride, accuses a fellow 'brother' of running away from the frontline in Syria 'When it was only him and me defending the post'. Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, posts videos online under the name Abu Sa'eed Al-Britani. He has complained about jihadis who leave their posts then boasting on social media about their bravery . Islamic State fighters pose at the border between Syria and Iraq. Hussain has cautioned 'sisters' to choose wisely when searching for a spouse among ISIS fighters . A jihadi poses with a handgun and an ISIS ring in a social media post. Hussain has warned would-be jihadi brides to be wary of fighters who seem to spend too much time online . He said: 'I can recall myself shouting at him to come back as he ran away leaving me alone to defend the position. 'The ironical thing here was that the brother went online the next day and praised how Dawlah [Islamic State] managed to defend an onslaught by the enemy, and how people in the west need to ""stop being cowards"". 'On other occasions, I have noticed how some brothers praise how ""we"" attacked such and such village, how hard the battle was for ""us"", etc. yet they were not there. 'A form of tadlees (twisting the haqq [truth] to get self praise), not a characteristic stemming from humbleness and sincerity.' Hussain, who has previously issued advice on how jihadists should 'deal' with wannabe jihadi brides, has now cautioned 'sisters' to choose wisely when searching for a spouse among ISIS fighters. He said: 'Although there may be nothing wrong with marrying a brother who is constantly online, I would just like to say that its best one does not rush into a marriage contract. 'I have been in Sham [the Caliphate] for just over a year now and I have seen many beautiful brothers who are constant on their ibaadah [worship], warriors in front lines, have amazing military minds, generous towards others, humble, funny, etc. yet are unknown on social media. 'So sisters, please be careful and deliberate when choosing a spouse. We are still human beings, we err and we make mistakes. 'Some people's intentions can sidetrack, especially when on social media platforms.' A jihadi poses with an AK-47 and a handgun. Some fighters boast online about how 'we' attacked a village when they weren't even part of any ISIS assault, according to Hussein . Despite his hatred of the West this ISIS fighter enjoys showing off his Adidas trainers in this online post . Hussain himself poses with an AK-47 in Raqqa, Syria. He often posts videos containing his opinions on life inside the so-called Islamic State . The British jihadi decries boastful fellow fighters who are 'always on twitter posting pics of [themselves]' rather than actually fighting on the frontline - which should make would-be wives wary given electronic devices are banned there. He adds: 'The only reason a brother can be constantly on twitter, fb, Instagram or other social media platform, is if he's not on front lines.' Hussain continues that all ISIS members in the area controlled by the group have guns and not just the fighters. 'Just because someone is in Sham and has a gun, it does not mean they are a Mujaahid,' he says. 'Immaturity makes a person over excited. And being over excited leads to posting pics online with a gun. 'Do not be afraid to reject a proposal, there are many brothers here in Sham. And some of the most beautiful are those who are always on ribat [the frontline] and completely unknown on social media platforms.' And in a missive posted yesterday Hussain railed against jihadis who moan 'like menstruating women' about the guns they've been given. Jihadists based in Atmeh - just one mile from the Olive Tree refugee camp in Syria - have boasted of living 'the goodly life' in a huge hilltop villa - a far cry from the frontline in the country's brutal civil war . Bethnal Green teenagers Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase all ran away from their homes apparently to be jihadi brides. Hussain says such girls should chose their husbands carefully . It is feared the three are now married to ISIS fighters. Hussain has complained at how some moan like 'menstruating women' at the guns they have been given . Hussain admits on Twitter that it took him 50 minutes to peel 10 potatoes - leaving him too tired to cut them . He says to his 'beloved brothers in Islam': 'Know that yesterday you had nothing of honor in your hands and were subjugated under the laws of the Kuffar [unbeliever] . 'You carried no bullets, no gun, no grenade, nothing of this sort. Yet here you are today with honor given to you, so do not boast about what you have been given. 'For you have been given it due to the sacrifices of your brothers before you…The soldiers who fought the battles while you were sitting at home. 'Likewise, do not complain when you are given a gun which you do not like… What were you walking around with last month? In Dar Al-Kufr [any non-Muslim country], did you have a brand new Russian AK47? 'Did you have a Glock? You didn’t even have a rusty old gun, yet here you are complaining like a menstruating woman about the very find details of your gun!' Yet Hussain has form when it comes to spending a time posting on social media rather than taking the fight to ISIS' Syrian government or Kurdish enemies or dodging US airstrikes - and he's not averse to sharing pictures of himself brandishing an AK-47 either. Earlier this month he complained on Twitter about his difficulties completing the most basic daily jobs including peeling potatoes for his dinner and washing his clothes. In August Last August he appeared on BBC2's Newsnight, saying: 'I hate the UK, the only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.'","Omar Hussain, from High Wycombe, often posts about life in Islamic State .

"A 41-year-old British man has been charged after he allegedly relieved himself in an ice machine at an Orlando hotel. Andrew Stewart Wood, of Havant, Hampshire, was accused of urinating into the ice machine at the Hard Rock Hotel in the Universal theme park resort in the early hours of Tuesday. A guest reportedly told a security guard at the luxury hotel that there was a very intoxicated man on the premises. Andrew Wood, 41, from the UK, was arrested at Orlando's Hard Rock Hotel after being caught urinating in an ice machine while intoxicated . The guard located Wood and saw him urinating into an ice machine. When he tried to stop him, Wood became belligerent, began shouting and would not cooperate. According to the police report, the security guard tried to have the guest identify himself and tell him what room he was staying in but he continued disturbing the peace and quiet of other guests. The security guard then called the police. Police removed Wood from the premises after he refused to stay in his room. Officers said that Wood was extremely intoxicated 'with the odor of alcohol emanating from his person and having random outbursts'. He was arrested on disorderly conduct charges and placed in jail where he continued to act out. Wood posted $1,000 bond and was released from Orange County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to a booking report. In a statement to Daily Mail Online, Hard Rock Hotel at Universal Orlando said: 'The health and safety of our guests is our top priority and we have removed the ice machine from service.' The hotel was unable to confirm if Wood was still a guest, adding: 'For security reasons, we are unable to provide guest information.' A standard room at the hotel costs around $294 per night. The luxury Hard Rock hotel in Florida is attached to the Universal Studios theme park - a standard room starts at around $300 a night .","Andrew Stewart Wood, of Havant, Hampshire, was accused of urinating into the ice machine at the Hard Rock Hotel in the early hours of Tuesday .

"This is the terrifying moment that one wrong move sent a climber tumbling 10 metres down an icy cliff face. Karlis Bardelis, 30, from Latvia, was attempting to scale the cliff in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, when the accident happened. And footage from a camera mounted to his helmet shows the very second that his climbing axe came loose. Mr Berdalis said: 'I was just thinking ""I hope I land somewhere soft and don't break any bones"".' Scroll down for video . The footage shows climber Karlis Bardelis carefully traversing the ridge, left, but one wrong move sends him tumbling down the icy cliff face in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, right . You see his feet literally above his head as he continues to fall down the mountain head-first . Karlis Bardelis, left, and Gary Kinsey, right, on Headhunter's summit on January 28, 2012. Bardelis has only just released the footage of his terrifying fall on a training exercise in hospital . Between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds in the video below, you can see the axe slipping out of the ice and knocking his other axe out of position. Almost immediately his feet were in the air and Karlis can see nothing but his boots and the blue sky as he begins the terrifying fall down the 60m mountain. He continues to fall for three-and-a-half seconds until he's eventually saved by his safety rope after falling ten metres. But the experienced Latvian climber, who now works in Nepal, held his nerve after the tumble and even continued his ascent to the top. Bardelis scaling the mountain which he fell from. On the left you can see the safety rope that saved his life . Holding his nerve: The experienced climber grips the rock face on his ascent . He said: 'My ropes saved me and stopped my fall. 'These kind of falls are very dangerous because I'm carrying two ice tools and crampons, both of which are really sharp and could cause serious injuries. 'Obviously there's the risk of hitting a rock on my way down, which can cause serious fractures. 'I never think that I'm going to die in these situations - I never consider death as an option' Karlis had travelled to Scotland to take part in a training course organised by the British Mountaineering Council joining climbers from 26 countries. And he attempted the level six climb with some trepidation. Life on the line: Bardelis was rescued by his safety rope after his axe became dislodged from the ice, knocking the other out of position and sending him plunging down the mountain . He said: 'I was feeling excited about that climb but at the same time I was feeling scared in those difficult parts too. 'I fell because I made a mistake; I put one ice axe in a crack and was trying to put another one in but the placement wasn't good so it ripped the other one out. 'My crampons weren't in a stable place so I fell.' The footage shows Karlis tumble backwards from the cliff face and free fall towards the ground. Incredibly, after being saved by his harness, Karlis continued his ascent after the fall. He said: 'I climbed back to the same place and this time did it right using the same technique. 'Some people laugh when they see the video - others say they are not going to sleep after seeing it. 'I guess it was a good example of how not to climb.'

"Thought the vampire face lift and leech facial were weird? The beauty industry is about to get much more bizarre. Foreskin facials are the latest unconventional beauty treatment to be hitting salons - and people who've had them can't stop singing their praises. Dubbed a HydraFacial, the treatment, which costs around $150 (£100) and uses stem cell from an infant's foreskin, is currently available in New York. Scroll down for video . Foreskin facials, also known as HydraFacials, are the latest unconventional beauty treatment to be hitting salons in New York (stock image) Described as a 'multi-step treatment that promises to erase wrinkles, reverse sun damage, lighten dark spots, and prevent acne', the key ingredient is the somewhat bizarre stem cell from an infant's foreskin. Speaking to NY Magazine about the unusual treatment, Dr. Gail Naughton, a leader in regenerative science, said: 'When we're born, our skin is in its best shape. Our cells naturally secrete proteins known as growth factors that keep the cells healthy and stimulate them to divide. One writer who had the treatment hailed its benefits and described her post-facial confidence as being at 'Beyonce levels' and her skin as glowing as Jennifer Lopez's, right . 'As we age, our cells divide at a slower rate, which contribute to the telltale signs of aging, like wrinkles and loss of firmness and luminosity. Growth factors captured from the donated foreskin of a baby (just one can generate over a million treatments) are at their peak ability in promoting rapid cell turnover. 'Applied topically, they spur adult skin cells to regenerate. This is said to have a smoothing effect on the skin.' The 30-minute treatment involves a cleansing process using salicylic-and-glycolic-acid peel and an extraction to remove blackheads and dead skin. This process is followed by a mask packed with hydrating hyaluronic acid and a serum with foreskin extracts and rounded off with some light therapy. One writer, Ashley Weatherford, who had the treatment hailed its benefits, describing her post-facial confidence as at 'Beyonce levels' and her skin as glowing as Jennifer Lopez's. The 30-minute treatment (not pictured) involves a cleansing process using salicylic-and-glycolic-acid peel, an extraction, a mask packed with hydrating hyaluronic acid and a serum with foreskin extracts . Commenting on the trend, Anne-Marie Gillett, Non-Surgical Director at Transform Cosmetic Surgery, told FEMAIL: 'The HydraFacial, commonly known as the ""Foreskin Facial"" is an interesting concept and is one that we will be keeping our eye on here at Transform. 'We’ve seen a whole host of faddish non-surgical treatments coming over from the US - last year it was the vampire facial, which had a celebrity fan base, with the likes of Kim Kardashian openly talking about having had the treatment. This year, it seems to be the HydraFacial, but we often find that these extreme treatments seem to disappear as quickly as they come. 'It’s no surprise, as there are numerous new treatments hitting the market all the time, particularly ones with the ""wow"" and shock factor, but how effective they actually are is questionable. We’ll have to wait and see. 'If you want to keep your skin looking its best, it’s important to maintain a good skincare regime which involves limiting sun exposure, avoiding smoking and excessive drinking, which can dehydrate the skin and accelerate the ageing process. 'We would urge anyone who is considering having a non-surgical treatment, to do their research and be confident with what’s on offer and that the person providing the treatment is appropriately qualified. Also, it’s important for patients to manage their expectations when it comes to the results.' The 'baby foreskin facial' will, however, never be coming to the UK as it is illegal to use human cells in cosmetic procedures. The USA-owned company are currently in the process of creating the same effect, by using plant extract and bringing that to the UK.","Dubbed a HydraFacial, the treatment is currently available in New York .

"When Ali Maffucci got a deal to write a cooking and healthy lifestyle book, she quit her corporate job and began working from home. But while she was running the website and sharing healthy recipes with her readers, secretly she wasn’t practising what she preached. As the months ticked by, she piled on the pounds. But desperate to loser weight for the book's photo shoot, she decided to try adopt a novel way to lose weight. Miss  Maffucci made one simple change to her diet that helped her drop over 11 kg (24 lbs) in just three months. For every meal, she substituted spiralized vegetables for bread, pasta, rice and potatoes.Here, she tells the Healthista website how she went from a size 14/16 to a size 8/10 so rapidly... Scroll down for video . Ali Maffucci, 28, lost 11 kg (almost two stone) in three months through replacing pasta, bread and rice with spirazlied vegetables. She is pictured before (left) and after (right) her weight loss . Now, Ms Maffucci weighs 10 stone, is a size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight . After eating courgette noodles recommended by her mother, Ali Maffucci fell in love with the spiralizing tool. Not long after, she took to the internet with her blog, Inspiralized, where she began creating and sharing recipes using spiralized vegetables. Then in June of 2013, Ms Maffucci quit her corporate job to become a full time blogger. However while she was running the website and sharing healthy recipes with her readers, she was far from a reflection of that herself. Without the structure of her old job, she gained what she called her ‘blogging weight’ of 10 kg (22lbs). The spiralizer is a razor-sharp cutting device that creates thin ribbons of fruits and vegetables. Originally a Japanese invention, it allows people to create nutritious, very low-calorie, low-carb ‘pasta’, ‘noodles’ and ‘rice’ from everyday fruit and vegetables, in less time than it takes to peel a potato. For example, it can spin a simple courgette into a generous bowl of ‘spaghetti’ in a flash. Spiralize a sweet potato and in minutes you’ll apparently get a filling portion of ‘rice’ with just half the calories and carbs of regular basmati. Nutritionists warn it is not a good idea to completely eliminate carbohydrates from the diet entirely, as they provide a range of important nutrients. However, many of us are guilty of eating too many carbs, and a spiralizer could help us cut down, said dietitian Vanessa Hattersley. She said: ‘Many of us do tend to overload our plates with pasta, rice, bread and potatoes when they are on offer. A well-balanced meal should be a quarter protein, a quarter carbohydrate and half fruit and vegetables, so the spiralizer could play a really useful role in redressing the nutritional balance in a carb-heavy diet.’ Being in her apartment all day with her kitchen nearby meant her constant snacking quickly led to weight gain. ‘It wasn’t necessarily that I was eating unhealthy food, it was more that I was eating a lot of healthy food. 'I was eating a half a tub of almond butter instead of a little bit with an apple slice or the whole tub of hummus,’ Ms Maffucci said. ‘I was snacking on many healthy things, but eating too many of them.’ She describes feeling constantly tired. ‘I felt like I was very lazy, even at night time. 'My fiancé would come home and I would make dinner for him, and by the time we were done I would be exhausted, and I would just lay on the couch and probably snack on more food,’ Ms Maffucci said. Later that month, she scored a deal to write a cookbook, which meant she would have to be photographed and featured in it. That’s when she knew she had to turn things around. The ‘blogging weight’ gain had left her at 12 stone and a size 14/16, and she needed to look fit and healthy for the book. ‘I told myself, how could I promote this healthy lifestyle if I wasn’t living it myself?’ She had until late August — about three months — to transform her lifestyle so she could look and feel fit and comfortable during the photo shoot. She made a plan to get to 140-145 pounds (66 kg) - by consistently exercising and eating her own spiralized meals minus the snacks. ‘I said myself ""I’m gonna eat healthy spiralized meals for lunch and dinner, and that kept me satisfied and kept me fueled"". 'It’s such a fun way to eat, you never get bored of what you’re eating. 'It’s healthy and it makes you feel good,’ Ms Maffucci said. ‘I felt satisfied all the time.’ She said didn’t find it difficult to stick to spiralized food. 'It is delicious, after all. If you were to boil some pasta, drain it and then try to eat it, it wouldn’t really taste good; it’s sort of the same thing with spiralized food,' she said. ‘What makes the dish delicious is the sauces and the cooking and the other things you put into it.’ She said by eating food she normally would, and replacing pasta, rice, potatoes and processed food with spiralized vegetables, she didn’t have to sacrifice her taste buds in the name of health. Ms Maffucci said she didn’t find it difficult to stick to spiralized food (her recipe for spiralized courgette with a fried egg is pictured). She said: 'It’s such a fun way to eat, you never get bored of what you’re eating' Ms Maffucci wrote a book, Inspiralized: Inspiring Recipes to Make With Your Spiralizer, following her weight loss . ‘I always tell people, you won’t notice a big change in your flavor profile but you’ll notice it in the way you feel afterwards and how full you feel, and you feel a lot lighter,’ she said. She even mastered how to incorporate weekend indulgences into her diet. ‘I think of all of the foods that I love to eat that aren’t good for me and I literally sit and brainstorm and say how can I make this inspiralized?’ she said. Her recipe for Blueberry Sweet Potato Waffles was one she came up with when she had a craving one hungover Sunday morning. After sticking with the spiralized food and staying true to her exercise schedule, Ms Maffucci reached 150 pounds (68 kg) by early August, extremely close to her goal. Now she rests at ten stone, size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight. Compared to her old lifestyle, she said she  is much happier, focused and energised. ‘After I lost the weight, I would do something as little as writing a thank you note that before I would push off because I was so exhausted. 'I would clean out my drawers at night instead of sitting on the couch and watching TV. ‘My focus during the days was so much stronger too. Without that old laziness anymore I get so much more done now.’ Visit Ms Maffucci's blog, Inspiralized, for recipes and tips. Her book is available on Amazon.

"The wife of paedophile and former Bega Cheese CEO Maurice Van Ryn has had her letterbox fire-bombed and received several threatening calls, a court has heard. The father of one of Van Ryn's victims has also been seen in her backyard, lawyer Francois Salama told the NSW Supreme Court on Thursday morning. 'She's concerned for her safety,' he told Van Ryn's sentencing hearing. Van Ryn pleaded guilty last year to abusing 10 boys and girls, aged eight to 16, over the previous decade and is due to be sentenced at a later date. Scroll down for video .

Maurice Van Ryn is now allowed to sell his property to support his wife (left) and pay off legals debts . The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, including the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child. His wife Louise was at the court on Thursday and successfully applied to alter a freezing order. Under the order Maurice Van Ryn is not allowed to dispose of a property, superannuation distributions and shares or securities in four companies. It allows him to spend up to $500 a week on living expenses and $25,000 on legal bills. Maurice Van Ryn is now allowed to sell off some of his assets to support his wife and pay off debts. It was varied to permit the sale of the property, on condition that half the net proceeds be paid to the court after debts secured against the house were settled. Under the new order Van Ryn also has to pay his wife Louise, who applied for the variation, up to $5,165 per month, until the property is sold. He also has to give her up to $150,000 so she can repay his debts. Included in that is $25,000 'for her ordinary living expenses', the orders state. Van Ryn, who has previously described the abuse he inflicted as 'a few minutes of stupidity', is undergoing a chemical castration treatment while in custody. He will remain behind bars and will be sentenced on June 17. A young woman who was subjected to years of abuse by Bega Cheese boss Maurice Van Ryn (pictured) has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life . In court on Monday a young woman who was subjected to years of abuse by Bega Cheese boss Maurice Van Ryn has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life. For years she kept what Van Ryn did to her a secret, but when she found out he had been caught she knew she had to break her silence. One of his victims told Sydney's District Court that she is scared for her future relationships, and didn't understand why she had been targeted. 'I am scared for my future relationships,' the young woman said, according to News Corp. 'He has stolen my right to share my body with someone for the first time.' Van Ryn sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she told Sydney's District Court on Monday about the impact his abuse has had on her. The young woman, who cannot be named, said when he abused her as a child she didn't know it was wrong. 'I didn't understand why he would do something like this. Does this happen to every kid? Do friends do this to other friends?' she said. 'I didn't know it was against the law.' Van Ryn (left) sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she told Sydney's District Court on Monday about the impact his abuse has had on her. The young woman, who cannot be named, said when he abused her as a child she didn't know it was wrong . She said she hadn't spoken up about the abuse until the day she heard he had been caught, and since then had attempted to take her own life. 'I knew I had to say something.' Since then, however, she says she has been scared people will find out. 'I didn't want people to know what happened to me. I don't want people asking questions. She says she wonders when Van Ryn, who is now in custody will be out in the community again, and she worries what he did to her will forever affect how she relates to men.

"An editor for a Los Angeles-based fashion website has opened up about going from a super skinny size two to a ‘healthy’ size ten, in a new article about body acceptance. Being obsessed about having the perfect body is not exclusive to those working in fashion, but it is an industry that encourages it, and Meghan Blalock, Managing Editor of popular style website Who What Wear, is the first to admit that things can get carried away. In a new article published on her website, the 29-year-old editor reveals what her changing sizes taught her about being comfortable in her own skin and how being thinner did not equal being happier - though she admits that this is only something she has recently started coming to terms with. Strike a pose: Meghan Blalock, pictured at a Marchesa shoot in 2014, when she ‘squeezed into’ a small size six dress, has opened up about her battle with body image . Blogger extraordinaire: Meghan wrote the article for the website Who What Wear, where she works as a Managing Editor . 'I was teased for being fat starting around seven or eight years old,' she writes. 'Of course, I was far from actually being fat, but I think the cruelty of my peers ended up having a long-term impact that I am just overcoming.' In her confessional, Meghan describes being every different size from a two to a ten, explaining that her smallest form was achieved after losing 25 pounds as a teenager when she 'made it my mission to show up to my freshman year looking fitter and better than ever'. She met that goal by going on a restriction diet and 'exercising like crazy all summer'. Stepping into the school on the first day back to a windfall of compliments, Meghan admits that she felt 'amazing', but also reveals that the 'high' she gained from being thin led her down a path to 'an actual addiction'. Ever-changing: The 29-year-old, pictured when she was somewhere between a size four and a size six, says she has been 'pretty much every size you can imagine' 'Eventually, I ended up somewhere around 110 pounds, and I stopped menstruating,' she writes. 'My “rock bottom,” as they say, came when, at 15 years old, I found myself in my parents' bathroom, sobbing because I had overshot my calorie limit for the day, and was pondering vomiting it all up.' That turning point put Meghan on the journey to accepting her body. And while it was a long time before she truly achieved that state, she now confesses that she knows the times in her life when she was at her skinniest, were also the periods when she was the most unhappy. 'The times when I have been thin, when I looked really, really great in every single photo, are the times when I have been the most miserable on the inside,' she says. 'When I’ve been my skinniest, I’ve been my unhappiest: Meghan says she is much more happy since she let go of trying to be extra thin . A healthy size eight: Meghan, pictured in November 2014, is now a yoga addict and more comfortable in her skin than she's ever been . While Meghan claims to believe not all size two women are miserable, she adds that it is 'simply not my natural state', and usually stemmed from issues like stress and eating disorders. Today, Meghan says she is a healthy size eight, regularly does yoga and tries to 'feel nothing but positive feelings' when looking in the mirror. She admits that it's a battle to truly feel that way, but she rounds up her article on the advice that she has learned: 'It simply does not matter what size you are. 'What matters is your internal state—your happiness, contentment, and joy—and that your body is healthy,' she says. 'Obviously, this is much easier said than done, but take it from a woman who has seen some success at trying not to care: It’s possible, and what you experience on the other side is a whole new level of freedom.'","Meghan Blalock, 29, is the Managing Editor for popular style website Who What Wear .
She says that her obsession with losing weight began when she was bullied as a young child and eventually it became an 'addiction'"

The 28-year-old Girls star has penned an essay for Seventeen magazine titled ‘Why I'm on Team Weirdo For Life’, in which she recounted the regrettable moment when she yielded to the pressure to be a 'regular' girl by altering her appearance. 'I was a bona fide weirdo in high school,' she wrote. 'My best friend was my dad. (Still is.) I wore my yellow rubber clogs every day. I was so obsessed with my pet rabbit that I fed her bananas from my mouth.' Scroll down for video .

And while no one ever shoved Lena into a locker for being the type of girl to bring a 'bagel to the party, not beer', she admitted that it was made clear she wasn't respected by her peers. Lena recalled trying an 'experiment', in which she tried to fit in. She wore the 'normal' flared jeans that were in style at the time and her mom's tank top. She donned eyeliner, straightened her hair and even padded her bra. While the reactions to her change in appearance were subtle at first, she soon overheard a guy in her class saying: 'Wow. She actually looks regular.' Just be yourself: The 28-year-old, who wore her mom's prom dress for her senior photo (pictured), encouraged girls to be themselves in an essay for Seventeen . Animal lover: Lena shared this snapshot of herself posing with three Chihuahuas on Instagram last week . But the word 'regular' didn't sit well with Lena, and the next day she was back to wearing her yellow clogs. 'Who wants to be regular, especially if it means taking an extra 15 minutes on your hair? Or pretending that you're not rereading Madame Bovary again or not crazy about your rabbit?' she asked. Lena added: 'If regular means pretending you don't have passions and style, count me out.' Strange love: Lena celebrated her three year anniversary with her boyfriend Jack Antonoff by mocking up image of the two of them with their rescue dog Lamby . In character: Lena is pictured on the set of Girls with her friend and co-star Jemima Kirke . She noted that daring to be different will cause others to 'lash out', and while Lena admits that 'criticism is an essential part of being human', she explained that most criticism isn't constructive or helpful in any way. 'It's the result of people in pain about what they perceive as their own failings,' she said of baseless criticisms. Lena explained that she will always listen to her loved one and coworkers when they have issues with her or her work. She also said that she wants her readers and viewers to make her aware if her work upsets them, but it's the criticism 'born of others' insecurities' that she warned girls to ignore. 'You don't need anyone telling you what your style, substance, or happiness should look like,' she said.","Lena, 28, penned ‘Why I'm on Team Weirdo For Life’ for the May issue of Seventeen magazine .

"A schoolboy with a rare illness which means he is allergic to sunlight has been racially abused in the street because of the brown suncream he has to wear. James Creag, 11, is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside. He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires' because their skin cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. James Creag must use the special brown suncream (pictured) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy . He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, which means he suffers from terrible sunburn (pictured) when exposed to sunlight . James, from Salford in Greater Manchester, was given Dundee Reflective Sunscreen, a thick brown paste which blocks out the light. But when strangers shouted out abuse such as 'chocolate face' and 'you're coloured' because of his unusual appearance, he refused to wear it any more. His mother Claire, 34, said: 'When he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say. I don't know why. 'It was either ignorance or evilness. People think he's different so they taunted him. It's so cruel. I hate that people take the mickey out of him. 'The cream was meant to protect him but he's stopped wearing it now.' The unfortunate schoolboy has to wear a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, and gloves in all weather so he is not harmed by the sun, which would be like having 'boiling water poured on him'. However, his condition can also can flare up when he is inside, so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun's rays. 'His school got new lightbulbs in October,' Mrs Creag said. 'Immediately he started getting pins and needles and his body swelled up. He was in agony, I was so worried. 'It turned out he was suffering a reaction to the new daylight bulb lights. The school put a special coating over them and now he is lots better. Family: James with his mother Claire and younger sister Grace, who does not have the condition . EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As . blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy . from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly . damage surrounding tissues. The . nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, . and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing . swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation . She added: 'He was first diagnosed when he was two. He was playing football in the garden with my husband, Daniel. 'But after half an hour outside, they came running towards me, James screaming. He said his hands hurt. They had swollen up so much they looked like boxing gloves. 'I put them under the cold tap and looked at him. His skin was red hot and burning. It was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size.' The family visited their GP, who suggested that James might be allergic to grass. 'He was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away,' his mother said. 'But it kept happening and I took James to the doctors three times that week. 'Painkillers and allergy tablets didn't help. Every time he was outside, any exposed skin became red raw, his face and hands would swell up. He would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference.' Eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition. 'We were told to wrap him up and use the special cream,' Mrs Creag added. 'So, even if it's overcast, James still wears a hat, scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin. The Dundee cream is so important.' She spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter Grace had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to James for his bravery. 'Even after all he's been through James is brilliant,' Mrs Creag said. 'He is your typical 11-year-old lad. Even when he is flaring up, he just shrugs his shoulders. I admire him. 'He always wears a hat too He just puts up with it though. He’s so brave and doesn’t let it get him down. Even though other kids can play football in the sunshine.' Mrs Creag continued: 'Doctors said his EPP was an inherited condition. Daniel had a variant gene, I had a mutant gene. So when I fell pregnant with Grace I was terrified she’d be born with EPP too. 'Luckily she wasn't.'","James Creag suffers from rare condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria .

Dietitians have singled out a 'happy tummy brew' in Evans' cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, because it contains almost five times the maximum vitamin A dose for a baby. The original recipe for the 'brew' contained more than 10 times the maximum daily intake of vitamin A for babies. Scroll down for video . The paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around, with celebrity followers taking on the lifestyle . The Dieticians Association of Australia said the reworked formula still presents a threat to babies. 'This new infant 'brew' could seriously harm babies,' a spokeswoman for the Dieticians Association of Australia told News Corp Australia. 'The authors seem to have made a serious mistake with this second version of their liver and broth recipe, suggesting they do not understand the basic scientific and nutrition information relevant for infant feeding. 'They have said publicly that they have tried to make it safe by reworking the original recipe, and increasing the age for which it's suggested from 0-6 months to now be 6-12 months, but they have failed spectacularly to meet any safe standards.' The paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle . Evans's co-authors, wellness blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padrin, told Channel 7 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed 'Happy Tummy Brew'. The pair told the program the recipe had changed. 'We added vitamin C and some calcium,'Carr told The Morning Show. It comes after Evans' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis. A 30-year-old woman, Hollie, wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in September 2013. She said that she endured months of  constant dizziness, altered temperature perception, extreme fatigue, numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression. But after jumping on the Paleo diet bandwagon, Hollie claimed she has not suffered any MS symptoms over the past 12 months, her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever. Hollie's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on Facebook on Saturday. Pete Evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis . 'WOW this is powerful story on MS, thanks for sharing Hollie.. it will make your heart sing.. it has mine, please tag and share wide!' Evans wrote. The Australian chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg, another MS sufferer. The woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on Evans' 10 weeks Paleo program. The celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate . 'I have had a lot of health issues the past years, mainly auto-immune stuff including MS,' she wrote in the online post. 'Having MS means I'm always sapped of energy, have numbness, pins and needles, pain, poor concentration, etc. Not any more!' Marg said she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs. 'No way on earth I could have done that 10 weeks ago,' she wrote. 'My concentration and memory is much better and I can also plan better. I'm not off my MS meds yet but I am off my Thyroid and Reflux meds. 'Thanks so much Pete and team for helping me get my life back. You've made this road so easy. As an added bonus I've gone from a size 16 to a size 12.' The My Kitchen Rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But, Hollie praised Evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet, and said 'the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable'. 'I have been inspired by your encouragement, great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide,' Hollie wrote. 'Pete, I thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though I'm a weirdo for following this way of life.' In another recent Facebook post, the Australian chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by Marg who also suffers from MS . Evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman 'diet' LaTrobe University Associate Professor of Dietetics Catherine Itsiopoulos pointed out Hollie's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the Paleo lifestyle. 'Her diet may have been poor previously,' Dr Itsiopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we don't know what her diet and eating habits were like before. 'By eating lean meat, good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together. 'But we don't actually know if her condition is cured so it's hard to advocate on because there's no scientific evidence to back this up.' The paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar . University of South Australia Professor of Population, Health and Nutrition Kerin O'Dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for Hollie, it might not work for others. 'Pete can share whatever he likes to his followers but there's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease,' Dr O'Dea told Daily Mail Australia. 'Someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person's case but it's very difficult to imply it to others, which can be quite misleading for people. The paleo style of eating, which Pete Evans is a proud supporter of, has been sweeping across the globe . 'They could feel failure when it doesn't work for them, especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this. 'I wouldn't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses.' The paleo style of eating, which Evans is a proud supporter of, has swept  the globe and involves a high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruits, seeds and nuts.","Health experts slam Pete Evans' new baby milk formula as a danger to kids .

"Europe's controversial new laws banning ultra-thin models from strutting down the catwalk may be doing more harm than good as models are reportedly going to extreme measures to ensure they clock in at a 'healthy' weight when they hop on the scale - including stuffing their underwear with sandbags. Earlier this month France passed a new law that bars models from walking the runway if their body mass index is deemed too low, in an attempt to combat anorexia. And the pressure is on for agencies who can face a fines of up to $80,000 and six months in prison for employing too-thin models. But former model Jennifer Sky, 38, from Brooklyn, New York, has revealed in an op-ed for the New York Observer that the fashion industry has already found a way around the regulations, explaining that thin models are now resorting to wearing weighted Spanx in order to cheat the new BMI standards. New kind of pressure: Former model Jennifer Sky, pictured in 2013 (R) and 2003 (L), has reported that models are being asked to wear Spanx underwear stuffed with sandbags, so they can clock in at a 'healthy' weight . Different rules: Models can be seen walking down the runway at the Masha Ma show in March at Paris Fashion Week. France recently passed a law banning models from the catwalk if their body mass index is too low . An anonymous model, referred to in the piece as 'Lauren', told Jennifer that she participated in Spanish Fashion Week, sometime after the country passed its new weight law in 2006 and recalled being asked to hide weights in her undergarments. 'They gave us Spanx underwear to stuff with weighted sandbags so the thinnest of girls had a ""healthy"" weight on the scales,' Lauren said. 'I even saw them put weights in their hair.' Jennifer went on to say that she hopes the US does not try to pass this 'discriminatory and misguided' because of its negative affect on naturally thin women. She noted that when she was a teenager she too would have been deemed underweight because BMI calculations, which are based on weight and height, don't take age, sex or genetic body shape into account. 'At 16, when I was working as a fashion model, I weighed 115 pounds and was 5’7” 1/2,' she wrote. 'I exercised regularly and really loved to eat Subway veggie sandwiches and drink McDonald’s vanilla milkshakes.' Major changes: Models can be seen strutting down the catwalk during the YDE show at Paris Fashion Week in March. Agencies who employ 'too-thin' models face large fines and even jail time under the new French law . She continued: 'I was not anorexic or starving - I was definitely over-worked. I was simply a naturally thin teenager with a powerful teenage metabolic system.' Jennifer noted that as a teen with a BMI of 18.0, she would most certainly have been considered 'underweight'; while the exact BMI requirements for models working in France have not been released, the World Health Organization considers people with a BMI below 18.5 to be underweight and at risk of being malnourished. And while Jennifer says that, 22 years later her current measurements finally put her at a 'normal' 21.0, her BMI for most of her modeling career would have been deemed too dangerous for her to work under the new laws. While the model rights activist applauded the French government for attempting to protect the health of 'these young working professionals', she and Lauren both agreed that outlawing skinny altogether is not the answer. 'I think a better solution is to raise the age limit for models to 18,' Lauren told Jennifer. 'Many ultra-thin models are simply still going through puberty, and allowing their bodies to form before their career would be beneficial to all.' Model rights activist: Jennifer spoke with Megan Alexander (R) about trafficking, abuse, and child labor problems within the fashion industry on Inside Edition in February . Strict rules: The 38-year-old, who snapped this 'Post Fashion Week' selfie in February, noted her BMI would have been considered too low when she was a healthy 16-year-old model because she had a fast metabolism . Jennifer added that instead of putting restrictions on the size of young models, the French government should 'look to the modeling agencies who freely act as employment agencies without the responsibilities of treating their client-models as working professionals'. Because models are considered independent contractors in the US, standard employment laws, which allow workers mandatory breaks, compensation for injuries and protection from sexual harassment, do not apply. Sara Ziff, who is a model and founder of The Model Alliance organization, told Think Progress in March that she is also against the new French law because legislating body mass standards is not the same thing as the fashion industry promoting a 'healthy ideal'. 'BMI suggests there are distinct categories of underweight, ideal, overweight and obese, with sharp boundaries that hinge on a decimal place, which is simply not true,' she explained. 'It is unfair and unreasonable to ban healthy models from working just because they have a relatively low BMI.'","Former model Jennifer Sky, 38, claims that models are being asked to stuff their underwear with sandbags so they can clock in at a 'healthy' weight .
The activist says she is against France's new law, which bars models from walking the runway if their body mass index is deemed too low ."
"The Conservatives have opened up a four-point lead over Labour with millions of voters yet to make up their minds about how to vote in the tightest election race since 1992. An exclusive poll by ComRes for the Daily Mail and ITV News shows that David Cameron’s party, on 36 per cent of the vote, has moved ahead in the last fortnight as Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Ukip have all slipped. The Tory vote share equals their highest since March 2012. Labour is on 32 per cent, Ukip on ten per cent and the Liberal Democrats on eight per cent, with the Greens on five per cent. Scroll down for video . David Cameron's (left) Conservative party has opened up a four-point lead over Ed Miliband's (right) Labour with 36 per cent of the vote compared to 32 per cent, a new ComRes poll reveals with just two weeks to go . Crucially, the poll suggests that with less than a fortnight to go, there is all to play for – with a startling one in five of those who say they are likely to vote still not sure which party they will back. The main parties are evenly split when voters are asked who they would consider backing on May 7, with 48 per cent saying Labour and 47 per cent Conservative. Some 66 per cent say they would never countenance voting Ukip, with 29 per cent saying they would. The poll confirms catastrophic drop in support for the Lib Dems demonstrated in the attitudes of its former voters. Two in five – 41 per cent -- of 2010 Lib Dem voters say that they would not consider voting for the party this year. However, 25 per cent of both Conservative and Labour voters say that they would consider voting Lib Dem, suggesting that the party still has some hope of winning over voters on either side of the political spectrum. Men are slightly more inclined to consider voting for the Conservatives than women – 50 per cent compared to 43 per cent. The reverse is true for the Lib Dems – 25 per cent of men compared to 31 per cent of women, while both genders are equally likely to consider voting Labour, with 48 per cent each. Voters appear relatively relaxed about the rise of smaller parties. Some 75 per cent say it is good to have parties other than the big two in government. Nick Clegg's (left) Liberal Democrats have an eight per cent share of the vote, will Nigel Farage's (right) Ukip has ten per cent. The poll suggests that the Green party has five per cent of the vote ahead of the election . More than half of British adults – 57 per cent -- disagree that a hung parliament places too much power in the hands of smaller parties, and seven in ten – 70 per cent -- disagree that having smaller parties in government is undemocratic. However, the poll shows that Conservative voters are significantly less positive about the increase in support for smaller parties. Almost half of them – 46 per cent – believe that another hung parliament would give them too much sway. ComRes said the poll showed the Tories had ‘reinforced their lead’, with Labour yet to be ahead in any telephone survey by the pollster this year. Despite this, the Tories are still ‘unsure of winning a majority of seats in the Commons’, it added. Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said: ‘Our latest poll continues the trend we’ve seen all year, with the Conservatives just, but consistently, ahead of Labour. Despite this lead, both parties have very similar proportions of the electorate willing to consider voting for them. ‘With just two weeks left and the margin so fine, both Labour and the Conservatives will be exerting most of their efforts on moving people from these pools of potential support into polling booths across the country to make their votes count.’ A more detailed ComRes analysis of undecided voters, involving 1,500 people, will lift Tory spirits. It found that they trust that the Conservatives will be better than Labour at promoting economic growth by a wide margin of 42 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr Cameron is the leader most undecided voters want to see running the country, backed by 28 per cent, ahead of Ed Miliband, with 16 per cent. And 42 per cent say Mr Cameron is strong, compared to only 11 per cent who say the same of the Labour leader. Some 42 per cent of undecided voters regard him as a good leader, compared to only 14 per cent who say the same of Mr Miliband. To the alarm of Labour strategists, another pollster also suggested the party’s support is slipping and the Tories have taken a four-point lead. A Survation poll for the Mirror put the Conservatives up two on last week, with 33 per cent, Labour down six on 29 per cent, Ukip on 18 per cent and the Lib Dems on ten per cent.","Conservatives have opened up four-point lead over Labour, poll reveals .

"Modern humans have developed a reputation for being somewhat destructive and keen to separate themselves from the rest of the animal kingdom. However, a recent excavation of a cave in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains in Spain is suggesting our ancient cousins, the Neanderthals, were more in tune with nature. Archaeologists have discovered evidence that Neanderthals regularly inhabited the Cave of Llenes, near Senterada in Catalonia, around 200,000 years ago but were not alone. The fossilised remains of badgers were found in old dens within the cave alongside Neanderthal camps . The remains of other canivores including cave bears, hyenas, leopards, wolves and badgers have been found in the cave and were apparently also living there. While some of the bones may have been brought there by the Neanderthals themselves, it seems they were also sharing the cave with these other predators. Scratches on the walls and hibernations nests particularly indicate that cave bears spent a considerable amount of time there. Neanderthals, shown in the artist's impression above, may have lived alongside predators in a cave in Spain . Researchers found several cave bear fossils, similar to the one above, along with scratches on the walls and signs of hibernation nests that suggest they were living in the cave alongside Neanderthals 200,000 years ago . It is hoped the discoveries will help scientists learn more about Neanderthal behaviour and their relationship with the animals they co-existed with. ‘The excavations have documented regular visits by groups Neanderthals, probably related to hunting animals living around the cave.’ The researchers discovered large numbers of stone tools made by Neanderthals and evidence of camps that were made close to the entrance of the cave. They also found the fossilised bones of Bonal tahr – a species of wild sheep that became extinct in western Europe 100,000 years ago – which appear to have been hunted by the Neanderthals. The researchers also found traces of other ungulates including deer, rhinos and megaloceros - a giant species of deer that is now extinct. Neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago, spreading to inhabit much of Europe and parts of Asia, but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago. The reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated Homo sapiens. They were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age Europe. However, a series of discoveries are now putting Neanderthals into a new light. Stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination. A 60,000-year-old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in France also suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices . A recent discovery by researchers at the Muséum National d'Histories Naturelle in Paris suggests that Neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them. They discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones. Many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments. Cross-hatched engravings found inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are also thought to be the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art. DNA analysis has also shown that Neanderthals carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak. Eight talons found at a 130,000 year old Neanderthal site in Krapina in Croatia are also thought to be the world's first jewellery, and may have been worn as a necklace. Recent research has also suggested that Neanderthals may also have used  herbs to flavour their food. Neanderthals, like the one  above, may well have been the world's first gourmet chefs and made jewellery .","Fossils found in Cave of Llenes in Catalonia, Spain suggests Neanderthals lived  alongside other predators like badgers, bears, wolves and leopards .

"Two French backpackers who filmed themselves torching a native Australian quokka have been released from prison. Thibaud Jean Leon Vallet, 24, and his cousin Jean Mickael Batrikian, 18, pleaded guilty to animal cruelty after footage emerged of the pair lighting the quokka on fire with an aerosol can and a lighter on Rottnest Island on April 3. The pair appeared before Fremantle Magistrate's Court last Friday and were ordered to pay $4000 and were told that they would be held behind bars for seven days if they fail to pay the fines. Scroll down for video . The two French tourists charged with setting fire to a quokka have been released from jail after spending a week behind bars . The French men opted to serve the seven days in Hakea prison rather than pay the fine, as they did not have sufficient funds. A Department of Corrective Services spokeswoman said that the week long sentence was considered the equivalent of the fine, and that it had been served in full, reported WA Today. The men were released at 11.30 am on Thursday morning after entering the jail, in Canning Vale, Western Australia on Friday. According to Corrective Services, the two French men cost taxpayers $1810 each day they were in jail, despite the fact that the pair had saved over $12,000 between them in their working holiday employment as cleaners, reported The Esperance Express. The creature survived the incident by scampering away, but was singed by the flame . Animal rights activists have claimed that the pair's punishment was too lenient for their crime . Using a deodorant can and lighter, the men torch the defenseless creature which quickly scampers away . Animal rights activists have claimed that the pair's punishment was too lenient for their crime. 'It was pretty disgusting,' said Peter Murphy from Quokka Rescue. 'I don't think the sentence is enough. I think they got off quite lightly.' The video of the crime was played in court on Friday, and Magistrate Elizabeth Langdon labelled the act 'outrageous', reported The West Australian. In the disturbing footage of their crime, both men are heard laughing uncontrollably after igniting the quokka before one said 'Don't do that, why?' The creature survived the incident by scampering away, but was singed by the flame. The magistrate was told that Vallet and Batrikian were remorseful for their actions, and that they admitted the incident was stupid and juvenile. The men can be heard uncontrollably laughing after igniting the native Australian creature . The quokka is a small wallaby and resembles a diminutive version of the kangaroo with thick brown fur . Magistrate Langdon commented on their cruelty, calling the offence 'abhorrent.' 'One can only imagine the impact caused to the quokka,' she said. 'Obviously it would have been fearful as a result of what occurred.' The men told Fairfax Media outside court on Saturday, 'you think we're monsters? We didn't hurt the quokka. We have pets at home.' Both men were on a working holiday and were spending three months in Rottnest Island working as cleaners. As a result of the incident, both men lost their job. They also had their passports confiscated and are expected to be leaving Australia soon. The quokka, classed by the government as 'vulnerable', is a small wallaby and resembles a diminutive version of the kangaroo with thick, rough, grey-brown fur. It is found only in the south-west of Western Australia state and on the offshore islands of Rottnest and Bald.","Video emerged showing two French tourists torching a quokka .

"Bingo hall toilets have tested positive for traces of Class A drugs amid evidence that an increasing number of pensioners are turning to hard drugs in retirement. Out of 17 bingo halls tested seven showed traces of cocaine, while another had traces of crack cocaine, a more dangerous form of the drug that is smoked, a newspaper investigation revealed. While the venues do let players as young as 18 in, the majority of attendees are elderly, and the discoveries mirror a spike in OAPs being treated for drug abuse. Out of 17 bingo halls tested across the country, seven had traces of cocaine in the toilets, while this one, in Hengrove Leisure Park, Bristol, was found to have traces of crack cocaine . Class A: While bingo halls allow people as young as 18 to visit, the majority of visitors are pensioners (pictured, Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol, where traces of cocaine were found in the toilets) Figures from Public Health England show that 634 pensioners over 65 were treated for substance abuse in the last year, a rise of 20 per cent in a year, and double the rates seen in 2009. A probe by The Sun used swabs coated with special chemicals which reveal traces of cocaine to test toilet cubicles in bingo halls around the country. The news comes as hospital figures reveal a spike in drug abuse among the elderly, with 634 treated for addiction last year (stock picture) Two Gala Bingo premises in Clydebank Retail Park and Hawthorne Quadrant, Glasgow, tested positive for the drug, while Mecca Bingo in Coral Island, Blackpool, also showed traces of cocaine. Gala Bingo in Basildon and Mecca Bingo in Romford, Essex, also had positive results, as did Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol. Another Bristol venue, Gala Bingo in Hengrove Leisure Park, tested positive for crack cocaine, which is highly addictive. Kate Lawrence, of drug charity Phoenix Futures, told the paper’s Grant Rollings that the findings were unsurprising, adding that many older people turn to drugs to combat loneliness, or to socialise. She said: 'We assume older people don't want to go out and socialise, but they do, particularly if they are lonely. Loneliness is a massive trigger for drugs. 'The older generation isn't so well informed because we have concentrated on warning young people about drugs. Representatives from both Mecca Bingo and Gala Bingo said that their companies took a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and banned taking them on their premises. Figures released early last year showed that, as well as record numbers of pensioners being hospitalised with drug problems, thousands more were seeking help to kick the habit. Busted: Mecca Bingo Blackpool was among the eight premises where traces of Class A drugs were found . Zero tolerance: Both Gala Bingo and Mecca Bingo said drug taking was banned in both of their venues (pictured, Gala Bingo in Basildon, where cocaine traces were discovered) More than 2,000 people in their 60s, 70s and 80s sought help for problems relating to substance abuse in 2013 - double the number that were receiving treatment only five years ago. The dramatic rise is being blamed on those who first experimented with drugs during the 1960s, and have continued to use them on and off over the subsequent decades. The majority of those requesting help last year suffered from addictions to heroin or crack cocaine, although there were significant numbers who had problems with cannabis, amphetamines and prescription medications.","Out of 17 bingo halls tested, seven revealed traces of cocaine in toilets .

"Hardly a day passes without a spurious new survey which lists our supposedly favourite things. An example of this banality last week was one about what makes us most happy. Among the feel-good experiences were said to be fresh sheets and popping bubble wrap. Reading this idiotic list made me extremely depressed. You cannot reduce life to a catchphrase or a ranking like a best-buy at Morrison’s. Experiences which bring us true pleasure are being with loved ones, enjoying warm weather, eating wonderful home-cooked food and just laughing uncontrollably. It’s not rocket science. Surely a far more useful exercise is to list every aspect of modern life that makes us unhappy. Here’s my list of pet hates — which gets longer by the day: . In the face of an increasing number of surveys claiming to reveal what makes us most happy, Janet Street-Porter reveals her list of the things that are making her unhappy - which is getting longer by the day! TRENDY MEN WITH BUSHY BEARDS . Is there anything less attractive than a man’s chin covered by a thick mat of hair? God forbid you get close enough to snog anyone sprouting a beard that makes them look like a Sixties folk singer or an extra from a remake of Moses. SECRET FACE-LIFTS . Every September, I encounter women whose faces look suspiciously taut, whose saggy chins have vanished and who have managed to eradicate the bags under their eyes. Although they put this good health down to a ‘wonderfully restful holiday’, the truth is they’ve had a face-lift. NASTY LITTLE SACHETS . The bane of B&Bs, cafes and hotels. What’s wrong with a pot of jam on the table? WEATHER DOLLIES . Every night these simpering females appear on local TV news bulletins, posing pertly in front of a map of Britain in very high heels, and totally inappropriate cocktail frocks, waving perfectly manicured hands around. VOUCHERS PAST USE-BY DATES . As a dedicated bargain-hunter, it causes deep pain to discover at the till that my carefully-collected discount vouchers have expired. Janet is a self-confessed bargain hunter who hates it when she discovers her vouchers are out of date . ANYTHING CALLED ‘AN EXPERIENCE’ Shopping has become a pastime, like making raffia mats or embroidery, and addicts dignify this mindless activity by talking about the ‘experience’. Everything is an ‘experience’ these days, from a car wash to munching on a burger. SLUGS, SNAILS, MICE . Is there anything more soul-destroying than lovingly nurturing broad beans, peas and lettuces from seed, only to go away for the weekend and return to find they have been destroyed by these vile creatures. DIETING CELEBRITIES . Nothing makes me crosser than celebrities’ claims that any weight-loss is due to ‘eating healthily’. Nine times out of ten, they’ve been paid a huge sum of money to plug a diet plan or a food supplement. CHEFS WHO THINK THEY’RE PICASSO . Too many chefs fiddle with a decent meal and turn it into something that artist Tracey Emin would be proud of. For example, with chive and parmesan crisps carefully balanced like a propeller surrounded by drips of gravy. Yuk. PAY-BY-PHONE CAR PARKING . What’s wrong with cash? This drives people crazy — especially older people who find it a big hassle to try to use a phone to pay for 20 minutes in a car park so you can get your shopping in Boots. Janet remains baffled by pay-by-phone car parking, what's wrong with cash? QUEUE-JUMPERS AT AIRPORTS . After patiently waiting my turn, I could murder anyone who suddenly appears out of the blue and joins a ‘friend’ in the queue in front on me. SUPERFOODS . Sold at a premium price because we are so desperate to extend our lives by a month, that we want to stuff ourselves with goji berries, quinoa, purple sprouting broccoli, pink tomatoes and hideous kale. Funny how mum and dad were so thin and fit, without a single goji berry. FAKE WORDS . For example, air stewards talk of ‘de-planing’ (don’t they mean ‘disembarking’ or ‘getting off’)? Railway stations are described as ‘calling points’. I heard a radio reporter speak about Nigerians ‘jubilating’ after the country’s recent election. Phoney words started when ordinary people started being called ‘stake-holders’. I blame New Labour. RE-SEALABLE BAGS OF RICE . Whoever invented the ‘re-sealable’ bag for rice, nuts, pasta etc, I want to go around to their house and shout: ‘It doesn’t work!’ ‘Re-sealable’ bag for rice, nuts, pasta just don't make sense to Janet . JUICERS . The Devil’s gadgets. If God had meant us to live on green slime, he would have given us gills and no teeth. Part of the enjoyment of food is the textures and fibres. No one is going to reduce my breakfast to slurry in the name of an energy drink. MIRACLE FACE/EYE CREAM . The impossible dream — turning back time with a pot of gunk. Only a giant pleat pulled together at the back of my neck will get rid of the sagging jowls on my jawline. The cheapest solution is to talk a lot, so the loose flesh keeps moving and it either tightens up or it’s not so obvious. PAYING BILLS ONLINE . Having to remember all the ruddy passwords to log on to your account takes longer than writing an old-fashioned cheque and sticking it in an envelope. SMALL TALK . I’m useless at this, and am infuriated when check-out staff in the supermarket (ordered to do so by their boss) ask how I am. If wanted to talk to them, I’d open the conversation. TRAD JAZZ . In my mind, this will for ever be ‘dad’ jazz, not helped by the fact Tory grandee Ken Clarke is a huge fan. Modern jazz is fantastic, but I’m afraid the late clarintettist Acker Bilk has a lot to answer for. Trad jazz goes with halitosis, corduroy trousers, a check shirt and a dodgy waistcoat. YORKSHIRE PUD FLOPS . I am a decent cook, but I’ve never managed to make a Yorkshire pud that didn’t resemble an old shoe sole. And don’t bother writing in with your tips, I’ve tried them all. Limp and lifeless Yorkshire puddings are also something that Janet's added to her list of annoyances . GETTING MY NAME WRONG . Don’t ever call me Janice! In America, I’m routinely called Miss Street or Mrs Porter. Sorry, I managed to marry a double-barrelled bloke, but that’s my name, so get over it. ORIGAMI HOTEL TOWELS . Is this a substitute for real cleaning — folding the ends of toilet paper into points and sticking the clean towels on the bed, turned into origami swans? CENTRAL HEATING CONTROLS . When the Devil wanted to create something that would result in regular domestic fury, he devised the control box for programming central heating. Holiday settings, off-peak settings and then copying each day’s setting to the next day … I feel miserable just thinking about it. COUNTRY PUB LANDLORDS . As a walker, I know that the more remote the pub, the less likely it will serve anything edible after 2pm. They think they can fob people off with a bag of crisps and a picked onion. Forget the ‘hospitality industry’, it’s more like the hostility industry. Traditional pubs often seem to have landlords who think they can fob you off with just a bag of crisps, according to Janet (stock image) UNNECESSARY INSURANCE . I am bombarded with leaflets and emails offering special insurance for my gutters, my roof, the central heating, the drains, the pipework, the pet, and my holidays. How did we get through life before the advent of insurance? I have cancelled nearly all the policies after my plumber told me one for the boiler costing me £200 a year was pointless. MEN AND SHOPPING LISTS . What is it about men and supermarkets? Why do they have to go off-piste? Instead of getting the essentials you’ve carefully written down for them, they buy their own favourites: a nasty can of hot dogs, a huge pot of English mustard and a jumbo bag of crisps. STEPS AT STATIONS . Maybe it’s because I make a lot of journeys with a heavy wheelie bag stuffed full of left-overs from the fridge, my computer, some clean clothes and a book. But why do most railway stations have giant flights of steps between platforms and up from the car park? READY-TO-EAT FRUIT . Another supermarket scam —you pay way more for this stuff on the basis that it will be deliciously ripe, but they invariably turn to mush in 24 hours. BABY CHAT . Ok, I haven’t had a baby, only four husbands — but I don’t go around flashing photos of them at people. Why should I be interested in someone’s new baby, unless they are directly related to me? Most babies look exactly the same anyway, just giant tadpoles in nappies. Janet can't stand it when people go around flashing pictures of their new-born children (stock image) PUBLIC EATING . We’ve become a nation of scoffers totally unembarrassed about gorging while we walk, dropping chips and spraying crumbs as we chat on our mobile phones. Ugh! TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENTS . Every journey nowadays seems to be blighted by the guard (now called a ‘train manager’!) making endless useless announcements about the next station, the cause of a delay or the availability of a full range of snacks (i.e. just crisps) in the buffet car (now re-named the ‘on-board café’.) TOILET ROLL TROLLS . There’s nothing more annoying than someone who doesn’t replace a toilet roll. BAD IMPERSONATORS OF ME . About once a month, a member of the public comes up to me and announces that their teenage daughter does a really good impersonation of me and is thinking of a career on telly. Being confronted by an embarrassed 16-year-old with ginger hair attempting to mimic my accent is not remotely entertaining!","An increasing number of surveys claim to reveal what makes us happiest .
But are these generic lists really of any use to us?

"Singer Adele Adkins, a mother-of-one, has topped the young music rich list again, earning £5million in the last year, despite releasing no new music . It has been almost four years since her last album but that has not stopped Adele from earning £5million over the last year. Bringing her fortune to a total of £50million, the singer has retained her place at the top of the list of Britain’s richest musicians under the age of 30. The mother-of-one, 26, has double the wealth of her closest rivals – the four members of One Direction and their former compatriot Zayn Malik, 22 - who are worth £25million each. However, the country’s rising stars are hot on the singer’s heels. Ed Sheeran, 24, has enjoyed the year’s biggest rise, with a £13million boost taking his fortune to £20million and moving him from 23rd to seventh on the list. While Sam Smith, 22, is a new entry with £12million, placing him on par with Florence Welch, 28, and the pairing of Arctic Monkey’s guitarist Jamie Cook, 29, with his model wife Katie Downes, 30. Adele, full name is Adele Adkins, faces the toughest female competition from the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding singer Ellie Goulding, 28, who, alongside Leona Lewis, 30, Jessie J, 27, and Katie Melua, 30, is worth £13million. Having also sung the theme song for the last James Bond instalment Skyfall, Adele’s hotly anticipated but much delayed third album is believed to be set for a release later this year. This is the fourth year in a row Adele has topped the list of the richest young musicians. With such impressive earning power, many of her contemporaries would look to channel their popularity into other lucrative activities. However, the singer has previously ruled that out, telling Vogue: ‘I have absolutely no intention of going into acting or making perfumes. Adele has amassed twice the wealth of her nearest competitors, the four remaining members of One Direction, plus recently departed Zayn Malik, who are worth £25million each . 'I am a singer. I will stick to what I am good at and not spread myself thin and become mediocre at everything I do.’ The figures have been compiled for the new edition of The Sunday Times Rich List, released this weekend and are based on the information about the stars’ land and property portfolios, stocks in public companies and known assets such as art. The young musicians still have a long way to go to catch their older counterparts. Sir Paul McCartney, 72, and his wife Nancy Shevell, 55, top the list of the richest musicians overall for another year. They have added £20million to their joint fortune this year, bringing their total wealth to £730million. Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber, 67, and the pop group U2 collectively round off the top three, with £650million and £431million respectively. The highest ranked new entry in the overall list is DJ Calvin Harris, who at 31 is just ineligible for the list of young musicians. Songstress Ellie Goulding is the nearest female competition for Adele, with  wealth of around £13million . Also hitting the £13million mark are Leona Lewis (left) and Jessie J (right), according to the Sunday Times . Rumoured to be dating pop star Taylor Swift, 25, he has debuted at number 30 with a fortune of £70million – joint with Mark Knopfler, 65, of Dire Strait’s and The Who’s Pete Townshend, 69. Harris, a Scottish born DJ and producer who has worked with stars including Kylie Minogue, Rihanna and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, is reportedly the world’s highest paid DJ, earning $1million (£665,000) for a single performance. Last year, he was the first solo British album to have his songs played more than one billion times on music streaming service Spotify, earning him a pay cheque of £4million. In last year’s Sunday Times list, Calvin Harris was ranked second richest young musician after Adele, with a fortune of £30million. Graduating to the full rankings, he has more than doubled his wealth over the last 12 months. Sir Paul McCartney has not had a UK number one single in decades but that has not stopped him topping the only chart that counts - the top 40 musical millionaires. The former Beatle has a personal fortune of £730 million - £20 million up from last year - and is well ahead of his nearest rival Andrew Lloyd Webber, who is estimated to be worth £650 million. Sir Paul's fortune is given a significant boost by his wife Nancy Shevell, who has a £150 million stake in her family's US trucking business. Irish rockers U2 share a £431 million fortune, with Sir Elton John and Sir Mick Jagger said to be worth £270 million and £225 million respectively.

"Disgraced former CIA Director David Petraeus will not go to jail for giving his mistress classified material while she was working on a book about him, a judge ruled today. The former U.S. Army General, whose career was destroyed when the affair with Paula Broadwell emerged in November 2012, avoided jail time at the hearing in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday and was instead sentenced to two years probation. He was also fined $100,000 - more than double the $40,000 his attorneys had requested. While Petraeus had agreed two months ago to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, he formally entered his plea during Thursday's hearing. Petraeus was wearing his wedding ring but there was no sign of his wife, Holly. He told the court he wanted to apologize to those closest to him 'for the pain my actions caused'. Apologies: Former CIA director David Petraeus apologized for his 'mistakes' as he spoke outside the North Carolina courthouse where he was sentenced to two years probation on Thursday afternoon . Sentenced: As well as the probation, he was fined $100,000 for leaking classified information to his mistress . Following the hearing, he briefly addressed the media outside the courthouse. 'As I did in the past, I apologize for those closest to me and many others,' he said, before thanking his supporters including his family, colleagues and fellow veterans. 'I now look forward to moving on with the next phase of my life and with continuing to serve our great nation as a private citizen,' he added. Critics have noted that in other cases concerning government leaks, defendants have received far harsher punishments than Petraeus. CIA analyst John Kiriakou who is serving 30 months behind bars for revealing the secret CIA torture program. Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represents Edward Snowden, told Reuters that he was not against lighter sentences - as long as such treatment is handed out equally. 'The problem is not that David Petraeus is getting lenient treatment,' Wizner said. 'The problem is that lenient treatment is only available to people in high places.' Petraeus was also given special conditions for his probation. He is allowed to travel internationally with his probation officer's approval, for example, and is allowed to possess firearms. He is allowed to pay the $100,000 fine $25,000 per month until it is paid in full. Going solo: Petraeus, who was seen wearing his wedding ring to  court, was not accompanied by his wife Holly to the sentencing hearing. It emerged in 2012 that he had been having an affair with his biographer . Petraeus has 14 days to file an appeal if he wants to dispute the sentencing. In the previous agreement, prosecutors said that while Broadwell was writing her book in 2011, Petraeus gave her eight binders of classified material he had improperly kept from his time as the top military commander in Afghanistan. Days later, he took the binders back to his house. Among the secret information contained in the 'black books' were the names of covert operatives, the coalition war strategy and notes about Petraeus' discussions with President Barack Obama and the National Security Council, prosecutors said. Those binders were later seized by the FBI in an April 2013 search of Petraeus' Arlington, Virginia, home, where he had kept them in the unlocked drawer of a desk in a ground-floor study. Prosecutors said that after resigning from the CIA in November 2012, Petraeus had signed a form falsely attesting he had no classified material. He also lied to FBI agents by denying he supplied the information to Broadwell, according to court documents. Affair: Petraeus gave his mistress Paula Broadwell, pictured together in 2011, classified material that he had improperly kept from his time in the military. She was writing his biography at the time . Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the CIA in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing. Broadwell, now 42, met Petraeus, 62, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University, where she was working on a dissertation about him. She wrote his biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus', which afforded them considerable time together. They carried on an affair between late 2011 and the summer of 2012. But the relationship was later uncovered whiled the FBI investigated claims that one of Petraeus' friends, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, was receiving threatening emails. The messages were found to have been sent by Broadwell, a married mother-of-two. As agents investigated Broadwell's email account, they uncovered the affair and learned the CIA director had shared classified information with her. Petraeus, who remains married to wife Holly, acknowledged the affair as he stepped down, while in May 2013, Broadwell, who is also still married, finally issued an apology for the relationship. 'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station, WSOC. Hurt: Paula Broadwell remains married to husband Scott, pictured together left in 2012, while Petraeus is married to wife Holly, right, despite the affair that forced him to step down as CIA chief in 2012 . 'I'm very blessed. Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will. Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.' Petraeus held the CIA post less than a year, not long enough to leave a significant mark on the spy agency. The core of his identity has been a military man. He was brought in by President George W. Bush to command multinational forces in Iraq in 2007, a period when the war began to turn in favor of the U.S. Petraeus' command coincided with the 'surge' of American forces in Iraq and a plan to pay Sunni militias to fight al-Qaeda in Iraq. With American help, the Sunni tribes were able to push out insurgents and enable U.S. troops to withdraw in 2011. Those same Sunni areas are now controlled by the Islamic State group, which evolved from the remnants of al-Qaida after Iraqi's Shiite-led government proved weak.","The former U.S. Army General appeared in court in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday for his sentencing hearing .

"Frail and tired of leading a secret life for four decades, 66-year-old Clarence David Moore called police this week to surrender. The deputy who answered thought it was a prank. It wasn't. Moore escaped from police custody three times during the 1970s and eventually settled into a quiet life, living in Kentucky since at least 2009. His health is poor from a stroke late last year and he has difficulty speaking. When Franklin County Sheriff Pat Melton showed up at Moore's house to make the 'arrest,' Moore was in a hospital bed. He broke down in tears. He told the sheriff he needed medical help. Turned himself in: Clarence David Moore, an escapee from a North Carolina prison turned himself in to authorities on Monday, April 20, 2015 after four decades of being on the run . 'He looks like he's almost 90,' the sheriff said. A woman who had been living with Moore had no idea of his past. 'She was just blown away when all this happened,' the sheriff said. On Wednesday, a woman who answered the door at the single-story ranch home declined comment. The modest neighborhood on the outskirts of the state's capital was dotted with brick homes with well-tended yards. Two sport-utility vehicles were parked in the driveway. Moore was convicted of larceny of more than $200 in North Carolina in 1967 and was sentenced to up to seven years in prison, according to records from the Department of Public Safety. While working with a road crew in the Asheville area, he escaped and was recaptured in 1971. He escaped again the following year and was on the lam until he was apprehended in Texas in 1975. His third escape from a Henderson County prison was Aug. 6, 1976. On Monday, after he called police, he was taken from his home by ambulance to a local hospital for evaluation and then to jail, where he remained in custody Wednesday. 'As soon as he saw us, he started crying,' Melton said Wednesday. Criminal past: This undated photo provided by North Carolina Department Of Public Safety shows fugitive Clarence David Moore in his youth . 'He said, ""I just want to get this behind me. I want to be done.""' Moore has declined requests for interviews. Melton said he knew little about Moore's life before arriving in Kentucky, other than Moore spent time working on boats along the East Coast. Neighbor Jim Clark, a former correctional officer, said he knew Moore by an alias. He was an attentive neighbor who would collect the Clarks mail for them when they went on vacation and let them know if they had left their garage door open at night. 'He was a nice neighbor. He was a very compassionate person. He didn't have any hatred in his heart toward anyone,' Clark said. Moore had lived in Frankfort since at least 2009, when he was involved in a traffic crash, Melton said. Moore was cited then for not having a driver's license. He didn't appear for his court date and was charged with contempt. He went by the name of Ronnie T. Dickinson in that case, and has used other aliases. Neighbor Richard Colyer said he knew Moore as Ronnie Dickinson. He said Moore was a private man who moved into the neighborhood three to four years ago. Sometimes Moore would sit on his front porch and wait for the mail. The sheriff said he thought Moore's poor health factored into his decision to turn himself in. As he arrived at the jail, Moore thanked the sheriff for his kindness. 'He made some bad choices, but at the end of the day he wanted to make them right and he stepped up,' Melton said. A good neighbor: Claremce David Moore resided in this Kentucky home where his neighbors described him as being compassionate .","Clarence David Moore, 66, was convicted of larceny of more than $200 in North Carolina in 1967 and was sentenced to up to seven years in prison .

"Depraved militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have brutally stoned two gay men to death only seconds after they were photographed embracing and 'forgiving' them. The shocking images were taken in ISIS-held territory in the province of Homs and show the two accused men being savagely executed by up to four jihadis. Huge, bloodthirsty crowds are seen in the desert clearing where the group of executioners made a display of hugging the blindfolded couple and telling them they were forgiven of their 'sins', before pummeling them to death with hundreds of fist-sized rocks. Shocking: The group of executioners made a display of hugging the blindfolded couple and telling them they were forgiven of their 'sins', before pummeling them to death with hundreds of fist-sized rocks . Brutal: The shocking images were taken in ISIS-held territory in the province of Homs and show the two accused men being savagely executed by up to four jihadis . Images of the horrific murder emerged on social media this afternoon and were hurriedly shared online by ISIS sympathisers who claim the photographs reveal the terrorists' compassionate side. The sequence of four images begin by showing two blindfolded men standing side-by-side in  a desert clearing while a group of ISIS gather alongside the on motorbikes. One of the two victims - who has curly hair, a thick beard and wears a black leather biker jacket - appears resigned to his fate as one of his soon-to-killers shoulders rests his hand of his shoulder. A second shot shows a close-up of the killers embracing the men and apparently forgiving them. The act appears to be genuine and there is nothing to suggest the victims mistakenly thought they had been pardoned. Their remarkably calm demeanor is instead likely to have been due to the men having been given a cocktail of medication to reduce their anxiety. ISIS is known to have used similar mind-altering drugs  both in filmed executions and when carrying out public amputations. A third image shows a huge crowd of young men and boys gathered in the desert clearing to watch the atrocity take place. Preparing to die: One of the two victims - who has curly hair, a thick beard and wears a black leather biker jacket - appears resigned to his fate as one of his soon-to-killers shoulders rests his hand of his shoulder . Bloodthirsty: A large crowd of men and boys gathered in the desert clearing to watch ISIS' latest atrocity . Wearing traditional Arab clothing, the bloodthirsty audience stand in a semi-circle only feet away from the spot where the men will be barbarically murdered. A number of motorbikes are seen in the background, suggesting that's how many of the onlookers arrived at the execution site. The final image shows the two victims' battered bodies on the ground as a group of at least four ISIS executioners stand over them, raining down rocks. News of the shocking murder comes as it emerged that armed forces battling against ISIS over the border in Iraq will finally receive the first batch of F-16 fighter jets it ordered four years ago. The shipment is expected to boost Iraq's capabilities in battling ISIS in the country. Lt. Gen. Anwar Hama Amin said the fighters would arrive on July 12 along with the U.S.-trained Iraqi pilots and spare parts and would immediately begin carrying out operations, according to a statement posted late Wednesday on the Defense Ministry's web site. Iraq ordered the 18 jets for nearly £2 billion in 2011 to supplement its almost non-existent air force.","Shocking images show men being savagely executed in Homs province .

"Chris Christie appeared on the Tonight Show Wednesday evening, and wasted no time calling on Jimmy Fallon for the weight jokes made about him on the program. After Fallon told Governor Christie he 'looked great,' the New Jersey politician asked him; 'If I look great, what the hell's with all the jokes every night?' Then, to make amends, Fallon gave Christie his favorite food - ice cream. Scroll down for video . Chris Christie appeared on The Tonight Show (above) and called out Jimmy Fallon for his weight jokes about the governor . Fallon however pulled out two spoons thinking the men could share the ice cream, at which point Christie took the treat for himself, slowly moving away. 'You have to share,' screamed Fallon. The ice cream, The Tonight Dough, was named after the show by Ben & Jerry's, and includes caramel and chocolate ice creams with chocolate cookie swirls and gobs of chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter cookie dough. Later in the program he hoarded a pint of ice cream (above) Fallon brought out for the two to share . Christie meanwhile has not yet announced if he plans to run for president in the upcoming election, but he made it clear on the show that he will not be changing himself just to win office. He told Fallon; 'There’s only one Chris Christie. This is it. I’m not gonna be someone else if I run for president.' This after the host pointed out some of his brash behavior in the past, and even compared him to The Hulk. And when pressed about what his decision might be when it came to the presidency, Christie simply said; 'I’ve got a day job which keeps me busy.'","Chris Christie appeared on The Tonight Show and called out Jimmy Fallon for his weight jokes about the governor .

"If you've always dreamed of seeing penguins in Antarctica or tracking the Siberian tiger in Russia - but gorilla trekking in Rwanda and spotting grizzlies in Alaska also feature on your to do list, this could be the safari for you. But before you don your khakis, you'll need a whopping £176,000 going spare to take part. The grand adventure promises to deliver up and close and personal moments with some of the world's most elusive and enchanting wildlife. Scroll down for video . The adventure promises to deliver up and close and personal moments with some of the world's most elusive and enchanting wildlife . To mark its 10th anniversary, Natural World Safaris has launched a new series of ‘Ultimate Safari’ adventures. Divided into four areas: Primates, Bears, Big Cats and Marine Life, the safari can be taken separately, but also as an epic world tour over 203 days, taking in 21 destinations. On each ‘Ultimate Safari’, guests will be guided across the globe on a carefully planned itinerary, taking them through Africa, Asia and the Indian Subcontinent to the Polar Regions and Latin America for rare wildlife encounters. Each safari can be split into separate legs, or completed in one journey. They will be accompanied by expert guides, optimising the visitors encounters with wildlife, ensuring they are in the right place at the right time. The Ultimate Bear Safari tracks polar bears, grizzly bears and spirit bears in Arctic Canada, the Arctic Circle, Alaska and British Columbia . The rarest animal that guests can hope to see is the critically endangered Siberian Tiger in Russia. With a population currently stabilised at under 400, sightings in the wild are extremely rare as Siberian tigers have the largest home range of any tiger subspecies. Accommodation ranges from pure luxury such as Shangri- La Rasa Ria, a large resort with its own orang-utan sanctuary, to basic cabins in Russia’s Durminskoye Forest Reserve, the best place to experience the habitat of the elusive Siberian Tiger. They can spend nights in eco lodges like the domes at Patagonia Eco Camp in Chile, and aboard ships such as the MS Malmo, a maritime vessel with heritage listing and the Jaguar House Boat moored on the north side of Taima Island, one of the best places in the world to see jaguars in the wild.

Price £176,000 . Destinations 21 . Total Days- 203 . www.naturalworldsafaris.com . For those with a budget weighty enough to take on the whole 201 day extravaganza, there would be some overlap in terms of destinations, for example- tours to Svalbard appear on both the Marine safari, for narwhals, and the bear safari, for polar bears. So the option of dividing it up may be appealing. The Big Cat section takes intrepid nature fans to ten different locations, starting in Latin America to track pumas and jaguars, before heading off to Africa for cheetahs, lions and leopards. Guests will then visit Asia for Asian leopards, Asiatic lions, snow leopards and tigers, before finishing in Russia looking for the biggest cat of them all, the Siberian tiger. The Asiatic lion (left) and the Bengal tiger (right) are just two of the big cats safari participants can expect to see on their travels . The countries that will be visited are Brazil, Chile, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Sri Lanka, India and Russia. As a separate trip, the 62 day Ultimate Big Cat Safari starts from £45,000 per person including international and internal flights, transfers and all meals.

"The owners of this house better not leave too quickly, after a speed camera was angled directly on their front door. The bright yellow gatso had previously enforced the 30mph speed limit for motorists along the residential road in Handsworth, Birmingham. However, it has not been working for two years after every single fixed device was switched off in the West Midlands. Big Brother is watching: A speed camera has been turned round and is pointing at this house in Birmingham, West Midlands . The speed camera has not been working for more than two years . Around 300 speed and traffic camera, using old technology, were turned off across the region in March 2013 . In there place, speed enforcement operations have been carried out by a small number of mobile camera units, fixed cameras on motorways and traffic officers on patrol. Mystery surrounds who had re-pointed the camera, but a spokesman for Birmingham City Council said they were aware of it. One of their engineers will now be visiting the site and the camera could be removed completely. 'Fixed location safety cameras have been decommissioned across the West Midlands since 2013 as the technology inside them had become obsolete,' the spokesman said. 'Plans for a pilot at a limited number of sites, using digital technology, is currently in development. 'Now the issue with this camera in Wellington Road has been brought to our attention, we will take any appropriate action at the site.' The spokesman confirmed that there were no plans to include the camera in Wellington Road in the new pilot.

"A 14-year-old British boy has been remanded in custody after appearing in court charged with plotting to carry out a terror attack during the Anzac Day commemorations in Australia. The teenager from Blackburn, Lancashire, who cannot be named but is thought to be the youngest person charged with Islamist-related terror offences in the UK, was arrested last weekend. He is said to have incited an Australian teenager, Sevdet Besim, to behead, run over or shoot a police officer in a 'Lee Rigby style' massacre during a ceremony for fallen soldiers. The 14-year-old British boy (pictured left in court sketch) has been remanded in custody after appearing in court today . He is also alleged to have encouraged the 18-year-old from Melbourne to carry out another decapitation on a 'loner' in their own home. Besim was arrested by Australian police after Greater Manchester Police revealed the extent of communications between the pair. Five other men have also been arrested by Australian counter-terrorism officers. The boy appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court today wearing a grey tracksuit to answer two charges of inciting terrorism overseas, which both date between March 15 and 26 this year. He bit his fingernails throughout the hearing and gazed at the packed press gallery, before having a whispered conversation with his lawyer, and spoke only to confirm his age, name and address. The teenager was flanked by two police officers in the dock while a family member sat in court for the brief hearing. He was remanded in custody to youth detention accommodation in the north of England after District Judge Emma Arbuthnot turned down a bail application. This afternoon he appeared by videolink at the Old Bailey for a preliminary hearing and spoke only to confirm his first name. The 14-year-old boy was remanded in custody after he was charged with inciting terror overseas was planning a 'Lee Rigby-style' attack during an Anzac Day ceremony in Melbourne, Australia (pictured) Suspect: Sevdet Besim (pictured) from Melbourne was charged with conspiracy to commit terrorist acts which had allegedly been planned by a 14-year-old British boy . Counsel and the judge appeared in court without their robes and wigs because of the defendant's young age. Judge Mr Justice Saunders said the case should be dealt with as soon as possible because of the defendant's age. The trial is estimated to last three to four weeks and is due to take place in August or September in Manchester. The defendant was remanded in custody and is excused from attending the next hearing at the Old Bailey on 14 May. Prosecutor Rebecca Ledwidge told Westminster Magistrates Court at this morning's hearing: 'It is alleged that [the defendant] communicated with an individual in Australia over a secure encryption application known as Telegram. 'Throughout the communications, it is clear that they were discussing a plan to attack an Anzac Parade in Melbourne, Australia.' Miss Ledwidge said the options discussed were to carry out 'a knife attack on police, or a ""car op"" on police, or a gun attack on police'. The second allegation, Miss Ledwidge said, related to a plan to 'break into someone's house and behead someone' in Australia. Chilling: The alleged plot to carry out an attack during the ceremony (pictured) honouring fallen soldiers from the First World War involved running over a policeman and hacking him to death . Never forget: Anzac Day memorials mark one hundred days since Australia and New Zealand's soldiers arrived in Turkey, where ceremonies are also being held (pictured) Mr Besim (left) was one of two  men arrested by Australian police for allegedly planning the 'ISIS inspired' attack and both were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (right) who stabbed two officers outside a Melbourne police station in September . The boy was said to have 'suggested he [Besim] should pick someone who was a loner and wouldn't be noticed'. Defence lawyer David King agreed the case should be sent to the crown court, as the allegations constitute 'grave crimes' under existing legislation. Mr King said the boy was from a 'respectable family' and that his father had conscientiously sat through a total of 40 interviews between his son and investigators. 'His mother and father have done nothing but cooperate completely with police and do everything they can. He said the boy's parents 'are the most concerned and responsible parents one could ask for'. District Judge Arbuthnot agreed the case potentially constituted a 'grave crime' and must be tried at a crown court. She told the defendant, 'This afternoon, you are going to the Central Criminal Court for a preliminary hearing. Do you understand all that?'. The boy replied 'yes'. Deputy Head of Counter Terrorism at CPS, Deborah Walsh, said: 'Following an investigation by police in the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, we have today authorised charges for a 14-year-old male of two offences. Remembered: As Australia, New Zealand (pictured), Turkey and UK prepare to honour fallen soldiers, five people have been arrested on suspicion of planning a deadly attack at the ceremony in Melbourne . Honoured: Australians and New Zealanders will descend on the Anzac Commemorative site on the Gallipoli Peninsular (pictured) for the centenary commemorations . 'The first allegation is that, between 15 and 26 March 2015, . the defendant incited another person to commit an act of . terrorism. 'Namely to carry out an attack at an Anzac parade in . Australia with the aim of killing and / or causing serious injury . to people. 'The second allegation is that on 18 March 2015, the . defendant incited another person to behead someone in . Australia.' 'We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.' The alleged plot bears a frightening resemblance to that of hate preachers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale who butchered British soldier Lee Rigby in south-East London in May 2013. Anzac Day was established to mark the anniversary of the start of the First World War Gallipoli campaign and ceremonies are held on April 25 each year in memory of Australian and New Zealand soldiers who have died in battle. This year’s events, being held tomorrow, take on extra significance as the centenary of the conflict in Turkey is marked. Attack: Australian Federal Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Neil Gaughan (left) confirmed that two 18-year-old men had planned to target Anzac Day activities . Two teenagers were also among those arrested by counter-terrorism police in Australia on suspicion of planning and carrying out the Anzac Day attack. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner said both men were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider, the 18-year-old shot dead after stabbing two officers outside a Melbourne police station in September. A number of 'edged weapons' including knives and swords were seized at some of the properties searched. A total of five teenagers were arrested as part of the Melbourne Joint Counter Terrorism Team operation named Operation Rising in which 200 officers raided seven properties. All five were on the radar of counter-terrorism investigators, according to Australian Federal Police Acting Commissioner Michael Phelan . He said: 'Particularly since late last month the investigation ramped up and it became very obvious to us that their plans were specific. 'We received information earlier this week that led us to undertake the resolution today.' Copycat: The attack he was allegedly planning bears a frightening resemblance to the death of British soldier Lee Rigby (pictured) who was tragically stabbed to death with a meat cleaver on the streets of London in 2013 . Killers: Michael Adebolajo (right) and Michael Adebowale (left) ran down 25-year-old Lee Rigby in Woolwich before 'butchering him' to death . London is hosting three Anzac ceremonies on Saturday: A service at Hyde Park Corner, another at Westminster Abbey and a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey. The Duke of Cambridge will join them at the Cenotaph and Princess Anne will attend the dawn service at Hyde Park Corner. Security will be extremely high at all three events - with those attending told to carry photographic ID - and it could be ramped up further after recent terror arrests.

"A  47 stone (660lb) woman who was so immobile she needed her husband's help to go to the toilet has revealed how he prevented her from losing weight. Despite being morbidly obese, Bettie Jo, from Houston, Texas, lived off a diet of fried chicken and barbecue sauce, and was unable to care for herself, meaning Josh had to do everything for her. But Josh has admitted he didn't support the 24-year-old with her bid to lose weight because he feared if she became slimmer, she wouldn't need him anymore, in My 600lb Life, which airs tonight on TLC. Scroll down for video . At 47 stone (660lb) Bettie Jo was housebound and unable to tend to her own needs . Bettie Jo now weighs 35st 8lbs (500lbs). Shedding 11st means she is now mobile and can stand up on her own . Bettie Jo, who now weighs 35st 8lbs (500lbs) thanks to surgery, reveals on the show that Josh had become her 'caretaker' - helping her go to the toilet and into the shower, and putting powder between her rolls of flesh afterwards to stop her skin from chafing. She said that the pair's relationship had become 'slim to none'. She added: 'Being that size was miserable. I was always in pain. My weight was killing me. I couldn't do anything on my own. 'My husband Josh had to help me take a shower and wipe my butt. It was humiliating. He had to be the caretaker. 'My marriage with Josh was really difficult too because my weight prevented me having a real marriage. Josh had to be my caretaker.' 'Our intimacy was slim to none. We’d been together for so long sometimes I thought, ""Am I with you because I love you or because you're the one person who looks after me.""' 'I hated myself. I hated my life. I was so tired of being that way.' Before her surgery Bettie Jo was reliant on husband Josh to tend her every need . Josh was in charge of the shopping and meals and kept Bettie Jo fed with unhealthy foods . But despite the deadly weight, Bettie Jo was living on a diet of fried chicken and barbecue sauce. 'I knew my body was getting to its limits. When I was five I started to become a chunky kid but I just got on with it,' she said. 'But when I was 13 my life totally changed. I was sexually assaulted. 'I'd always been happy go lucky but after that I didn’t like myself. I was angry and depressed and started eating more. 'I thought that if I was bigger I could protect myself. I met Josh right after I turned 17. I was 400lbs by then and could hardly walk. 'I hated myself, I hated everything so I tried to kill myself and then I got put into hospital.' Although Bettie Jo lived through her suicide attempt, seven years later at the age of  24, she felt life was slipping through her fingers. 'I was hardly existing. I never went out. Going out is not so easy when you're over 600lbs. Bettie Jo and Josh shopping after her weight loss: She now buys lots of protein and checks labels for calories . 'I wanted to have some freedom again and I knew my weight was keeping me from that. 'I hated going out in public all the time because I couldn't stand peoples reactions. I felt judged, that people were saying: “Look at that fat girl”.' 'But I knew it was something I'd done to myself through what I ate. I was raised with country home cooking and I loved fried, mash potatoes, crisps I just love food.' But husband Josh now admits he did not help Bettie Jo's weight loss. 'I thought if she lost weight she wouldn't need me anymore.I didn't want her dropping weight and leaving me.' But Bettie Jo was determined to make a change. 'I didn’t want to waste my life just sitting in a chair. I wanted to have a career, have a baby. I wanted to grow old. 'I knew if I didn’t change I was going to die. When pain has destroyed your life it can take something just as painful to restore it.' Desperate for a solution, Bettie Jo and Josh went to a Houston  bariatric surgeon. ‘Every other surgeon had turned me away so I didn't want to get my hopes up.' At 5ft 2in Bettie Jo's ideal weight is 8st 8lbs (120lbs) but her doctor predicted that at almost 47 stone (660lb) she was unlikely to get to 30. He set Bettie Jo the task of losing two stone (28lbs) to demonstrate she was capable of losing weight before he could agree to surgery. He also raised concerns about Josh's role as the feeder in their relationship, which he said would have to change. Bettie Jo used to love pizza and anything containing potato - chips, crisps and mashed potato . 'I needed Josh to help me, says Bettie Jo. 'I knew if we didn’t do it as a team I’m wouldn't make it. I didn’t want to die young.' Bettie Jo and Josh moved to Houston to be closer to the doctor and set about a weight-loss mission. 'I had to break a lot of old habits,' she said. 'I ate smaller potions – a lot smaller than before. They didn't fill me up but I hoped once I had surgery I wouldn't have the hunger pains. 'Josh was a big help – he was careful about the food he bought. 'I also tried to exercise. The first time I managed to ab crunches I was pretty excited,' she says, even though she still had to them from a sitting position on the couch. But as Bettie Jo gained independence, Josh grappled with the change and worried he was becoming dispensable. 'He wanted to be needed - that was his primary concern,' she said. It took several months for Bettie Jo to drop the weight and be scheduled for surgery. ‘I couldn't believe someone was finally helping me and that I was going to get the surgery. I can’t wait to get my life back,' she said. 'The operation went well but my first night after surgery but Josh wasn’t there when I woke up. It made me a little scared because I needed him more than ever. I knew if I didn’t have his support. I wouldn't be able to do this. 'The first month went but  it wasn't as easy as I'd hoped. Josh was preparing my meals and didn't necessarily want to follow the doctor's instructions. Five month after the surgery Bettie Jo had trouble breathing and was rushed to hospital. 'I felt like I was having a heartache. I kept blacking out. I'd never felt like that before,’ she said. The doctor found she had not lost any weight since the surgery and warned her over-eating was affecting her lung function to the point that she was not too far from dying. But it was the wake up call Bettie Jo and Josh needed. The doctor insisted they see a therapist to get the diet on track. Josh admits: ‘I used to take care of her but when she started being able to move around herself after the surgery that really scared me because. I don’t want her to leave me. She’s the only woman I've ever loved. In the supermarket with having shed teh wight, Bettie Jo looks for the 'light' options . It forced Bettie Jo to confront relationship issue too: ‘I hadn’t been touched. We didn’t have intimate time. It was partly Josh's fault and partly because I didn't want it. 'But therapy helped us discover that we still care so much about each other. This whole process has told us that.' Now ten months after the surgery Bettie Jo weighs 35st 8lbs (500lbs), and is proud of the progress she's made. ‘One thing I wanted to do is help other people but when you’re  47 stone (660lb) you need everyone to help you. So now I'm volunteering to put food bag together for needy children. 'To be able to help others make me feel more of a person. I’m also working on my relationship with Josh . 'Josh and I had never been on a date. I've always been so big I could never really go out. 'And so thankfully this process has show me just how much I love him - and how mush he loves me. ‘Our grocer shopping changed lots too. We look at labels and look at what I can and can't eat. I'm getting things with a lot more protein. ‘I feel like a different person. ‘I have a long way to go but I now know I can do it because I have Josh. And I have hope for the first time in along while.' My 600lb Life, airs tonight on TLC .","Bettie Jo, 24, from Houston, was morbidly obese at almost 47st (660lbs)

"Documented and undocumented immigrant population in the United States could reach a record high of 51million in just eight years, according to U.S. Census figures. And by 2060, immigrants could account for 82 per cent of all population growth in the country. One in seven U.S. residents will be an immigrant by 2023, the report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) said. Documented and undocumented immigrants in the United States could reach a record high in the United States by 2023, when their share of the population could hit 14.8 per cent . That number could rise to one in five by 2060, when immigrant population reaches 78 million. This report comes as President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policies. Net immigration will steadily increase over the next 45 years, totaling at 64million . Without no change in current immigration policy, by 2023 the total immigrant population in the United states will reach 14.8 per cent, the highest ever recorded in American history . Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population and will reach 15.8 per cent of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent by 2060 . In 1990, immigrants accounted for just 7.9 per cent of U.S. population . U.S population could grow to 417million by 2016. In 2010 the population was 306million . Without a change to immigration policty, immigrants who arrive in the future and their descendants could account for three quarters of future U.S. population . Center for Immigration Studies . This could potentially exempt about five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner. There are also more than 4.4million people on a U.S. State Department green card waiting list. And within years, Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population. From a starting point of 2010, immigration population will reach 15.8 per cent (57million) of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 (65million) per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent (78million)  by 2060. Immigrants and their descendants will account for 75.5 per cent of the nation's population growth between 2010 and 2050 and 82 per cent of growth between 2010 and 2060. By 2060, immigrants and their descendants will account for 82 per cent of the nation's population growth since 2010 . President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand immigration policies, which could potentially exempt about 5million undocumented immigrants from deportation . Alabama Rep. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has been a leader in the immigration debate, said in a letter to the New York Times on Saturday that an increase of immigrants in the country will hurt the middle class. He wrote: 'It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. 'Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?' Key business leaders form a group association with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are meeting on Friday to discuss expanding immigration. The meeting it titled 'Understanding and Improving the High-Skilled H-1B Visa Program', according to the examiner. Republican leaders, particularly those running in the presidential race for 2016, have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established .","Documented and undocumented immigrant population in the United States could reach a record high of 51million in just eight years .

"Scientists have used cosmic rays from the distant universe to study lightning and thunderclouds in unprecedented detail. Cosmic rays constantly bombard Earth’s atmosphere, and there have been some suggestions they could even trigger lightning. But this particular experiment observed how cosmic rays were affected by lightning as they passed through it - providing information on the electrical field of a given storm. Scientists in The Netherlands were using the Lofar radio telescope. They found it could measure changes in lightning caused by cosmic rays (illustrated). A storm can have hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres. The method could provide a novel way to understand thunderclouds . The experiment was conducted using the Lofar (Low-Frequency Array) radio telescope in the Netherlands. Researchers found, almost by accident, that cosmic rays were a suitable probe to measure electric fields within thunderclouds. High in the atmosphere, the rays strike atmospheric molecules and create ‘showers’ of elementary particles - the smallest known to exist. A long-standing puzzle in astrophysics is the source of ultra-high-energy particles from space that hit Earth. Called cosmic rays, they're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at Cern's Large Hadron Collider. They strike the atmosphere and cause an enormous shower of other particles, mostly muons, electrons and photons, over a wide area. Though they were discovered decades ago, cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare, making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated. It's thought that some come from supernovae, but it's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well. These showers can be measured from the radio emissions that are generated when they interact with Earth’s magnetic field. By measuring this during a thunderstorm, the researchers found they could find out information about the electric field in a thundercloud as it affected the radio emissions. It was found to be as strong as 50 kilovolts per one metre (3.3ft) - which translates into a voltage of hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres, an enormous amount of energy. 'We modeled how the electric field in thunderstorms can explain the different measurements,’ said researcher Dr Pim Schellart from Radboud University in the Netherlands. ‘This worked very well. How the radio emission changes gives us a lot of information about the electric fields in thunderstorms. ‘We could even determine the strength of the electric field at a certain height in the cloud.’ Though they were discovered decades ago, cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare, making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated. It's thought that some come from supernovae (illustrated), but it's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well . Lightning is a highly unpredictable natural phenomenon that inflicts damage to infrastructure and claims many victims around the world each year. This new method to measure electric fields in thunderclouds will contribute to a better understanding and ultimately better predictions of lightning activity. Current measurement methods from planes, balloons or little rockets are dangerous and too localised. Most importantly, the presence of the measurement equipment influences the measurements too. Cosmic rays probe the thunderclouds from top to bottom. Moving at almost the speed of light they provide a near instantaneous 'picture' of the electric fields in the cloud. Moreover, they are created by nature and are freely available. 'This research is an exemplary form of interdisciplinary collaboration between astronomers, particle physicists and geophysicists', said Dr Heino Falcke, also from Radboud University. 'We hope to develop the model further to ultimately answer the question: how is lightning initiated within thunderclouds?' Lightning (shown in Utah) is a highly unpredictable natural phenomenon that inflicts damage to infrastructure and claims victims around the world. This new method to measure electric fields in thunderclouds will contribute to a better understanding and ultimately better predictions of lightning activity .","Scientists in The Netherlands were using the Lofar radio telescope .

This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin, last August . A jury deliberated for about 10 hours until all but two of the 12 agreed the verdict early on Thursday. During Steele’s trial earlier this month forensic psychiatrist Dr. Doug Tucker had testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law was delusional and showed Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' The defendant had claimed he blacked out during the killings. Steele had been diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, attacks motor neurons, cells that control muscles. Prosecutors believed Steele planned the killings. The State had asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. Defense attorneys argued that Lou Gehrig's disease had damaged Steele's brain, making him not criminally responsible for the deaths . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am on August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot. Dr Tucker testified that there was no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with his sister-in-law . However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. Steele’s defense attorney, Jessa Nicholson, had told the court that her client maintained that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister on August 22 . If the jury had found him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could have faced up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses. Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind.","Former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, has been found not legally responsible in the killing of his wife and sister-in-law .

"Residents and tourists in Venice have for years delighted in their local, laid-back fizz. But here in Britain prosecco has long been seen as the second choice to champagne. Now, however, it seems our tastes are taking an Italian turn. According to industry figures released this month, we’ve developed such a taste for prosecco that last year UK sales overtook those of champagne for the first time — £181.8 million compared with £141.3 million. It’s been a long time coming. Prosecco may have found its way over here 30-odd years ago, but it was barely known beyond well-travelled wine lovers. One UK wine importer, David Gleave from Liberty Wines, tried to sell it in the late Eighties: ‘I thought: “This is delicious — I’m sure people will buy it.” They didn’t.’ Scroll down for video . Britain has long seen prosecco as the second choice to champagne, now that's all changing as prosecco sales have overtaken for the first time . Sales bubbled along rather slowly, and by 2009 we were still only consuming just over two million bottles a year. Five years on, that’s leapt to a massive 28 million — with most of the increase coming since 2012. So what’s behind the remarkable rise of this once humble sparkling wine? Quite simply, it’s word of mouth. The prosecco revolution was set against a backdrop of celebratory occasions — the Jubilee, the Olympic Games and a Royal Wedding — where cheap bubbles were called for. Suddenly, supermarkets began to see their sales soar and started clearing space on the shelves: it was time to take this loveable sparkling wine seriously. Until then, there had been only two types of bubbles to choose from. First, France’s most famous sparkling export — champagne, from a region in northern France which sells nine million bottles in Britain each year. Made from a blend of three classic ‘champagne’ grapes — Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier — it gets its bubbles from a second fermentation in the bottle. It’s then aged for at least 18 months in cellars, longer for ‘vintage’ champagnes. The second is Spain’s sparkling equivalent — Cava. Most is made in Catalonia in the north-east using the Macabeo, Parellada, and Xarello grapes (although one of the classic champagne grapes, Chardonnay, can also be used). Cava isn’t usually aged for as long in the producers’ cellars before being sold compared with champagne, making it cheaper (17 million bottles are sold in the UK each year). While champagne is produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region of northern France (pictured), prosecco comes from a particular area of north-eastern Italy, spanning the Veneto and Friuli regions . As for the flavours, cava tends to be more fruity and ripe than the comparatively richer, more complex flavours of champagne. But the new kid on the block, prosecco, is very different to both of these, not least because it’s made in a different country. To be classified as prosecco, it must come from a particular area in north-eastern Italy, spanning the Veneto and Friuli regions. It’s made from different grapes — one called Glera must make up at least 85 per cent of the blend. And it gets its bubbles from a second fermentation in a tank rather than in the bottle, which gives it a softer fizz. In fact, compared with the more complex flavours of champagne and cava, prosecco is, quite literally, the softer option. It’s relatively light, at around 11 per cent alcohol (champagne and cava are normally closer to 12 per cent), with frothy bubbles and simple fruit flavours, wrapped up with a touch of sweetness. Of course, there’s another very important factor that makes it really attractive: the price. Unlike champagne and cava, which is already in a bottle for that second bubble-inducing fermentation, the tank method of producing prosecco bubbles keeps production costs down — especially compared with champagne. No long years of ageing in dark cellars required; producers can make up a batch of prosecco in a matter of months rather than years. Which is a good thing, because prosecco is best when it’s young and most is produced as non-vintage, meaning it won’t have a stated year on the label. If you see a bottle with an old vintage, it might be interesting but more likely it’ll be past its best. So, with everyone reaching for a glass or few of prosecco, are we going to run out of this no-fuss fruity fizz fit for any occasion? While champagne is aged for atleast 18 months, more for 'vintage' bottles, prosecco can be made in a matter of months rather than years . That might have been the case had the area where prosecco comes from not undergone significant changes in 2009. European wine laws protect what can be labelled as prosecco under DOC — meaning Denominazione di Origine Controllata — regulations (similar to the ones that decree champagne must come from a certain region of France). But in 2009 the area allowed to produce wine under the prosecco DOC name was expanded significantly and increased controls were introduced in an effort to ensure the quality of what was produced wasn’t compromised. At the same time, the original DOC region — between the towns of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, and around the town of Asolo — was upgraded to the smarter DOCG status (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita). If you see ‘Prosecco Superiore’ or any of these town names on the label, you’re likely to get a better quality of wine — and pay a higher price (currently, DOC quality wines range from £6 to £10, with DOCG quality wines from £7 to £15). There’s even a kind of ‘grand cru’ prosecco, from the steep hills surrounding the town of Cartizze. Here, a small number of vineyards are harvested by hand and the wine produced commands the highest prices. Not many of the one million bottles produced each year find their way on to our shelves, as most is consumed in Italy. Tesco recently introduced a limited-edition Finest ‘Cartizze’ wine at £14.99, one of the most expensive in the range. (It was good, but I’d rather have two bottles of DOCG). You don’t have to pay much to get a great prosecco — all freshness, froth and simple fruit — but there are some that fall flat. Pick the wrong one and you could get something nose-wrinklingly unpleasant. So which bottles should you pop in your basket? Below are the pick of my favourites . . . 1. Filippo Sansovino Prosecco . £6, Asda . This one wins points for its stylish label — shallow, I know, but more importantly what’s inside is light, fresh and extremely drinkable. A good one for Bellinis. 2. Soffio No. 3 . £6.66 when you buy two, Majestic . Apparently, this is Holly Willoughby’s favourite prosecco. She’s got great taste (buds) in that case. Ripe with baked apple fruit, it’s a definite party starter. 3. Prosecco Superiore . £7.49, Aldi . Smartly dressed with a silver label, this is from the DOCG Superiore vineyards of Valdobbiadene. Nicely floral and citrussy. 4. M&S Prosecco . £8, Marks & Spencer . This DOC-quality wine is one of the sweeter-tasting wines in the line-up. Those with a sweet tooth will love it, and it works a treat with a bowl of strawberries. 5. Valdo Oro Puro Prosecco . £9.99 on offer, Waitrose (right) Another one from the DOCG Prosecco Superiore region of Valdobbiadene, this is richer than many other proseccos in the range. More orchard fruit flavours with plenty of lasting froth. Just add breadsticks. 6. Conegliano Prosecco . £10, Sainsbury’s Taste The Difference . If you like this one, bear in mind it comes in a magnum, too, so you can get two bottles for £19. It’s another DOCG, from Conegliano, and worth the extra few quid for its cut-above fruit and freshness. 7. Bonotto Delle Tezze Prosecco DOC . £10.60, Honest Grapes . Most of the wines available here are classified as Extra Dry but this one is Brut, so it has less sugar than most. Noticeably drier but still lovely and balanced, this one feels more serious. Well, as serious as prosecco can be. 8. Bele Casel Asolo Prosecco . £12.95, Bbr.com . My current favourite, this is a creamy, dreamy prosecco from the Asolo Prosecco DOCG. Think fresh, bright, beautifully balanced and almost indecently moreish. Somebody pass the antipasti now. 9. Finest Bi sol Prosecco . £8.99, Tesco . Made by one of the oldest family-owned producers in the region called Bisol. They’re 300 years old, so they know what they’re doing. With ripe pear fruits and a touch of apple blossom, it’s brilliant value. 10. Ca’ Morlin Prosecco Superiore DOCG Asolo . £13.70, Slurp . This comes from the man who first brought prosecco to the UK in the Eighties — not that he sold much back then. Happily, he stuck at it and went on to create a really smart Asolo Prosecco wine with top producer Ca’ Morlin. Gorgeous, top quality wine. The Knackered Mother’s Wine Club (£7.99, Macmillan), by Helen McGinn is out now.","Britain has long seen prosecco as the second choice to champagne .

"Andrew Hutchinson was reported to the hospital trust where he worked for indecent behaviour five years before being convicted of sexual offences . Bosses at a hospital where a male nurse sexually assaulted patients were warned of his predatory behaviour five years before he was convicted of 23 different offences against patients. Andrew Hutchinson raped two patients while they were under general anaesthetic and assaulted others at John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford where he worked in the A&E department between 2011 and 2013. The 29-year-old was convicted of 23 separate charges last month including making indecent images of children, outraging public decency and voyeurism. He was taken into custody at Oxford Crown Court and is due to be sentenced next week. It has since emerged that an earlier complaint about the nurse was made to bosses at Oxford University Hospitals Trust. In 2009 a student nurse reported Hutchinson as having taken inappropriate photographs at the hospital. But the hospital didn't report it to police as they said there was not sufficient evidence to suggest whether there was grounds for a complaint. Instead bosses only mentioned it to authorities after being told of more serious allegations Hutchinson was facing. After his conviction, Oxford University Hospitals Trust said it was first made aware of any alleged sexual misconduct when contacted by police in 2014. In a statement spokesman Susan Brown said: 'November 2014 Thames Valley Police requested a meeting with the trust and at the meeting informed Oxford University Hospitals about the images they had found and that they believed some were taken on trust property. 'This is the first time that the Oxford University Hospitals were aware of the serious allegations of sexual assault, voyeurism and rape that took place in our hospital.' When contacted by MailOnline this afternoon Ms Brown said the 'important' thing was that the Trust reported the 2009 complaint after being made aware of the more serious charges. Hutchinson was reported to police separately after being caught filming women as they changed their clothes at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon. After searching his home police discovered photographs and video footage of him abusing women in the hospital. Some of his victims were unconscious at the time. CCTV footage from the leisure centre where Hutchinson preyed on women as they changed shows the nurse walking through its lobby . Staff at Oxford University Hospitals chose not to investigate the complaint made against Hutchinson while he was working at John Radcliffe Hospital (above) In 2010 Oliver Balicao, another male nurse at the hospital, was jailed for raping two female patients . One of his victims self-harmed after learning what had happened to her while she was under general anaesthetic. In 2010 Oliver Balicao, another male nurse at the hospital, was jailed for raping two female patients. As a result of the attacks , unconscious patients are now treated in an open area, a hospital source revealed. During a trial at Oxford Crown Court it was heard how Hutchinson had preyed on victims aged between 10 and 35. The nurse stole one of the hospital's cameras to be able to film up the skirt of a woman as she visited her sick friend and had become 'addicted' to spying on women and children, it was claimed. Once arrested police discovered more than 1,700 indecent images on his computer and phone. He will be sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on April 27.","Andrew Hutchinson raped two women who were under general anaesthetic .

"In the era of advanced DNA profiling, police can usually identify a suspect with a single strand of hair or a tiny drop of blood. Their techniques, however, fall apart if the suspect has a twin. Identical twins share 100 per cent of their genes, meaning that until now it has been impossible to tell which sibling a sample comes from. But the problem has been solved by a team of British researchers. Identical twins share 100 per cent of their genes, meaning that until now it has been impossible to tell which sibling a sample comes from. But researchers at the University of Huddersfield have created a technique which they claim can distinguish between the genetic fingerprints of identical twins (illustrated) Researchers at the University of Huddersfield have created a technique which they claim can distinguish between the genetic fingerprints of identical twins. The breakthrough may eradicate a stumbling block which has often meant it was impossible to tell which of the pair was guilty of a crime. Identical twins start life with the same genes because they come from the same fertilised egg which divides into two embryos. But as they age different life experiences, such as smoking or diet, create variations in the number of hydrogen bonds in the DNA. Using a technique called high resolution melt curve analysis - or HRMA - researchers can now identify the difference between each twin. HRMA subjects the DNA to increasingly high temperatures until the hydrogen bonds break, known as the melting temperature. The more hydrogen bonds that are present in the DNA, the higher the temperature required to melt them. In 2013, 22-year-old twins Mohammed and Aftab Asghar were both charged with raping a 17-year-old woman in Berkshire because the police were unsure which one DNA evidence came from. Mohammed was eventually convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court, and charges dropped against Aftab because mobile phone evidence placed him elsewhere. But in some cases it has even led to prosecutions being dropped, rather than run the risk of convicting the wrong twin. Murder charges were dropped in 2011 against Orlando Nembhard, 19, accused of shooting a teenager outside a nightclub in Arizona, the US, because prosecutors could not prove that he was the murderer rather than his twin, Brandon. Dr Graham Williams, who leads the Forensic Genetics Research Group at Huddersfield, alongside Leander Stewart and their colleagues have now come up with a method which could solve such riddles. Identical twins start life with the same genes because they come from the same fertilised egg which divides into two embryos. But as they age their different life experiences create a variation in the number of hydrogen bonds within DNA (illustrated). This could be caused by smoking, exposure to chemicals, or different diets . Dr Graham Williams (pictured), who leads the Forensic Genetics Research Group at Huddersfield, found that by heating DNA until its bonds break these subtle differences become apparent. The technique is based on the concept of DNA methylation - the molecular mechanism that turns various genes on and off . Method is called high resolution melt curve analysis (HRMA). The more hydrogen bonds present in DNA, the higher the temperature needed to melt them . They have created a method of heating DNA until its bonds break - identifying minute differences between two twins. Identical twins start life with the same genes, because they come from the same fertilised egg which divides into two embryos. But as they grow older their different life experiences create a variation in the number of hydrogen bonds within the DNA. This could be caused by smoking, sunshine, exposure to chemicals, or different diets. Dr Williams, whose research is published in the journal Analytical Biochemistry, says that using a technique called high resolution melt curve analysis - or HRMA - can identify the difference between each twin. He said: ‘What HRMA does is to subject the DNA to increasingly high temperatures until the hydrogen bonds break, known as the melting temperature. ‘The more hydrogen bonds that are present in the DNA, the higher the temperature required to melt them.’ The technique is based on the concept of DNA methylation - the molecular mechanism that turns various genes on and off. Environmental factors alter the methylation status of DNA, changing the way it works.

For example, if one twin has a job outdoors and the other a desk job, the methylation profile will be slightly different. Crucially, methylation changes the number of hydrogen bonds. Dr Williams said: ‘Consequently, if one DNA sequence is more methylated than the other, then the melting temperatures of the two samples will differ - a difference that can be measured, and which will establish the difference between two identical twins.’ The technique has some limitations, Dr Williams acknowledges. For example young twins, or twins raised in highly similar environments, may not have yet developed sufficient methylation differences. The technique also requires a relatively large sample of DNA, which might not always be present at the crime scene. ‘Nevertheless, we have demonstrated substantial progress towards a relatively cheap and quick test for differentiating between identical twins in forensic case work,” Dr Williams said.","Identical twins start life with the same genes from the same fertilised egg .

"Five terrorist attacks have been foiled in France since the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, the country's Prime Minister Manuel Valls said today. His chilling words follow the arrest of a 24-year-old student who was allegedly preparing to storm Catholic churches with an armoury of weapons including Kalashnikov assault rifles. Discussing the case of Sid Ahmed Ghlam, Mr Valls said: 'Numerous attacks had already been foiled - five if you take into account the attack which happily did not take place at [Paris suburb] Villejuif'. Chilling: French Prime Minister Manuel Valls (left) today revealed that five terrorist attacks have been foiled in France since the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January . Mr Valls's comments follow the arrest of 24-year-old student Sid Ahmed Ghlam (pictured) who was allegedly preparing to storm Catholic churches with an armoury of weapons, including Kalashnikov assault rifles . Killed: DNA evidence also reportedly links Ghlam to the murder of Aurelie Chatelain (pictured left and right), a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor who shot dead in her car in a Paris suburb on Sunday morning . Gathered: This is the student residence where Sid Ahmed Ghlam - a 24-year-old computer science student suspected of plotting imminent attacks on churches in France - had reportedly been living . Ghlam, 24, was caught on Sunday after accidently shooting himself in the leg after allegedly murdering Aurelie Chatelain, a 33-year-old fitness instructor. He was said to be on his way to a number of churches in the Paris area, ready to kill as many people as he could. Ghlam's profile was very similar to the three Al Qaeda and Islamic State linked Parisians who killed 17 people around the French capital in January. They murdered staff including cartoonists from the anti-Muslim satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, as well as police officers and four Jews, before being killed themselves. Attack: Five terrorist attacks have been foiled in France since January's Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris . Tragic: Ghalm's arrest came just hours after the murder of Aurelie Chatelain (pictured), a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor, who was riddled with bullets as she sat in her car in the Paris suburb of Villejuif . Victim: DNA tests reportedly link the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain (pictured) on Sunday . Police are now hunting for at least two accomplices linked to Ghlam, who moved to France in 2009 from Algeria, its former north African colony. Prosecutors believe Ghlam was in contact with an IS radical in Syria, whom they believe ordered attacks on churches in the Paris area. The intelligence has led to Mr Valls ordered increased security, including police and army patrols, around 178 Catholic institutions. 'The threat has never been as high,' Mr Valls told France Inter radio station. 'We have never had to face this kind of terrorism in our history.' Hundreds of French nationals are said to have joined jihadist ranks in Iraq and Syria, accounting for almost half the European fighters there, according to report by the French Senate. Mr Valls said 1,573 French citizens or residents have been implicated in 'terror networks', 442 of which were currently in Syria and 97 of whom had died there. 'I want to remind you that seven French citizens have died while carrying out suicide attacks in Syria or Iraq,' Mr Valls added.","Manuel Valls said France is facing an unprecedented threat from terrorism .

"A volcano in Chile that has laid dormant for more than 40 years has suddenly erupted, causing a thick plume of ash to cloud the sky while thousands of people living in its shadow were forced to flee. Volcano Calbuco, in the country's south, is believed to be among the three most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes, but was not under any special observation before it suddenly sprung into life at around 6pm local time. An estimated 1,500 people were forced to flee the nearby town of Ensenada after the eruption, while several smaller townships were also cleared. Scroll down for video . Up in smoke: Volcano Calbuco, in southern Chile, has erupted forcing 1,500 residents from Ensenada, about 10 miles away,  to flee their homes (pictured, a view of the eruption from Puerto Montt, a small city around 20 miles from the volcano) Boom: The eruption sent a huge plume of gas and ash soaring into the atmosphere which was visible from up to 100 miles away (pictured, the scene in Puerto Varas, around 25 miles away) Unexpected: The volcano last erupted in 1972, and while it is widely believed to be among Chile's most dangerous, it was not under observation before it erupted today (the eruption pictured from Puerto Varas) Active: Volcano Calbunco is regarded as being among Chile's three most dangerous volcanoes, and is part of an active chain of around 500 that cover the south of the country . Panic: Residents from Ensenada described 'apocalypse scenes' after the volcano erupted about 6pm local time, with local authorities setting up a 12.5-mile exclusion zone around it . Smoke and lava can be seen spewing from the Calbuco volcano in this picture taken from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas . An electrical storm lights up the night sky as a huge column of ash and lava shoots out of the volcano. The eruption sparked a red alert in the port city of Puerto Montt . The volcano is located near the tourist town of Puerto Varas and the city of Puerto Montt, a little more than 620 miles south of Chile's capital, Santiago. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert, setting up an exclusion zone of 12.5miles around the volcano, barring access to the area. Trevor Moffat, who lives in Ensenada, some six miles from the volcano, said the eruption happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. The Calbuco volcano in southern Chile erupted for the first time in more than five decades on Wednesday, sending a thick plume of ash and smoke several kilometres into the sky . Explosion: Residents in nearby Puerto Varas go about their business while in the background the ash cloud from Volcano Calbuco is seen . Destructive: Volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust, either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another. Eruptions occur when magma  forces its way to the surface, exploding through weak points in the crust . Plume: While most people think of volcanoes as spewing lava, many eruptions take the form of super-heated gas and ash which is pushed through the earth's crust, covering the sky . Not another one: Southern Chile is a sparsely populated region of high volcanic activity. In March, volcano Villarrica, about 155 miles to the North, also erupted in spectacular fashion, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky . He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' Television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom-shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it. The eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring Argentina. Danger: Residents from nearby towns said people were crying in the streets after the volcano erupted without warning at 6pm local time . Shocking: While the first eruption occurred in the middle of the afternoon, the plume of ash and smoke was visible well into the evening from towns 100 miles away in Argentina . Blanket: The last major eruption here was in 1961 when lava flows filled the top crater before spilling down the sides and into a nearby lake. There was another minor eruption in 1972 . Distant: A view of the ash cloud from the Nahuel Huapi lake, around 100 miles away from the volcano in neighbouring Argentina . Derek Way, a resident of Puerto Varas,, said: 'There are a lot of people out in the streets, many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas. A friend told me to fill everything we have with water.' Chile, on the Pacific 'Rim of Fire', has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active. In March, volcano Villarrica, also in southern Chile, erupted in spectacular fashion, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, but quickly subsided. Volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust, either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another. Eruptions occur when magma from the Earth's core forces its way to the surface, exploding through weak points in the crust.","Volcano erupted without warning at around 6pm local time with 1,500 people forced to leave their homes .

As the market for plus-size fashion consumption grows, Alice Dogruyol, Founder of all-inclusive denim brand, Beauty in Curves, believes that Jamelia’s message to women is incredibly disturbing. She said: 'We come in all shapes and sizes and we all deserve to enjoy shopping for clothes whether we are a size zero or a size 20 plus. It is such a shame that Jamelia has used her privileged position of influence to encourage people to feel ashamed of themselves. 'The thought that a person should be made to feel excluded from having access to lovely clothes is absurd and trying to link clothes size to health is also uninformed. 'Our ethos at Beauty in Curves is to make women look and feel great about their bodies and give women more choice and access to great quality premium denim.' This lady named Charlotte happily posed her pictured to Twitter in support of plus size women . This lady named Kelly said that she was proud of her curves . On Thursday, Jamelia admitted she had found the anger directed towards her following her comments 'really difficult.' She said: 'Some of the things that have been printed I have actually said but not in that context... It's difficult to say your piece or to speak honestly when it kind of gets misconstrued in that way.' Many 'normal' women have also lambasted the star taking to Twitter using the hashtag #wearethethey to show off their curvy photographs. One user named @vampira246 posted a picture of herself in a pair of dungarees and a pink top saying: '#wearethethey !!!!!! I'm a size 22-24 and I rock my outfits!!!.' Another called @applecharlotte said: '#wearethethey - ty @debzjs for starting this hashtag in response to @Jamelia's comments.' Another lady called @charlotteBHC said: 'Jamilia consciously wished discomfit on a group of marginalised people, I'm one of those people #wearethethey [sic].' Debz, who set up WeAreTheThey, told FEMAIL she did so because she 'doesn't believe in ignoring bullies'. 'The whole point of the hashtag is not health or weight. People's health is their own business and if someone chooses to be plus size and healthy or unhealthy that is up to them. The idea behind the hashtag is that EVEN if people are unhealthy, they have a right to buy clothing without being made to feel uncomfortable. 'Jamelia called for a large spectrum of people being made to feel uncomfortable JUST because they COULD be unhealthy and that will never be acceptable to me or the other people using the #WeAreTheWay tag.' The Loose Women panellist said she was 'hounded on Twitter' after airing her views on the ITV show in a discussion about overweight teenagers, and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20. 'Of course I don't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops,' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on Loose Women this afternoon. 'I was referring to extreme sizing, I was referring to health and how we should all participate in helping our youngsters to live healthier lifestyles.' Women took to Twitter to post their pictures under the #wearethethey, they have defended their bodies against Jamelia's comments . Jamelia's co-panellists were quick to leap to her defence. Ruth Langsford, 55, stated: 'I definitely, categorically said we're not talking about size 14, 16 or even 18.' Janet Street Porter, 68, then said: 'I was completely in agreement with Jamelia and I said you've got to ask yourself if a young girl is already size 20-25, can she run around with her children, can she enjoy life or is she storing up health problems for later? 'So I do feel like Jamelia has been somewhat unfairly picked on.' 'Of course I don't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops,' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on Loose Women this afternoon (pictured). 'I was referring to extreme sizing' Jamelia's co-panellists, Ruth Langford (left), Coleen Nolan (center left) and Janet Street Porter (right) were quick to leap to her defence . Jamelia also appeared on Good Morning Britain to say that she was sorry for upsetting people. 'I didn’t make it clear on the show that I was talking about extremes, I was talking about above size 20 and below size six, those sizes being available en masse,' she said. 'Knowing that I offended people really upset me. Knowing that I made people question themselves and their choices, it really did upset me. All I can do is apologise for that.' But the star added: 'I do stand by what I said. I’m a real woman with real opinions. I get paid to voice my opinions. Social media users weighed in on Twitter, telling Jamelia to 'keep it shut' and accusing the singer of 'stirring up hatred' on the topic . Appearing on Good Morning America earlier today, Jamelia, pictured with GMB presenters Kate Garraway and Susanna Reid, said she still stood by her remarks . Jamelia said of the reaction: 'It’s been absolutely awful but this is my job. I believe we are all entitled to our opinion. 'I genuinely love people and believe everyone has the right to feel wonderful and feel beautiful and it was never my intention to make people feel any less than what they are.' Speaking on Loose Women yesterday, in the conversation which sparked the controversy, Jamelia said: 'I do not think it's right to facilitate people living an unhealthy lifestyle, in the same way I don't believe that a size zero should be available - it's not a healthy size for an average woman to be.' Jamelia first response to yesterday's Twitter backlash was a quote (pictured) Jamelia, who also claimed she was 'all for celebrating people as they are', added: 'I don't believe they [high street stores] should be providing clothes for below that range or above that range. 'Yes, have specialist shops, but you should feel uncomfortable if you are unhealthy... to be available in every High Street store, I don't think that's right.' Viewers were were enraged by her comments and vented on Twitter, with many declaring she should be 'sacked' from the show, and not a single user taking her side. 'I'm so disappointed with Jamelia's comments on Loose Women today. WE. ARE. NOT. PROMOTING. UNHEALTHY.LIFESTYLES. #PlusSizeDebate,' wrote one. On Monday, Jamelia showed her support for a new Good Morning Britain campaign dubbed #SelfieEsteem, which asks people to snap a first-take selfie and share it unfiltered (pictured) Viewers were quick to criticise the former singer's comments on Twitter . One asked Jamelia directly what 'large girls' are supposed to wear, if not clothes . Other fans said they were 'disappointed' with the singer's comments . 'Ah Jamelia. The advocate for self esteem telling people that if you're over a certain size you shouldn't shop on the high street. Idiot,' argued another. Indeed, on Monday the singer showed her support for a new Good Morning Britain campaign dubbed #SelfieEsteem, by snapping a first-take selfie and sharing it on social media unfiltered. Jamelia responded to the Twitter backlash with a quote yesterday afternoon. 'Never waste your time trying to explain, to people committed to misunderstanding you,' she tweeted to her 34,000 followers. Jamelia, pictured in London last week, says she had found the anger directed towards her following her comments 'really difficult'","The 34-year-old singer made the initial comments on Loose Women .

"A man has been hailed a hero after he rescued a three year old girl from a raging house fire that left him with horrific burns across his entire body. Carl Bradey lost everything he owned in the blaze, which was started by a candle in his Palmerston North rental property last month. The 25-year-old smashed through a window to rescue the child of a family friend, suffering nerve damage that has left him unable to feel anything in his right arm .. Bradey told Daily Mail Australia he awoke to the screams of his partner in the early hours of March 14 as the house they were sleeping in was engulfed in flames. WARNING: graphic content below . Carl Bradey (left) suffered horrific burns to his whole body (right) after he rescued a three-year-old girl from a raging house fire last month . The 25-year-old said his first thought was to make sure everyone got out of the house. ‘The flames were getting close to the room where the girl was sleeping, the only thing going through my mind was 'get her out'. So I ran in and smashed the window.’ Bradey cut several of his main arteries on the broken glass and lost so much blood that he fainted as he reached the front of the house. ‘When I woke up I was in hospital in the worst pain I’ve ever had felt. Every time I moved it felt like glass was being smashed onto my skin,' he said. Footage from inside the house shows the devastation caused by the fire . It took fire fighters 30 minutes to extinguish the fire, which gutted Bradey's house and car . Bradey has undergone four major operations since the fire, including multiple skin grafts to repair his damaged skin and an operation to remove a damaged vein. ‘It’s the worst thing I’ve ever been through and I’ve been through some heavy stuff in the past,’ he said. It took fire fighters 30 minutes to extinguish the fire, which destroyed Bradey's house and car.

'Every time I moved it felt like glass was being smashed onto my skin’: Bradey said the injuries were the worst pain he has ever felt . The 25-year old is currently staying with his mother, Angalina Summers, while he recovers. ‘Carl has been amazing. Because he has had the support of his loved ones his attitude throughout the whole ordeal has been optimistic and very inspiring,’ Ms Summers told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I was so proud of him for saving that girl.’ Bradey and a friend who visited him in Palmerston North hospital: in hopes of getting back on his feet, his family have made him a crowdfunding page . Fire experts urge anybody using candles to ensure they are positioned on solid holders away from anything inflammable. The house has been demolished because there was asbestos found in the property. Bradey's family have created a crowdfunding page to help him get his life back on track and you can donate to Bradey  here .","Carl Bradey lost everything he owned in a raging house fire last month .

"Hillary Clinton's family's charities are refiling at least five years of tax returns after an investigation revealed they had misreported tens of millions of dollars in donations from governments. The charities' errors generally took the form of under-reporting or over-reporting donations from foreign governments, or in other instances, omitted to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue, the charities confirmed to Reuters, which uncovered the mistakes. Following the discovery, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative said they will be refiling multiple annual tax returns and may audit returns extending as far back as 15 years in case there have been other errors. The foundation and its donors have been under . intense scrutiny in recent weeks. Republican critics say the . foundation makes Clinton, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic . presidential nomination, vulnerable to undue influence. Her campaign team calls these claims 'absurd conspiracy . theories'. Following Reuters' report Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz called on the non-profit to return all of the money it received from foreign governments. Scroll down for video . Under scrutiny: Charities run by the family of Hillary Clinton (seen at Georgetown University on Wednesday) under- or over-reported millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments in their tax returns . The errors, which have not been previously reported, appear . on the form 990s that all non-profit organizations must file . annually with the Internal Revenue Service to maintain their . tax-exempt status. A charity must show copies of the forms to . anyone who wants to see them to understand how the charity . raises and spends money. The unsettled numbers on the tax returns are not evidence of . wrongdoing but tend to undermine the 990s role as a form of . public accountability, experts in charity law and transparency . advocates told Reuters. 'If those numbers keep changing - well, actually, we spent . this on this, not that on that - it really defeats the purpose,' said Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation, a . government transparency advocacy group. For three years in a row beginning in 2010, the Clinton . Foundation reported to the IRS that it received zero in funds . from foreign and U.S. governments, a dramatic fall-off from the . tens of millions of dollars in foreign government contributions . reported in preceding years. Those entries were errors, according to the foundation: . several foreign governments continued to give tens of millions . of dollars toward the foundation's work on climate change and . economic development through this three-year period. Those governments were identified on the foundation's annually updated donor list, along with broad indications of how much each had cumulatively given since they began donating. 'We are prioritizing an external review to ensure the accuracy of the 990s from 2010, 2011 and 2012 and expect to refile when the review is completed,' Craig Minassian, a foundation spokesman, said in an email. The Clinton Foundation erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years - even though it previously received millions. Pictured, Bill and Hillary speak about the charity last September . The decision to review the returns was made last month . following inquiries from Reuters, and the foundation has not . ruled out extending the review to tax returns extending back 15 . or so years. Minassian declined to comment on why the foundation had not . included the necessary break-down of government funding in its . 990 forms. He said it was rare to find an organization as . transparent as the foundation. 'No charity is required to disclose their donors,' he said. 'However, we voluntarily disclose our more than 300,000 donors . and post our audited financial statements on our website along . with the 990s for anyone to see.' Separately, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the . foundation's flagship program, is refiling its form 990s for at . least two years, 2012 and 2013, CHAI spokeswoman Maura Daley . said, describing the incorrect government grant break-outs for . those two years as typographical errors. CHAI, which is best known for providing cheaper drugs for . tens of thousands of people with HIV around the world, began . filing separate tax returns in 2010, and has previously refiled . at least once both its 2010 and 2011 form 990s. Changes: In light of Hillary seeking the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, the foundation said it would  only continue to receive donations from six countries that are already supporting ongoing projects . 'I’m #ReadyforHillary to return all the money she raised from foreign nations,' Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said on Twitter. 'Add your name if you are too,' he added, including a link to a Cruz for President petition asking for supporters' email addresses and zip codes . For both those . years, CHAI said its initial filings had over-reported . government grants by more than $100 million. Some experts in charity law and taxes said it was not . remarkable for a charity to refile an erroneous return once in a . while, but for a large, global charity to refile three or four . years in a row was highly unusual. 'I've never seen amendment activity like that,' said Bruce . Hopkins, a Kansas City lawyer who has specialized in charity law . for more than four decades, referring to the CHAI filings. Clinton stepped down from the foundation's board of . directors this month but her husband, Bill Clinton, and their . daughter, Chelsea Clinton, remain directors. The foundation said last week after Hillary Clinton became a . candidate that it would continue to accept funding from foreign . governments, but only from six countries that are already . supporting ongoing projects. CHAI will also continue to receive . foreign government funding, again with additional restrictions. Nick Merrill, Clinton's spokesman, has declined to answer . inquiries about the foundation and CHAI. Though Mrs. Clinton has abdicated her board seat, GOP rival Cruz has zeroed in on the Democratic presidential candidate in a tweets about the Clinton Foundation's tax headaches. 'I’m #ReadyforHillary to return all the money she raised from foreign nations,' he said, referencing a pro-Clinton organization that spent more than a year laying the groundwork for her eventual announcement. 'Add your name if you are too,' he added, including a link to a Cruz for President petition asking for supporters' email addresses and zip codes.","A Reuters investigation uncovered errors in tax returns filed by the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative .

"An Iowa politician who was accused of abusing his wife by having sex with her when she no longer had the capacity to consent because of her dementia has been cleared. Henry Rayhons, 78, was accused of having sex with his wife Donna Lou Rayhons at her nursing home - despite being told her dementia and Alzheimers meant she no longer had the capacity to decide for herself. Mr Rayhons, who served 18 years as a Republican member of the Iowa House, had argued that on the night in question he and his wife had been affectionate but had not had any sexual contact. Henry Rayhons is pictured tearfully hugging his daughter Sara Abbas after he was found not guilty of sexually assaulting his dementia suffering wife, following a trial in Hancock County . Jurors acquitted the lawmaker following a trial after the court heard that medical tests could not conclusively prove Mrs Rayhons had recently had sex and that the allegations were made by another patient in a bed nearby, who was unsure whether they had had intercourse or not. The farmer was emotional as the not guilty verdict was read out at the Hancock County courtroom. Had he been found guilty he could have faced up to ten years in prison. Speaking after the verdict he tearfully said 'the truth finally came out.' 'Donna's love for me never changed from the day that we got married to the day she passed away,' he said after the verdict. 'It was always the same. She knew me all the time. She just was a lady who wanted to be loved.' The case highlighted issues around consent when one person in a couple is diagnosed with dementia. Defense attorney argued a guilty verdict could create fear of any contact between couples while prosecutors said finding him not guilty could put future dementia patients at risk. Mr and Mrs Rayhons married seven years ago, both being widowed from their previous marriage. Mr Rayhons had always insisted he and his wife had kissed on the night in question but they had not had sex . The couple had met while singing in the church choir and Mr Rayhons had gone on to learn his wife's hobby of beekeeping while Mrs Rayhons had accompanied her husband to the statehouse. After the allegations were filed against him last August Mr Rayhons decided not to run to serve a tenth term in the Iowa House of Representatives. The court heard that Mrs Rayhons was moved to a nursing home in Garner in March last year, following instructions from her daughters from a previous marriage. The clashes over her care built until a meeting in May during which Henry Rayhons was informed of his wife's inability to consent. According to court documents, Henry Rayhons entered his wife's room about a week later on May 23. He is alleged to have pulled the curtains around her bed and a roommate alluded to the couple having sex behind a curtain, but that she never explicitly told them they were having sex. Testimony from the roommate revealed that she was unsure whether the noises she heard that day were sexual in nature, but that they made her uncomfortable. The couple were married seven years after meeting at a church choir and had both been widowed previously . Mrs Rayhons was put into a care home by her daughters in March last year because she had dementia . An exam done on Donna Rayhons that night found no sign of injury. Also, lab tests done on swabs from that exam found no conclusive evidence she'd recently had sex . Investigators found semen stains on sheets and a quilt in his wife's room, but were unable to say how long they had been there. Security-camera footage from the night of the alleged incident was also aired in court, showing Henry Rayhons going into his wife's room, staying there for about half an hour and depositing something into a laundry cart on his way out. Rayhons' attorney said his client frequently dropped his wife's laundry into the bin, but prosecutors said he was trying to discard evidence. Not long after Mr Rayhons visited his wife, one of her adult daughters went to court and won temporary guardianship. Charges against him were filed at a later date. Mrs Rayhons died in August last year and her husband was arrested shortly after her funeral, the New York Times reported. Mr Rayhons, a Republican lawmaker, was arrested over the claims in August shortly after his wife's funeral . Mr Rayhons took to the stand to defend himself, explaining that he had not had sex with his wife on the night in question but they had kissed, held hands and prayed together. The case had widespread implications for the issue of consent between couples where one becomes ill in old age. Rayhons' defense attorney argued that a guilty verdict could have created fear that any interaction between spouses could be interpreted as sexual abuse. The not guilty verdict was met with cheers and tears when it was read out, after 13 hours of deliberations. Elizabeth Barnhill, executive director of the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said the case was a reminder of the need to be clear about consent in care homes. She told the Des Moines Register: 'One thing this very sad case makes clear is that care facilities, healthcare providers, families and patients need to have clear policies and guidelines to protect vulnerable patients and provide patients sexual ... autonomy when appropriate. 'I have a great deal of empathy for both families in this situation, and feel all would have been better served had such policies been in place.'","Henry Rayhons was arrested for sexually assaulting his wife in August .

"For 120 years it has been a great British institution, bringing world-class performances of classical music to the public. But now the BBC has been accused of dumbing down the Proms – by holding an Ibiza-style dance party. This year's Proms will include a late-night concert hosted by DJ Pete Tong, who will pay 'homage to Ibiza and its infectious, energetic brand of club music'. Veteran dance DJ Pete Tong (left) will bring club classics to the Royal Albert Hall for this year's Proms. Pictured right is cartoonist Pugh's take on the 'dumbing down' of the Proms . It will take place on July 29, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of Radio 1's broadcasts from Ibiza, and will reinterpret 'club classics' such as Music Sounds Better With You by Stardust and Rhythm Is Rhythm's Strings Of Life. Proms director Edward Blakeman said it was a 'natural' move, adding: 'These 20 years of dance have been a huge phenomenon on Radio 1 so why not celebrate it in a Proms way with a big orchestra? We do now live in a world, thank God, where you can like all kinds of music.' Live music at the so-called Pete Tong Prom will be played by the Jules Buckley Heritage Orchestra, which has worked with pop stars such as Arctic Monkeys, Professor Green and Basement Jaxx. When conductor Sir Henry Wood started the Proms in 1895, he wanted to inspire the public to enjoy top-class classical music. He had accepted a challenge from Robert Newman, manager of the new Queen’s Hall, to ‘run nightly concerts to train the public’. The plan was to gradually raise the standard of music until they ‘created a public for classical and modern music’. Sir Henry more than lived up to that challenge. He conducted the first promenade concert, as it was known, offering tickets for as little as a shilling. Audiences could smoke, drink and eat, keeping the atmosphere informal. He established a tradition of playing Wagner on Mondays and Beethoven on Fridays, later adding Debussy, Strauss, Rachmaninov and Ravel. The Proms moved to the Albert Hall in 1941 after the Queen’s Hall was bombed. By the time of Sir Henry’s death in 1944, they were firmly established as the highlight of the classical music calendar. The BBC was accused of 'undermining' the Proms by Conservative Bill Cash, who said: 'The Proms are one of the great British institutions. Like so many institutions, it is under attack by people who think that being novel is necessarily good. The world loves the Proms as they are. It is extremely damaging to undermine the ethos of the Proms by bringing in fake originality. 'The Proms already have a good, convivial finish, and that is part of the tradition, but to undermine the framework and ethos of the Proms is unacceptable.' The Pete Tong Prom is not the only surprising addition to this year's line-up at the Royal Albert Hall, which runs from July 17 to September 12. There will be a 'grime symphony' featuring rapper Wretch 32, and the Last Night Of The Proms will include a singalong section inspired by The Sound Of Music. The series of 92 concerts will also include a tribute to Sherlock Holmes, with a performance of pieces referenced in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books, including compositions by Wagner and Paganini. It is one of a number of Sunday matinees on the schedule, which are designed to attract families with children as young as five. Sir David Attenborough will host another of the afternoon concerts, featuring music from his natural history television series Life Story. More traditional fare includes the complete Beethoven piano concertos and Sir Simon Rattle conducting Elgar's The Dream Of Gerontius. The DJ's selection is the latest bizarre choice for the Proms (pictured at Albert Hall), which has previously been accused of 'dumbing down' Rapper Fazer (left) and pop singer Paloma Faith (right) have played the Proms in recent years in an attempt to appeal to a younger audience .","DJ Pete Tong will present a late night Prom at Albert Hall this summer .

"More than a dozen areas in the US have been shaken by small earthquakes triggered by oil and gas drilling, according to a government report released today. The man-made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states, including parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. Earthquakes, they said, were sometimes caused by fracking, in which large volumes of water, sand and chemicals are pumped into rock formations to free oil or gas. Scroll down for video . The study identified 17 areas in the central and eastern US with increased rates of induced seismicity. Since 2000, several of these areas have experienced high levels of seismicity. Researchers say there have been 'substantial increases since 2009 that continue today' They said the spike in seismic activity was largely down to the oil and gas industry injecting wastewater deep underground, which can activate dormant faults. Many studies have linked the rise in small quakes to the injection of wastewater into disposal wells, but the Geological Survey's report takes the first comprehensive look at where the man-made quakes are occurring. 'The hazard is high in these areas,' said Mark Petersen, who leads the agency's national mapping project. Oklahoma lately has been rocked by more magnitude-3 quakes than California, the most seismically active of the Lower 48 states, Petersen said. Oklahoma was not on scientists' radar until recently when the state experienced a spate of quakes, the largest registering a magnitude-5.6 in 2011. A 2014 United States National Seismic Hazard Maps with the areas most at risk shown in warmer colours. Recently, man-made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states, including parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas . The cumulative number of earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.0 or larger in the central and eastern US, 1973-2014. The rate of earthquakes began to increase starting around 2009 and accelerated in 2013-2014 . Earlier this week, the Oklahoma Geological Survey acknowledged that it is very likely most of the recent shaking is from wastewater disposal. Many faults awakened by drilling have not moved in millions of years, Geological Survey geophysicist William Ellsworth said. 'They're ancient faults,' Ellsworth said. 'We don't always know where they are.' A message to the American Petroleum Institute was not immediately returned. The industry group has said efforts are made to map fault lines where drilling occurs. The fluid pressure in the pores and fractures of the rocks is called the 'pore pressure.' The pore pressure acts against the weight of the rock and the forces holding the rock together. If the pore pressures are low - especially compared to the forces holding the rock together - then only the imbalance of natural in situ earth stresses will cause an occasional earthquake. If, however, pore pressures increase, then it would take less of an imbalance of in situ stresses to cause an earthquake. This type of failure is called shear failure. Injecting fluids into the subsurface is one way of increasing the pore pressure and causing faults and fractures to 'fail' more easily. Earthquakes can be caused by injecting fluid into the subsurface or by extracting fluids at a rate that causes subsidence and slippage along planes of weakness in the Earth. Source: US Department of Energy . Increases in the number of tremors from 1960-2010 shown in various regions of the US.  Scientists said it's difficult to know what jobs will trigger shaking . A group of experts met last year in Oklahoma to pinpoint seismic hotspots around the country caused by induced quakes. Scientists initially identified 14 regions affected by quakes linked to drilling. They later added three other high-risk areas - northern Oklahoma-southern Kansas; Greeley, Colorado; and Azle, Texas. The findings were released at a Seismological Society of America meeting in Pasadena, California. Seismic hazard maps produced by the Geological Survey and used for building codes and insurance purposes don't include quakes caused by the oil and gas industry. Scientists said it's difficult to know what jobs will trigger shaking. Researchers study man-made quakes in the affected areas to determine how often they are expected to occur in the next year and how much shaking they would produce. A series of earthquakes that rattled a small Texan community have been linked to nearby oil and gas operations. In this image red squares are injector locations; pink arrows, approximate location of two large brine production wells that are located both near the faults and near reported earthquakes swarms .","Man-made quakes have hit once stable regions in central and eastern US .

"The UK's top prosecutor today told critics deriding her decision not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged child sex offences to challenge her in court. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge because she is convinced the Labour peer is not fit to plead because of his dementia. And in her first interview since she announced Lord Janner would not face trial she refused to quit because 'making the right decision is not a resigning issue'. Fighting back: Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge over her decision not to charge Lord Janner and said she would not quit . Victims and leading politicians have accused her of 'damaging public confidence' in the justice system with her ruling – even though there was a enough evidence to go ahead with a prosecution. Mrs Saunders admitted herself that three investigations into claims made by 25 alleged victims over 25 years were botched  - but decided it was now too late to charge him. She told the Evening Standard today: 'If somebody wants to challenge my decision I'm not afraid. The proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review. 'I'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up. I thought long and hard before making it and I'm confident I got it right. My job is not to be populist. 'The medical evidence was very clear. He wouldn't be fit to stand trial, he wouldn't understand the questions, he wouldn't understand the process, he wouldn't be able to understand instructions. 'It's not to make decisions on the basis of what people want. It's about making the right decisions. Sometimes that means it won't be popular but if I'm fulfilling my duties as DPP that's the right thing to do.' Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trial . Last night it emerged Mrs Saunders overruled the advice of two of the country's most senior barristers to allow Lord Janner to avoid a trial. Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. In particular, Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and corroborating accounts by victims during the two-year police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his Alzheimer's disease. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a 'trial of the facts' could have satisfied the need to get to the bottom of the appalling claims against the peer, whatever his mental state. And MailOnline revealed last week that 19 dementia sufferers have been prosecuted for child sex offences and ten were in the past year. The Mail revealed today that Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his £2million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him, it can be revealed. The move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the Labour peer for compensation. The flat, in an exclusive gated community near Hampstead Heath, North London, was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in March last year - the same month police raided Janner's Westminster office and three months after they had swooped on his home. In the four years after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009, the former Labour MP, 86, has claimed more than £100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances. Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his £2 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raid . Even earlier this month, on April 9, he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the House of Lords. A week later, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Janner would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from Alzheimer's that he could not even understand any charges against him, let alone answer them. This was despite the fact the CPS ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. Victims have accused bungling authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice. Child protection campaigners, MPs, police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said concerns over the decision were justified. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something 'very strange' about the ruling and Health Minister Norman Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of dementia sufferers being brought to trial. He added that the matter should be brought before a court because Mrs Saunders and the Crown Prosecution Service had made 'heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so'. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, when he was last seen in public . Signed: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons . Mr Hunt said London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been 'right' to express concern at the decision, adding: 'I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious.' Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and legal expert, said although there was strong evidence Lord Janner had dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. This week, leading politicians from seven parties demanded the decision be reversed. The group, led by Labour's Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times: 'As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.' A CPS spokesman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and that Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an 'ancillary matter'. At least ten men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010. Clare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial .","Alison Saunders won't quit because 'making the right decision is not a resigning issue'

"Greece warned it will go bankrupt next week after failing to stump up enough cash to pay millions of public sector workers and its international debts. Deputy finance minister Dimitras Mardas set alarm bells ringing yesterday when he declared the country had been 'running on empty' since February. With a debt repayment deadline looming on May 1, Greece faces the deeply damaging prospect of having to snub its own employees to make a €200m payment to the International Monetary Fund. In a sign of the bleak climate engulfing the country, Greece's biggest tax office had its electricity cut off yesterday after the finance ministry failed to pay its power bills. At a summit in Brussels today, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to appeal to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for more aid to avoid going bust and a potential exit from the euro. Dire straights: Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras arrives at an European Union leaders summit in Brussels as the country warned it was on the verge of bankruptcy with salary and debt repayment looming . Mardas caused consternation by saying Greece was about €350-400m short of funds needed this month to pay salaries and pensions that are due at the end of the month. But two hours later, he said the money had been found from social security funds and state corporations not listed on the stock exchange that would put their reserves in a Bank of Greece account. EU leaders fear the left-wing Syriza government will choose its workers, potentially pushing it out of the Eurozone and landing Europe with yet another crisis, it was reported by The Times. At a meeting today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was expected to press Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to move faster to agree detailed economic reforms crucial to unlock international bailout funds before Athens runs out of cash. The conservative German leader was due to meet the leftist Greek premier a day before eurozone finance ministers meet in Riga to review progress -- or the lack of it -- in slow-moving negotiations between Athens and its creditors. EU officials said they expected Merkel to deliver a message that she wants to keep Greece in the single currency area and avoid a catastrophic default. EU leaders fear Mr Tsipras's left-wing Syriza government will choose to pay its workers than its IMF creditors, risking a default that potentially pushes it out of the Eurozone and lands Europe with yet another crisis . But to achieve that, Tsipras's government must make commitments in technical talks on detailed, costed measures to make public finances sustainable. 'At the highest level, the Germans want to keep Greece in the euro area and find a solution, but time is running short and there may have to be more drama before Tsipras can put his foot down and reach an agreement,' one senior official said. A Greek government official told Reuters in Athens that Tsipras would outline specific reforms to Merkel in a bid to appease creditors and is hoping she will intervene so that there is a breakthrough in the negotiations. The chancellor has so far insisted it is up to Athens to satisfy representatives of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, speaking in Berlin, said there were increasing doubts about the situation in Greece, warning that if financial instability returned, there would be no economic growth this year. He said he no longer expected an accord this month but negotiations could run beyond an April 30 deadline for a deal and he expected agreement sometime during May. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was expected to press Greek PM Alexis Tsipras to move faster to agree detailed economic reforms crucial to unlock international bailout funds before Athens runs out of cash . UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino has warned that there will be no choice but to suspend Greece from international football unless the country's government rescinds proposed new laws. The Greek government has put forward a bill which could see sporting events cancelled due to incidents of crowd violence and teams prohibited from playing in European competition. UEFA and FIFA say that is direct government interference in football and have threatened to suspend Greece. Infantino said: 'Sadly there will be no other choice than to suspend the Greek Football Federation if this new legislation is passed because football does not allow government interference. 'There are currently three other countries, outside of Europe, which are currently facing similar issues - Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. 'I think people in Greece should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football. Don't forget that it will affect more than the national team. If your clubs don't play in our competitions, their coefficient will also drop, meaning that less teams can qualify for the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.' UEFA and FIFA sent a final letter of warning on Wednesday but the Greek government is refusing to back down. Greece's deputy sports minister Stavros Kontonis told Greek television on Wednesday night: 'We are not going to change the philosophy of the sports bill. The supervision exercised in Greek football by FIFA and UEFA has failed.' Given its tight cash position, Greece had reasons to speed up the talks and its reform plans. 'Progress is not good,' he told ARD German television. Greece has yet to agree with its partners on a comprehensive list of reforms to secure €7.2billion remaining from its €240billion EU/IMF bailout. Despite concerns raised yesterday, Eurozone and Greek officials indicated that Athens could probably scrape together public cash reserves to meet its payment obligations into June. But it faces a hump of bond redemptions to the ECB in July and August that it cannot meet without a fresh injection of funds. The ECB's chief economist, Peter Praet, said the central bank was prepared to keep authorising emergency lending to Greek banks for now because they were assessed to be solvent. 'It is true that it is a stressful situation,' Praet said at an event in Berlin. 'I'm not going to discuss how long this will go on. Verbal discipline is of the essence in crisis times.' Tsipras, elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, is resisting cutting pensions, liberalising the labour market or raising value-added tax on Greek holiday islands. EU officials said Brussels was pressing Athens to move ahead with other measures, such as a radical shake-up of product and service markets to sweep away privileges and protections for vested interests, . It also called for greater fairness in taxation to shift the burden to the better-off and improve collection. They are also looking for progress on privatisations, which leftist ministers halted when they took office in late January. Tsipras's office said he would also have a private meeting with French President Francois Hollande on the summit sidelines. Greek daily Kathimerini reported that Athens is considering asking the euro zone's rescue fund to buy Greek government bonds held by the ECB to pay for debt redemptions due this summer. 'The aim of the government's plan is to have the European Stability Mechanism buy the bonds and reach a deal to repay them further out in time, as is the case with loans from the EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility),' the paper said without citing sources. That would amount to a third Greek bailout requiring euro zone governments' agreement and parliamentary approval in some countries, such as Germany and Finland, which could only be achieved if there were a deal on a comprehensive reform package.","Greece could go bust next week as salaries and EU debt repayments loom .

"A 60-year-old man has flown more than 6,000 miles from Vancouver to Shenzhen, South China and turned himself into a walking billboard in a desperate bid to track down his online 'lover'. Canadian Jake Malone met a woman calling herself 'RiLi' on a social website 11 months ago, who according to her online profile lives in Shenzhen and owns a clothing company. She contacted Mr Malone after becoming divorced and he decided to pay her a visit - but after turning up at her company's address, he discovered the office had been closed for years, reports the People's Daily Online. Bid to find online 'lover': Canadian Jake Malone flew more than 6,000 miles from Vancouver to Shenzhenand turned himself into a walking billboard in a desperate bid to track down a woman he met online . An infatuated Mr Malone, who fell in love with 'RiLi' from a photo she sent him, now wanders the streets of the city, which has a population of ten million, with a sign bearing her picture attached to his torso. Mr Malone claimed it was love at first sight when he saw a photo of 'RiLi', who said her real-life name is Rebecca during their correspondence. Speaking to China Daily, he said: 'She is so beautiful. Her smile is cute and soft. I can tell how innocent her heart is by looking into her eyes. 'That innocence is what attracted me to her.' Mr Malone said the website on which he met 'RiLi' charged 20-30 Yuan (£2-3) to receive and send each email. The pair have sent each other 396 emails in the last 11 months and Mr Malone claims that he has spent more than 11,000 Yuan (£1,100), paying for translators to communicate. He said: 'Translators block out all personal details in the emails. So Rebecca and I can only communicate through the website.' Mr Malone mentioned coming to China to look for 'RiLi' a few times, but she said she feared meeting in person would ruin the relationship. Despite her uncertainty, the Canadian decided to fly to China anyway -  emailing 'RiLi' about his hotel details and arrival times, though these were blocked by translators. Wild goose chase: Mr Malone has not been able to track down the woman, who calls herself 'RiLi', and is unable to contact her after the website they use to communicate was shut down . Unfortunately, the website that the pair met on suddenly shut down when Mr Malone landed in Shenzhen on the April 9 - meaning  his mailbox was not accessible. Rebecca once told Mr Malone that she owns a clothing company that has the same name as her internet alias, 'RiLi'. After tracking down the company's address but finding it had closed down, he started to ask around for his online sweetheart. He arrived at Donghu hotel and the concierge Miss Zhang made him a sign that says 'your Canadian love is looking for you'. Other hotel staff found a telephone number with the limited online information but no one picked up the call. Mr Malone carries the sign around his neck and walks around Luohu KK Mall, a big shopping centre, every day hoping that Rebecca will appear. He said: 'People in Shenzhen are very friendly. They took photos of me and put them online. I am very thankful for that. Love at first sight: Mr Malone, 60, said he fell in love with 'RiLi', aka Rebecca, as soon as he saw her photo . Despite some passers-by warning him that 'RiLi' was just looking for someone to talk to, the romantic is adamant their feelings were mutual. He said: 'No, I believe in her, I can feel from her letters that she loves me.' He says is willing to give up his life in Vancouver and move to China if he finds her. He added to China Daily: 'I am afraid that she will not be able to get used to the Canadian life, but I can adapt to her life in China,' Unperturbed by her lack of English, he says he has always been fascinated with Chinese culture  and visited the country in 1987. Mr Malone is a Buddhist and has been practising Taichi for a long time. He added: 'I can be an English or Taichi teacher since I have been doing that in Vancouver.'","Jake Malone, 60, met woman who calls herself 'RiLi' on social website .

"The mother of accused killer Vincent Stanford is helping detectives investigating the death of beloved teacher Stephanie Scott, who was buried in an emotional funeral service on Wednesday. Wearing a striped grey shirt and black pants with a orange backpack flung over one shoulder, Anika Stanford arrived at Leeton Police Station on Thursday morning to meet with police officers. She left 45 minutes later with a detective in a silver sedan and was taken back to the home she shared with her son, Vincent, and another son, Luke. Ms Stanford is believed to have given police information which led them to a road in the  Cocoparra National Park, where they discovered Ms Scott's burnt remains on April 10, five days after she went missing. Scroll down for video . Anika Stanford (pictured), the mother of Stephanie Scott's accused killer Vincent Stanford, is assiting police with the murder case against her son . Vincent Stanford, 24, has been charged with the Easter Sunday murder of Ms Scott, who disappeared the weekend before her wedding to fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley. He will next appear in Griffith Court by video link on June 4 . Stanford moved to the Netherlands aged two or three with his mother and brothers, before returning to Australia later in his life. The family has lived in the Leeton area for just 14 months, where Vincent Stanford worked as a cleaner at the same school where the much-loved Ms Scott taught English and Drama. When Daily Mail Australia knocked on the door of the Stanford's Maiden Avenue home on Thursday nobody answered, but it was understood two people were inside at the time. Ms Stanford's visit to the police station comes after the beloved teacher's family buried her in an emotional funeral at the venue she was supposed to be married. The touching celebration of the teacher's life saw hundreds of friends, family, and mourners travel to Eugowra’s Eat Your Greens function centre, the place where she was supposed to marry her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley. Ms Stanford was taken back to the home she shares with Vincent and brother Luke by a detective . The family have lived in Leeton (pictured) for just 14 months, and previously lived in the Netherlands .

A memorial service for Ms Scott, 26, took place in Eugowra in NSW's central west on Wednesday, at the venue where her wedding was due to be held . At the service her sister, Kim, shared humorous childhood memories of Ms Scott with the crowd and painted a picture of someone with a strong sense of who she was. 'Steph never cared what anyone thought of her,' Kim said. 'She had an easy way about her that meant she could get along with anyone.' Mr Leeson-Woolley looked visibly distressed throughout the service, held just outside the town of Eugowra in New South Wales' central west. Leeton Shire Mayor Paul Maytom told Daily Mail Australia Anika Stanford had been helpful to police but could not expand on it any more. The pair recently met for coffee and during their conversation earlier this week, Cr Maytom said he had offered friendship and support to Anika. Ms Stanford met with Leeton Shire Mayor Paul Maytom ahead of Ms Scott's funeral, and offered her condolences to her family and friends .

'I know she has people at work [to talk to] but I wanted the community to have that contact with her, and we care about her feelings in this matter,' he said. 'She has been deeply saddened by this event. 'She feels terrible and was able to vent her condolences through me.' Cr Maytom told Daily Mail Australia he had not passed on these sentiments to Stephanie Scott's family but intended to do so through a council condolences card. '[I will] make note of the condolence... at an appropriate time,' he said. 'The community has been very supportive of my having contact with [Anika, even though they are devastated].' Ms Scott is survived by her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley, and was killed just days before the pair were set to wed . Stephanie Scott is pictured giggling as a little girl (far right) in a sweet photo with her elder sisters Robyn and Kim, in a photo shared by her sister Kim on the eve of her tragic funeral . Police were lead to Stephanie Scott's remains by the family of her accused killer, Vincent Stanford . On Tuesday the woman's heartbroken family shared a sweet photo of her as a little girl, giggling with her sisters in a bubble bath - as they invited all mourners to 'show their support of our beautiful Steph' for her funeral. 'Hi everyone. Tomorrow will be Stephanie's funeral… All are welcome to pay your respects,' wrote Stephanie Scott's sister Kim on Tuesday night. 'She was a beautiful girl and we'd all love to see you to show your support for her.' On the same day, the school used social media to reach out to staff, students and parents after their first day back after the school holidays. It had also been the first day on campus without the beloved teacher. 'Once again, whenever strength, unity, leadership and integrity is asked of the whole student body, Leeton High's students rise to the challenge,' they wrote. The school's Facebook admin proceeded to commend the school community for their thoughtfulness after a beautiful, yellow-themed tribute was left for Ms Scott at the school following her disappearance. 'Just like at the fence tribute for Stephanie last Thursday, you guys were impeccable on this, the toughest of all school days.'

"We've had an ale made from yeast grown in beard hair, a beer that features barley from the International Space Station, and a 67.5 per cent alcohol brew that comes with a warning tag. And while the craft beer revolution has seen connoisseurs knock back their interesting ales and small batch brews, news of the latest offering might put off even the biggest of fans. Promising to make the hardiest of stomachs turn before even a sip is supped, this new craft beer will be brewed from human sewage. Recycling gone too far? US alcohol regulators have approved plans for beer brewed from human waste . Production of the beer has been approved by alcohol regulators in Oregon, US, and will be made from waste gathered by sewage treatment firm Clean Water Services. The company will treat the effluent before handing it over to microbrewers who will turn it into a tasty tipple. According to a 50-page report which was handed to alcohol regulators, the sewage would pose 'very low human health risk' and would be treated to 'very high standards'. There will only be ten barrels of beer made and it won't be available in shops but there is talk of mass production if the drink proves popular. In the report, Robert Baumgartner, an assistant director at Clean Water Services, told regulators it was designed to 'raise awareness of the reusable nature of all water'. 'By highlighting craft beer, a product Oregon is known for around the world, the project will seek to engage... people everywhere in a conversation about water,' he continued. The scheme, which is backed by The Oregon Brewers Guld and Oregen Brew Crew, is proving to be highly unpopular with state residents. According to The Mirror, Resident Dorothy Shoemaker said: 'The water meets drinking water requirements, but does it smell and taste good?' Elizabeth Graser-Lindset added: 'There is plenty of clean water in Oregon. 'Let's let the ground do the purifying as water sinks a hundred or more feet to the water table. 'DON'T use recycled water in alcoholic beverages.' 1. Snake Venom beer brewed by Brewmeister's Brewery Armageddon which contains 67.5 per cent alcohol. The beer comes with a warning tag telling you not to drink too much and costs $80 (£54) a bottle. 2. Brewdog's End of History - a special limited edition Belgian blonde ale - is a 50 per cent ABV which sold for $765 (£510) a bottle. There were only 12 bottles made, and each was encased in a taxidermied body of a weasel or squirrel. 3. Sapporo Space Barley made with barley that was on the International Space Station and sold for $100 (£68) for a six pack. 4. Starting them young, Hello Kitty beers - which were aimed at the younger market - have half the alcohol of a Budweiser and come in fruity flavours such as passion fruit, banana and peace. 5.

"The body of a girl who vanished on her fifth birthday while playing at a Texas marina has been found in the water nearby. Fiona 'Kitty' Carroll was at Kemah Boardwalk Marina as her father worked on his boat on Wednesday but when he checked on the girl 'after a brief moment', she was gone, police said. Her bucket was found in the water but there was no sign of the little girl, KHOU reported. The girl's father contacted police around 6pm to report that she had disappeared near the edge of the pier, the Kemah Police Department said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Celebration: Fiona 'Kitty' Carroll had celebrated her fifth birthday on the day that she went missing, family members said. Her body has been found in the water near to where she is believed to have fallen . Last seen: She is pictured on the Kemah Boardwalk Marina before she went missing on Wednesday . Authorities launched sea, land and air searches with the help of Kemah, Nassau Bay, Seabrook police and the U.S. Coast Guard. Dive teams searched the water for more than seven hours on Wednesday evening, while teams used sonar equipment to comb the water to try to locate the girl. On Thursday morning, the Kemah police announced that the girl's body had been found in the water near the marina around 9am. 'We extend our sincerest sympathy for her mother, father and other family members,' the police department said in a statement to DailyMail.com. 'We would like to thank all the police, fire, federal agencies and Texas Equusearch that assisted us during this tragic incident.' Kemah police said they hope that surveillance video from boats on the marina could provide further information about exactly what happened. They have said they do not suspect foul play and an autopsy has been ordered. Tragic: The little girl's body is wheeled away from the scene after she was found on Thursday morning . Sadness: Authorities stand at the site where the child's body was found in Kemah, Texas on Thursday . Search: A helicopter, boats and divers searched for the girl on Wednesday evening but turned up nothing . The family had been working on their boat ahead of a trip to the Caribbean, KPRC2 reported.

"The most popular cities in the world are often instantly recognisable thanks to their world-famous landmarks. But what would these cities look like if they did not have their prized attractions? That's what one studio asked its designers, and the images it received back were certainly illuminating. Scroll down for video . Without the 324m-high Eiffel Tower in Paris, the skyline looks incredibly bare and dark, which is not surprising considering it has 336 lamps illuminating it at night . The iconic tower, on the Champ de Mars, was opened in 1889 and has come to define the French capital . The Arc De Triomphe was constructed in 1806, and is the centrepiece of Place Charles de Gaulle at the end of the Champs-Élysées . The imposing monument celebrates France's military glories and also its military heroes - tourists can climb up tot the roof for beautiful views of Paris . Virtual studio DesignCrowd invited people to submit before and after graphics of some of the most well known landscapes as we have never seen them before. Nearly 100 submissions have been created, with a number of them focusing on the 300m-high Eiffel Tower in their creations . The startling absence of the giant tower left the landscape feeling bare and flat, although it did allow for views from the Trocadéro Gardens, through to the Champ de Mars. More missing features in Paris included the impressive Arc De Triomphe. Instead of leading to the famous centrepiece, the multiple surrounding roads meet at a bare, round circle. Without the Statue of Liberty to draw boats of tourists, Liberty Island looks forlorn and barren. All that remains of the island is the paved stone where the iconic colossal neoclassical sculpture stood. The Statue of Liberty draws boats of tourists every day, but without the iconic lady, Liberty Island looks nothing special . Siena Cathedral is a medieval church in Siena, Italy that has been around since 1215. Its spires and towers peek over the city . The River Thames looks just like any other river with the elegant Tower Bridge stretching across the waterway . The iconic Tower Bridge is featured in nearly every London tourist shop and often mistakenly referred to by visitors as London Bridge . Designers imaged what London would look like without its most photographed clocktower and Westminster Palace . The Palace of Westminster is more commonly known as the Houses of Parliament, with both the House of Commons and House of Lords based in the Gothic-style waterfront building . London's attractions draw millions of tourists every year, but there would be a lot less photographs taken in the city if Big Ben was not a feature on the skyline. It is said to be the most photographed clock in the world, and would not be easy to remove, sitting at over 13 tons. The sunset skyline looks empty without the impressive architecture of the Palace of Westminster. The banks of River Yamuna, in Agra, look desolate with the majestic presence of the Taj Mahal . The Taj Mahal is a striking white marble mausoleum in Agra, and brings millions of tourists to the surrounding area . A certain Holy presence is missing from the skyline of Rio de Janeiro, making the normally instantly-recognisable city a little more mysterious . Christ the Redeemer overlooks all the goings on in Rio, and makes the city instantly recognisable . The Sydney Harbour stands out due to its uniquely designed opera house, which resembles the sails of a ship, without it the skyline looks like any other cluster of skyscrapers . The beautiful monastery carved out of red rock in Petra, Jordan, was originally part of a Nabataean . The rose-red Petra is Jordan's most prized tourist attraction, and hopefully, being a UNESCO World Heritage Site, will never disappear . Machu Picchu was only rediscovered by western travellers in 1911, leading to the site being excavated and becoming a tourist attraction . The ruins at the Inca settlement of Machu Picchu in Peru have made the area a bucket list favourite . Niagara Falls without the falls is a dry, barren hole, and would not attract the 12 million annual visitors it does today . On the border of the US and Canada, Niagara Falls is actually made up of three separate waterfalls . The designs also featured landmarks outside of typical city backdrops. Without the tumbling 51-metre-high Niagara Falls, the area left behind would not pull the 12 million annual visitors that it sees every year. While the Andes are an incredible sight by themselves, iconic pictures with the ruins at the Incan settlement of Machu Picchu, have made the area a bucket list favourite. Standing at 68m, the Obelisk of Buenos Aires would be missed from the urban landscape behind if it were removed . The Four Face Sculptures of late Presidents on Mount Rushmore have vanished, leaving behind just another normal rockface .

"This is the shocking moment a Labour candidate collapsed seconds before he was due to take part in a live TV debate. Darren Jones, who is standing for Bristol North West, was seen stepping away from his podium after complaining of pins and needles in his legs. The Labour candidate started swaying on his feet in front of worried audience members before collapsing in front of presenter Ellie Pitt and his opponents on Made in Bristol's programme, Decision Made. Darren Jones was seen stepping away from his podium in front of his worried-looking opponents just seconds before the programme was due to go on air . The 28-year-old approached presenter Ellie Pitt, taking off his glasses before collapsing in front of the studio audience seconds before they were due to go on air . The channel was forced to cut to commercials as the 28-year-old recovered on the studio floor. An ambulance was called by cancelled while the programme was delayed for nine minutes. Once back on his feet Mr Jones was escorted out of the building leaving other local candidates - Ukip's Michael Frost, Liberal Democrat Clare Campion-Smith and Conservative Charlotte Leslie - to take part in the debate without him. Later he said he had not been feeling well for a while before fainting but had been determined not to cancel the event. Blaming his collapse on a cold brought on by his campaign, he said: 'My team and I have all been working really hard to make sure we return a Labour MP for Bristol North West that will fight for the things that really matter. 'I managed to catch a cold in the process but wanted to make sure that Labour's vision for a better Britain was represented so I went to the studio anyway.  Clearly this was unwise!' Audience members rushed to help the Labour candidate after he fell at their feet just seconds before going on air . After coming to, Mr Jones sat on the studio floor with his debate notes still on the podium next to his opponents . 'I'm just disappointed that voters in Bristol didn't get the Labour representation they deserved but I look forward to the opportunity of representing them in Parliament as the next Labour MP for Bristol North West in a few weeks time (fingers crossed).' Chris James, station manager for Made in Bristol, said: 'All of us at Made in Bristol TV hope Darren is recovering, and we send him our very best wishes. 'It was a truly shocking moment to witness for everyone here. We called an ambulance immediately and a number of Made TV staff and audience members carried him outside to get some fresh air.' 'We have spoken to Darren and he is feeling much better and said he was disappointed he couldn't take part, but he is OK.' Mr Jones said he collapsed after becoming exhausted with the a cold but was looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail .","Darren Jones was seen swaying on his feet moments before going on air .

"Ivan Balashov took this selfie on one phone before stealing one he preferred - only to be caught when police identified him from the picture . A phone thief took a selfie with a handset before stealing a model he preferred - only to be caught when police identified him from the photo. Ivan Balashov was browsing through smartphones in a shop in Novokuznetsk, southern Russia when he took a picture of himself wearing a bobble hat and a fake Reebok top. But after deciding the camera on the mobile was not good enough, the 22-year-old grabbed another handset and headed for the exit where he was stopped by shop security. A shop spokesman said: 'When he was asked where he was going he told the security guard that he wanted to buy the phone - and was going to his car to get his wallet. 'For some reason the guard let him go outside the shop with the phone at which point the man ran off.' But when police arrived they quickly discovered Balashov’s selfie. A police spokesman said: 'The man is well-known to the police so when the shop assistant told officers he had been taking photos with another phone they immediately recognised him and were able to go straight to the man’s house. 'When they arrived he denied being anywhere near the shop so in a way condemned himself as we were able to prove he had been there just 30 minutes earlier.' On his way home he had sold the stolen phone in a pawn shop for the equivalent of £120. Appearing in court, Balashov was found guilty and given a three month suspended sentence.

"Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man . A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.","Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, has been arrested .

"A mother-of-two who lost her eye to skin cancer is warning people against the dangers of wearing cheap sunglasses. Deborah Kane, from Tyldesley, Manchester, had her right eye removed three years ago in a life-saving nine-hour operation to stop the cancer spreading to her brain. The 46-year-old teaching assistant believes her cancer developed from getting badly burned on holiday in Lanzarote when she was 15 - where she also bought cheap sunglasses without proper UV protection. Scroll down for video . Deborah Kane, from  Manchester (pictured), had her right eye removed three years ago in a life-saving nine-hour operation to stop her skin cancer spreading to her brain . Debbie, pictured with her radiation mask, said, 'They drilled in through the back of my head to get to my eye, so it was a horrible experience' Debbie, who recently filmed a segment about her ordeal for an upcoming TV show called ‘Fake Britain’, says: 'I want to warn other women of the dangers of buying cheap sunglasses. The decision cost me my eye. 'But I know I’ve been lucky, because through losing my eye, my life was saved.' To celebrate her recovery, Debbie held an aptly named ‘Eye Ball’ and named each table after a part of the eye. She hopes to repeat the event annually and has so far raised over £10,000 for The Royal Manchester Eye Hospital where she was treated. Debbie’s problems first began when she was 24 and had a cancerous mole removed from her neck. She was given the all-clear and put it behind her. Debbie went on to have two children, Annabel, now 14, and Charlie, eight. 'Having one eye doesn’t stop me at all and I’ve learned to be comfortable with the way I look,' says Debbie, pictured with her niece . But in December 2011, aged 42, she began to suffer with blurred vision. She was eventually diagnosed with a malignant melanoma behind her right eye. Debbie says: 'My mind immediately went back to a teenage holiday in Lanzarote when I had been badly sunburned. I had blistered very badly on my neck, which was exactly the same place where I’d first had skin cancer. 'I had scrimped on sunglasses too; I bought cheap ones because they were trendy – but they didn’t protect my eyes at all. 'I used to buy lots of them every time I went on holiday because they only cost a couple of euros. I binned them all as soon as I was diagnosed with cancer. She is now cancer free but has to stay out of the sun, and wears a patch over her eye, as she's never felt comfortable with a prosthetic eye. Pictured, Debbie with her doctors . 'My consultant confirmed that the sun was definitely the cause and that the holiday was likely the starting point for cancer. 'I was so angry, so frustrated with myself. But it was too late for that. 'The lump was so big it was forcing the eye up and out of the socket.' Her eye had to be removed, to stop the cancer spreading to her brain, but her consultant had never done that type of surgery before. Debbie says: 'It was a huge risk and he discussed with experts from around the UK before my operation. In the end there were three consultants at my surgery. 'They drilled in through the back of my head to get to my eye, so it was a horrible experience.' In 2012, Debbie had nine hours of gruelling surgery followed by months of radiotherapy. But a year on, she made a good recovery and returned to work. In 2013, she found a cancerous lump in her leg, which also had to be removed. Her consultant believes that Debbie’s eye and leg tumours were both caused by rogue cells from the original tumour in her neck. To celebrate her recovery, Debbie held an aptly named ‘Eye Ball’ (pictured) and named each table after a part of the eye . She hopes to repeat the event annually and has so far raised over £10,000 for The Royal Manchester Eye Hospital where she was treated . She is now cancer-free but has to stay out of the sun, and wears a patch over her eye, as she's never felt comfortable with a prosthetic eye. Speaking about her Eye Ball, she says: 'My friend didn’t understand the concept and she told me she didn’t want to sit on ""Len’s table"" because she might not like him!' Debbie says: 'Having one eye doesn’t stop me at all and I’ve learned to be comfortable with the way I look. I work as a teacher, I drive a car and do everything like a normal mum. 'The way I see it, losing my eye saved my life. I just hope my story can save someone else.'","Deborah Kane, from Manchester, had a melanoma behind her eye .

"Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond today held talks with Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman - just hours before it was sensationally announced he had quit the BBC. The resignation  marks another blow for the hugely-popular show, which has been marred by uncertainty since Clarkson was axed  last month following a  'fracas' with a producer. It means Mr Wilman, a childhood friend of Clarkson who helped revamp Top Gear into the Corporation's most successful programme, is now free to reunite with the team on a rival channel. There is widespread speculation that the men are  working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster - in what would be a nightmare scenario for the BBC. Scroll down for video . Back together: Jeremy Clarkson (left) is seen with his Top Gear colleagues James May (centre) and Richard Hammond (right) outside his  west London flat, in their first public appearance since he was sacked . Discussions: Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman (front centre) was also present at the meeting today, just hours before it was sensationally announced he had quit the BBC, in what is another blow for the show . Presenters: May had earlier said the BBC would be 'stupid' to try a version of the hit motoring show with 'a surrogate Jeremy', Richard Hammond and himself - adding that the idea was a ‘non-starter’ Something to smile about? The presenter looked in high spirits as he left the property with Mr Wilman. A BBC spokesman would not comment on the producer's resignation other than to confirm it . Put it there: Hammond and Clarkson shake hands as they part ways on a west London street . The men were photographed today outside Clarkson's home in west London - their first public appearance together since the presenter was dropped from Top Gear - before moving on to a pub. Earlier today, May ruled out returning to Top Gear without Clarkson, insisting it would be 'lame' with a new presenter in place of his sacked co-host. The 52-year-old said the BBC would be ‘stupid’ to try a version of the programme with 'a surrogate Jeremy', Hammond and himself - adding that the idea was a ‘non-starter’. His comments mean that if the show does return next year, it will likely be with an entirely new presenting team. Both May and Hammond saw their contracts finish last month. Casual: Speaking  today, May, pictured tonight, said he had just been 'having a pint' with his co-stars . May told The Guardian: ‘Me and Hammond with a surrogate Jeremy is a non-starter, it just wouldn’t work. That would be lame, or “awks” as young people say. ‘It has to be the three of us. You can’t just put a surrogate Jeremy in and expect it to carry on. It would be forced. I don’t believe they would be stupid enough to try that. ‘It doesn’t mean I won’t go back - we may all go back in the future. It might just be we have a break from it. I don’t know. It would be a bloody tough call to do Top Gear without Jeremy.’ Former X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, model Jodie Kidd and Great British Bake Off host Sue Perkins have all been named as possible replacements for Clarkson. Speaking after the meeting today, May said he had just been 'having a pint' with his co-stars and Mr Wilman, adding that he still didn't know what he would do in the future. This evening, a BBC spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Wilman, Top Gear's longstanding executive producer and Clarkson's right-hand man, had handed  bosses his resignation. She would not say whether or not the decision was related to the outspoken presenter. It comes just weeks after an email from Mr Wilman to colleagues titled 'au revoir' was leaked. In the email, the 52-year-old, who has  made millions from the show, congratulated staff on making 'one of the most iconic programmes in TV history'. 'At least we left 'em wanting more. And that alone, when you think about it, is quite an achievement for a show that started 13 years ago,' he wrote. After the email was leaked, Mr Wilman announced publicly that it had not been a resignation. The revelations today come after BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw, who has been tasked with finding a replacement for Clarkson on Top Gear, said the presenter ‘will be back on the BBC’ at some point. Leaving: Hammond arrived at the flat first, before May came in a BMW car - followed by Mr Wilman's arrival . Waving: It comes a day after BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw, who has been tasked with finding a replacement for Clarkson (left) on Top Gear, said the 55-year-old presenter ‘will be back on the BBC’ at some point . Keeping mum: The group has not yet revealed whether it will work together on another car programme . Miss Shillinglaw also confirmed Clarkson's final Top Gear scenes will be screened later this year and she was not thinking of his replacement ‘in terms of gender’. Clarkson was sacked by the BBC after an ‘unprovoked physical and verbal’ attack in North Yorkshire that left his victim, Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon, in need of hospital treatment. The star was suspended last month when he became the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Mr Tymon, 36, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him. Clarkson's contract was not renewed, with director-general Tony Hall saying at the time 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'.

Victim: Clarkson was suspended last month when he became the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (pictured), 36, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him . Clarkson said he considered turning his back on presenting altogether in the immediate fall-out from the incident, but has since stated that he expects to present another TV show on cars in the future. Earlier this month, North Yorkshire Police said that following an investigation Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel in Hawes. Meanwhile, Clarkson revealed in a newspaper column earlier this month that he was told by a doctor that he might have cancer, two days before assaulting Mr Tymon. Top Gear - which is said to generate about £50million a year for BBC Worldwide - is viewed by more than six million viewers on BBC2 and watched in more than 200 countries.

"Koby Hodder, suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed in the school playground when he was 10 . A 10-year-old boy nearly died after suffering a cardiac arrest in the school playground. Koby Hodder's heart stopped for a staggering 12 minutes after he collapsed while running around with friends during the morning break. He was playing British Bulldog – a game in which children run from one side of a playing field to another without being caught by one of the ‘bulldogs’, who often employ forceful tactics to trap runners, including rugby tackling opponents to the ground. Teachers across the country have called for the game to be banned, claiming it is dangerous and leads to children becoming injured. In the middle of playing the game, Koby suffered a cardiac arrest. This is where the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that it stops pumping and quivers or ‘fibrillates’ instead. His heart suddenly stopped beating blood around his body and he collapsed and lost consciousness. The 10-year-old was later diagnosed with the same heart condition as footballer Fabrice Muamba, a former Bolton Wanderers  player who collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during the first half of Bolton's FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham in 2012. Mr Muamba was 'effectively dead' for 78 minutes and had to be shocked 15 times before his heart restarted. Teachers at Koby’s school in Doncaster, were able to give Koby CPR until paramedics arrived and saved his life. His father, Mark, 45, got a call from the school at around 11am on March 2, and was told to get to the school immediately. He said: 'I was working around the corner so I was able to get straight over there and when I saw Koby on the ground I knew he was dead. 'Teachers were giving him CPR but I could see he was grey and lifeless. I couldn't even go to him. I was devastated.' Luckily he was brought back to life when paramedics Lee Murphy and Martin Parkinson and emergency care assistant Freddie Stevens arrived, and were able to save him by giving Koby two shocks with a defibrillator. A cardiac arrest happens when the heart stops pumping blood around your body. The most common cause of a cardiac arrest is a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF). Ventricular fibrillation happens when the electrical activity of your heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers or 'fibrillates' instead. Someone who is having a cardiac arrest will suddenly lose consciousness and will stop breathing or stop breathing normally. Unless immediately treated by CPR this always leads to death within minutes. It is possible to survive and recover from a cardiac arrest, with the right treatment. Ventrivular fibrillation - which causes an arrest - can sometimes be corrected by giving an electric shock through the chest wall, by using a device called a defibrillator. Source: British Heart Foundation . Koby, who turned 11 two weeks ago, was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary, where he seemed to be making a recovery. Just as he seemed to be improving, he suffered another attack, and was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Mr Hodder, a builder and father-of-three, said: 'We were beside ourselves with worry. 'Koby is super-fit, he plays football three times a week and goes boxing two times a week. ‘How could this happen in someone so young?’ Koby’s mother, Joanne Hodder, 43, added: 'Can you imagine what we were going through? 'We didn't even have a clue what had happened to Koby. ‘We didn't think for a moment that he could have had a heart problem. 'I had dropped him off to school that morning and he was his happy little self. ‘We had no warning. Koby is a bit of a joker so when he collapsed even his friends thought he was messing around, until they noticed he wasn't breathing.' While Koby was in hospital doctors fitted him with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to shock his heart back into rhythm should it ever stop again. Muamba, 26, was fitted with the same implant after his high profile collapse three years ago. Mr Hodder said: 'At the moment we don't know what has caused Koby to have a heart problem. It is baffling.' Koby, who is now 11, suffered a series of cardiac arrests, where the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, and was treated in intensive care . Koby had a device fitted to his heart which will shock it back into beating if it ever stops again. He is pictured in hospital with boxer Josh Warrington . Mr and Mrs Hodder are due to have tests to see if Koby's heart condition is hereditary. His brother and sister, Joel, 27, and Courteney, 20, may also have to be tested. Mrs Hodder, said: 'I cannot thank each and every person who played a part in saving Koby's life and helped with his recovery, enough. 'Teachers, paramedics and hospital staff have all been amazing. 'As a parent it is your worst nightmare to receive a phone call like I did from school, when you sent your healthy 10-year-old child there fit and well that morning. 'Doctors have said that the fact that Koby was running around at the time of the attack may have helped him - because it meant his heart was pumping.' Koby knows he is lucky to be alive, but his dream of being a professional footballer has been taken from him. Koby had played with both Leeds United and Doncaster Rovers youth teams and dreamed of playing for his beloved Leeds United when he got older. Mr Hodder said: 'Doctors have said he can play with friends as long as he doesn't exert himself too much. ‘They've said that if he can exercise and talk at the same time then that's okay, but playing professionally is out of the question. Koby suffered from the same heart condition as Fabrice Muamba, a Bolton Wanderers football player who collapsed after a cardiac arrest during the first half of Bolton's FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham . 'Maybe Koby would not have been a professional footballer but he is gutted, understandably.' Mrs Hodder said: 'When Koby feels down we tell him that he is very lucky to be here and that makes him feel better. 'But he is still recovering and sometimes he feels scared, but he is still getting used to his defibrillator. It's a big thing he has had to deal with. 'For his birthday he didn't want a sleepover as we had originally planned, instead we went for a day out to York. 'Koby has come a long way and even returned to school this month. 'He's had a fantastic recovery so far, which is all down to the fast response from the school staff and the paramedics. 'He's doing better than we could have ever imagined. I am so grateful we still have our little boy with us.'

"When emergency crews received a call saying 'someone' had been knocked down by a car in Essex, they immediately sent two ambulances to the rescue. But the vehicles returned to base just moments later when the caller revealed the 'victim' was actually a squirrel that had been run over in Epping Forest. The report forms just part of a long list released by East of England ambulance service detailing their most bizarre, and irritating, call outs. Two ambulances were sent to Epping Forest after a caller told crews 'someone' had been run down, only for the 'victim' to turn out to be a squirrel.

The service said it receives around 2,500 calls per day, and in the last two years has had to deal with 1,248 that did not need emergency help. Front-line crews have attended almost half of the phoney calls, believing them to be genuine emergencies. Also on the list is a woman from  Shoeburyness who called to say she was locked out of the house, while a man in Peterborough called to say his feet hurt after wearing shoes that were too small. In Hitchin, Hertfordshire, a man told 999 staff: 'I have been dieting and feel lethargic.' Gary Morgan, Regional Head of Emergency Operations Centres, asked people to use common-sense when calling, adding that misguided or hoax calls could cost lives.

"The wife of a suburban Los Angeles mayor who was shot in his home pleaded not guilty Thursday to voluntary manslaughter. Lyvette Crespo, 43, entered the plea to a grand jury indictment. She was ordered held on $150,000 bail and could face up to 21 years in state prison if convicted. Crespo shot Bell Gardens Mayor Daniel Crespo three times in the chest on September 30. The killing came after the late mayor's years of domestic abuse, the widow claims. However, the late Crespo's brother says those claims are all a lie and that he has evidence proving Mrs. Crespo is a cold-blooded killer. Indicted: Lyvette Crespo (right) allegedly shot her husband, Bell Gardens, California Mayor Daniel Crespo (left), in September during a heated argument about his infidelity. She's now been indicted on charges of voluntary manslaughter . History of abuse? The Crespos were high school sweethearts. Mrs. Crespo claims her husband had become increasingly abusive in the months leading to his death. She says she shot him after he punched their son, who'd tried intervening during an argument . In text messages that brother, William Crespo, provided to the LA Times, Mrs. Crespo appears to have threatened to shoot her husband at least once before doing the deed. 'I'll find out who ... u got flowers for. Has to be a bell gardens wh***,' reads a message from Lyvette to her husband. Mr. Crespo replied: 'It better last time U threaten to shoot me in head!!!' In a civil suit filed against Lyvette on behalf of his mother, William Crespo has asked for more than $53 million in damages for the death of his brother, who he says was killed 'with malice and in cold blood,' by Mrs. Crespo. Crespo has told authorities it was self-defense after he punched their 19-year-old son in the face after he intervened in the couple's argument.

Broken family: In this file photo, attorney Claudia Osuna holds a photo of the Crespo family - from top left to bottom right, Bell Gardens, Calif., Mayor Daniel Crespo, his daughter Crystal, his wife Lyvette and son Daniel Crespo Jr. Daniel Crespo Jr. called 911 to report the shooting, telling a dispatcher: 'He's on the floor dying. He hurt me.' Daniel Crespo, a Los Angeles County deputy probation officer, was elected in 2001 to the City Council of Bellflower, a city of about 42,000 residents. The mayor's position rotated among council members. He and his wife were high school sweethearts and married as teenagers in 1986. However, the autopsy report contained allegations by a daughter, Crystal Crespo, that her father had been verbally and physically abusive toward her mother over two decades. She said the abuse had become more physical in recent years because of arguments over Daniel Crespo's infidelity, but it was never reported and never left serious injuries. Daniel Crespo's brother, William Crespo, has denied the abuse allegations. The mayor's mother filed a $53 million lawsuit last fall in which she calls Crespo a 'cold-blooded killer' who picked a fight with her husband knowing their son would intervene. What happened?

"There are dozens of safety rules when it comes to jet skiing. But all of those appeared to have sunk to the bottom of the ocean at a beach in Cancun, Mexico, as a new nail-biting video proves. Alejandro Bouvier of Uruguay filmed the moment another rider got scarily close to his watercraft one sunny day. Footage shows him zipping towards the driver before he swings around and drives directly in his path. 'Look out, look out!' a man behind the camera can be heard screaming. Luckily the two jet skiers avoid a dangerous collision thanks to some swift steering skills. Commenting on the incident, Bouvier later told Grind TV: 'Actually, I was more concerned about the cost of the jet skis than our injuries, but after watching the video and thinking about it, I believe it could [have resulted] in really bad injuries, if not death.'

"The eminent plastic surgeon who treated acid attack victim Katie Piper molested another patient after getting drunk in his surgery, a tribunal was told yesterday. Mohammad Ali Jawad, 56, allegedly dimmed the lights, shut the blinds and asked her to dance to the music of Julio Iglesias before massaging her neck and touching her breasts. To the strains of the Spanish singer crooning on his iPhone, he is claimed to have asked her: ‘Do you see me as a man or a surgeon?’ Dr Mohammad Ali Jawad, pictured with former patient Katie Piper. Today a medical tribunal heard how he allegedly molested another patient at his surgery in Marylebone, central London after getting drunk . The woman, known as Patient A, told a hearing considering Dr Jawad’s fitness to practise that when she went to him for a consultation about treatment for facial scarring, she took a bottle of vodka from her native Poland as a gift. He opened it in front of her, brought out two shot glasses and when the next patient cancelled his appointment, he gulped down some vodka, Patient A said. ‘We had a shot first and I think he had a few, then he put the vodka in the bigger crystal glasses,’ she added. ‘The more he drank, the more he kept staring at my cleavage and telling me I looked pretty. He asked about my employment. He offered me a job at the clinic. ‘I was a little bit uncomfortable. I wouldn’t say I was distressed, but it was becoming a little weird. He was becoming increasingly drunk.’ Patient A, a former personal assistant in her 30s, said: ‘He re-entered the room and dimmed the lights, pulled the blinds down and played Julio Iglesias on his iPhone. 'He then opened a bottle of red wine, then he asked me to dance with him. He didn’t really say anything – he grabbed me. ‘I didn’t stop him, I was paralysed. I pushed him away and managed to remove myself from his grip. I told him I would show him something on the internet, so he let me go. ‘I showed him pictures of my friends on Facebook and that’s when he stood behind me and started massaging my neck. He then moved his hand from my neck to my collarbone and the front of my chest. I was paralysed.’ She added: ‘He then sat down on the chair next to me, facing me. He pulled his legs round one of mine and squeezed my leg with his. He put his hands on my knee and asked if I thought he was pretty. He then asked me if I saw him as a man or a surgeon. Dr Khan featured in the Oscar-winning documentary Saving Face, pictured. Patient A told the hearing in Manchester he had bragged about his connection with Katie Piper. He denies all the allegations against him . ‘When I said I saw him as a surgeon, he said: “Well if that is the case, there is nothing for us to discuss.” I got up, took my bag and coat and left in a hurry.’ The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester was told the incident happened in October 2012 during a three-hour consultation at his Nip n Tuck surgery in Marylebone, London. Dr Jawad came to prominence when he led pioneering reconstruction surgery on Miss Piper, 31, who suffered horrific burns to her face and body after being covered with sulphuric acid in an attack arranged by her ex-boyfriend in 2008. Patient A told the hearing he had bragged about his connection with the TV presenter, adding: ‘He had promised to tell me details about Katie Piper, but he wasn’t sharing details about her treatment. He was telling me how she was healing and that she was very good.’ Dr Jawad is alleged to have molested Patient a at his surgery Nip n Tuck on this street in Marylebone, London . She said he had showed her a clip on his laptop of his appearance at the Pride of Britain awards before trying to instigate sexual contact. The tribunal heard Dr Jawad and Patient A first met for a consultation in January 2010 and had at least two other meetings before the incident, but they communicated by text message and email. The surgeon denies all of the allegations of misconduct and will give evidence via videolink from Karachi, Pakistan, where he is currently living and working. In 2012, Dr Jawad featured in the Oscar-winning documentary Saving Face, which followed his journeys to Pakistan to perform reconstructive surgery on female survivors of acid attacks. He is a trustee, alongside Simon Cowell, of Miss Piper’s burns charity, the Katie Piper Foundation.","Dr Mohammad Ali Jawad allegedly bragged about treatment of Katie Piper .

"A week after 10 doctors urged Columbia University to sever all ties with him, Dr. Oz has used his syndicated TV show to hit back and claim that the criticism is part of a conspiracy because of his views on genetically modified foods. The celebrity doctor didn't pull any punches in Thursday's episode of The Dr. Oz Show which was called The Truth About His Critics. 'The 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted – sensational headlines and sound bites,' said Oz. Scroll down for video . The celebrity doctor used Thursday's episode of The Dr. Oz Show to hit back and claim that the criticism he's received is part of a conspiracy because of his outspoken views on genetically modified food . The 54-year-old found himself at the center of a firestorm last week when the doctors sent a letter to the university where Oz serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at College of Physicians. The doctors accused him of being a 'charlatan' who promotes 'quack treatments' and as someone who 'has repeatedly shown disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops'. 'It's ironic that I am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors, when, as you are about to see, some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also,' he said on Thursday's show. A report followed revealing how some of the 10 doctors 'have big ties to big industry.' Four who signed the letter, including leader author Henry Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health. The organization has previously received grants from Monsanto, who manufactures GMO seeds. 'They are rent-a-scientists,' said Gary Ruskin, cofounder and the executive director of US Right to Know, of Oz's critics. Thursday's Dr. Oz Show featured a report revealing how some of the 10 doctors 'have big ties to big industry' 'What Henry Miller does is he speaks on behalf of big corporations and he tells big lies on their behalf,' said Ruskin. During the almost half an hour defense of his reputation, Oz also denied having it in for genetically modified foods. 'That is not true. I have never judged GMO foods. But just like 64 countries around the world, I support GMO labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family.' Another Oz alley, Joel Fuhrman, said the doctors weren't 'representative of the medical profession.' 'It's ugly,' he told Oz. 'Number one, they're not representative of the medical profession. Number two, it is not an attack just against you. It is an attack against all physicians, all health care professionals, all people who maybe don't take a standard party line.' Oz also included a statement from the BMJ, which he described as his harshest critic. Ten doctors sent a letter to Columbia University urging the school to remove TV celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz from his faculty position because he is a 'charlatan' who promotes 'quack treatments' A BMJ analysis of 40 random episodes of his show revealed that his recommendations were supported by evidence only 46 percent of the time. On Thursday, Oz shared a statement from the BMJ that said the authors of the study were 'disappointed that the overwhelming commentary seems to be that our study somehow proves that Dr Oz or The Doctors are quacks or charlatans or worse. 'Our data in no way supports these conclusions.' Responding to the criticism that he promotes 'quack treatments', Oz said his show's purpose was 'not to talk about medicine' but to discuss 'the good life.' He told NBC News that the Dr. Oz Show is actually 'not a medical show,' but that he had decided to no longer use 'inflammatory' words like 'miracle'. 'The purpose is not to throw at you the biggest articles published by doctors that week. Frankly it's not very much fun to listen to [those], either. It's to have a conversation with people who may be feeling the way you feel right now and maybe got better.' The Harvard-educated doctor joined the faculty at Columbia in 1993. He has been hosting his health and wellness talk show since 2009. Dr Miller had led the campaign against Dr Oz. 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country. 'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.' From left to right, Dr Phil McGraw, financial advisor Suze Orman, host Oprah Winfrey, Dr Mehmet Oz and interior designer Nate Berkus participate in The Oprah Winfrey Show live from Radio City Music Hall in 2010 . He told CBS News that 'a person who endangers patients and is a menace to public health should not be on the faculty of a prestigious medical institution'. The nine other doctors from across the country included Dr Joel Tepper, a cancer researcher from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and Dr Gilbert Ross of the American Council on Science and Health in New York City. The doctors sent the letter to Lee Goldman, the dean of Columbia's Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine. The physicians accused Dr Oz of pushing 'miracle' weight-loss supplements with no scientific proof that they work. The doctors wrote that Oz, for years a world-class Columbia cardiothoracic surgeon, has 'misled and endangered' the public. The letter read: 'He has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain. 'Thus, Dr Oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both. For more, visit Extra online. The authors of the scathing communique took a particular issue with what they described as Oz's 'baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops.' CNN Money and the New York Times reported that some of the doctors opposing Oz have strong ties to the GMO food industry, namely the advocacy group American Council on Science and Health. Dr Miller, a researcher with a conservative think tank, has been a vocal proponent of genetically modified foods and has spoken out against mandatory labeling. Dr Oz insists that he is not opposed to GMOs on principle but wants them to be properly labelled so that educated consumers would know exactly what is in their food. 'I do not claim that GMO foods are dangerous, but believe that they should be labeled like they are in most countries around the world,' he said in his statement Friday. The New York Ivy League school responded Thursday, issuing a statement to The Associated Press saying only that the school 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.' Special interests: The authors of the letter took an issue with what they described as Oz's 'baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops.' The surgeon has been a vocal proponent of mandatory labeling of GMOs, while some of his critics have been advocating for the GMO industry . Dr Oz first came to public attention as a frequent television guest of Oprah Winfrey. For the past five years, he's been the host of The Dr Oz Show. Last year, he appeared before a US Senate panel that accused him of endorsing products that were medically unsound. At the time, the doctor acknowledged some of the products he advised his viewers to use 'don't have the scientific muster to present as fact.' A show representative did not immediately return a call Thursday from the AP seeking comment. As vice chairman of Columbia's surgery department, Dr Oz still occasionally teaches, said Douglas Levy, spokesman for the Columbia University Medical Center. The controversy did not die down after his testimony. The company behind the'miracle' diet supplement in question later agreed to pay a $3.5 million settlement over false advertising. A study that purported to prove the product's weight-loss benefits turned out to be based on fraudulent data and was retracted.","TV doctor used Thursday's show to hit back at his critics who he accused of having 'conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also'

"This United States may have been made for you and me, but America's diamond deserts and redwood forests could net a sizable amount of cash if we ever decided to sell it, according to a new study. All the land in the lower 48 states was worth a combined $23trillion in 2009,  combination of tax and real estate data in a paper published by the Commerce Department as revealed. Researchers estimated that land in the country, minus all the buildings, roads and trees on top of it, achieved its peak value of $26.2 trillion in in 2006 before sliding down three trillion dollars in three years. A map of the US by county shows areas with land values from $73,000 to $3.35million per acre in dark blue and land less than $2,000 per acre in white. The entire country is worth $23trillion, according to new study . Prices may have rebounded since the end of the economic recession, but the study from William Larson paints the widest ever picture of how much the ground beneath our feet is actually worth. The research used land prices combined with Census data to tabulate values for all of the federal, agricultural and developed land in the country, excluding Alaska, Hawaii and bodies of water. Washington DC had the greatest land value, with a staggering $1,050,000 per acre. It was followed by New Jersey, where the average acre cost of $196,000 led a foursome of smaller Northeastern states with acre values above $100,000 with Rhode Island's $133,730, Connecticut's $128,820 and Massachusetts $102,210. Land in Washington DC had the highest price  in the entire country, with land costing more than $1million per acre . Northeastern states including New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts all have per acre values above $100,000. Above, a home in Cape May, New Jersey . California was the most valuable state overall at $3.9trillion while Vermont was worth only $44billion. Wyoming, with $1,560 per acre, is the cheapest place in the country to buy land, followed by New Mexico at $1,930 and Nevada at $2,120, according to the Wall Street Journal. Land in large urban areas was the most valuable, with cities of more than 1million people worth $64,844 per acre. Despite only being 5.8 per cent of the country's 1.89billion acres, developed land had a slim majority of the country's value. Besides Washington DC, New Jersey and Rhode Island had the highest percentages of developed land, both more than 30 per cent. Wyoming, which like many Western states is majority-owned by the federal government, had the lowest per acre price at $1,560. Above, the High Plains Desert in Wyoming . The federal government, the largest landowner in the US and the fourth largest in the world, owns 24 per cent of the country and majorities of six states including California, Nevada and Oregon. However, the land is almost entirely undeveloped and is only worth $1.8trillion, which is about 10 percent of the federal debt. The government owns almost none of Connecticut, just 0.1 per cent. True to its reputation for having golden waves of grain, forty-seven per cent of the land in the US is farmland, with the highest state percentage for agriculture being Nebraska's 92.7 per cent. Mr Larson estimated that his figures were within a 10 per cent margin of error. He said he did the study because 'Despite its fundamental role in nearly all economic activity, there is no current and complete estimate of the value of the land area of the United States'.

"Eye of the Beholder . by Laura J Snyder . (Head of Zeus, £25) The behaviour of Dutch natural scientist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek was nothing if not eccentric. In 1677, at the age of 41, he embarked on an extraordinarily gruesome experiment, using his body as a guinea pig. Antoni van Leeuwenhoek (pictured in a portrait ) used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment . He took three lice, nestled them among the hairs of his calf, rolled up a tight stocking so that the insects were bound to his leg and then left the stocking on and did not bathe for six days. On the seventh day, he removed the stocking and counted more than 80 eggs but no young lice. In the interests of empiricism, the stocking went back on for another three days. Finally, the stocking came off to reveal at least 25 lice running up and down his leg. ‘This spectacle of all the young lice filled me with such aversion to the stocking,’ he wrote, ‘that I threw it, along with all the lice in it, out the window.’ He rubbed down his legs with ice, then took up his pen to calculate the louse’s reproduction rate. He estimated that two pairs of lice could generate 10,000 young in only eight weeks. While Leeuwenhoeck was thus engaged, another great Dutchman, Johannes Vermeer, was intent on his own more genteel studies in his house on the opposite side of Delft’s market square. Draped in a black cloth, Vermeer spent hours peering into the box-like interior of a camera obscura, an ancestor of the photographic camera. This was a light-tight wooden chamber with a hole or lens on one side, which could be used to project an image of a scene on to a glass plate or wall. They had been used for party tricks and for viewing solar eclipses but were increasingly being employed by artists to render paintings more lifelike than ever. The experiments of these two men are the subject of Laura J. Snyder’s new biography. She asks an intriguing question: could Vermeer and Leeuwenhoek, who were born in the same week, lived and worked their entire lives in an area not much larger than a football pitch, and who had friends in common, have exchanged ideas and inspired each other’s work? This is much more than a joint biography. It is a portrait of an age of insatiable intellectual curiosity. The 17th century gave us an inventory of instruments which far extended man’s understanding of the world: accurate thermometers and barometers, the air pump, the pendulum clock, improvements to the telescope, the refinement of the microscope. Leeuwenhoek’s mastery of lens-grinding saw him build a microscope capable of magnification up to 480 times. Scientists and dilettanti assembled cabinets of curiosity filled with rare animal and shell specimens. Leeuwenhoek’s collection included the eye of a whale, pickled in brandy. Anatomical theatres for the dissection of bodies were built in Padua, Bologna, Leiden, Delft and Amsterdam. According to one chronicler, sumptuously dressed ladies would attend dissections of the bodies of executed criminals and then go straight to that night’s ball. Snyder moves effortlessly not just between Vermeer’s studio and Leeuwenhoek’s laboratory, but all over Europe, from the universities of Italy, to the halls of the Royal Society in London, then the world’s pre-eminent scientific institution. Leeuwenhoeck wrote about 300 letters to the Royal Society, charting 50 years of experiments. He addressed them as ‘curious gentlemen dabblers’. One of his great discoveries was the observation of thousands of swimming creatures, which he called animaculae or little animals, in murky water. He estimated there could be more than eight million of them in a single drop. Later generations would recognise them as bacteria. He was also the first scientist to observe the existence and movement of sperm. No one had yet seen the human sperm or the egg or understood their part in reproduction. Leeuwenhoek politely wrote to the President of the Royal Society: ‘What I investigate is only what, without sinfully defiling myself, remains as a residue of conjugal coitus.’ One feels a certain amount of sympathy for his wife, Cornelia. What with the lice and the post-conjugal microscope experiments, she must have been a very patient woman. The great pleasure of this book is how Snyder makes the science clear to the layman. I have a degree in history of art and only one measly science GCSE in biology. Yet I was left more eager to peer down the lens at one of Leeuwenhoek’s slides, than to stand before even the most pellucid of Vermeer’s exquisite paintings.","At 41 van Leeuwenhoek used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment .

Curiously absent from the final vote was Texas Senator Ted Cruz - a key opponent of Lynch's nomination. He was the only member of the Senate who did not cast a vote.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . IN: The first black woman to become the top U.S. law enforcement official, Lynch, 55, was approved by a 56-43 vote, with 10 Republicans joining with Senate Democrats to approve her . OUT: She is expected to take over as head of the U.S. Justice Department on Monday, replacing Eric Holder . Lynch is expected to take over as head of the U.S. Justice Department on Monday, replacing Eric Holder. The White House said it did not know when exactly Lynch would be sworn in but it wasn't likely to be today. President Barack Obama said in a statement after that the vote that 'America will be better off' having Lynch as its next top cop. 'She will bring to bear her experience as a tough, independent, and well-respected prosecutor on key, bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform,' he said. 'Loretta’s confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe, keep our nation secure, and ensure that every American experiences justice under the law.' Ten . Republicans voted for Lynch, including Senate Majority Leader . Mitch McConnell and expected presidential candidate Lindsey Graham, the senior senator from South Carolina. Florida's Marco Rubio did not vote in her favor. Cruz tried to block Lynch from clearing a procedural hurdle earlier in the day, giving an impassioned speech on the chamber floor urging his colleagues to oppose her nomination, but was missing when the final tally was taken. 'The Republican majority, if it so chose, could defeat this nomination,' the 2016 Oval Office candidate said said during the debate on whether to take a formal vote on her nomination. 'I would note there are a few voters back home that are asking what exactly is the difference between a Democratic and Republican majority,' he charged. It was not immediately clear why the senator - who had not been shy about his intentions to vote against Lynch - was absent from the floor during the formal vote and a spokeswoman for his 2016 campaign simply told Daily Mail Online that he had a prior commitment in Texas. Like a representative from his Senate office noted on Twitter, the spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said he voted no on cloture, and that's the only one 'that mattered.' 'As you know Sen. Cruz led the charge to oppose her nomination at every turn for the last several months,' she added. Minutes later the Cruz for President invitation began circulating online. The  VIP portion of the event starts at 6 pm central, meaning Cruz needed to leave the East Coast to by mid-afternoon arrive at the party on time. Hicks, who is currently in the process of selling his estate, on the market for $98 million as of last month, is a neighbor of former U.S. President George W. Bush, also a Republican and a former co-owner of the Rangers. MISSING: Ted Cruz was not present for today's final vote on Lynch. He was the only member of the Senate who was absent. A copy of a Cruz for President invitation that later began flying around Twitter indicates the Texas senator skipped town early to make a fundraiser at the home of former Texas Rangers owner and billionaire Tom Hicks . The voting margin reflected many Republicans' disapproval of . Lynch's support for an executive order issued by Obama in . November that was meant to shield millions of undocumented . immigrants from the threat of deportation. Before the vote, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, an . outspoken critic of that action, blasted Lynch. 'We do not have to confirm someone to the highest law . enforcement position in America if that someone is publicly . committed to denigrating Congress, violating law,' he said. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid berated Republicans for . delaying the confirmation and said Lynch was 'as qualified a . candidate' as he'd seen in almost 30 years in the Senate. Lynch has awaited confirmation since November when Obama, a . fellow Harvard Law School graduate, nominated her. After winning November's midterm elections, Republicans asked the Democratic-led Senate not to shove a vote on Lynch down their throats. In a show of good faith, Democrats acquiesced and let the clock run out on their leadership in the Senate. Her nomination was backed by the Senate's Judiciary Committee by a vote of 12-8 on Feb. 26. But her confirmation languished over an impasse in the Republican-led Senate on an unrelated bill meant to protect human trafficking victims. Democrats had balked at an anti-abortion provision included in that bill, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell put a hold on all business until that issue was resolved. A bipartisan agreement was reached earlier this week, and as a result the process to consider Lynch was allowed to move forward. Hicks is currently in the process of selling his estate, on the market for $98 million as of last month. He is a neighbor of former U.S. President George W. Bush, also a Republican and a former co-owner of the Rangers . MYSTERY SOLVED: Minutes after a spokesperson for Cruz told Daily Mail Online that the senator had a prior commitment in Texas that caused him to miss the vote, this Cruz for President invitation began circulating online. The VIP portion of the event begins at 6pm central, meaning Cruz needed to leave the East Coast to by mid-afternoon arrive at the party on time . Despite the delay, she was widely seen as less controversial . than Holder, who often clashed with Republicans. She has said . she aims to smooth relations with Congress. As attorney general, her earliest tests will likely include . handling civil rights cases stemming from deadly altercations . between police and unarmed black men in several U.S. cities. The . Justice Department has said it will look into bringing civil . rights charges over the death of a Baltimore man who died after . sustaining a spinal cord injury while in police custody. Lynch will also inherit major financial cases involving . allegations that some of the world's largest banks helped . clients evade U.S. taxes and manipulated the currency markets. An accomplished career prosecutor, Lynch has twice served as . U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, New York, most recently since 2010. Her office there handled more terrorism prosecutions than most . other offices in the United States. For two years, she also led . a committee that advised the attorney general on policy.

"Cardinal Francis George was remembered Thursday as a man of deep faith, intellect and compassion as Catholics said their final goodbyes to the man who led the nation's third-largest archdiocese and was known as a vigorous defender of Roman Catholic orthodoxy. George also didn't hesitate to speak his mind, even if it was unscripted and, at times, controversial, said Seattle Archbishop J. Peter Sartain, who delivered the homily at a packed funeral Mass at Chicago's Holy Name Cathedral. 'The cardinal's faith was simple, direct, without pretense or embarrassment,' Sartain said. 'He was so utterly a Christian that no circumstance seemed inappropriate for him to give witness to Christ.'

He was to be buried Thursday in his family's plot at All Saints Cemetery in nearby Des Plaines. After being appointed by Pope John Paul II in 1997 to lead the Chicago Archdiocese, George earned a reputation as an intellectual leader and a leading figure in some of the most prominent events in the U.S. Church. At the height of the abuse crisis in 2002, George led a group of U.S. bishops who persuaded resistant Vatican officials to more quickly oust guilty priests — a policy at the core of reforms meant to restore trust in church leaders. He also oversaw the contentious new English-language translation of the Roman Missal, one of the biggest changes in Catholic worship in generations.

And in his three years as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, George spearheaded opposition to the Affordable Care Act, arguing that the health insurance law would allow taxpayer money to fund abortion. The Chicago archdiocese's charitable arm helped sue the Obama administration in 2012 over the requirement that employers cover the cost of contraception. George retired last fall before announcing his treatment for kidney cancer had failed. He was replaced by Archbishop Blase Cupich. Hundreds of clergy from around the country, plus Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner joined lay Catholics at Thursday's services, which followed three days of visitation. Lolita Slaughter of suburban Bolingbrook said the funeral Mass was 'beautiful, and such a great home-going for the cardinal,' whom she regarded as a steady and stabilizing force.

One read: 'I love you do much please forgive what I said please.' Written in bold capitals another asked the recipient to remember their first date and professed it was the 'best day of my life.'

'This recipe uses rice malt syrup which is a fructose-free sweetener that, unlike sugar, doesn't cause metabolic havoc. But, as with all our recipes, we keep the sweetener to less than half a teaspoon per serve. We chuck in some macadamias to give them extra Australian love!'

CHOCOLATE & MACADAMIA ANZAC BISCUITS BY LORRAINE ELLIOTT, NOT QUITE NIGELLA . 'There are two types of Anzac biscuits: crunchy and chewy, and while I'll happily eat both I prefer crunchy,' says Lorraine Elliott of food blog Not Quit Nigella. 'These Anzac biscuits are definitely of the crunchy variety. Think brandy snaps or toffee in their tooth feel. 'The macadamias and chocolate give it a bit of luxury that isn't traditional but I am not really allowed to make them any other way now that friends and family have tried this one.' Chocolate-coated: Food blogger Not Quite Nigella's pimped-up variety features chocolate and macadamia . Yield: 24 biscuits . Preparation time: 5-10 minutes . Baking time: 15 minutes . Total time: 20-25 minutes . Ingredients . 1 cup oats . 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar . 1 cup/125 g/4.4 ozs macadamia nuts, chopped . 3/4 cup plain or all purpose flour . 1/2 cup desiccated coconut . 130g/4.6 ozs butter . 2 tablespoons golden syrup (can also use honey) 1 tablespoon hot water mixed with 1/2 teaspoon bi carbonate of soda . 250g/1/2 pound dark chocolate (optional) Method . 1. Preheat oven to 175°C/375°F. Line two large trays with parchment (you will actually put six biscuits on each tray so you can line four baking trays if you want). Not Quite Nigella's Lorraine prefers crunchy Anzac biscuits . In a medium sized bowl mix the oats, brown sugar, flour, nuts and coconut so that it is evenly distributed. 2. In a small saucepan (or even in the microwave) melt the butter until completely melted. Add the golden syrup and bi-carb and water mix. Whisk to combine and then add this liquid mixture to the dry mixture and stir until everything is moistened. Shape into walnut sized balls with hands and place far apart on the baking sheet as they will spread a lot - I fit six per tray. Bake for 15 minutes. Allow to cool on the tray for five to ten minutes and then place on a cooling rack as they will firm up then. Repeat with rest of the dough. 3. If you are making these with chocolate, melt the chocolate in a double boiler (a heatproof bowl fitted over a saucepan of simmering water ensuring that the bottom of the bowl doesn’t touch the water) or in the microwave on 50 per cent power with 60 second bursts, stirring between bursts. Spread the chocolate over the bottom with an angled spatula and leave bottoms up to set. For more recipes, visit Not Quite Nigella. Sweet: These versions are thinner like brandy snaps .

"Andrea Yates' ex-husband has condemned the criminal process the killer was put through 14 years after she drowned their five children in the bathtub of their suburban Texas home. Russell 'Rusty' Yates, who has since remarried and has a son, slammed his ex-wife's murder trial, claiming it was the 'cruelest thing he had ever witnessed'. He insisted her actions were 'completely a result of her illness' and maintains she was a good mother who loved her children. The mother from Clear Lake, Texas, systematically drowned Noah, 7; John, 5; Paul, 3; Luke 2; and Mary, 6 months, in their home in June 2001. Andrea Yates' ex-husband Rusty (left), who has since remarried and has a five-year-old son, slammed her murder trial (pictured right in 2002) as the 'cruelest thing I have ever witnessed' The Yates' boys, from left: Paul, three, John, five, Noah, seven, and Luke, two, dressed up for Halloween the year before they were drowned in the bathtub by their mother . Six-months-old Mary Yates, killed by her mother along with her four older brothers. Andrea Yates was said to be suffering from postpartum depression when she drowned her children in 2001 . She then called 911 and told the first officer to arrive at the scene that she had just killed her children. Earlier that day she fed the children breakfast and said goodbye to her husband as he left for work. She was convicted of capital murder in 2002 and sentenced to life in prison, after prosecutors tried and failed to get the death penalty. But an appeals court granted her a retrial and in 2006 she was found not guilty by reason of insanity and moved to a mental health facility. Yates had been diagnosed with postpartum psychosis - the most severe and rarest form of postpartum depression. Little was known about it at the time and most afflicted mothers were left to suffer in silence. Her condition was a cause of huge pain for Mr Lake, who has revealed he still cares for his wife and visits her - even though they divorced in 2005. Speaking on Oprah's Where Are They Now, Mr Yates said: 'This [was a] mentally ill woman -- who otherwise loves her children, was a great mother, was a great person -- and they're going to sit her in trial? Try to kill her? The first trial, where prosecutors sought the death penalty, was hard on Mr Yates. The Yates family portrait (before baby Mary was born), left, and husband Russell 'Rusty' Yates outside his home the day after his children were murdered. Almost 14 years after the deaths, he maintains his ex-wife was a good mother who loved her children . Mr Yates married Laura Arnold, a woman he met at a church in Clear Lake, during a private ceremony in 2006, two days before his ex-wife's murder re-trial . He added: ''They spent a week showing pictures of our children's dead bodies in front of a jury, in front of her. 'I mean, from my perspective, that's the cruelest thing... She's somebody that needs love, compassion, support. 'They just take her and put her on public display, with the bodies of my children. It's so wrong.' The former nurse and stay-at-home mom had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and suicide attempts before the horrific incident, when she drowned her children, one by one, in the family bathtub. According to investigators, Yates had to chase the last child, her eldest, Noah, seven, through the family home and drag him into the bathroom. The former high school valedictorian's devastated husband, Rusty, remained married to his wife for four years after their children's deaths and he continues to visit her although they divorced in 2005. He has now remarried and has a five-year-old son. Of his former wife, he said in 2012: 'She is doing well, all things considered. She's been medically stable for five years.' Andrea Yates was first convicted of murder but this was overturned on appeal in 2006. She was found not guilty by reason of insanity and has since been in a psychiatric hospital . During her first trial in 2002, Yates lawyers claimed she believed that the devil was inside her and that by killing her children she would save them from hell. Her attorney George Parnham and his wife, Mary, have campaigned for more awareness of women's mental health issues. Nine years ago, he helped setup the Yates Children Memorial Fund to educate families about postpartum psychosis and similar conditions. One out of 1,000 women are said to experience postpartum psychosis and may hear voices, see things and have thoughts of harming themselves or their baby. Last year, doctors recommended that she be granted permission to attend group outings from the psychiatric hospital where she has been institutionalized since 2006. She is the only patient at Kerrville State Hospital who has never received a group-outing pass, said Parnham. A decision is set to be made on it this year. Mr Yates married Laura Arnold, a woman he met at a church in Clear Lake, during a private ceremony in 2006, two days before his ex-wife's murder re-trial. The pair began dating shortly after his divorce was final. In 2008 his new wife gave birth to a son .

"England could have a separate income tax rate to Scotland under radical new reforms which will be introduced within 100 days of a Tory election victory, David Cameron announced today. The Prime Minister pledged to deliver effective ‘home rule’ for England - giving MPs the same powers to set tax rates which have been agreed for Scotland following last year's independent referendum. Mr Cameron said in the interests of fairness English MPs must be given a veto on legislation that no longer applies in Scotland. Scroll down for video . High on the list: David Cameron and William Hague will today pledge that delivering effective ‘home rule’ for England will be one of their party’s top priorities if re-elected . Under Mr Cameron's plan English, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs being able to set a separate rate of income tax to that in Scotland with MPs north of the border having no say . Mr Cameron said a Conservative government would have the new system in place in time for the first budget of the new parliament in March 2016. It will mean English, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs being able to set a separate rate of income tax to that in Scotland – where the SNP is expected to hold sway after the election – with MPs north of the border having no say. If Wales votes in favour of the Welsh Assembly having income tax powers like those being devolved to Holyrood in a proposed referendum, Welsh MPs would also be excluded. The plan will involve reforming Parliament’s committee stage, where MPs discuss legislation in detail. No Bill or part of a Bill relating only to England would be able to pass to its third reading and become law without being approved in a ‘grand committee’ made up of all English MPs. The plan is likely to trigger a row with Labour, which opposes the idea of an English veto. Mr Cameron helps build an industrial fan during a campaign visit in Colchester in Essex this afternoon . The Prime Minister's visit came as he courted English voters with an election pledge to create a separate rate of income tax for England . The party has traditionally relied on the votes of its army of Scottish MPs at Westminster, which it used to implement tuition fees and foundation hospitals even though they did not apply in Scotland. Labour’s leader in Scotland Jim Murphy yesterday claimed Mr Cameron was ‘cheap’, ‘nasty’ and an ‘election agent’ for the SNP in Scotland. ‘He has given up on the Scottish Tory party and is throwing his lot in with the SNP. David Cameron is the agent and the campaign manager for the SNP,’ Mr Murphy said. But Mr Cameron, speaking Lincoln, said: ‘We do not support English nationalists, we do not want an English Parliament, we are the Conservative and Unionist Party through and through. ‘This manifesto simply recognises that the democratic picture has got more complicated in the UK, so beyond our main manifesto, English voters deserve one document, clarifying in black and white what they can expect. ‘Soon, the Scottish Parliament will be voting to set its own levels of income tax – and rightly so – but that has clear implications. English MPs will be unable to vote on the income tax paid by people in Aberdeen and Edinburgh while Scottish MPs are able to vote on the tax you pay in Birmingham or Canterbury or Leeds. It is simply unfair. And with English votes for English laws we will put it right.’ Former foreign secretary William Hague added: ‘This is not a vague promise to make this change some time in the future, this is a plan ready to be implemented. ‘We will table our proposals within the first hundred days after the general election. And after consultation with the procedure committee of the House of Commons and running a pilot test of the new rules, we will fully implement our plan within the first year of the new Parliament and apply it to the Budget of 2016.’ Other commitments in the Tories 'English manifesto' include a commitment to spend more on the NHS in real terms every year, deliver a ’truly seven-day NHS’ and keep the Cancer Drugs Fund, which pays for expensive treatments on the English NHS. It also promises to give more schools in England freedoms so they are in charge of their own affairs, continue to allow charities, teachers and universities to set up new schools in the state sector, and keep school league tables. Commuter rail fares in England will be frozen for five years, and working parents of three and four-year-olds will get 30 hours a week free childcare. The right to buy will be extended to all housing association tenants in England, and 200,000 new ‘starter homes’ will be offered at 20 per cent below the market price for first-time buyers under 40. Mr Cameron added: ‘My message to people who want these things, who want their own home, more childcare, an NHS protected and their taxes cut, is: there is only one way to guarantee it: vote Conservative on May 7. A vote for anyone else makes an Ed Miliband-SNP Government more likely – which will put all these things at risk. Only a strong Conservative Government will deliver for you and your family.’ One of Ed Miliband’s close allies, former Cabinet minister John Denham, urged the Labour leader to issue an ‘English manifesto’, but the party has not done so.","The Tories publish a separate 'English manifesto' for the first time .
Mr Cameron said delivering 'home rule' for England is a top priority .

"The new Adam Sandler film ran into a huge problem on Wednesday when a group of extras stormed off the set. Native American actors appearing in The Ridiculous 6, a spoof of The Magnificent Seven that stars and was written by Sandler, left the set after they became offended by the script's jokes about their race and culture. It was so bad in fact that even the cultural adviser for the movie, which is filming in New Mexico, walked off the set. Scroll down for video . A dozen Native American extras and the cultural adviser walked off the set of Adam Sandler's (seated above in wig) new movie The Ridiculous 6 on Wednesday . The film stars Sandler (left), Taylor Lautner (right), Nick Nolte and Steve Buscemi . Loren Anthony (above with Nick Nolte in the background) was one of the extras who walked off set . Indian Country Today Media Network spoke to one of the actors who walked off, Navajo Nation tribal member Loren Anthony, about his issues with the script. 'I was asked a long time ago to do some work on this and I wasn't down for it. Then they told me it was going to be a comedy, but it would not be racist,' said Anthony. 'So I agreed to it but on Monday things started getting weird on the set.' Among the many problems he cited were the costumes that were being used, the way the hair was being styled, and the film's treatment of women. 'We were supposed to be Apache, but it was really stereotypical and we did not look Apache at all. We looked more like Comanche,' he explained. 'One thing that really offended a lot of people was that there was a female character called Beaver's breath. One character says ""Hey, Beaver's Breath."" And the Native woman says, ""How did you know my name?'"" In another scene, an Apache woman is seen squatting and urinating while smoking a pipe. As for the dress, the Apache do not wear their hair in braids or chokers while that is common for Comache. Anthony (on right with actor Saginaw Grant) said the film was offensive towards Native American women . Vanilla Ice (above as Mark Twain) with Sandler in the background in red bandanna were back to filming oin Thursday . Anthony said that though the film is about the Apache (traditionl dress on left) extras were dressed more like Comanche (traditional dress on right), with braids and chokers . Making matters worse says Anthony is that no one felt like they were being listened to by the production team. 'They just treated us as if we should just be on the side,' said Anthony. 'When we did speak with the main director, he was trying to say the disrespect was not intentional and this was a comedy.' The cultural adviser meanwhile asked to speak to Sandler according to one extra, but was refused, and when that extra, Goldie Tom, later complained, she was told; 'It's in the script and we are not going to change it.' Tom later said on her Facebook; 'I've had some time to sit and think about everything that's been going on, on the set of this movie The Ridiculous Six. 'Something just didn't feel right, I had a heavy heart while being on set but still tried to make the best of it. But after finding out what was in the script and what some of the movie scences portrayed, a group of us left the set upset and with our hearts pounding due to the disrespect of our Native people. 'It's been an emotional and upsetting time since we left the set but we have stood up for what we think is right and we are going to stand by our decision. Still and always will represent OUR PEOPLE!!!' The film's director Frank Coraci (above) with Sandler on the set . Blake Shelton (above with Whitney Cummings) has a small role in the film . Sandler and his production company Happy Madison have yet to comment, though Netflix, who is producing the movie, did release a statement. 'The movie has ridiculous in the title for a reason: because it is ridiculous,' they said. 'It is a broad satire of Western movies and the stereotypes they popularized, featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of - but in on - the joke.' That cast includes Taylor Lautner, Nick Nolte, Blake Shelton, David Spade and Steve Buscemi, among others. Lautner has said before that he has distant Native American ancestry on his mother's side, specifically Ottawa and Potawatomi. Producer Heather Parry (second from right) shared this photo from set earlier this month with David vSpade, Cummings and Lautner . Steve Buscemi also has a role in the film (above with director Coraci) Other stars in the film include Lavell Crawford (top left), Steve Zahn (top right), Nick Swardson (middle right), Will Forte (bottom left), and Paul Sado (bottom right) David Hill, a 74-year-old Choctaw , did not seem to feel like he was in on the joke as he too left the set. 'They were being disrespectful,' he said. 'They were bringing up those same old arguments that Dan Snyder uses in defending the Redskins. But let me tell you, our dignity is not for sale. It is a real shame because a lot of people probably stay because they need a job.' He then added; 'We understand this is a comedy, we understand this is humor, but we won’t tolerate disrespect. I told the director if he had talked to a native woman the way they were talked to in this movie - I said I would knock his ass out.' 'When I began doing this film, I had an uneasy feeling inside of me and I felt so conflicted,' said Allison Young, a Navajo who studied film at Dartmouth. 'I talked to a former instructor at Dartmouth and he told me to take this as finally experiencing stereotyping first hand. We talked to the producers about our concerns.' Filming also went on Wednesday after the extras walked off, with Coraci even posting a selfie of himself in front of the teepees (above) the Native American extras found so offensive . Young then explained that, just as Anthony said, talking about her concerns with the production team did not work. 'They just told us, ""If you guys are so sensitive, you should leave,'"" she said. 'I was just standing there and got emotional and teary-eyed. I didn’t want to cry but the feeling just came over me. This is supposed to be a comedy that makes you laugh. A film like this should not make someone feel this way.' Despite this, filming seemed to continue on Thursday, with Vanilla Ice, who plays Mark Twain in the film, posting a photo with Sandler in the background. Filming also went on Wednesday after the extras walked off, with director Frank Coraci even posting a selfie of himself in front of the teepees the Native American extras found so offensive. And not all the Native Americans on the set had issues with the script, with Ricardo Caté, a Kewa Pueblo native who also draws satirical cartoons, telling the Sante Fe New Mexican; 'There's nothing worse [in the script] than anything in my cartoons. If anything racial or racist happened I would have walked off. The shoot has been fine, everybody has been happy.'","A dozen Native American extras and the cultural adviser walked off the set of Adam Sandler's new movie on Wednesday .

Paul Guzman of Fairfield, California, the father of 8-year-old Brock Guzman, took video that he claims shows police throwing his wife Suzanne on the ground in handcuffs just moments after they reported their son missing. This after Suzanne refused to let the officers into their home, something Paul claims she was doing for their own safety. Scroll down for videos . Brock Guzman (above with parents Paul and Suzanne) was taken from his home when someone stole the family car from their driveway as he slept inside Monday morning . His parents, Paul and Suzanne, are now filing a formal complaint against police for the way they were treated after they reported the incident, with Suzanne being thrown to the ground handcuffed (above) Shortly before this incident, at around 4:45am on Monday, Paul claims he was getting ready to drive Brock to school when he left the sleeping boy in the car to run inside and grab something. While inside, someone stole the car, and he and his wife immediately called officers. When they arrived on the scene they said Suzanne refused to let them in, and that they thought appeared to be blood inside the home. That is when Suzanne reportedly grew belligerent, and can be heard cursing on their body cams, at which point they restrained her. She can be heard saying at one point; 'I can't breathe! I can't breathe!' Paul told ABC 7 however that his wife was just trying to protect the officers from one of their two dogs in the house, who would have likely attacked them when they came inside. Suzanne (above) was handcuffed and thrown to the ground by officers, something Paul claims he captured in a video . And while police found their son in the car roughly two miles away shortly after, and the young boy read a letter thanking them, Paul is still upset. 'We were treated like criminals,' he said. They have now hired an attorney, but former FBI agent Rick Smith seems to think they may not have a case against police. 'The people being interviewed get a little defensive, which is natural, police are used to that,' he explained. 'But I think there's a little bit of undue sensitivity here on the part of the family.' Meanwhile, police are still trying to determine who took the car with Brock.","Brock Guzman, 8, was taken from his home when someone stole the family car from their driveway as he slept inside Monday morning .

"John Hinckley Jr. has found love. Hinckley, who still spends half of his days institutionalized after being found not guilty by reason of insanity for shooting President Ronald Reagan back in 1981, is said to have met the woman at a National Association for the Mentally Ill meeting. This was revealed by his brother Scott during a hearing to determine if Hinckley should be able to permanently live outside St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington and instead with his mother, where he has resided 17 days out of the month since December 2013. Scroll down for video . John Hinckley Jr. (above) has been dating a woman he met at a National Association for the Mentally Ill meeting . This was revealed by his brother Scott (above) during a hearing to determine if he should be released from the institution he has been at since shooting President Reagan . Hinckley currently splits his time between St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington and his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia (above) Scott went on to describe his brother and his new girlfriend as 'somewhat compatible,' though he admitted he had not met the woman. Hinckley's mother Joan has been introduced to her son's girlfriend reports NBC News. Hinckley shot Reagan and three others, including White House press secretary James Brady, in a bid to impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed. Testimony is expected to wrap up next week to determine if he can move in permanently with his mother, but it could be months before US District Judge Paul Friedman renders a decision. Prosecutor Colleen Kennedy has argued that the provisions suggested for expanded release were inadequate for a would-be presidential assassin. Hinckley also has written to killers Ted Bundy and Charles Manson, and in January he deceived doctors about where he was going when he was away from St. Elizabeths, she said. 'Now is not the time to loosen the reins of the hospital,' she said. Hinckley's mother Joan (above) has been introduced to her son's girlfriend . Hinckley (left) shot Reagan and three others, including White House press secretary James Brady, in a bid to impress actress Jodie Foster in 1981 (right) Initial testimony centered on whether Hinckley's family could bear the financial cost of supporting him and his care. Prosecutors put the cost at $5,000 to $10,000 a month, and said the family would run out of money in one or two years. But his siblings, who both live in Dallas, said the value of their mother's retirement fund and home totaled about $500,000, and vowed to support him financially. During a 2011 hearing, prosecutors argued Hinckley repeatedly engaged in deception when away from the hospital. Secret Service agents saw him browsing books on Reagan and on other presidential assassins in 2011 instead of going to a movie, as he had told doctors he would. Brady died in August at age 73, and a coroner determined the death was attributable to the shooting. Prosecutors declined to press charges.","John Hinckley Jr. has been dating a woman he met at a National Association for the Mentally Ill meeting .

"The ex-king of Spain, Juan Carlos, was leading a double life and having an affair with a German aristocrat for the last ten years of his reign, according to a new book that claims they were 'a couple, pure and simple'. The bombshell allegation is that Juan Carlos was romancing Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein and was so smitten with her that he even contemplated divorcing his wife, Sofia, according to Final De Partida – or End Game – by Ana Romero, which sold out within 24 hours. Romero, a former royal correspondent for the El Mundo daily, said at the book's launch in Madrid: 'What do you see (in the book)? Well, the double life which Juan Carlos led during a long time, a double life which obviously has not gone well.' Scroll down for video . The former King Juan Carlos greets Corinna Sayn-Wittgenstein in at an awards ceremony in Barcelona in May 2006:  A new book claims that they have been lovers for a decade . Glamorous: The aristocrat is 27 years younger than the former Spanish king. Their affair is said to have ended in 2014 . The author's claims are based on 100 interviews with anonymous sources. She said that the affair ended in 2014 when Juan Carlos abdicated in favour of his son, Felipe. He married former Queen Sofia in 1962 and became king in 1975. Romero added: '[Final De Partida]  is a chronicle of the end of an era, when Spaniards turned their backs on Juan Carlos. The first print run of 25,000 copies nearly sold out on Wednesday less than 24 hours since the book hit stores and its publishers have already ordered a second print run. The 77-year-old former king's friendship with Sayn-Wittgenstein, 50, who is divorced from the German prince whose name she bears, emerged in 2012 when Juan Carlos was flown home from Botswana on a private jet after suffering an injury while on an expensive elephant-hunting holiday. Juan Carlos, pictured here with Queen Sofia in May 2014, was said to be so smitten with Sayn-Wittgenstein that he considered a divorce . The German woman, who is 27 years younger than Juan Carlos, was among those accompanying the monarch on the trip, which sparked outrage at a time when Spain was grappling with record unemployment and risked needing an international bailout. Juan Carlos, who won respect for his role in guiding Spain's transition to democracy after the death of longtime dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975, made an unprecedented apology for his behaviour but his popularity took a serious hit. Romero said the uproar over the hunting trip, combined with a string of health problems and a corruption scandal implicating his youngest daughter Cristina, created the 'perfect storm' which pushed Juan Carlos to abdicate. Sayn-Wittgenstein was born a Danish national in 1964 in Frankfurt, Germany to parents Finn Bönning Larsen and Ingrid Sauer. She has been married twice, in 1989 to English businessman Philip Adkins, with whom he had a daughter, and in 2000 to Prince Casimir zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, having ended her first marriage in 1995. She had a son with the prince in 2000, but they divorced in 2005, though she carried on using her married name. Currently residing in Monaco, Sayn-Wittgenstein was asked by the prince of the microstate to help bring in business. She used to be the director of Apollonia Associates, a company that connects 'people, platforms and organisations to create sustainable value'.

"A waterfall gushing over the Harbour Bridge, a man surfing waves in front of the Opera House and a crocodile stalking flood water inside a train station are just a few of the fake photos to emerge from the Sydney storm. Social media users were left scratching their heads over some of the manipulated snaps being shared during New South Wales’ worst storm in a decade, including an image of a family-sized trampoline caught on power lines. While there were many genuine dramatic photos to emerge from the devastating storm, such as torn up roads and floating houses, not all of them were quite what they seemed. A waterfall gushing over Sydney's iconic Harbour Bridge while two people watched on was just one Photoshop photo to come out of New South Wales' worst storm in a decade . In Lewisham, a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, an unlikely visitor was spotted in the flood water at the train station . Eagle-eyed Twitter users pointed out that the large trampoline believed to have blown into the sky in the cyclone-strength gusts in NSW was actually a victim of Hurricane Sandy in Milford, Connecticut, USA. The crocodile at the bottom of the steps in Lewisham station was merely an imaginative prank, as was a reused Photoshop snap of sharks swimming at the bottom of a train station escalator. And the video of a wave rider surfing in front of Sydney’s Opera House was nothing but a hoax – even when it started trending for a second time. The clip was uploaded to Twitter on Tuesday morning by popular Sydney radio duo Fitzy and Wippa, before quickly being reposted by a spell of other sources.

The more unbelievable Photoshop jobs included a photo of Noah’s Ark majestically cruising into Sydney Harbour amidst a grey stormy backdrop and a Bondi house with sand pouring through its doors. The Bondi prank came after sand was blown over the famous beachside suburb’s promenade and skate park in real life photos. In other jaw-dropping pictures, the storm water in Sydney’s CBD had submerged the Opera House and knocked over the giant office blocks on the Harbour’s front while a helicopter rescued a person from the flood. And in a nod to the #umbrellageddon hashtag that emerged on social media as Sydneysiders posted photos of their umbrellas destroyed and abandoned in the gutters, one Reddit user shared a picture of soldiers in The Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, holding up an umbrella instead of the American flag.

"A police officer has been charged with leaking confidential information about the arrest of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins to his reporter girlfriend. Channel 7 Perth news reporter Monique Dirksz got the scoop on Cousins' arrest when she was the only journalist outside Freemantle Police station at 2am on March 12 when he was released on bail. The troubled star was arrested on March 11 over an alleged low-speed chase from Bicton to Mosman Park, in Perth. First Class Constable Daniel Jamieson is said to have been dating Ms Dirksz at the time and is accused of divulging information that gave her a particular advantage, WA Today reports. Scroll down for video . Officer Daniel Jamieson (left) is accused of leaking confidential information about Ben Cousins' arrest in March to his girlfriend Channel 7 Perth news reporter Monique Dirksz . Police investigators became suspicious when Ms Dirksz (right) and her cameraman were the only people outside Freemantle Police station at 2am on March 12 when Cousins (left) was granted bail . Acting Police Commissioner Steve Brown said the policeman allegedly looked up the information on a police computer. The 29-year-old was stood down immediately and has been charged with four counts of disclosing official secrets between March 11 and 17, 2015. At 11:00am on March 12, Ms Dirksz tweeted: ‘Ben Cousins arrested after police pursuit. Charged with Reckless Driving, Fail to Stop and Failure to Provide a Sample of Breath.’ Mr Brown said Ms Dirksz had done nothing wrong but told 6PR Mornings radio Mr Jamieson’s alleged offences were an ‘absolute breach of trust not only for this agency but for the community at large’. Mr Jamieson will appear in Perth Magistrates Court on May 5. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Dirksz for comment. Monique Dirksz got the scoop on Cousins' arrest. Officer Jamieson accused of divulging information that gave her a particular advantage . At 11:00am on March 12, Ms Dirksz tweeted: ‘Ben Cousins arrested after police pursuit. Charged with Reckless Driving, Fail to Stop and Failure to Provide a Sample of Breath.’ Acting Police Commissioner Steve Brown confirmed Ms Dirksz had done nothing wrong . Mr Brown is also concerned about the 112 police officers who had accessed Cousins’ confidential files 300 times in two days, some of whom were working in regional WA. ‘We want to know why they have accessed these records. It's a breach of trust,’ Mr Brown said. Officers also reportedly accessed files containing information about Daniel Kerr, a fellow former West Coast Eagles player, according to The West Australian. The pair both made headlines in recent months, for different incidents. Mr Brown confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an internal investigation is underway relating to access, but would not confirm or make comment about the people whose records had been accessed. Police in Western Australia have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrests of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins (pictured on April 9) 'I can confirm that WA Police are currently investigating accesses, by a large number of police employees, to the records of high profile persons within our internal computer systems,' Commissioner Brown said in a statement. 'The focus of the investigation will be to determine if the accesses were justified having regard to the work role of each officer. This process will take some weeks, if not months, to complete. Allegations will be investigated under Section 440A of the Criminal Code, which states police officers face up to 12 months in prison or a $12,000 fine for unauthorised computer usage. 'The disappointing thing from my view is that the behaviour of these personnel has triggered a series of resource intensive internal investigations which will likely have criminal and/or internal disciplinary outcomes,' Mr Brown said. The disgraced football player (pictured during his career) was arrested three times in two weeks in March, and another warrant was issued for his arrest in April when he failed to front court . Cousins, pictured here in handcuffs arriving at court earlier in April, has a well-documented and public battle with methamphetamine . 'I suspect that the investigation will find that the majority of the accesses will have stemmed from mere curiosity, however this will not be known for sure until we undertake the investigation,' he added. In light of the incident the Acting Commissioner also assured West Australians that their information was safe. 'The community can rest assured that we hold their information in high regard and will conduct investigations into all suspected access breaches of our computer systems.' However the WA Police Union has reacted negatively to the news of an investigation, with president George Tilbury telling The West Australian officers had done nothing wrong. He said they exhibited 'professional curiosity' and added 'there is no suggestion in these cases of any corruption'. Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events . Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth earlier this month . Footage also emerged showing Cousins running through the streets away from police . Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events. Cousins was reportedly arrested compulsively taking photos of a Sikh temple before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. On April 8, when Cousins failed to front court on the driving charges a warrant for his arrest was issued. The next day the Perth-based former AFL star surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station.

"Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, a former minister and the late Muammar Gaddafi's cousin . The most senior member of the Gaddafi clan has laid the blame of the migrant shipwreck that killed about 950 people on the western countries which helped overthrow Colonel Gaddafi. Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, a former minister and Muammar Gaddafi's cousin, said the 'overwhelming chaos' in Libya 'has become a shame that will haunt the countries that had participated in the destruction of the Libyan armed forces in 2011'. But senior Conservative minister William Hague has defended the government's role in helping to overthrow the dictator, who was well-known for his barbaric treatment of the would-be migrants. About 800 people are believed to have died when a fishing boat carrying migrants overturned off Libyan waters, south of the Italian island of Lampedusa, shortly after midnight on Sunday. And Gaddafi's cousin, who was one of several high-profile regime figures who fled to Egypt during the 2011 revolution, believes the only solution for stability in the Mediterranean is to bring back those who surrounded the country's despotic former ruler in government. Mr Gaddaf al-Dam, whose supporters claim could be Libya's next president, said western countries have shed 'the tears of crocodiles over democracy and human rights'. 'The missiles of NATO have installed the gangsters instead of the regime,' he said. 'I express my astonishment. How have super power countries, members of the Security Council, been incapable of realising that they are committing such a crime and not foreseeing the consequences? 'What happened in Libya, Syria and Iraq may extend everywhere... and will burn all the fingers that have participated in it.' Scroll down for video . Former dictator: Western countries helped overthrow Muammar Gaddafi (pictured) and his cousin claims they are to blame for the Mediterranean Sea disaster . Family: Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, pictured here with his cousin Muammar Gaddafi's, blames the migrant shipwreck that killed about 950 people on the West . Local residents and rescue workers help a woman after a boat carrying migrants sank off the island of Rhodes, southeastern Greece . He described the situation in Libya since the fall of his cousin as a 'continuing tragedy'. Mr Gaddaf al-Dam claimed a third of the population had been displaced, men and women had been imprisoned and are subjected to torture, and towns are cities are bombed. But Mr Hague said it would be wrong to think that whatever has happened in Libya in the last few years is the cause of this'. He added on BBC Radio 5 live: 'Let me remind you of something as well, which is that when Colonel Gaddafi was still in power, there were periods when he simply allowed people to do exactly this, to get into boats and try to go to Europe – that was one of the ways in which he put pressure on Europe.' Colonel Gaddafi's 42-year-rule, which ended in 2011, was characterised by tyranny. He murdered political opponents and dissidents, and replaced law with his 'Green Book' of rambling political philosophy, taught in all Libyan schools. He saw himself as the leader of the Third World and used Libya's vast oil wealth to sponsor terror, shipping Semtex to the IRA and sending agents to bring down a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie in Scotland. A migrant carries a baby as they disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Chimera in the harbor of Salerno, Italy today . Tragedy: Infrared images released by the coast guard show the rescue operation after the migrant ship capsized . By the 1990s he had become a pariah, but was rehabilitated in 2004 under the British Labour government with the despot signing an £120million gas contract for Shell with Tony Blair. The Lockerbie bomber was allowed to return to Libya from a UK prison and Gaddafi intelligence officers were even allowed to operate in Britain. He held out for eight months during the Libyan revolutions of 2011, but was eventually found hiding in a drain, dragged out by rebels, beaten and executed. Experts have drawn links between the massive rise in would-be migrants and Colonel Gaddafi - whose people were forced to call him the Guide' - but not for the reasons his cousin insists. The so-called 'deal in the desert' struck by  Tony Blair in 2004 involved the dictator agreeing to crack down on human traffickers as well as renouncing Libya's possession of weapons of mass destruction and decommissioning the country's chemical and nuclear weapons programs. In 2008 Colonel Gaddafi sought to stiff the European Union for £4.1billion a year in return for halting the flows of migrants in and out of Libya. Migrants stand on board Italian Navy ship Chimera before disembarking in the southern harbour of Salerno today . Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing Libya as extremists take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country . In October 2010, the EU paid Libya more than £30million to stop African migrants passing into Europe. The Libyan ruler's barbaric treatment of the would-be migrants was widely condemned. It was claimed his officials would round up the migrants and hold them for months or even years in horrendously overcrowded detention centres, where rape, violence and torture were common. The migrants would then typically be deported to Libya's southern border crossing with Sudan - where they were abandoned in a harsh desert environment - or otherwise flown back to their country of origin without any checks on what they would be facing back home. As Blair's much touted 'deal in the desert' turned sour, Gaddafi gave people smugglers in Zuwara the green light to resume their trade and the migrant routes have flourished ever since. But Mr Gaddaf al-Dam said the only way to bring stability back to the country is to bring back the Gaddafis. 'Libya has become like a sick body stricken by viruses,' he said. 'The human trafficking is but one such virus. Such chaotic environment is what created this phenomenon and others.' He also accused the Libyan government of being in league with the criminal gangs. The so-called 'deal in the desert' struck by Tony Blair in 2004 involved the dictator agreeing to crack down on human traffickers . 'Libya now is ruled by extreme criminal gangsters… in alliance with all the world's devils: from drug dealers, human traffickers, exploiters of religion, arms traders, and international mafias. 'IS (ISIS) collaborate with the traffickers by wreaking chaos in Libya in exchange for financial benefits.' 'There is an exchange of financial, political and military interests that Daesh (ISIS) benefit from so as to disrupt the scene and intimidate their enemies and extort them, in fact even make a mockery out of their weakness.' Continuing to worship his late-cousin's legacy, he added: 'He dedicated billions for investment in building schools and hospitals. 'He allowed millions of Africans to work and reside in Libya without any restrictions. He provided free oil on many occasions in order to support neighbouring countries.' Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing Libya as extremists  take advantage of the political chaos currently engulfing the country. With ISIS having established strongholds in the towns on Sirte and Derna, and with smaller bases elsewhere in the country, fear of capture and execution at the hands of the radical Islamists is driving the desperate migrants to leave Libya as quickly as they can, dangerously overloading vessels. As well as the spread of ISIS in the country, Libya is currently in a state of civil war - with two rival governments controlling and operating in different areas of the country. People smugglers are taking advantage of the subsequent chaos and confusion tearing the country apart to ply their trade with little to no threat of being caught. Refugee route: Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing Libya as extremists take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country . New ground: ISIS has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya (pictured) while building a terrifying support structure in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria . Mr Gaddaf al-Dam added: 'The coming period requires a strong government that has experience in controlling this chaos: a government supported by the Libyan army and police in order for Libya to reach the shores of safety. 'Libya will not stabilise except with the actual participation of the previous regime supporters.' He claims the Gaddafi supporters number two million and are not a party but said it is made up of several major tribes with the support of the Libyan army and police. 'They are the key for a solution, for peace and stability in Libya,' he said. 'They are the political experts, the military personal, the lawyers, the university professors, and the major tribal-leaders. ' Mr Gaddaf al-Dam called for a conference that includes all parties, including ISIS and the Gaddafis. In his last interview with a Western newspaper Colonel Gaddafi accurately predicted a future without him. He told Il Giornale: 'The Mediterranean will become a sea of chaos. The Africans will move en masse towards Europe.' Earlier this year, Mr Gaddaf al-Dam professed that 'not less than half a million' migrants will set sail from Libya to European shores this year. Among them, he claimed, are thousands of terrorists, who will soon be running amok in Europe culminating in a terror strike on the same scale as the September 11 attacks.","Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam says the West is to blame for the 'chaos' in Libya .

"A cancer survivor who had to have part of his mouth removed after a tumour stopped him from swallowing has been given a new tongue made out of part of his arm. David Billing, 48, has told how he had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital, during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue. Medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from Mr Billing's arm. The only drawback is that it still has hairs on it, and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved. David Billing, 48, had to have part of his tongue removed after being diagnosed with mouth cancer, so doctors made him a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it . The dramatic story began after Mr Billing, a part-time welder, went to his GP in October 2013 after being unable to swallow. After a second doctor's appointment, he was referred to Royal Derby where specialists discovered an ulcer on the right-hand side of his tongue and confirmed it was cancer after a biopsy. He said: 'Being told I had cancer was mind-blowing and a real low point for me. I had no idea when they found this ulcer in my mouth that this was what it would be.' It was a double-blow for Mr Billing, as he had been made redundant just a week before from his job at digger manufacturer JCB. He said: 'It was all so overwhelming. My life and everything was ticking along nicely and the next thing I knew I'd lost my job and needed to have a major operation.' David had the procedure to remove the lump and rebuild his tongue on November 13, 2013. He said: 'I had to have a stomach tube fitted first and then go through the main procedure. Mr Billing was forced to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital (pictured), with surgeons sawing between two teeth and through his jaw to get to the tumour . 'They had to cut through the jawbone and get my face wide open to get to the ulcer then they had to remove some lymph nodes in my neck too, just to be safe in case the cancer had spread.' David spent nine days in hospital after his operation, returning now only for check-ups and once for the smaller procedure to reshape his tongue. He said: 'Usually, people have to go on chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the operation and, during this, the skin tissue used to rebuild the tongue shrinks in size. 'Because I didn't need either, it meant I later needed this smaller operation to have the bit of skin trimmed. 'My tongue's absolutely fine. I had to have speech therapy after the procedure but it's not had any long term impact on my speech or my eating or drinking.' David continued to use a feeding tube and relied on liquid foods until his first proper meal on Christmas Day 2013. And, in another fortunate turn of events, he was offered his old job a JCB back in March 2014. He added: 'JCB actually took me back having originally laid me off because of a lack of work. Mr Billing, who is now preparing to run the London Marathon to raise money for Cancer Research, says his speech is back to normal - though he does have to go to hospital to have his tongue shaved . 'It was the best feeling in the world when, two weeks after coming through the operation, the consultant told me the cancer was completely removed and I didn't even need radiotherapy or chemotherapy.' Now David is preparing to run the London Marathon and is hoping to raise more than £3,000 for cancer research. He said: 'I was not fit or well at all when I was watching the London Marathon last year but I thought how much I'd love to do it. 'I've never done anything like it before so, when I started feeling better, I decided to start training and now I'm about to take part in this experience of a lifetime. 'If I can get over the finish line, whatever time I do it in, it will be absolutely brilliant.'","David Billing, 48, diagnosed with cancer after being left unable to swallow .

"Cad: Poet Rupert Brooke had a string of short-lived relationships with various women before he died aged 27 in April 1915 . Poet Rupert Brooke has long had a reputation as a 'young Apollo', a symbol of innocent youth who was cut down in his prime during the senseless slaughter of the First World War. But a new haul of previously unseen letters show that he was in fact a slightly caddish womaniser who had a string of affairs without ever settling down. The documents, brought to light for the first time thanks to a £430,000 grant, show Brooke's lovers complaining about his refusal to take their relationships seriously. The letters are part of the John Schroder collection, which has spent decades in private hands but will now be available to the public after being bought by King's College, Cambridge, where the poet was a student. Brooke, who died 100 years ago today at the age of just 27, became a semi-legendary figure thanks to his early death and his popular poems such as The Soldier. His obituary was written by Winston Churchill, who called him 'all that one would wish England's noblest sons to be'. However, the letters in the Schroder collection - including 170 documents written by Brooke himself - show a somewhat different side to the great poet. King's archivist Patricia McGuire said that Brooke was 'promiscuous even for a man of his time' and carried on relationships with multiple girlfriends. 'Several women thought he was going to marry them - he may have thought that he was going to,' Dr McGuire told The Times. 'I think he was happy to spend a lot of time with as many women as he could.' Among the lovers whose affairs with Brooke are featured in the letters are Hollywood star Cathleen Nesbitt, artist Phyllis Gardner, and Laurence Olivier's cousin Noël. Lovers: Cathleen Nesbitt, left, and Phyllis Gardner, right, are among the women who had affairs with Brooke . Popular: Brooke became one of Britain's best-loved poets after his premature death . Nesbitt wrote to Eddie Marsh, Brooke's biographer, saying: 'I've no intention of marrying anybody for years to come - nor, I hope, has Rupert - though I shouldn't be in the least surprised if he settled in the wild with a squaw and a wigwam.' In another letter, she described the poet's care-free attitude in the face of the danger he submitted himself to in the war. Nesbitt wrote: 'When I talked of all things coming to an end he would always laugh and say, ""Hush - there's never any end when things are perfect.""' This is not the first time that Brooke's reputation has taken a battering - previously discovered letters have shown him expressing unpalatable views on Jews and homosexuals. And this year a book about his affair with Phyllis Gardner revealed that he opposed the women's rights movements and privately said that 'all women are beasts'. The pair bathed naked together near Grantchester, the village outside Cambridge where Brooke lived in the Old Vicarage, now home to Jeffrey Archer. Trove: Peter Jones of King's College, Cambridge with a haul of letters which the college has now bought thanks to a £430,000 grant . Home: The Old Vicarage in Grantchester, Cambridgeshire, where Brooke once lived . If I should die, think only this of me: . That there's some corner of a foreign field . That is forever England. There shall be . In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; . A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, . Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam, . A body of England's, breathing English air, . Washed by the rivers, blest by the suns of home. And think, this heart, all evil shed away, . A pulse in the eternal mind, no less . Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; . Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; . And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, . In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. Despite the recent revelations, Brooke has retained his image as a 'young Apollo' cut down in his prime, whose poems encapsulate typically English scenes. His poem The Soldier, featuring the line 'there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England', was immensely popular during the First World War, and made even more poignant when Brooke himself died while on active service on April 23, 1915. Churchill wrote in his obituary, published in The Times: 'He was all that one would wish England's noblest sons to be in the days when no sacrifice but the most precious is acceptable, and the most precious is that which is most freely proffered.' Peter Jones, the librarian at King's, said: 'It is hard to realise today just how significant Brooke's impact was 100 years ago. 'In the early 20th century as a poet you were fortunate to sell 200-300 copies of your work. Just after his death, Brooke's close friend and patron Eddie Marsh published 1914 and Other Poems. 'The first edition of 1,000 sold out immediately and, in all, 160,000 copies were sold of various impressions.' He added: 'We now know much more about Brooke as a person and he is certainly more interesting and, in some ways more difficult, than the heroic image portrayed at the time of his death. 'He was a conflicted individual. He had a major breakdown in 1912 and had disastrous relationships with the women who loved him.' One of the letters now made available reveals how Brooke's mother Mary Ruth sought to avoid turning her son into an icon, and also intervened to stop Marsh inserting details of his more sordid relationships. Lorna Beckett, chairman of the Rupert Brooke Society, said: 'He was an interesting, complex and likeable person who is still suffering from the hostile backlash brought about by the ""young Apollo"" myth created straight after his death.'","The poet has a reputation as a 'young Apollo' who died tragically young .

"An assistant school principal in Texas has received a lenient sentence after admitting to sneaking off with an 18-year-old student during a prom event in 2012 and having sex with the girl in his office. Light sentence: Mark West, 32, will serve four months prison and eight years probation for having sex with a student in 2012 . Mark Steven West, 32, who is married with a child, was sentenced Tuesday to four months in jail followed by eight years probation after pleading guilty to the improper relationship while working at Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He had previously said the girl instigated the moment, seducing him by saying she was 'feeling horny'. The girl admitted as such to police also, telling them  she encouraged West to have sex. But despite the light punishment, the judge was scathing in handing down her punishment, saying that just three weeks after the incident the girl  graduated, which would have made their encounter legal. 'You did it because you enjoyed the attention of young girls,' State District Judge Catherine Evans said, according to The Chron. 'We're talking about a razor thin margin of three weeks between what separates a felony crime from a poor decision to have an inappropriate extramarital affair.' State law prohibits educators having sex with students. West apologized to the court, saying he made 'bad decisions made on impulses' and was being 'selfish'. School officials were first tipped off to the allegations after hearing rumors and seeing inappropriate interactions between West and certain students at the school on separate occasions, according to court documents. He tickled one girl, lifted up another, and was accused of making inappropriate comments to two others. West was interviewed by a senior staff member at Spring High School in Texas in December 2012 after administrators heard that he made a sexual remark about one female student and possibly had sex with another. He was also investigated in the 2011-2012 school year for inappropriately touching a female student on her lower back. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence but he was ordered not to have any contact with female students. One staff member said she was extremely uncomfortable by the number of lengthy 'closed door meetings' West was having with female students. The staff member said she observed students leaving his office, smiling and laughing, with their clothes and hair disheveled. Scene: West has resigned from his post as assistant principal at Spring High School, Texas, after the incident became public. He eventually pleaded guilty and no longer works as a teacher . She also saw West 'body slam' a female student, in a playful manner, on a couch in the lobby office. Students told investigators about rumors that West had sex with a student at the 2012 Project Prom event. The woman, who is now at college, told investigators she seduced West. She told investigators that she came on to West first and that he initially refused her advances, according to court documents. She said she started to flirt and talk with West, allegedly telling him that she 'was horny and wanted to have sex with him'. The woman said she continued her advances until he agreed to meet her in his upstairs office. Once alone, the two of them began to kiss and then had sex, investigators said. West denied having sex with the student, but authorities felt they had enough evidence to file charges. He was placed on administrative leave and then resigned. While he maintained his innocent for some time, West finally admitted what he had done and pleaded guilty. Spring High School Principal Donna Ullrich issued a statement to parents, writing at the time of West's arrest: 'I want to assure you that the safety of our students is of the highest importance at Spring High School. 'The criminal history and references of job applicants are routinely checked before they are hired. 'The administration at Spring High School takes every allegation seriously and will conduct a thorough investigation and expose inappropriate behavior when necessary.' West's wife testified at his hearing that he is still not working as a teacher. The prosecution had pushed for a much higher sentence, reiterating that he was not just a teacher, but a principal. West does not have to register as a sex offender.","Mark West, 32, was sentenced Tuesday to four months jail and eight years probation for having sex once with a student, 18, during 2012 prom event .

"The former SS officer known as the Bookkeeper of Auschwitz has said he believed Jews were the ‘enemy’. Oskar Groening added that it was ‘unimaginable’ to him that Jewish inmates would leave the camp alive. 'I couldn't imagine that' happening, former SS Sgt. Oskar Groening told the Lueneburg state court on Thursday during the third day of his trial. He is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder. Scroll down for videos . SS Sgt. Oskar Groening told the Lueneburg state court on Thursday during the third day of his trial that he did not expect Jews at Auschwitz to make it out alive . The 93-year-old's answer came in response to a question from attorneys representing Auschwitz survivors who have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs on the third day of his trial . Groening, who worked for an insurance company after the war, has testified as a witness in other Nazi trials .

Groening told the court on Tuesday that he is 'morally guilty' but not directly responsible for any deaths .

Recovery: Miriam and Eva Kor as shown in a 1949 photo. Eva Kor and her twin sister Miriam were among the 1,500 twins (amounting to 3,000 children) Dr. Josef Mengele experimented on in Auschwitz . The 93-year-old's answer came in response to a question from attorneys representing Auschwitz survivors who have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs, the dpa news agency reported. On Wednesday Groening described how so many Jews were brought to the Auschwitz death camp at once that he was put on a 24-hour shift guarding the ramp where they disembarked from the trains. He told in chilling detail how cattle cars full of Jews were brought to the Auschwitz death camp, the people stripped of their belongings and then most led directly into gas chambers. Groenings charge is related to a period between May and July 1944 when around 425,000 Jews from Hungary were brought to the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex in Nazi-occupied Poland and most immediately gassed to death. During that period, so many trains were arriving that often two would have to wait with closed doors as the first was 'processed,' Groening testified at the Lueneburg state court. Though he was more regularly assigned to the camp's Auschwitz I section, he said he guarded the Birkenau ramp three times, including one busy 24-hour shift. The main gas chambers were located at Birkenau. 'The capacity of the gas chambers and the capacity of the crematoria were quite limited. Someone said that 5,000 people were processed in 24 hours but I didn't verify this. I didn't know,' he said. 'For the sake of order we waited until train 1 was entirely processed and finished.' Auschwitz survivors describe their arrival as chaotic, with Nazi guards yelling orders, dogs barking and families being ripped apart. But Groening maintained the opposite, saying 'it was very orderly and not as strenuous' on the ramp at Birkenau. 'The process was the same as Auschwitz I. The only difference was that there were no trucks,' he said during the second day of his trial. 'They all walked - some in one direction some, in another direction... to where the crematoria and gas chambers were.' Survivor Kor asked Groening whether he knew details about files kept at the camp in hopes of learning more about what diseases she and her sister, who both survived, were injected with . Survivors from Auschwitz (pictured), who are plaintiffs in the case, travelled from the United States, Canada, Hungary and elsewhere to attend Groening's trial . Between May 16 and July 11, 1944, Groening was on duty when 450,000 Hungarian Jews were transported there, with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival. Pictured, Auschwitz survivors . No pleas are entered in the German system and Groening said as his trial opened Tuesday that he considers himself 'morally guilty,' but it was up to the court to decide if he was legally guilty. He faces between three and 15 years in prison if convicted in the trial, which is scheduled through July. Eva Kor, 81, was one of the Jews who arrived at Auschwitz in 1944. Though she doesn't remember Groening personally, she said she can't forget the scene. 'Everything was going very fast. Yelling, crying, pushing; even dogs were barking. I had never experienced anything that fast or that crazy in my entire life,' she told The Associated Press before addressing the court. Her two older sisters and parents were taken directly to the gas chambers, while she and her twin sister, both 10 at the time, were ripped away from their mother to be used as human guinea pigs for notorious  Dr. Josef Mengele's experiments. 'All I remember is her arms stretched out in despair as she was pulled away,' Kor remembered. 'I never even got to say goodbye.' Kor, who now lives in Indiana, is one of more than 60 Auschwitz survivors and their families from the U.S., Canada, Israel and elsewhere who have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.

Groening sits opposite Auschwitz survivors Hedy Bohm (left) and Eva Pusztai-Fahidi (right) at the court room in Lueneburg . General view of the cout before the start of the trial against  Groening . Thomas Walther, who represents many co-plaintiffs, said he and his clients were happy Groening agreed to testify, but suspected he was withholding many details. 'There is an ocean of truth, but with many islands of lies,' he said. Kor, the first co-plaintiff to address the court, described her experience Wednesday and asked Groening whether he knew Mengele or details about files he kept in hopes of learning more about what diseases she and her sister, who both survived the camp, were injected with. Groening showed no reaction to Kor's statement and his attorney, Hans Holtermann, said his client would try to answer what questions he could, but he didn't believe that Groening knew Mengele. Groening guarded prisoners' baggage on the ramps, but his main task was to collect and tally money stolen from the new arrivals and then send it to Berlin - a job for which the German press has dubbed him the 'Accountant of Auschwitz.' While he previously testified he was 'horrified' by individual atrocities he witnessed, he suggested Wednesday his daily thoughts were more pedestrian, like when the guards heard a train loaded with Hungarian Jews would be arriving. 'If this is Hungary, they have bacon on board,' he remembered thinking. Though he was investigated twice before and no charges were brought, Groening was indicted under a new line of German legal reasoning that anyone who helped a death camp function can be accused of being an accessory to murder without evidence of participation in a specific crime. Groening, who worked for an insurance company after the war, has testified as a witness in other Nazi trials. Outside court, Kor said she wished Groening would use the trial to try and dissuade 'misguided young people' today from becoming neo-Nazis but she was still satisfied with his testimony. 'I'm going to take whatever confession he gives - it's better than no confession,' she told reporters. 'Maybe this is the best thing he has ever done in his life. Isn't that sad?'","Oskar Groening is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder .

"Harrowing images reveal one of west-Africa's vast electronic graveyards where 'millions of tonnes' of discarded appliances from all over the world - including the UK - are being dumped every year. Thousands of broken televisions, computers, microwaves and refrigerators are being illegally exported to African countries and dumped gigantic landfills like Agbogbloshie in Ghana because it costs less than recycling them in their countries of origin, campaigners claim. 41 million tonnes of 'e-waste' worth over £34billion were discarded globally in 2014, according to a shocking report by United Nations University who claim only 6 million tonnes of that was recycled properly. Scroll down for video . Polluted: 'Millions of tonnes' of the world's e-waste ends up in Africa where it is dumped in landfills like Agbogbloshie (pictured) in Ghana's capital Accra . Damaging: The mountains of 'e-waste' that builds up in landfill sites such as Agbogbloshie (pictured) pollutes the local water and harms the health of the scavengers whose livelihoods depend on these broken goods . Broken: Defunct televisions, computers and keyboards (pictured) are transported to west-African countries like Ghana  because 'it is cheaper than recycling it properly in European Union nations' Relic: The whole of the African continent produced only 1.9 metric tonnes of waste and yet 'millions of tonnes' of broken products (pictured) end up there . Dangerous: Young men sift through the mountains of scraps in landfills like Agbogbloshie (pictured), hoping to find something worth selling in local markets . Defunct: Shipping broken or unusable equipment (pictured) to Africa is illegal under the Basel convention, according to the Head of United Nations University (UNU) Pollution: Brokers manage to ship containers of illegal e-waste (pictured) to the continent by fraudulently categorising it as 'reusable' Toxic: Old fridges (pictured) that now reside in filthy landfill sites such as Agbogbloshie contain chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which damage the ozone layer . The UK contributed  1.5 million tonnes of waste to the staggering 11.6  Europe generated last year - putting it behind only Germany as the continent's greatest contributor. That dwarfs the 1.9 million tonnes produced by the whole of Africa and yet the continent's western nations have become a dumping ground for the world's defunct products. Some of the appliances even leak toxic elements such as lead and mercury which harms the environment and the young men who trawl through the broken goods hoping to find something worth selling. The shocking images taken by e-waste campaigners QAMP reveal how countless household appliances have contaminated what was once the 'pastoral landscape' of Agbogbloshie in Accra. 'Developed countries export millions of tonnes of electronic waste annually into developing countries such as Ghana,' the group based in the country claims on its website. Photographs show young boys trawling through the western world's scraps, dismantling old stereos and burning components to recover scrap metal - which they will sell for small amounts of money. Transporting broken or expired electronics to Africa is illegal but brokers exploit a loophole by fraudulently labelling the items as reusable, according to the Head of United Nations University who believes Africa is becoming 'a graveyard for e-waste'. When massive containers arrive in Ghana and Nigeria, they are trucked to remote locations where the locals can buy the products directly without testing them to later sell in markets, Dr Ruediger Kuehr told MailOnline . He believes legal shipments can help close the digital divide between Africa and the west but said: 'If it turns out that this equipment arriving in Africa is no longer of use, there is no longer a market existing or that they are getting real waste… then we are having a real issue.' Aid: UNU believes legal shipments of electronic appliances can help people in Africa who burn components (pictured) to extract scrap metal which they can sell . Broken: But the head of the organisation Dr Ruediger Kuehr told MailOnline that most of the material being shipped to Africa 'is nothing more than junk' Useless: 1.8 million tonnes of 'large equipment' including washing machines (pictured in Agbogbloshie), clothes dryers, dishwashers and electric stoves was discarded world wide in 2014 . Profit: Locals in Ghana's capital Accra intercept trucks carrying the discarded products and buy the products without testing them - to later sell them in the city's market (pictured) Target: West African nations like Ghana are  inundated with the world's waste because the continent's eastern and southern countries are implementing measures to prevent the dumping of e-waste (pictured) Victim: Ghana produced only 38,000 metric tonnes of e-waste in 2014 compared to the UK's 1.5 million but its landfills have become a graveyard for the world's useless microchips, light bulbs and motherboards (pictured) Inexpensive: Even old wiring is dumped in Agbogbloshie (pictured) because it is cheaper to ship them to Africa than it is to recycle it in European Union nations . This sometimes-illegal and environmentally damaging practice plaguing Ghana is driven by cheap dumping prices in comparison to the cost of recycling in the countries where it comes from. Dr Ruediger Kuehr said: 'These shipments are taking place and increasingly so. The reasoning behind it is quite simple - economic and financial. 'Recycling in the European Union and the UK costs money. So if a broker successfully collects enough material and sends it to Africa, it could be in their interest because in people in Africa are still paying for this.' The 'recycling' of e-waste in Agbogbloshie is a dangerous business which often involves burning it in unmonitored landfill sites, according to UNU. The waste discarded in 2014 contained around 300 tonnes of gold, 16 million tonnes of iron and nearly two million tonnes of copper as well as significant amounts of silver, aluminium and palladium. And alarmingly, it also contained 'substantial amounts' of life-threatening toxic material like mercury and cadmium which can cause organ failure and severe mental impairment if they pollute the local water supply. In the deadly fields of Agbogbloshie, photographer Yepoka Yeebo has seen young men braving toxic fumes and explosive appliances in what she deems 'the chaotic heart of one of west Africa's biggest economies'. She has witnessed boys as young as 14 trawling barefoot through acres of what could be deadly waste material which may cause them irreparable harm. Yepoka adds: 'The electronic waste leaks lead, mercury, arsenic, zinc and flame-retardants. They've been found in toxic concentrations in the air, water, and even on the fruits and vegetables at the wholesale market.'

UNU's research discovered the majority of e-waste, nearly 60 per cent, consisted of large and small domestic appliances rather than discarded electronics like mobile phones and computers. It included a gigantic 12.8 megatons of small items such as microwaves and toasters and 18.8 megatons of 'white goods' such as fridges, washing machines, dryers and other larger appliances. The UK was identified as one of the world's largest generators of e-waste and ranked fifth in the world in terms of material discarded per person, with each Briton producing 23.5kg every year. It also produced the sixth most e-waste overall and its 1.5 megatons of waste was only 100,000 tonnes less than India which has 20 times the population. The UNU report said that only one-third of e-waste in the UK is recycled through recognised schemes, a figure that must reach 85 per cent by 2019 under European Union rules. According to the Independent, UNU researcher Federico Magalini said: 'In the UK we are seeing that the 'lifespan' of an electric or electronic product may be particularly short. 'We should not simply try to stop consumption to minimise the amount of waste being generated, but should instead make sure that it is properly collected and recycled. There is an opportunity to create jobs and extract those resources currently being discarded.' Health: The toxins leaking from discarded appliances in Accra's Agbogbloshie landfill could be causing irreparable harm to the young men (pictured) who scavenge through the site . Decay: Despite millions of tonnes of e-waste and appliances making its way to Africa, much of it cannot be sold and is left to rot in the huge landfills . Desperate: Local Ghanaian's sift through mounds of old chargers in the hope that some of the still work and can be sold at market . The weight of last year's e-waste is comparable to over 1.1 million 18-wheel trucks - enough to form a line from New York to Tokyo and back. And yet less than one-sixth of last year's e-waste is thought to have been diverted to proper recycling and reuse. While the US and China produce almost a third of the world's combined e-waste, the top producers per-capita are the wealthy nations of northern and western Europe - the top five being Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Denmark, and the UK. The escalating global e-waste problem is driven by the rising sales and shortening life cycles of electrical and electronic equipment, according UN Under-Secretary-General and Rector of UNU. David Malone said: 'Worldwide, e-waste constitutes a valuable 'urban mine' - a large potential reservoir of recyclable materials. At the same time, the hazardous content of e-waste constitutes a toxic mine' that must be managed with extreme care.'","New report says 41 million metric tonnes of electronic waste worth a staggering £34billion was discarded in 2014 .

"A Los Angeles judge agreed with the governor's decision to reject parole for a Charles Manson follower imprisoned 43 years for two brutal murders. Bruce Davis' record shows there is 'some evidence' he is dangerous and shouldn't be freed, Superior Court Judge William C. Ryan wrote in a decision filed Wednesday. Davis, 72, was convicted in the 1969 slayings of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea and sentenced to life in prison in 1972. He was 30 years old at the time. Then and now: Bruce Davis, Charles Manson's former follower (pictured left in 1970 and right in March 2014), has been denied parole after spending 43 years in prison for a double homicide in 1969 . Bloodthirsty: Bruce Davis held Gary Hinman, a friend, at gunpoint while Charles Manson (pictured) sliced his face open with a sword . Davis, who once bragged of cutting Shea's head off, claimed he has turned his life around in prison, earning a doctoral degree in philosophy, becoming religious and ministering to other inmates. He also married a woman he met through the prison ministry, and has a grown daughter. The couple recently divorced. The parole board cited those accomplishments, along with his age and good behavior as reasons to grant him parole in March last year. Gov. Jerry Brown rejected that decision in August, saying factors in his favor were outweighed by the brutality of the killings and Davis' lack of insight into the crimes, which he didn't admit until 2012 after claiming for years to be an innocent bystander. The Manson family planned to rob Hinman, a friend, but killed him after holding him two days because he said he didn't have money. Davis held Hinman at gunpoint while Manson sliced his face open with a sword. About a month later, Davis stabbed Shea, who worked at Spahn Ranch where the family lived. His body was found buried on the property years later. Homicidal maniac: Charles Manson, pictured left in 2011, orchestrated the murders of eight people in 1969, including actress Sharon Tate (right). Davis did not play a part in her slaying . 'Both victims were abused, defiled and mutilated,' Ryan wrote. 'These actions demonstrate the utmost callous disregard for human suffering.' The judge said he gave broad deference to Brown's discretion and that the governor's decision in August didn't amount to cruel or unusual punishment. Davis' lawyer had not seen the decision, but said he would appeal to a higher court. 'I'm stunned. I can't believe he would do that,' attorney Michael Evan Beckman said. 'The judge is wrong.'

"German banking giant Deutsche Bank will pay $2.5 billion in fines for its role in a vast multi-year conspiracy to rig LIBOR interest rates, US and British authorities said on Thursday. 'Deutsche Bank secretly conspired with its competitors to rig the benchmark interest rates at the heart of the global financial system,' said US Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer. 'Deutsche Bank's misconduct not only harmed its unsuspecting counterparties, it undermined the integrity and the competitiveness of financial markets everywhere.' German banking giant Deutsche Bank will pay $2.5 billion in fines for its role in a vast multi-year conspiracy to rig LIBOR interest rates, US and British authorities said on Thursday . The case centers on charges that Deutsche Bank derivatives traders manipulated the London InterBank Offered Rate, used to peg millions of interest rate-sensitive contracts and loans around the world, from at least 2003-2011 to boost their trading positions. Under the deferred prosecution agreement,  Deutsche Bank agreed to plead guilty to a US charge of wire fraud, a criminal offense, in connection with the scam and admitted participating in price-fixing conspiracy with other banks. Deutsche Bank employees defrauded counterparties in emails, telephone calls and electronic chats, the US said. The $2.5 billion fine is a record for interest-rate manipulation. The largest German bank will pay $775 million in penalties to the Justice Department, $800 million to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $600 million to the New York Department of Financial Services and $344 million to Britain's Financial Conduct Authority. The settlement agreement allows Deutsche Bank to keep its operating license in the United States. The Justice Department said the penalty reflected that Deutsche Bank's cooperation with the probe 'was often helpful but also fell short in some important respects.' Deutsche Bank co-chief executive Jurgen Fitschen has expressed regret for the rigging, adding that no current or former member of its management board were found to have known about the misconduct . Deutsche Bank co-chief executives Jurgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain expressed regret for the rigging, adding that no current or former member of its management board were found to have known about the misconduct. 'We have disciplined or dismissed individuals involved in the trader misconduct; have substantially strengthened our control teams, procedures and record-keeping; and are conducting a thorough review of the bank's actions in addressing this matter,' Fitschen and Jain said in a statement. The bank said it would book an additional charge of $1.6 billion in the first quarter for LIBOR and 'other matters'.","German banking giant has been fined for its role in a vast multi-year conspiracy to rig LIBOR interest rates .

"With rigorous grooming regimes and Instagram filters, it seems that some celebrities are on a constant mission to stay forever young - and succeeding. But whether it's through botched surgeries, poor lifestyles, stressful career lows or shattered relationships, certain stars have taken a quicker turn for the worst than their contemporaries. From child actors that swiftly deteriorated in the lime light or golden Hollywood stars that have greyed with time, FEMAIL rounds up the celebrities that have aged terribly . LINDSAY LOHAN . Lindsay Lohan at the age of 18 in 2005 (left) and now at the age of 28 (right) The child actress shot to fame as a freckle-faced darling in classics such as The Parent Trap, Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, but despite showing much promise, the now 28-year-old began to experience regular run-ins with the law and started appearing on headlines for the wrong reasons. A few rehab stints, DUI charges and parole violations later and it seems like Lohan's fast-paced lifestyle is finally catching up to her. The star has recently began showing rapid signs of ageing, including lines and over-plumped lips. JOHNNY DEPP . Johnny Depp at the age of 39 in 2003 (left) and now at 51 (right) Johnny Depp shot to stardom as a teen idol due to his dark and mysterious looks and acting versatility, which scored him roles in films such as Edward Scissorhands and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Having dated a slew of beautiful it-girls such as Winona Ryder and Kate Moss, before having two children with long-term partner Vanessa Paradis, the 51-year-old actor is now married to 29-year-old actress Amber Heard. It seems the series of high-profile relationships and a long-term smoking habit has taken its toll on the actor, as he now exhibits duller skin and lacklustre hair. KATE MOSS . Supermodel Kate Moss at the age of 30 in 2004 (left), now at the age of 41 (right) Kate Moss was, and still remains, one of the most famous supermodels in the world, rising to fame in the Nineties after she was discovered at the tender age of 14. The now 41-year-old ushered in the supermodel movement 'heroin chic', and popularised waif models at the time. However, 20 years of drinks and partying have seemingly aged the supermodel, who only celebrated her 41st birthday in January - but exhibits fine lines and dull skin. BRAD PITT . Brad Pitt at the age of 42 in 2006 (left) and now at 51 (right) Brad Pitt made his breakout role as a denim-sporting, cowboy hat-toting, golden-skinned bandit in Thelma & Louise in 1991, and quickly gained celebrity for his dashing looks. The actor has since been regularly cited as one of the world's most attractive men, and the now 51-year-old has been with wife Angelina Jolie since 2005, with whom he has six children with. But it seems like the strain of a hectic life has taken its toll on Pitt's looks, and the actor looks more haggard and greyed by the day. BRITNEY SPEARS . Britney Spears at the age of 21 in 2003 (left) and now at the age of 33 (right) At one point, Britney Spears was the apple of the eye of every Noughties guy and gal, sporting the widely-popular all-American aesthetic and busting out hit tunes such as Baby One More Time and Oops! I Did It Again. But it seems the fame and attention came too early, and the star suffered an apparent breakdown in 2007, shaving her head completely bald and beating a paparazzi's car with an umbrella. Since then, the 33-year-old pop star has slowly tried to bring back her career, but her weighty personal issues have inevitably taken their toll on her appearance. MACAULAY CULKIN . Macaulay Culkin at the age of 24 in 2005 (left) and now at the age of 34 (right) One of the most prominent child stars of our time, a baby-faced Macaulay Culkin soared to fame in 1990 Christmas favourite, Home Alone, when he was just ten years old. After completing a sequel a couple of years later, the star seemingly dropped off the public radar, struggling to secure acting work. The next time the now 34-year-old made headlines were for drug misdemeanors, and the star has since been seen chain-smoking and sporting an unrecognisably gaunt physique. RENÉE ZELLWEGER . Renée Zellweger at the age of 36 in 2006 (left) and now at the age of 45 (right) The American actress rocketed to fame as our favourite 'verbally incontinent spinster who drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney, and dresses like her mother': Bridget Jones. The 45-year-old's protrayal of the lovable and relatable character saw Zellweger's popularity spike and she landed additional hit roles in films such as Chicago and Cold Mountain. However, it seems the pressure to maintain a youthful complexion took its toll and Zellweger was subject to some controversy late last year, when she stepped out sporting a distinctively tauter but unrecognisable face. LEONARDO DICAPRIO . Leonardo DiCaprio at the age of 31 in 2006 (left), and now at 40 (right) With more than 30 years in the acting industry, Leonardo DiCaprio swiftly sealed his position as Hollywood hearthrob after roles in films such as Titanic and Romeo + Juliet. Having for the duration of his career remained a bachelor and enjoyed a regularly publicised party-boy lifestyle, it's no wonder that the actor's once-revered looks have begun to fade. The star is regularly seen out chain-smoking, sporting a hefty beard and a pot belly. MISCHA BARTON . Mischa Barton at the age of 21 in 2007 (left) and then now at the age of 29 (right) Rocketing to stardom as troubled all-American girl Marissa Cooper in The O.C., Barton was the envy of every teen due to her flawless looks. After The O.C., the actress struggled with securing film roles, and battled with yo-yo dieting, displaying dramatically fluctuating weight losses and gains. The 29-year-old star also had run-ins with the law and was charged with a DUI and possession of drugs in 2007. It seems as if Barton's hectic lifestyle and stress has started to catch up with her, with her face displaying signs of accelerated ageing. RUSSELL CROWE . Russell Crowe at the age of 41 in 2005 (left), the actor now at 51 (right) Australian actor Russell Crowe has enjoyed a successful career, scooping an Oscar in 2000 for his role in Ridley Scott-directed Gladiator. Although Crowe was always known for his messy unshaven looks, it seems as if the now 51-year-old has completely let go of his grooming regime all together. The star sports an unruly greyed beard and has put on a considerable amount of weight. Here FEMAIL rounds up the other celebrities who have aged badly... World-renowned singer and performer, Madonna, at 42 years of age in 2001 (left), now at 56 (right) Baywatch star Pamela Anderson at the age of 35 in 2003 (left), now at the age of 47 (right) Singer Michelle Williams, formerly of Destiny's Child, at 25 years of age in 2006 (left) and now at 34 (right) Actress Meg Ryan, at the age of 39 in 2000 (left) and age 53 now (right)","Some are child actors, others are former  Hollywood heartthrobs .

"Disgraced DJ Dave Lee Travis (pictured arriving at court in 2013) has claimed that his indecent assault trials 'financially ruined' him, but he will still receive £4,000 from the taxpayer to pay for his taxis to court . Disgraced DJ Dave Lee Travis has claimed that his indecent assault trials 'financially ruined' him, but he will still receive £4,000 from the taxpayer to pay for his taxis to court. The 69-year-old was convicted of indecently assaulting a woman behind the scenes at the Mrs Merton Show and was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, suspended for two years. At a costs application hearing today, the former radio presenter was told he would be awarded travel and hotel fees for his time on trial. Travis's conviction came after lengthy legal proceedings which saw him cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault following a trial in February last year. After the jury was unable to decide on verdicts on an additional count of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that the DJ, real name David Griffin, would face a retrial. It also added one more count of indecent assault - the offence of which he was eventually convicted of in September. Travis was cleared of the indecent assault on which he was retried, and after a second jury were unable to reach a verdict on the sexual assault charge, Judge Anthony Leonard QC directed a not-guilty verdict. Today Travis was told he will be awarded more than £4,000 for taxi fares to and from court, as well as a further £630 for hotel stays while he was on trial. The costs will come out of the public purse. Stephen Vullo QC, representing the disgraced DJ, made a defendant’s costs application at Southwark Crown Court, saying the criminal proceedings against his client had left him 'financially ruined'. 'In effect, it means that all of the allegations from trial one were found in his favour,' Mr Vullo said. 'In reality, as difficult as it might be for the prosecution, they called a number of complainants in the first trial who we say were proven to be liars, and some of the evidence called in the first trial was extremely weak on paper.' Mr Vullo said that since the second trial he had been acting pro bono on Travis's behalf. He added: 'He has no money left whatsoever. He is now below zero. He lives in a house owned by his wife ... he has been financially devastated by this.' Mr Vullo applied to the court for travel and accommodation costs, saying that Travis had racked up a bill of £4,456 in taxi fares to travel daily from his home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to court during the trials. He also claimed £630 in hotel accommodation, and £246 for travel to legal conferences, asking for a total of £5,332 towards Travis's costs. At a costs application hearing today, the former radio presenter (pictured outside court), 69, was awarded travel and hotel fees for when he was on trial . Prosecutor Joshua Munro opposed the application, stating that the costs were not 'reasonable' expenses for the taxpayer to fund. Travel costs: £4,121.80. The total equivalent of a return day train fare from Aylesbury to Marylebone (£61.40), plus £50 each day for taxis, on each of the 37 days he was in court. In reality Travis took taxis instead of the train. Hotel accommodation: £630. COSTS HE WILL NOT BE AWARDED . Extra travel costs: £334.20. The judge did not award Travis the full travel costs applied for. Travel to legal conferences: £246. Magistrates' court costs: £21,161.54. Judge Leonard ruled that Travis was only entitled to the costs of a daily return train ticket from Aylesbury to Marylebone - worth £61.40 - as well as £50 a day for reasonable taxi costs from the station. The judge allowed the hotel costs. Judge Leonard said: 'The trip from Aylesbury by train costs £61.40, day return, not allowing for the reduction with a monthly or weekly season ticket.' Referring to Travis's back problems, he added: 'His infirmity was such that the benefit from the train to get up from his seat rather than remain in it is something that could only have been achieved on a train, not a car.' The judge added he did not have the power to award defence costs of £21,161.54 for magistrates' court hearings. The defence estimate that Travis travelled to court on 37 days, meaning he is entitled to a total £4,121.80 in fares. Today Travis (pictured in a taxi outside court) was awarded more than £4,000 for taxi fares to and from court, as well as a further £630 for hotel stays while he was on trial . Before Travis's retrial began, Mr Vullo revealed that the DJ was forced to sell his £1.1million home in Buckinghamshire to pay for legal costs. At Travis's sentencing, the court heard that he had spent in the region of £350,000 defending both trials and had not worked since his arrest. In September last year, Travis was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, suspended for two years. His trial heard that the former Top Of The Pops presenter got a 'weird sexual thrill' when he indecently assaulted the woman, who is now a successful TV personality, in 1995. He cornered her in the corridor of a BBC television studio where she was smoking, and commented on her 'poor little lungs' before squeezing her breasts for 10 to 15 seconds. Travis was first arrested in October 2012 under Operation Yewtree, Scotland Yard's investigation into historic sexual abuse in the wake of allegations against the late DJ Jimmy Savile.","Lawyers for Dave Lee Travis say he was 'financially devastated' by trials .

"A gang of eight dug a 50m underground tunnel in an attempt to steal the ancient treasures inside a 1,400-year-old temple. The real-life tomb raiders began their daring plan by renting a restaurant across the road from Guanghui Temple in Zhengdin County, North China at the start of February. And while serving snacks to the public at the front of the building, a team on the inside was hard at work with shovels, ladders, and power drills - digging their way towards the temple's famous Hua Pagoda. Audacious plot: A seven-metre deep tunnel, which led to a 50m-long underground passage, was discovered by police when they raided the gang's property - across the road from Guanghui Temple . Historical site: The temple dates back to the Tang Dynasty and the Hua Pagoda (pictured) is nationally protected . The Criminal Investigation Bureau was tipped off about the group's audacious plan at the beginning of March and a task force was assigned to the case, reports People's Daily Online. After two days of investigation, police officers located the tunnel and were able to determine its source. They launched a sting operation four days later and five gang members were arrested - all of who confessed to plans to steal artefacts beneath the pagoda. The gang was just 20 metres away from breaching the Hua Pagoda when they were caught. Evidence of plan: Dozens of bags of earth dug up by the gang during their tunnelling were also found by police . Police questioning revealed that the gang's leader is a man named Zhang from Tianjin, North China. Zhang is a known artefact thief and his associates have also been involved in similar crimes in the past. They were able to hide their construction equipment from the rented property's landlord for more than a month - as it's thought they began digging around the Chinese New Year. After removing a board on the restaurant's floor, police discovered a seven-metre-deep tunnel that opened into a passage leading towards the Hua pagoda located 70 metres away. Almost succeeded: The gang had dug 50 metres towards the Hua Pagoda and were just 20 metres away from breaching it when they were foiled by police . Secret underground lair: The tunnel was around 50 metres long when the criminal gang was caught on March 6 . The tunnel was around 50 metres long when the gang was caught on March 6.

It was destroyed during the war in late Qing Dynasty and the pagoda was the only monument remained intact. The Hua Pagoda is included in the Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level (MHCSPNL) in 1961. Known to police: The gang's leader, Zhang, who was arrested, has a history of artefact theft .

"San Antonio city officials have messed with the wrong Texas chef. Attorney-turned-cook and activist Joan Cheever has spent the past decade feeding the homeless from the back of her charity food truck, until earlier this month she was slapped with a $2,000 fine for her charitable efforts. Cheever founded The Chow Train non-profit organization in 2005, preparing hot meals in her  licensed mobile kitchen and serving them at city parks out of her personal pickup, which she has been using as a delivery truck because it is more maneuverable. Punished for compassion: On April 7, San Antonio police officers issued a fine to local chef and activist Joan Cheever (right) for feeding the homeless at Maverick Park . Wrong truck: Cheever, the founder of The Chow Train non-profit food truck, was serving hot meals out of her personal pickup truck because it is more compact . No permit: Cheever's mobile kitchen is commercially licensed, but her personal vehicle is not . Hefty sum: Mrs Cheever was issued a citation and a $2,000 fine for failure to serve food out of a licensed food truck . Mixed messages: After writing out the citation, the officers allowed Cheever and her volunteers to continue distributing the meals . On April 7, Cheever and her band of volunteers were dishing out free food to those in need at Maverick Park on the outskirts of San Antonio when she was approached by four police officers on bicycles. Speaking to ABC News, Cheever said she asked the cops, ‘What's the problem?' and they replied, 'You.' After a brief exchange with the SAPD cops, Mrs Cheever was issued a citation and a $2,000 fine for failure to serve food out of a licensed food truck. After writing out the ticket, Cheever said the officers gave her the green light to continue distributing meals. San Antonio city officials stated that Cheever was cited for ‘failing to adhere to long-standing regulations that are in place to ensure public health and safety.’ City spokeswoman Di Galvan told ABC that mobile food establishment permits are not transferable from one vehicle to another. But the hefty fine has done nothing to deter the plucky Good Samaritan from carrying out her mission to provide much-needed sustenance to the city's poor. Her meals usually consist of a vegetable soup, a main course, such as meatball or coq au vin, and a dessert. Since her April 7 run-in with the law, the chef has offered meals on two separate occasions at the park, each time drawing larger than usual crowds of supporters. No letter of apology: Cheever received this official letter from the city summoning her to court June 23 . Cooking up kindness: Cheever is an attorney and a trained chef who started her Chow Train charity in 2005 . Good Samaritans: Cheever and her band of volunteers have served hundreds of thousands of hot meals to those in need in San Antonio and other areas . ‘I came back to the park the following Tuesday and was met with 100 people who had candles and signs,’ Cheever said. ‘This isn’t only about The Chow Train. It’s about every non-profit and every person who wants to do a good thing, but are intimidated by the $2,000 fine and possible arrest. So we’re just going to keep rolling on.’ Cheever has retained the services of a lawyer to fight the citation. 'I’m not going to settle and I’m not going to pay the fine and I’m not going to stop,' a defiant Mrs Cheever declared. ‘They can come out every Tuesday and write me up a ticket and we’ll just start collecting them.’ Joan Cheever, a wife and mother, had graduated from a culinary school and was featured on celebrity cook Rachel Ray's daytime talk show. Besides offering gourmet meals to low-income residents of San Antonio, Cheever and her group of helpers also have delivered meals to victims of natural disasters in places like Joplin, Missouri, and Moore, Oklahoma, which were ravaged by tornadoes recently. Cheever said it was insulting to her as a licensed cook that the city of San Antonio was treating her as a danger to the community. Religious freedom: Cheever accused police and city officials of violating her freedom of religion because she considers cooking and feeding the poor a free exercise of her faith . Defiant: Cheever pans to fight the citation and even possibly sue the city for violating the 1999 Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act . The Chow Train founder is scheduled to go before a judge June 23. Cheever said she is prepared to invoke the 1999 Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act, saying she has the right to feed the homeless because she considers it a free exercise of her faith. Cheever said as much to Officer Mike Marotta as he was writing out the ticket to her April 7. ‘One of the police officers said, “Ma’am, if you want to pray, go to church,” and I said, “This is how I pray. When I cook this food and deliver it to the people who are less fortunate,’ Cheever told News 4 San Antonio. Cheever is now considering suing the city for infringing upon her freedom of religion. The San Antonio City Council’s Quality of Life committee held a meeting Tuesday to address the controversy surrounding Cheever's citation, saying that their goal is to protect the homeless from unsafe food, reported San Antonio Express News. But Cheever argued that she been distributing food in plain sight week after week for years, and local officers would pass by and wave at her. Some of them, according to the chef, even accepted meals from her. Besides offering gourmet meals to low-income residents of San Antonio, Cheever and her group of helpers also have delivered meals to victims of natural disasters in places like Joplin, Missouri, and Moore, Oklahoma, which were ravaged by tornadoes recently. Rep, Joaquin Castro, a Democrat representing San Antonio, has weighed in on the hot-button issue, calling on the City Council to ‘do right by Joan Cheever’ and ‘allow her to feed the homeless.’ This is the latest example of an ongoing nationwide crackdown on Good Samaritans offering help to the homeless. Last year, a 90-year-old pastor and World War II veteran was arrested twice in a single week for feeding the needy in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. According to a recent report by the National Coalition for the Homeless cited by the Washington Post, 71 cities across the US have either passed or proposed an ordinance that clamps down on feeding the homeless. Cheever has launched a GoFundMe campaign asking for donations towards her legal battle with the City of San Antonio. As of Wednesday night, Cheever's supporters have contributed nearly $10,000 to her war chest.","San Antonio police officers issued a fine to local chef and activist Joan Cheever for feeding the homeless at Maverick Park April 7 .

"Two pupils have been suspended after schoolgirl's drink was spiked with highly corrosive hydrochloric acid during a science lesson. The teenager was left needing urgent medical treatment after she unwittingly downed the potentially lethal liquid at the specialist science college. The girl avoided serious injury from the colourless corrosive substance as a result of the quick thinking actions of staff at Hounsdown School in Southampton, Hampshire . A schoolgirl was left needing medical treatment at Hounsdown School, pictured, after he water bottle was spiked with hydrochloric acid . An investigation was immediately launched into the incident that is understood to have been a classroom prank. Julie Turvey, Headteacher at Hounsdown School, said: 'The school is taking this matter very seriously and continuing its investigation. A student took a sip from a water bottle into which other students had put a small amount of hydrochloric acid. 'Immediate action was taken to assess the student and the risk of serious harm. First aid treatment was administered and, thankfully, no significant injury was caused and no subsequent medical or hospital treatment was needed. 'The welfare and safety of all pupils attending this school is our priority. We have reported the incident to the Police and two students have been temporarily excluded.' The schoolgirl, who is in Year 11, raised the alarm on Tuesday after taking a sip from her drink. She discovered an unusual taste and smell to the liquid. The child's science teacher abandoned the lesson while the girl was sent to the school medical room, assessed and given water to drink. Tests reportedly showed the girl's water bottle had been contaminated with hydrochloric acid, pictured left. Julie Turvey, Headteacher at Hounsdown School, pictured right  said they were taking the matter 'very seriously' A group of boys thought to have been 'messing around' in the lesson were later questioned about the incident. Tests reportedly showed the bottle was contaminated with the substance but that the concentration of the acid was low. The schoolgirl, who has not been named, did not require hospital treatment or suffered any ill effects as a result. Hydrochloric acid is a highly corrosive solution of hydrogen chloride and water; and it is clear and colourless, but highly pungent. It is widely used, including for manufacturing plastic, removing rust from steel, producing leathers, neutralising swimming pools and treating drinking and waste water. If it contacts the skin it can cause severe burns, ulceration and scarring. Hounsdown School is a specialist science college and one of 110 schools in England with teaching school status which allows them to train the teachers of the future. In July 2011 it converted to a 'new style' academy, run by a governing body free from local authority control. It was rated 'good' in its last Ofsted report in 2012 and last year 70 per cent of its 237 year 11 students achieved grade A* to C in English and maths. They currently have 1215 students aged 11 to 16 on roll.

"Lawyers for a high school honor student in Massachusetts say the teen is 'bewildered' over the involuntary manslaughter charges against her following the suicide of her friend, as they push to have the case moved to a different county due to 'a conflict of interest'. Michelle Carter, 18, looked glum as she appeared in court in New Bedford on Thursday accused of encouraging the death of Conrad Roy III, who gassed himself in his truck in Fairhaven last July. During the hearing her defense attorney requested the case be moved out of Bristol County, saying it's 'impossible' for Carter to receive a fair trial in the area because the District Attorney is the victim's third cousin. However the the district attorney's office filed a response arguing that the DA, Thomas Quinn, has excused himself from any involvement in the case. Scroll down for video . 'Bewildered': Michelle Carter, 18, seen here in court in New Bedford, Massachusetts, on Thursday, is said to be confused at being charged with involuntary manslaughter over the suicide of her friend, Conrad Roy II, 18, according to her lawyers, who claim she was attempting to help Roy . Hearing: Carter's lawyers are trying to have her case moved out of Bristol County, saying it's 'impossible' for her to receive a fair trial in the area because the District Attorney is the victim's third cousin . Pretrial: Michelle Carter appears for a hearing in court with her attorneys Cory Madera (left) and Joseph Cataldo on Thursday in New Bedford, Massachusetts . Honor student: Carter was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Conrad Roy III last July . Supportive: Parent's Gail and David Carter have insisted their daughter is innocent and had been left overwhelmed by Roy's suicidal talk . 'There's no suggestion that DA Quinn and Conrad Roy III had ever even met,' Assistant District Attorney Kattie Rayburn said. New Bedford Juvenile Court Judge Siobhan Foley heard the arguments but did not make a decision. Authorities claim Carter, of Plainville, texted with Roy minutes before he killed himself in the parking lot of a Fairhaven store. Police said Carter sent him a text saying 'get back in' when he had second thoughts. Carter's lawyer says no crime was committed. Attorney Joseph Cataldo said outside juvenile court that they will prove Carter was actually trying to help Roy. 'Taking all the texts in context, she tried to talk him out of it,' Cataldo said, The Sun Chronicle reported. 'He caused his own death. 'She doesn't understand why she is being prosecuted.' Roy had previously tried to commit suicide over a year earlier and was battling depression. Video courtesy of WPRI . Accused: Michelle Carter (left) allegedly knew that her friend Conrad Roy III (right) was suicidal but rather than seeking help, she encouraged him to take his life in the minutes before he died last July . Last month it was reported that Carter told a friend: 'He got out of the car, and I told him to get back in... because I knew he would do it all over again the next day', according toPeople. The magazine reported that in the days before Roy took his life,  Carter texted her friends to say he had gone missing and she feared he was going to take his life. But other texts revealed that she was messaging Roy the whole time. 'Let me know when you're gonna do it,' one of her messages allegedly read. 'It is believed that Carter acted in this way because she was planning to continue to encourage Conrad to take his own life,' police said, People reported. 'So as a result she was beginning to put together a plan to get sympathy from her friends, which was evident because at this point she already started explaining that it's her fault that Conrad is dead, even though he was still alive and speaking and texting with her regularly.' Police and prosecutors say the pair exchanged more than 1,000 text messages in the days leading up to his death in the parking lot of a Fairhaven Kmart on July 13, 2014. Before his suicide, Conrad told her he was scared and not ready to leave his family, according to a police report, but 'she continued to encourage him to take his own life', the Sun Chronicle reported. 'When he actually started to carry out the act, he got scared again and exited his truck, but instead of telling him to stay out of the truck ... Carter told him to 'get back in',' the police report said. Tribute: In the hours after he was found dead, Carter shared this message to her Twitter page . 'Duplicitous': Three days after she allegedly encouraged him to take his life, she questioned why he had died . Before she was arraigned earlier this year, Carter shared this image of Conrad, adding: 'Really missing you tonight'. She is free on bail but has been ordered not to touch her social media pages or text . His body was found in the truck after his parents reported him missing, and police found the text messages after looking through his phone. Carter messaged one of her friends nearly a week later expressing her fears that her messages to Roy had been found, People reported. 'I just got off the phone with Conrads mom about 20 mins ago and she told me that detectives had to come and go thru his things and stuff,' she wrote. 'They read my messages with him I'm done... His family will hate me and I could go to jail.' Even though Carter, who met Roy while on a vacation to Florida several years earlier, reportedly called herself his 'girlfriend', his friends and family said they never knew of the relationship. Friend Louie Pina, 19, told People of the first time he saw her: 'I didn't even know who she was. She was just like a random face.' After the death, Carter, who attends King Philip Regional High School, started raising money and awareness for suicide prevention and organized a fundraising softball tournament last September. Tragic: Roy had struggled with anxiety throughout school, his family said, and canceled plans to go to college . In a description for the event, 'Homers for Conrad', Carter wrote: 'Life can be tough, but helping others makes it easier.' She later wrote on Twitter that the event had raised $2,300. Carter has also repeatedly posted online about how much she misses her friend. 'Such a beautiful soul gone too soon,' she wrote on the day of his death. 'I'll always remember your bright light and smile. You'll forever be in my heart, I love you Conrad.' Three days later, she added: 'I will never understand why this had to happen.' Her most recent message - written just two days before her indictment - reads: 'Enjoy the parade from up there tomorrow Conrad, I know you would of loved to be there ♥ Really missing you tonight.' Carter, who was 17 at the time of Roy's suicide, was indicted on February 5 and arraigned on an involuntary manslaughter charge the next day in New Bedford Juvenile Court. The high school senior was charged as a youthful offender, which means her case is open and she could face punishment as an adult if convicted. She is free on bail and is due back in court in April. As conditions of her bail, she is not allowed to use the internet or social media and cannot text anyone but her parents. Her family have insisted that she is innocent and had been left overwhelmed by Roy's suicidal talk. Bailed: Carter, a high school senior who's on the honor role, has been charged as a youthful offender, which means her case is open and she could face punishment as an adult if convicted . In a statement earlier this year, they said she 'is not the villain the media is portraying her to be'. 'She is a quiet, kind, and sympathetic young girl,' they said. 'She tried immensely to help Mr. Roy in his battle with depression. We know that once all of the facts are released, our daughter will be found innocent.' Conrad Roy had graduated from Old Rochester Regional High School, where he was an all-around athlete who played baseball, rowed crew and ran track, according to an obituary. He had earned his captain's license from Northeast Maritime Institute and worked for his family's marine salvage business. But Roy's father told police that his son suffered from anxiety and had struggled to attend school, and that he had got into Fitchburg State University but had canceled his plans to go. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Michelle Carter, 18, appeared in New Bedford court Thursday over the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy II, 18, who killed himself last July .

"Eager customers have waited up to 10 hours overnight to get their hands on prizes including 21inch TVs at the opening of a new Aldi store. The company gave away golden tickets to the first 100 people through the door when the store in Avlaston, Derbyshire, was officially opened at 8am this morning.

More than 200 people were found queuing outside the new Aldi store when it officially opened its doors at 8am this morning . To mark opening day, the company gave away golden tickets to the first 100 people through the doors . Ivy and Brian Bacon came all the way from Basford in Nottingham and queued from 10pm last night to get their hands on a 21.5inch television. Ivy Bacon, 20, was delighted to win the top prize. She said: 'It's brilliant, absolutely. It doesn't feel real, we never win anything.' Former Derby County player Craig Ramage, who commentates on his former team's games for BBC Radio Derby, cut the ribbon at the event. He said: 'I think it's perfect. It is easy access and I can't believe how many people turned up this morning.' Built on an area of overgrown land next to a petrol station, the store will create 29 jobs – 12 full-time and 17 part-time – and will have a car park. Permission for the store was granted by Derby City Council in July. Aldi's arrival comes after Tesco pulled the plug on plans to build a large store nearby earlier this year. The company has also made a £250 donation to the council to support its ongoing activities for the community and has donated a range of children's treats and baby products to Alvaston Children's Centre. Some of the company's 'Specialbuys' will be available at the new store for bargain-hunters to get their hands on. It is one of 60 Aldi stores opening across the UK this year.

"The chairman of a House committee investigating the 2012 terror attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, on Thursday called former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to testify at a public hearing next month. The move will set up a high-profile showdown over Clinton's use of a private email account and server while she was secretary of state – and allow the GOP to rehash questions about her performance before and after the deadly assault on a diplomatic compound and a CIA annex nearby. South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy said he wants Clinton to testify the week of May 18 and again before June 18. HOT SEAT: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton will testify in public about the Benghazi debacle, and about her exclusive use of a home-brew email server while she was secretary of state . NO COMMENT: Hillary stared ahead and walked wordlessly Tuesday through a Washington, DC airport, refusing to acknowledge her first campaign-trail question about the deadly Benghazi terror attacks in 2012 . DEADLY: The September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attacks killed four Americans including the US ambassador to Libya . The first hearing would focus on Clinton's use of private emails, and the second on the September 2012 attacks that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya. 'With her cooperation and that of the State Department and (Obama) administration, Secretary Clinton could be done with the Benghazi Committee before the Fourth of July,' Gowdy said in a statement. It is necessary to call Clinton to appear twice 'because the committee needs to ensure we have a complete and responsive record and all the facts before we then substantively question her on the Benghazi terrorist attacks,' Gowdy said. INFAMOUS: 'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton said during a 2013 Senate hearing. 'Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?' NOT FORGOTTEN: U.S. Ambassader the Libya Chris Stevens was the first to die in Benghazi, and was seen by Libyans as a moderate – angering anti-American hardliners from radical Islamist groups . Clinton dodged questions about the Benghazi attacks on Tuesday after landing in Washington, D.C. following a two-day presidential campaign swing in New Hampshire. Daily Mail Online asked her in the Reagan National Airport terminal if she had made mistakes handling the crisis, and when she would be ready to start answering reporters' questions. Clinton, steely-eyed, looked forward and walked silently without uttering a word. Gowdy's action comes a day after the GOP-led panel signaled its final report could slip to next year, just months before the presidential election. Clinton is widely considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president. Gowdy spokesman Jamal Ware said on Wednesday that Gowdy wants to complete the panel's work by the end of the year, but said factors including witness availability, compliance with document requests and security clearances 'could continue to impact the timing of the inquiry's conclusion.' A lawyer for Clinton said she is prepared to answer questions publicly regarding the Benghazi attacks and her email use as soon as possible. 'There is no reason to delay her appearance or to have her testify in a private interview,' lawyer David Kendall said Wednesday in a letter to Gowdy. Clinton has twice testified before Congress on the Benghazi matter, telling lawmakers in 2013 that she takes responsibility for missteps by the State Department in the months leading up to the assault. But Clinton insisted that requests for more security at the diplomatic mission in Benghazi didn't reach her desk, and reminded lawmakers that they have a responsibility to fund security-related budget requests. CASUALTIES: US Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith (left), US Navy SEAL Glen Doherty (center) and US Nacy SEAL Tyrone Woods (right) perished in the Ansar al-Shariah attacks in Benghazi . PROTEST: Congressional interns carried photographs of Woods, Doherty and Smith during a Special Operations Speaks Political Action Committee news conference in July 2013 . SMOLDERING: The fires in Benghazi have gone out, but not the Republican Party's zeal to tarnish Hillary Clinton's political legacy with new questions about how it happened and why some details were allegedly covered up . Gowdy's letter includes more than 100 questions he and other lawmakers may pose to Clinton about her email use, including why she considered using a private server and what was done to vet the companies or individuals who set up the server. And still lingering, too, are uneasy questions about why Clinton initially blamed the Benghazi attaks on a spontaneous protest sparked by an anti-Muslim YouTube video produced in the United States. American intelligence knew during the attack that it was launched by a terror group, Ansar al-Whariah, which is affiliated with al Qaeda. Months later, following a concussion that delayed her congressional testimony about Benghazi, she testified in a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. 'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton told the senators. 'Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans?' 'What difference at this point does it make?' Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, senior Democrat on the Benghazi panel, said the focus on email comes after 'Republicans' multi-year search for evidence to back up their Benghazi conspiracy theories has turned up nothing.' Cummings accused Gowdy and other Republicans of a 'coordinated attempt' to 'drag out this taxpayer-funded search for anything they can use against Hillary Clinton, while their political arm raises campaign funds off the deaths of four Americans.'","Presidential candidate will face tough grilling about the 2012 terror attacks in Libya .
