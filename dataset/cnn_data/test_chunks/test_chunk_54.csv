"An offensive attempt by a men's magazine to commemorate fallen Anzac soldiers has backfired as social media users and the Department of Veteran Affairs condemn the crude 'commemorative issue'. After coming under scrutiny, Zoo Weekly removed all 'offending' images of a half-naked model holding a long stemmed red poppy from Facebook. The Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) said the word 'Anzac' is protected by federal legislation since 1920 and is not authorised to be used for commercial purposes- like Zoo Weekly's 'Special Anzac Centenary Issue'- without express permission from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Scroll down for video . Zoo Weekly removed images of a bikini clad woman holding a red poppy after being criticised by the Department of Veteran Affairs for using the word 'Anzac' without permission . After discovering Zoo had not sought permission, the DVA immediately notified Zoo Weekly of the breached and asked for all offending images to be removed. The issue, released on the Monday leading up to the Anzac weekend, included a 10-page feature with a list of '100 things every Aussie should know about Gallipoli'  and an interview with cover girl Erin Pash who revealed what features she admired in our service men. In the interview Ms Pas was asked what she liked about 'men in uniform', to which she replied: 'They're bad arses, they have guns and they're really fit and well built'. She then commends soldiers for 'doing what they're told' and being able to perform an 'impressive' 100 push ups, 'in a row'. Social media users were quick to condemn the controversial issue, labelling it 'gross and offensive.' Twitter users were quick to condemn Zoo Weekly for the controversial issue . Some thought the issue was 'gross and offensive' Some questioned how on earth an editor thought this was a good campaign? While others questioned how this relates to the Australian Anzac story .

The supermarket has since been forced to halt the campaign it was branded 'disrespectful' and 'disgusting' by social media users who unleashed a barrage of memes poking fun at Woolworth's attempt to embrace Anzac Day.

"A Washington teen who strapped fake explosives around his body in a stunt to ask a date to the prom has been suspended from school. The five-day suspension for Ibrahim Ahmad will prevent him from attending La Center High's dance Saturday. Ahmad says he was trying to go all out with his prom proposal and questions whether the decision to suspend him was based on his ethnicity. 'It was really unfair, and it kind of felt racist,' Ahmad said. The 18-year-old senior wore a vest filled with paper-tube props made to look like explosives. Scroll down for video . 'The bomb': Ibrahim Ahmad, a senior at La Center High in Washington State will miss his prom because of a suspension he received for this bomb-themed promposal . At lunchtime, he stood on the cafeteria stage and held a sign inviting his would-be date to the prom. 'I kno it's A little Late, But I'm kinda…THE BOMB! Rilea, Will U Be My Date To Prom?' the sign read. School Superintendent Mark Mansell says Ahmad's actions were inexcusable and that he deserved punishment for disrupting the learning environment. 'To me, it's just blatant disrespect,' Mansell told The Columbian. 'The student knew that the principal wouldn't support this and he went ahead and did it anyway.'

"Angelina Jolie pleaded with world powers on Friday to help the millions of Syrian refugees, sharply criticizing the U.N. Security Council for being paralyzed by its division over Syria's four-year conflict. Jolie briefed the council as special envoy for the U.N. on refugee issues. When asked about Jolie's planned briefing, Syria's U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari responded: 'She is beautiful.'

Special Envoy Angelina Jolie meets with young Syrian refugees at an informal tented settlement in Zahle, Bekaa Valley in Zahle, Lebanon in February 2014. The actress and husband Brad Pitt were reportedly moving to adopt a child from the war-torn region . The UN reports that about 440,000 people are besieged in Syria's civil war, now in its fifth year. Of those, 167,500 are trapped by government forces, 228,000 by Islamic State militants and the rest by other armed groups. The 39-year-old actress and director spoke at the United Nations in New York on Friday dressed in a white blazer, matching skirt and delicate jewelry. She had removed her $250,000 diamond engagement ring to make her speech. 'We cannot look at Syria, and the evil that has arisen from the ashes of indecision, and think this is not the lowest point in the world's inability to protect and defend the innocent,' Jolie said. 'We are standing by in Syria,' she said, adding that the council's powers lie unused because its members cannot agree on how to address the conflict. In addition, Jolie spoke briefly about the rising migrant crisis on the Mediterranean, where more than 1,300 migrants fleeing Syria and other places have drowned at sea over the past three weeks. 'It is sickening to see thousands of refugees drowning on the doorstep of the world's wealthiest continent,' she said. 'No one risks the lives of their children in this way except out of utter desperation.' Jolie, who said she has made 11 visits to Syrian refugees in the region since the crisis began in 2011, called strongly for the political will to act. Russia, a top Syria ally and backed by China, has vetoed multiple council resolutions on Syria, including an effort last year to refer the situation there to the International Criminal Court. Jolie said the council must now 'work as one,' and she said she would like to see the foreign minister of each of the 15 council members come to the table to negotiate a political solution. She also urged council members to visit Syrian refugees and see the crisis for themselves. 'Those refugees cannot come to this council, so please, will you go to them,' said Jolie. Following her UN speech, Jolie spoke on stage during the Women In The World Summit held in New York on Friday. She told a rapt audience that 'women are still treated as secondary issues' in wartorn regions. According to the NY Times said: 'It is still far too easy and accepted for leaders to ignore uncomfortable truths, from FGM (female genital mutilation) to child marriage. 'It is still the norm for women to be excluded from the peace process. Women, we know, are the first to be affected by war, and the last to be taken into account when it ends.'

Earlier this month, a business associate of Jolie and husband Brad Pitt told The Daily Express that the couple want to adopt a little Syrian girl. The megastars are already parents to six children, three biological - Shiloh, eight, and six-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, and three adopted children, Maddox ,13, from Cambodia, Pax, 11, from Vietnam, and Zahara, 10, from Ethiopia. 'She has been moved to tears on several occasions over the plight of youngsters orphaned in the Syrian conflict,' the source told The Express. 'Now she has sorted out her health issues, she and Brad believe the time is right to adopt another orphan from there, most likely a daughter.' Last month, Jolie - who married Pitt in the summer of 2014 - revealed that she could not biologically have children again as she had her ovaries removed. She had the operation to prevent cancer cells from taking over the organs - her beloved mother Marcheline Bertrand died from ovarian and breast cancer in 2007. Two years ago, Angelina underwent a double mastectomy as another preventative measure. Jolie, 39, stood out in her white suit as she joined members of the UN Security Council for the meeting .

"From alien coffins to fossilised lizards, conspiracy theorists believe they have found all manner of strange items in Nasa's images of Mars. Now, one alien hunter claims to have spotted what he believes to be a bunker on the red planet, with armed people peering out of its windows. Andre Gignac says he made the 'stunning discovery' in a photograph released by Nasa and taken by the Mars rover Opportunity. Scroll down for video . A conspiracy theorist claims to have spotted what he believes to be a bunker on the red planet, with armed people peering out of its windows (shown by the dotted red line) He says he became suspicious about a 'dark spot' on the rim of the Endeavour crater he had found in the original image, and so took a closer look. 'I was stunned. It was a massive panoramic window built in the inside wall of the crater,' Gignac told Cryptozoology News. 'You can see a person behind the bunker's window,' the 58-year-old added. He claims that the 'bunker' 'could also be a corridor leading to a bigger bunker'. 'Also, not far from this bunker are missiles, rockets and structures deployed in a circle,' he says. 'Bunkers have been spotted in previous Nasa pictures, some might be caused by shadows or lack of resolution that doesn't give enough detail to clearly see if the structure is a bunker or not,' Nigel Watson, author of the UFO investigations Manual, told Dailymail.com . Andre Gignac says he made the 'stunning discovery' in a photograph released by Nasa and taken by the Mars rover Opportunity . Pictured From left to right, are structures, missiles and rockets Cignac claims he found in Nasa's image . Cignac claims he became curious about a 'dark spot' on the rim of the Endeavour crater he had found in the original image, and so took a closer look . 'Others have claimed that bunker pictures were taken by the European Space Agency, Mars Express orbital vehicle. 'These were explained as being of erosional features or caused by the way the pictures were stitched together. 'Whatever the ""mundane"" explanation I think we are more fascinated by the idea that there are people secretly living beneath the surface of Mars and they are part of some secret space program. 'Such a project would need vast resources and would be very hard to keep covered up, yet many think this is what is happening and that these activities are being carried out in conjunction with one or more alien species.' The latest discovery follows a spate of supposed 'sightings' of Martian civilisation. Last year, a Maryland-based UFO hunter spotted what he believed to be a 'decorative' box on the red planet. Other objects found in images of Mars include what some UFO hunters claim to be a fossilised iguana (left). Stock image of an iguana is pictured right . The so-called 'coffin' was found by Will Farrar from WhatsUpintheSky37 as he trawled through a library of pictures sent back by the Mars rover Curiosity. The image pictured inset has been edited . The 'coffin' was discovered by Will Farrar from WhatsUpintheSky37 as he trawled through a library of pictures sent back by the Mars rover Curiosity. Many scientists believe that seeing strange objects, such as a 'coffin' on Mars, is simple a case of pareidolia. This is a psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random places. It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in unconnected data. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places, especially the faces of religious figures. Many involve images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and the word Allah. For example, in September 2007 a callus on a tree resembled a monkey, leading believers in Singapore to pay homage to the Monkey god. Another famous instance was when Mary's face was a grilled cheese sandwich. Images of Jesus have even been spotted inside the lid of a jar of Marmite and in a potato. 'This little box sure does look like a modern coffin concrete liner,' he wrote on his YouTube channel. 'As well as the stonework on the back part of the hill that looks like stairs or some left over stonework from some old civilisations constructions.' Alien researcher Scott Waring of the UFO Sightings Daily said he believes the coffin was made from a stone-like substance. 'What would it take to get Nasa to turn the rover around and examine the contents of this box?,' he said. But while its strong lines have captured the imagination of UFO bloggers, scientists believe sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called Pareidolia. This describes the brain's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random places. It has evolved so that human eyes can spot faces within their environment, and to help them recognise friends in a crowd. Scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and recognise meaningful shapes, even when they're not there. 'I stand ready to be convinced that I have possibly hallucinated. I won't mind being told that I'm wrong,' Cignac says. Last year, UFO enthusiasts claimed to have spotted Barack Obama's head on the Martian surface. They say a panoramic image from 2005 taken by the Spirit rover shows a rock shaped uncannily like his head .","Radical claim was made by 58-year-old Canadian, Andre Gignac .

"Attorney General Eric Holder bid farewell to the Justice Department on Friday after six years, outlining what he said were his major accomplishments and telling staffers that they helped produce a 'golden age' in the department's history. An emotional Holder, who has served as the nation's top law enforcement official since the start of the Obama administration, addressed hundreds of lawyers and staff members one day after his successor, Loretta Lynch, was confirmed by the Senate following a months-long delay. 'I am proud of you. I'm going to miss you. I am going to miss this building. I am going to miss this institution. More than anything, I am going to miss you all,' Holder told the standing-room-only crowd, many of whom embraced him after he concluded his speech. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Attorney General Eric Holder waved to Justice Department employees during his farewell gathering in Washington on Friday, ending six years at the DOJ . Holder shook hands and received hugs from well-wishers on his last day as attorney general . Newly confirmed Attorney General-designate Loretta Lynch will take over from Holder, following a months-long delay of her Senate confirmation vote – which passed on Thursday with 'yes' votes from 10 Republicans . The event also included a tribute video prepared for the occasion that featured members of Congress, former President Bill Clinton and Holder's wife, Sharon Malone. In it, Holder described an 'emotional attachment' to the department and recounted efforts to protect civil rights, prosecute terror suspects in federal court and change the criminal justice system. Other clips showed President Barack Obama showering Holder with praise on the day Holder announced his departure. Holder, a former judge and U.S. attorney who took the job in 2009, will exit the department as the third-longest serving attorney general in U.S. history. He has not publicly announced what he'll be doing next. After Lynch, 55, is sworn in at the Justice Department on Monday, she is likely to continue some of the same agenda as Holder as the Obama administration draws to a close. But she is expected to bring to Washington her own management style and has spoken optimistically about having cooperative relationships with Congress following years of bitter feuding with Republicans who saw Holder as overly political and once held him in contempt. Holder's tenure was in many ways defined by his efforts on civil rights protections. His department challenged state laws that it saw as restricting access to the voting booth and refused to defend the constitutionality of a federal law banning recognition of gay marriage. Holder also pushed for changes in the criminal justice system, directing prosecutors to sharply limit their use of harsh mandatory minimum sentences and championing alternatives to prison for nonviolent drug defendants. Though Holder sees civil rights as a defining element of his legacy, his early years largely centered on national security concerns as the country confronted several terror plots, including a failed effort to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009. MOBBED: Holder's jubilant reception from his staff was the polar opposite of his treatment at the hands of congressional Republicans . Media advocates criticized the Justice Department's aggressive stance in news media leak investigations involving national security cases, and human rights groups expressed frustration when the department failed to bring charges over harsh interrogation tactics of terror suspects. One area where he has professed vindication is in his plan to transfer terror suspects from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to the United States for prosecution in the federal court system. The plan was abandoned amid congressional opposition, but since then, the Justice Department has pointed to successful terror convictions in American courts even as the military tribunal system has slogged along without major results. On Friday, he called that debate 'dead' and settled and said it was now clear that civilian courts could adequately handle national security investigations.","Holder took a victory lap in his farewell speech, claiming credit for overseeing a 'golden age' of federal law enforcement .

"A student who was left with an unsightly cauliflower ear following a botched piercing says she wishes she had listened to her mother who told her not to get it done. Remmie, 18, had a thick bar put through her ear as an act of teenage rebellion, and initially hoped it would make her stand out from the crowd. But when the piercing became inflamed, Remmie was forced to remove the bar - and the resulting wound healed into a hazelnut-sized lump known as a keloid scar. Scroll down for video . Unsightly: Remmie was left with a hazelnut sized scar on the top of her ear following a piercing . Inflamed: After getting this bar put in, her ear became inflamed with led to a painful keloid scar . 'It looks vile, it's not pretty and makes me feel less confident,' says Remmie who appears on TLC reality series, Extreme Beauty Disasters. 'It's getting bigger and it's itchy. I had it done to look different, I look different now but not in a good way. People shout stuff and stare. 'It looks like I have a bit of chewing gum stuck on my ear. You just want to flick it off but you can't.' Her concerned mother, Victoria, who had always been against the piercing, added: 'I told her not to have it done. I'm worried about it getting bigger.' Vile: Remmie, 18, says the unsightly lump is 'vile' and has knocked her confidence badly . Desperate to get rid of the unsightly lump, Remmie was forced to seek the help of cosmetic surgeon Vik Vijh. Mr Vijh immediately diagnosed a keloid scar, which according to the British Skin Foundation, affects between 10 and 15 per cent of wounds. The scars, which usually take the form of a hard lump of tissue and are often larger than the original wound, are most frequently found on the shoulders and neck. Unfortunately, as Mr Vijh pointed out, removal operations frequently make things worse as the body goes into overdrive to heal the new wound. But much to the 18-year-old's relief, he also revealed that keloid removal operations on the ear are among the most likely to be successful. Much better: The teenager is now smiling again after a cosmetic surgeon managed to remove the scar . 'The good news is I can take these lumps away and reconstruct,' he explains. 'But there is a risk the scars could return.' Despite the risk, Remmie chose to go ahead and much to her delight, her ear has been returned to normal. 'My confidence is over the top,' she said afterwards. 'it's so much better. I feel like me again, it's nice to be back.'","Remmie, 18, got a piercing across the top of her ear .

"Shabana Bibi, died in hospital on Saturday April 18 . The heartbroken brother of Pakistan's latest 'honour killing victim' - allegedly burned alive because she left the house without permission - said he will set himself alight if he does not get justice. Shabana Bibi, 25, from the Muzaffargarh district of the country, died in hospital on Saturday after suffering burns to 80 per cent of her body. Police have arrested her husband Muhammad Siddique and father-in-law Pir Bakhsh. Bibi's brother, Muhammad Azam said Siddique became enraged on learning his wife had visited her sister without first asking him if she could go out. His father then beat Bibi before dousing her with petrol on April 17, Azam alleged. Bibi had been married to Siddique for three years, during which time she had suffered repeated domestic abuse because the couple couldn't have children, her brother claimed. Azam says police have not provided him with a copy of the crime report despite repeated requests. 'I would set myself on fire in front of the office of the district police chief if I did not get justice,' he said. District police chief Rai Zameer-ul-Haq said: 'We have arrested the husband and father-in-law of the deceased woman and charged them for murder and terrorism.' The charge of 'terrorism' is regularly applied in such cases to quicken the legal process. Bibi (not pictured) had been married to Siddique for three years, during which time she had suffered repeated domestic abuse, according to her brother . But Naseem, the investigating officer, now says police have no doubt Bibi committed suicide. He said the police investigation will end if three people from the area take an oath on the Quran claiming Bakhsh is innocent. He said police have asked the men to visit the police station tomorrow so the oaths can be made. Hundreds of women are murdered by their relatives in Pakistan each year through domestic violence or on the grounds of defending family 'honour'. The Aurat Foundation, a campaign group that works to improve the lives of women in Pakistan's conservative and patriarchal society, says more than 3,000 women have been killed in such attacks since 2008.","Shabana Bibi, 25, died after she suffered burns to 80 per cent of her body .

"A Facebook post and a Craigslist ad worked together to solve the 34-year-old cold case murder of a teenage girl from Michigan who was found stabbed nine times in the woods in rural Louisiana. Carol Cole was 17 years old when she disappeared without a trace after running away from a juvenile detention center in Texas in October 1980. In January 1981, police in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, found a teenage girl stabbed nine times in the back and chest stashed under a pile of leaves in the woods out of a dirt road outside Shreveport. For 34 years, Carol's family searched in vain for the troubled teen. At the same time, detectives from Bossier Parish never stopped trying to identity the body they found mutilated in the woods. Coming together: The picture at left is the image used by Carol Cole's family on Craigslist posts across Texas and Louisiana. The image at right is a rendering of 'Bossier Doe' created for a Facebook page posted by detectives in an attempt to identify a body found in January 1981 . Carol Cole escaped from a Texas juvenile jail in October 1980 after moving from Michigan with her mother. Her remains have been found and identified after 34 years . Relieved: Carol Cole's sister, Jeanie Phelps of Kalamazoo, Michigan, (center) with Bossier Sheriff's Lt. Shannon Mack and Sgt. Dave Faulk . Now, social media has brought Carol's family and Louisiana detectives together. In February, DNA confirmed that the body in Louisiana matched missing Carol's DNA, the Detroit News reports. New attention to the case has brought forward a potential suspect, as well. John Chesson, who is already in prison for an unrelated murder, is named as a person of interest in Carol's brutal death . Carol's sister Jeanie Phelps and her friend posted Craigslist ads across Texas and Louisiana with pictures of the teen, hoping someone might recognize her. At the same time, Bossier Parish Lieutenant Shannon Mack crated a Facebook post for 'Bossier Doe' (Facebook doesn't allow Jane Doe page names). It included a digitally-rendered drawing of the victim based on her skeletal remains. Carol's family aznd Bossier detectives made a connection six days later when Bossier Parish 911 dispatcher Linda Erickson was trolling through Craigslist. Long road: Cole, from Michigan, was eventually found dead in Louisiana. She was last heard from in December 1980 and found dad a month later . These are the shoes that Carol was wearing when she was found dead. Police posted pictures of them in the hopes of jogging the memory of anyone who may have known her . Person of interest: John Chesson has been identified as a possible suspect by his own daughter. He's currently in prison for an unrelated murder . She had seen the Facebook page posted by detectives in her department. When she stumbled across Ms Phelps' Craigslist page, she realized that the rendering of Bossier Doe and picture of Carol looked remarkably similar. 'I can't explain it other than this child was meant to have an identity,' Ms Erikson tells the News. Perhaps even more remarkable, authorities in Bossier and Carol's family had crossed each other's paths some 30 years ago in a failed attempt to find the teen and identify the body. A coroner in the early 1980s examined the remains to see whether they matched Carol's description - but he said they weren't close enough for further investigation. Ms Phelps, Carol's sister, also considered the Bossier remains in the search for her missing sister - but says she must have glossed over them, WOOD-TV reports. All the new attention has also brought forward a potential suspect in Carol's murder.  Convicted murderer John Chesson's own daughter told the News that media coverage of Carol's case jogged her memories that the teen had been staying at their house in 1980 before she disappeared. Frances LeBlanc says that her father was a violent, abusive man. And he was also the one who claimed to have found Carol's body in the woods and alerted police. Detectives have not filed charges, but say they are investigating whether Chesson murdered the teenager nearly 35 years ago. Carol's remains have been cremated and brought back to Michigan, where her family lives. The family is currently raising money to pay for a full funeral and burial.","Carole Cole, 17, disappeared in October 1970 after running away from a juvenile jail in Texas .

"A three-year-old girl was airlifted to hospital after being mauled in the face by her family's pet dog at their home. The toddler suffered horrific facial injuries after the Alaskan Malamute crossed with a Siberian Huskey clamped its jaws around her head at their home in Neyland, Pembrokeshire. She was playing in the garden on Thursday afternoon when her family heard screams and ran to find their eight-year-old dog 'gripping' the three-year-old by her head. A three-year-old girl was airlifted to Morriston Hospital (pictured) in Swansea after being mauled in the face by her family's pet dog . They wrestled the animal free but the toddler suffered deep puncture wounds to her face and skull. Her injuries were so severe that she had to be airlifted to Morriston Hospital in Swansea 60 miles away and her family are currently at her bedside. The dog was taken to a nearby vet and the family gave permission for their pet to be destroyed. A Dyfed Powys Police spokesman said: 'The incident occurred inside the family home and was by all accounts an attack that came completely out of the blue. Newborn Eliza-Mae Mullane (pictured) was killed by an Alaskan Malamoute in March 2014 . 'The dog had not been left unsupervised with the little girl and if it had not been for the fast actions of a family member, her injuries could have been far more serious. 'Police have thoroughly looked into this matter and are satisfied that this was a very unfortunate incident that no one could have foreseen. There will be no further investigation. 'She sustained head injuries and was conveyed to Morriston Hospital in Swansea by Air Ambulance. Her condition is not life threatening. 'Following the police response to the incident, the dog was safely contained and taken to a local vet. 'In accordance with the wishes of the family the dog was destroyed.' A six-day-old baby girl was killed by an Alaskan Malamoute 40 miles away in the village of Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire in March 2014. Eliza-Mae Mullane was pulled from her pram and bitten by the family's pet dog at her home, an inquest heard. Neighbours heard the baby's mother Sharon John, 42, scream: 'The dog ate my baby's head', after discovering her body next to the dog called Nisha. Alaskan Malamute are not a banned breed under the Dangerous Dogs Act. They were originally bred as sled dogs for work in the Arctic, but are now popular as family pets. The Alaskan Malamute Club of the United Kingdom describes the breed as an 'affectionate, friendly, loyal, devoted companion' on its website. It says an ideal Alaskan Malamute is 'heavily boned, powerfully built'. The Alaskan Malamute (not pictured) was taken to a nearby vet and the family gave permission for their pet to be destroyed .","Three-year-old girl was mauled in the face by her family's dog at home .

"A jealous woman in a love triangle allegedly kidnapped her lover's other girlfriend and her two-year-old son last week - sparking an Amber Alert and a statewide manhunt across Washington for the child last week. Alyssa Marie Chang, 56, was furious with the mother of little Ronnie Tran because she thought that the woman had been circulating doctored photos of their mutual lover in 'compromising sexual positions,' police say. On April 14, she showed up at the home of her love rival outside Seattle with a Taser. She told the rival and take her son Ronnie and come with her, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. When the woman refused, Chang allegedly shocked the woman with the Taser, according to police. Authorities say Chang then allegedly kidnapped the woman and Ronnie and took them to a home in Des Moines, Washington. Police say she bound the love rival with plastic ties and locked her in a cupboard. She then took Ronnie to another home in Fife. An Amber Alert was issued for the boy Tuesday night, after the mother managed to escape and find help. Scroll down for video . Babysitting: John Truong agreed to babysit 2-year-old Ronnie Tran (pictured) on Tuesday. He says his sister dropped off the boy, saying the toddler was her boyfriend's son and they wanted to go on a date night . That same night, Truong says his sister asked him to babysit the toddler he had never met before, saying it was her boyfriend's son and they wanted to go out on a date night. She promised to pick up the boy in the morning, but she never returned and eventually stopped answering her brother's messages. It wasn't until the next day that Truong realized he was harboring an abducted child when he read an Amber Alert on online. 'I'm eating my breakfast, I'm checking my Facebook, all of a sudden I see this Amber Alert for this child,' Truong recounted to KOMO. 'And it looks like this child in my bed, and I'm like, ""Oh my God! What's going on?""' Truong then called police to report that he was watching the boy, who they found safe, sound an unhurt at his home. Safe and sound: Truong was reading Facebook in the morning when he realized that Ronnie had been abducted from his mother. He then called police, and they picked up the boy (above). Truong's sister Alyssa Chang has since been arrested in connection to the bizarre kidnapping . He says the boy appeared fine the night before, enjoying a quiet night in watching movies and eating popcorn. 'He was a great kid. He didn't cry much or anything. He enjoyed my dog's company and my children's company,' Tuong said. Truong says he was completely taken aback by his sister's arrest in the bizarre kidnapping. 'I feel like she was just helping her boyfriend out and just got into this horrible situation,' he said. 'We're family people, this is definitely not like this. Honestly I'm at a loss for words right now. It's just crazy.' In the aftermath of the incident, Chang was arrested on charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment and is being held on $250,000 bail. Nguyen later turned herself into police and was questioned for several hours. Detectives have yet to reveal a motive for the crime. 'Our detectives are currently investigating this case,' said Sgt Mike Graddon of the Des Moines Police told King 5. 'It's very, very complex, and that is all the information we have at this point, but Ronnie has been found.'","John Truong of Renton, Washington says sister dropped off 2-year-old boy Ronnie Tran at his house Tuesday .

"EU leaders have agreed a package of measures to tackle the escalating migrant crisis in the Mediterranean – with pledges to send in warships and triple funding for rescue patrols. After years of dithering, an emergency EU summit yesterday agreed to lay the groundwork for military action against traffickers after the deaths of some 1,700 refugees in the last week alone. Within days, British warship HMS Bulwark and the German supply ship Berlin are expected to be sent to the region in the biggest sign of the European Union's belated commitment to the cause. Prime Minister David Cameron, who is two weeks from a national election in which immigration is a major issue, stressed that Britain was not planning to bring any more migrants back to the UK. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose country has been faced with almost daily tragedy as rescuers pluck bodies from the sea, called the EU measures 'a giant step forward.' But other EU leaders were less optimistic, with Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, saying the assets being proposed would 'never be enough' to address the problem. 'A giant step forward': Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi speaks after EU leaders agreed a package of measures to tackle the growing migrant crisis including extra military and a tripling of funding for patrols . Jovial: Danish Prime minister Helle Thorning Schmidt and her British counterpart David Cameron embrace before posing for a family photo during a European Union leaders summit in Brussels . The pledge of resources came as victims of the worst-ever migrant disaster in the Mediterranean were buried Thursday in Malta. Two dozen wooden caskets containing the only bodies recovered from a weekend capsizing off Libya that left at least 800 migrants feared dead were laid out for a memorial service. None of the bodies was identified: One casket had 'No 132' scrawled on it, referring to the number of the DNA sample taken from the corpse in case a relative ever comes to claim it. For several years as death tolls mounted, EU leaders have done little more than deplore the loss of lives and mark tragedies with moments of silence and wreaths instead of fundamental action. When Libya disintegrated politically after the overthrow of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi and unrest spread in neighboring countries, Europe failed to take forceful action. Yesterday, EU leaders pledged to do more, committing at least nine vessels to monitor the waters for traffickers and intervene in case of need. Other member states, from France to Latvia, also lined up more ships, planes and helicopters that could be used to rescue migrants. The member states agreed to triple funding to €9million (£7m) a month for the EU's border operation that patrols the Mediterranean. Seek and destroy: Britain will send one of its biggest warships, HMS Bulwark (above), to the Mediterranean within days as part of plans to targets boats used by human traffickers . Escalating crisis: A migrant is stretchered off to hospital by the Italian Red Cross at the port of Salerno after being rescued by the tanker Chimera along with 545 other refugees in the Mediterranean . They also assigned EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to line up the diplomatic options that would allow EU militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers. Officials said the lack of a strong Libyan government would likely make UN backing necessary. 'Leaders have already pledged significantly greater support, including many more vessels, aircraft and experts' than had been anticipated before the summit, EU President Donald Tusk said. Despite the sudden deluge of goodwill, huge questions remained about whether it would be enough to defeat the smugglers and human traffickers. 'Right now, it's a question of fixing yesterday's errors,' French President Francois Hollande said. He said the EU would hold a summit in Malta with African countries by this summer to see how the continents can work together to better deal with a crisis that has grown dramatically in recent years. In contrast to the Italian premier, the head of another Mediterranean nation on the frontline of the tragedies was far less enthusiastic. For tiny Malta, the smallest EU member state with a population of 450,000, the summit produced nothing particularly new, apart from a fresh resolve to break up the smuggling networks. The assets being proposed 'will never be enough,' Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat said. 'It is definitely not enough if the numbers that are being communicated about prospective migratory flows are anything to go by.' On the offensive: EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini (pictured) has been assigned to line up the diplomatic options that would allow EU militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers . In the past week alone, more than 10,000 people have been plucked from the seas between Italy and Libya as desperate migrants fleeing war and poverty threw their lot in with smugglers who charged up to $2,000 for a spot on overcrowded boats to make the perilous crossing. At least 1,300 people have died in April alone, putting 2015 on track to be the deadliest year ever. Ending that is Europe's main challenge. Even optimists say any measures agreed at Thursday's summit would not fully stem the tide of unstable ships crossing the Mediterranean. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte insisted that Europe should not take the brunt of blame. 'We also ask that Africa, the source of the problem, also collectively takes up its responsibility,' Rutte said. 'Last time I checked Libya was in Africa, not Europe.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande arrive at an EU emergency summit in Brussels seeking a solution to the migrants crisis . Over the past year, what little political structure Libya had has collapsed. There are two rival governments, neither with any real authority, and each fighting the other on the ground. Local militias hold sway around the country, some of them with hard-line Islamist ideologies, and the Islamic State group has emerged as a strong and brutal force. The makes any military action against traffickers there even more complicated. 'Any kind of military action can only be based on international law,' said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 'There are two possibilities: either a U.N. Security Council Resolution or a unity government in Libya. We have neither at the moment.' Europe itself was hardly a picture of unity when it came to the difficult issue of resettling migrants. Countries like Germany, Sweden, France and Italy have dealt with a disproportionate number of asylum requests while many eastern and Baltic member states take hardly any. Five of the 28 member states are handling almost 70 per cent of the migrants coming in. Still, despite the differences, Finland's prime minister Alexander Stubb was hopeful that this time Europe could put up a show of solidarity. 'I hope we'll get it right this time,' he said.","Funding increased to £7m a month for EU's border patrols in Mediterranean .

"A pound will buy you one and a half tins of beans, two packets of crisps – or an airport in Spain. Ciudad Real airport was built in 2009 at a cost of more €1billion – Spain’s economy having taken off – but was closed three years later when its parent company fell into financial difficulties.

"Julieane Jablonski, 38, was charged with providing marijuana to a minor and witness tampering . A Colorado mother has been arrested for allegedly giving her teenage son a pot brownie that caused him to jump out of a third-story glass window 'without hesitation.' In a bizarre twist, the alleged victim in the case, 19-year-old Austin Essig, took to the Fort Collins police department's Facebook page to describe the strange 'trip' he experienced after eating the brownie. His mother Julieane Jablonski, 38, was booked on suspicion of providing marijuana to a minor and felony tampering with a witness, the Fort Collins Police Department said on Wednesday. Detectives allege that Jablonski told the teen after he was hospitalized for the fall on April 14 'he needed to recant his statement to the police and lie about where the marijuana came from,' according to an arrest report obtained by the Coloradoan newspaper. After the incident, a Facebook user that appears to be Essig commented on the Fort Collins police post about the incident. 'It was quite the trip for a brownie, I can tell you that much,' he wrote on Tuesday. He added: 'I can say I followed dosage instructions (only ate one, as opposed to my mid - incident statement), but can't honestly comment on how I got ahold of it. 'I can also say that my reaction to the marijuana was far from normal, and that this isn't common at all. Currently researching the subject further.' Austin Essig, 19, jumped out of the third-floor window from this apartment complex earlier this month 'without hesitation' after eating a marijuana-laced brownie . 'It was quite a trip': The alleged victim in the case, Essig, commented on the police report about his own injury . The next day, detectives arrested his mother. Marijuana is legal to buy and consume recreationally in Colorado - but only for people over age 21. Buying marijuana for a teenager offers similar penalties to providing alcohol for minors in other states. Essig suffered non-life-threatening injuries when he jumped out of the third-story window - through the glass and all. Witnesses say he began acting strangely after consuming the pot brownie and then suddenly jump 'without hesitation.' Police confiscated what was left of the edible to test it for THC levels. Critics contend that the levels of the hallucinogen in Colorado marijuana is extremely high - often too high for people who are not regular users to tolerate. It was the latest of several incidents of pot users harming . themselves that authorities in Colorado have confronted since . retail sales of the drug began there last year.

"A 17-year old who spontaneously decided to run off for four days survived during his disappearance by eating from the fruit trees at his high school. Connor Sullivan, of Cupertino, California, attended his first period class at Monta Vista High School on Monday morning before disappearing for roughly 80 hours. After the junior returned home on his own Thursday night, police who had been searching for him learned that the teenager had never left the Bay Area town and was using the water fountains and Porta Potty on campus. Though search parties took off from the school, they could not find Sullivan, who said after his return that he slept under the bleachers every night, police told Daily Mail Online. Police and volunteers had searched (left) frantically for Connor Sullivan, (right) 17, of Cupertino, California, though the teenager was hiding at and around his high school . Sullivan reportedly survived by eating from the fruit trees at Monta Vista High School, which grow pineapple guavas and pear-like quinces (file photo) Sergeant James Jensen said that the teenager spoke with police on Thursday night, and said that he had spent most of his time around the school and in the foothills to the west. He is thought to have sustained himself on fruit growing in Cupertino residents' yards, as well as that on trees at his school. The school, which is about ten minutes' drive from the headquarters of tech giant Apple, has rows of pineapple guava fruit trees native to South America, according to its student newspaper. It also has a tree that bears quinces, yellow fruits native to Turkey that look similar to pears. Both quinces and pineapple guavas, which are also called feijoas, can be eaten raw. Police and 250 volunteers had searched frantically for the 5'5'' 150lb boy, according to ABC 7. His father Jeffrey and mother Jill Sullivan said that the disappearance of the hardworking track athlete was completely out of character. His parents Jill (left) and Jeffrey (right) said that Connor had never run away before and that the behavior was completely uncharacteristic for the hardworking track athlete . Sullivan said that he slept every night under the bleachers at the school near Apple's headquarters . Sullivan, who had never gone missing before, also spent time at Fremont Older Space Reserve park, where he would train for cross country races. He was said to have spent all of Monday hiking at the scenic reserve. Sullivan also told police that he spent one entire day under the bleachers at his school. In addition to school, the student also missed all of his practices. Police had searched for the teen, who does not have a car, at his school and in the surrounding neighborhood. Search parties had even gathered at the portable toilets he is thought to have used. Sullivan was reportedly stressed from school, though his family said that was not the reason he ran off and did not disclose the real cause. The teenager had originally agreed with police to do a press conference, though has now said that he will write a letter explaining his disappearance. Hundreds of volunteers gathered to look for the missing teenager, but could not find him even though he spent much of his time at and around the school .

"From model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's beloved wheatgrass-packed green juice to Victoria Beckham's favourite bee pollen breakfasts, there are plenty of stars who are walking adverts for the power of superfoods. Health bloggers and celebrities alike sing superfoods' praises and scientists publish countless studies into their health benefits. Each comes with its own promise. Indeed, acai berries have been linked to weight loss and cancer prevention, flax seeds are thought to help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease, while coconut oil has been hailed as a weight loss aid. But how do we know if they actually work when we've only become aware of them in the past few years? Scroll down for video .

Tipper Lewis, 43, from London, grew up on a farm and quickly became fascinated by the power of plants, Chinese medicine and organic produce. A vegan since the age of 18, she studied the power of herbs and plants at University and landed a job at Neal's Yard Remedies - the leading independent British retailer of organic natural health and beauty products. Tipper's wrinkle-free skin, boundless energy and the fact that she doesn't even have a doctor are surely testament to the power of superfoods . Tipper, left, aged 30, and, right, aged 43, studied herbs and plants in her teens and now she is the Head Herbalist at Neal's Yard Remedies where she keeps her finger on the pulse for up-and-coming superfoods and remedies . Speaking to FEMAIL about her love of superfoods, she said: 'I was taking them twenty years ago and they definitely weren't as fashionable back then but I've always loved them. 'People would laugh at me for having a bottle of green water on my desk at work but I just can't imagine living a different way. My healthy diet is definitely to thank for my energy levels. When I was eating badly as a student, I was grumpier and my mind didn't work as fast.' Tipper starts the day with a superfood-charged smoothie, packed with green powder, bee pollen and maca powder. For lunch, she grabs a healthy salad and dinner is often stir fry with hemp seeds.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her love of superfoods, Tipper, pictured on her allotment, said: 'I was taking them twenty years ago and they definitely weren't as fashionable back then but I've always loved them' She has also created countless healthy recipes, including her raw cacao chocolate, which is made using raw cacao powder. Unlike cocoa powder, cacao is not refined so is packed with the antioxidants and minerals that cocoa has stripped away. She replaces coffee with a matcha green tea, which is high in antioxidants and particularly catechins - the most potent and beneficial antioxidant. Thanks to her healthy diet, she rarely gets ill. 'I don't even have a doctor,' she admits. Her boyfriend has also jumped on the superfood bandwagon and takes bee pollen (the superfood loved by Victoria Beckham that contains almost all of the nutrients we need) to beat his hayfever. Tipper grew up on a farm and quickly became fascinated by the power of plants and Chinese medicine  after her parents, pictured, introduced her to organic produce . Tipper works behind the scenes at the UK's leading superfood supplier, so what big health trends can we look out for this year? 'Goldenberries are the new goji berries,' she said. 'They are amazing for your beauty, rich in antioxidants, protect your body and regulate blood sugar levels. They also help with collagen production so are amazing for keeping wrinkles at bay.' Whilst Tipper has quietly been consuming superfoods her whole life, she thinks celebrities such as Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have 'opened a door for the public' by professing their love of all things clean and lean. 'Celebrities have done so well in raising awareness that things that are good for you can also taste nice. I know this way of life isn't for everyone but I would love to see more people embracing it. 'I would love to see children eating superfoods. Watching them eat sugary cereal bars on the way to school is soul destroying,' she said. Super Feel-Good Golden Berry Cups .

"They were the biggest of the Ice Age giants, roaming the frozen plains of the Northern Hemisphere. But it seems the final days of the woolly mammoth were a sad struggle for survival. Genetic analysis of two woolly mammoth remains show that their population became so small that they had become chronically inbred. Scroll down for video . The last of the woolly mammoths (shown in the reconstruction above) were isolated on an Arctic island for around 5,000 years, forcing them to inbreed as their population dwindled until disappering 4,500 years ago . Researchers have concluded that the creatures clung on in just a tiny pocket of the Arctic, on an island that appears to have become cut off from the mainland. The study has also raised the prospect of bringing the giant mammal back to life using cloning techniques with modern elephants. Scientists claim to have taken a major step towards recreating the woolly mammoth by inserting more than a dozen of the creature's genes into the live DNA of an elephant. Researchers studied the structure of DNA from mammoths preserved in the Arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal’s genes. These were then integrated by experts at Harvard University in Massachusetts into the elephant genome - and functioned as normal DNA. A new method known as 'Crispr' - helping scientists make accurate changes to DNA - was used by genetics professor George Church, who replaced parts of elephant DNA with the mammoth genes . Other researchers have proposed using mammoth DNA to replace that of an elephant using a similar technique to the one used to clone Dolly the Sheep. However, many scientists fear these animals would be unable to survive in the modern world without their ancient habitat. Such techniques also can lead to deformities and health problems in the animals. However the researchers behind the genetic analysis have urged other scientists not to attempt this for fear of the suffering it may cause to the animals. Instead, they say their findings have revealed new insights into the evolutionary history and demise of the woolly mammoths. They have published full DNA sequences of one mammoth found in Oimyakon, northeast Siberia – thought to be around 45,000 years old – and another from one of the last surviving mammoths found on Wrangel Island, north of Russia in the Arctic Ocean. They found that the mammoths on Wrangel Island had been isolated for at least 5,000 years, eking out a meager existence there before dying out 4,500 years ago. Analysis showed that the parents of the mammoth found on Wrangel Island had been distant relatives, suggesting the population had been inbreeding. Dr Love Dalén, an associate professor of Bioinformatics and Genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History who took part in the study, said: ‘We found that the genome from one of the world’s last mammoths displayed low genetic variation and a signature consistent with inbreeding. ‘This is likely due to the small number of mammoths that managed to survive on Wrangel Island during the last 5,000 years of the species’ existence.’ The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Cell Biology, found that the mammoth genome only appeared to align with African elephant DNA by between 64 per cent and 76 per cent. Researchers extracted DNA from the remains of two woolly mammoths who died 36,000 years apart . Scientists have been able to extract DNA from mammoth hair (above) and tusks found across Siberia . Mammoths are thought to have evolved around 400,000 years ago in eastern Asia and is a close relative to the Asian elephant. The researchers analysis revealed that mammoths appear to have suffered significant setbacks around 250,000 to 300,000 years ago where their population was decimated. However, they then recovered before they experienced a further hit to their populations around 116,000 to 130,000 years ago. The population then appears to have remained stable until 12,000 years ago when their numbers were drastically reduced. The researchers believe the mammoths in Oimyakon and Wrangel separated around 50,000 years. Hunting by humans has long been thought to be what drove the mammoths to extinction while climate change has also been blamed. The researchers studied mammoth remains found at Oimyakon in Siberia and Wrangel Island (shown above) This mammoth tusk on Wrangel Island in Russia belonged to one of the last  mammoths before they died out . The new results suggest the animals were already in decline by the time humans began moving into Europe 45,000 years ago. Professor Hendrik Poinar, director of the Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University who was also involved in the research, said the DNA raises the prospect that mammoths could now be brought back from extinction. Organisations like the Long Now Foundation have said they hope to resurrect the mammoth. Professor Poinar said: ‘This discovery means that recreating extinct species is a much more real possibility, one we could in theory realize within decades. ‘I think in the future it will be inevitable that we will be able to do it, but the bigger question is should we do it. ‘With a complete genome and this kind of data, we can now begin to understand what made a mammoth a mammoth—when compared to an elephant—and some of the underlying causes of their extinction which is an exceptionally difficult and complex puzzle to solve.’","The last mammoths died out on an Arctic island around 4,500 years ago .

"A grandmother was left feeling 'sick and scared' after she received a chilling ransom demand for her stolen dog. Vivienne Garton, 65, was devastated her 10-year-old West Highland terrier Ben was snatched from her garden in Knowle West, Bristol, earlier this month. She began an appeal to find him and put up posters near her home, but shortly after she received two phone calls from an anonymous man threatening to cut up her pet unless she paid £500. Scared: Vivienne Garton, 65, has been left devastated after her West Highland terrier Ben was stolen. She put posters (pictured) up near her home but since received an anonymous call threatening to cut up the dog . The caller gave the address of an empty house in Bristol and a phone number which she handed to police, who are now investigating. Mrs Garton, who lives with her husband and four grandchildren aged between eight and 18, says a number of her posters have now been ripped down. 'I feel sick. I have had him for ten years - he is my little baby. I just want him home safe. I'm so worried. I don't know who could do that to someone,' she said. 'I don't know if it is a hoax or if he has really been stolen by someone. It is scary. It was a man on the phone and he sounded middle aged. He said he would cut Ben up.' Loving pet: Mrs Garton's 10-year-old dog is partially sighted, partially deaf and cannot walk long distances and has been missing for a fortnight . Ben, who is partially sighted, partially deaf and cannot walk long distances, disappeared from the family home on Sunday April 12. Mrs Garton, who suffers from arthritis, explained that she sent the dog outside because he was hassling her while she was cooking Sunday lunch. But when Ben failed to come back  she grew concerned and went outside to find a hole in the hedge. She said that while it was possible he could have escaped it was very out of character and was unlikely that he wouldn't return. She said: 'There was a little hole in the hedge that he might have got through, but it is very out of character for him not to come back. 'We went straight out looking for him but there has been no sign of him ever since. I am worried he has been stolen and somebody has him in their garage.' A social media campaign, started by her neighbours, is becoming increasingly popular in the hope of returning the pet. She added: 'Friends in the area have been great and I have so much support from people. We are all worried sick and must have driven about 300 miles in the past week just looking for him. 'Sometimes we cross paths with other people out doing the same thing. The entire family is worried and stressed out about him. We've always been a dog-loving family - I have had dogs ever since I was little. Ben is the smallest one we've ever had and he is a member of the family now.' A spokeswoman for Avon and Somerset police said: 'We have received reports of threatening phone calls in relation to a lost dog. We are investigating an incident of blackmail.' Devastated: Mrs Garton says she has been left feeling 'sick and scared' after receiving the calls, which have now been reported to the police are investigating an incident of blackmail .","Vivienne Garton, 65, was devastated when her 10-year-old dog was stolen .

"Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped. Most of the compensation consisted of stock valued at $100 million. It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday: Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed . Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by company.

"Earlier this month, a pregnant Canadian weather presenter received hate mail from viewers 'grossed out' by her appearance on their screens. The scathing critics told the six-months pregnant meteorologist Kristi Gordon that her 'front end looks like the Hindenburg and your rear end looks like a brick s***house.' Fans jumped to support her when Gordon read out excerpts from the letters and emails on TV, but it seems that abuse of pregnant TV presenters daring to get on with their jobs during their pregnancy is nothing new. Australian presenter and model Nicky Buckley famously soldiered on with her presenting job on The Sale of the Century after falling pregnant in 1997, continuing to wear the glamorous, figure-hugging gowns her job required of her. 'Never in my wildest dreams did I expect the barrage of abuse that was bestowed upon my unborn baby and me by a multitude of critics who were determined to dampen the joyous marvel of pregnancy,' Buckley, now 49, writes in her newly-released memoir. Scroll down for video . Pregnant and proud: Buckley copped heavy criticism for showing bump on TV but stood her ground . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia about the book, 'Nicky Buckley: A Memoir', she shared just how bad the criticism became. 'I was told I jammed fax machines at Channel 9 and newspapers - with faxes coming in from people commenting negatively.' 'At the time there wasn't any maternity wear except kaftans which covered you from head to toe, hiding your boobs and bump,' she said. Bitterness over bump: Buckley wore sexy dresses that revealed her bump,  shocking TV audiences, and hit back in magazine interviews saying she refused to bend to critics . TV Scandal: Nicky Buckley enraged public by staying on air throughout her nine month pregnancy . Family first: Buckley bucked preconceived notions of women in TV and continued to work to support family . As her role was to wear glamorous evening dresses and there wasn't adequate maternity wear available, she  just went up a size from her usual attire and got on with things. 'I wasn't out to raise the flag or cause a stir, I simply wanted to work – as was my right. Yet in doing so people had other opinions and thought I shouldn't be seen publicly with a bump.' 'I had a mortgage, people tend to forget  and put you in a bubble. But I still had a mortgage and do you think I should just stop and be taken off the air?' Game model: Game show host and model copped flack for her bump and continued to work to pay the bills . Glamorous to gritty: Despite her glamour role, Buckley says the pregnancy showed the ugly side to TV . 'I needed to pay the bills and I was happy with what's going on,' she said. 'Looking back I'm proud of how strong I was. I can't push the point hard enough, I was steadfast and strong, I was going to work and do my job.' 'I couldn't wait to share the news with my girlfriends but after the usual squeals of congratulations  they said ""what are you going to do about work?' she reflects in the book. A friend even made the shocking suggestion to Buckley that they could build her a podium to stand behind once she started to show. Host to husband: Buckley married her co-host Murray Bingham and subsequently had three children with him . While taken aback, she said she believes people saw her role as glamorous one and being pregnant clearly didn't fit with that image. 'Despite my blossoming belly and impending birth, unintentionally I had sparked a very public debate that divided a nation - was pregnancy  something to be ashamed of? Were pregnant women even attractive?  said Buckley. Not to mention the dress she wore on the runway at a Myer Fashion Festival that saw eyebrows raised. 'That caused a real stir. It was a dress with a cut out heart over the belly, people saw it outrageous but the designer and I thought it was beautiful and embraced the bump and fashion all at the same time.'

"All smiles: Sanjay Chaddah outside court yesterday . A property developer who falsely accused his neighbour's son-in-law of a racist assault in a row over a new driveway smirked yesterday as he walked free from court. Sanjay Chaddah concocted a 'tissue of lies', claiming Dean Paton had kicked him and called him a 'P**i' following the 18-month boundary dispute in a genteel village in the Wirral. But the move backfired when police discovered that the altercation had been caught on CCTV and cleared Mr Paton of any wrongdoing. Yesterday Chaddah, 43, who claimed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress, punched the air with delight as he strolled free from court after being given a six-month suspended sentence for common assault and perjury. Liverpool Crown Court heard he had been embroiled in an ongoing spat with neighbours Steve and Tricia Boden after he dug up part of the block paving on their drive to make way for an ornate wall and railings around his home in Raby Mere. Despite their objections, he carried on transforming his modest £300,000 four-bedroom detached home into what residents in the upmarket village describe as a 'Bollywood palace'. Things came to a head in July when Chaddah and his wife Deepa spotted their neighbours' son-in-law Mr Paton moving a fence panel on the day their new driveway was being laid. Chaddah was so incensed he charged at Mr Paton, 31, and knocked him over. Police were called and Chaddah falsely accused the archaeologist of racially aggravated assault, only to be caught out by frame-by-frame footage from his neighbours' CCTV cameras. Last night Mr Paton said he was relieved the case was finally over. But he added: 'If I'd been prosecuted for racially aggravated assault you can bet I would have ended up in jail, not with a suspended prison sentence. 'I'm married with two kids but would have lost my business and my livelihood. Being branded racist – I couldn't really have been accused of anything worse. 'Chaddah is a bully who had to be told he couldn't take the law into his own hands.' Another neighbour said: 'Everyone's had problems with them (the Chaddahs). They've built this Bollywood-style palace for themselves and don't give a monkey's about others in the street not being able to get in and out of their drives for builders.' The court heard the dispute began when Mr and Mrs Boden, both 61, returned from a two-week holiday to Cuba to find their block paving had been dug up to make way for the Chaddahs' new 3ft tall wall and railings. Around 18 months later, Mr Paton, who was visiting his in-laws, tried to remove a fence panel the Bodens claimed was sticking out on to their property. Chaddah charged at Mr Paton, catching the taller man side-on and knocking him over. CCTV: Chaddah (top) attacks Mr Paton in the footage which cleared Mr Paton of any wrongdoing . The disputed fence which led to the incident. Mr Chaddah's home is on the left . Police were called and Chaddah invented the assault, adding: 'He kicked my leg and punched me to the side of the face.' William Beardmore, prosecuting, said: 'It was a tissue of lies.' Judge Mark Brown said the offence was particularly serious because Chaddah had claimed the 'assault' was racially motivated. He told the father of two: 'Society has an abhorrence of those who use racist remarks. By making that allegation against Mr Paton you put him in a very difficult position.' He ordered Chaddah, who pleaded guilty, to complete 120 hours' of unpaid work, pay his victim £250 compensation and pay £300 in costs. John Weate, defending, said Chaddah was sorry, adding: 'He did the wrong thing.'","Property developer falsely accused neighbour's son-in-law of racist assault .

"Put away the flip flops and the sunglasses, as an Arctic airmass is on the way. After one of the warmest Aprils on record, there will be a dramatic change next week with temperatures set to fall by around ten degrees. The plunge means Britain will go from being hotter than Turkey and Ibiza to colder than Moscow, Stockholm and Finland in a matter of days. It also threatens to cause a wet and miserable time for the thousands of runners taking part in Sunday's London Marathon. Scroll down for video . Red sky in the morning, shepherd's warning: Forecasters predict that temperatures are set to plunge by 10C . People were making the most of the sunshine outside Exeter Cathedral before the Arctic airmass arrives . Britain is set to go from being hotter than Turkey and Ibiza to colder than Moscow, Stockholm and Finland in a matter of days . The Met Office has forecast rain through the morning in the capital with the chance of thunderstorms and heavy downpours early on. According to forecasters we will begin to see the Arctic airmass, also known as a polar maritime mass, on Saturday after it has blasted over from Iceland. 'It is going to be increasingly unsettled and colder across the nation over the coming week,' said Laura Young spokesperson for the Met Office. 'We have had a three week period of glorious sunshine and people get used to it, this will be a shock to the system. 'There are people in Devon wearing flip flops at the moment and next week they will need to bring their boots back out.' The grim forecast comes after Britain basked in what looked to be one of the warmest Aprils on record. After temperatures rocketed into the 70s, they were expected to dip to around 8C (46F) in the north and between 12C (53F) and 14C (57F) in the south. Overnight they may also plummet to below zero across the country, experts warned. Enjoy it while it lasts: Torrential rain, thunder and even hail have been predicted by forecasters . Piers Corbyn, forecaster for WeatherAction, said: 'Next week is certainly going feel like a return winter and will be very different to the warm weather we have just had. 'A cold plunge is on the way again the result of this wildly deviating jet stream which has led to ups and downs in the weather through the first part of this year.

"An art student at Syracuse University has taken a positive stand on self love and is sharing her secrets to accepting her flaws through a series of stunning self-portraits - and motivational speaking. Three years ago on New Year's Day, LaNia Roberts was standing in front of her mirror, vowing to change herself - but also to love herself more, after enduring years of cruel comments from her peers, and an ever-present feeling of self-doubt. Now, at only 18, LaNia is sharing details of how she learned to accept herself for who she is – and how, through her love of art, she learned to find beauty within her own appearance. Picture perfect: 18-year-old Syracuse painting student LaNia Roberts recently gave a speech at the university on learning to love one's self unconditionally . The artist: LaNia specializes in self-portraits, which she began painting in high school . Earlier this month, LaNia gave a moving motivational speech titled 'Love Yourself Unconditionally', during which the Louisville native LaNia recounted her journey to self-acceptance and eagerly shared the lessons she has learned. The path to this realization came after LaNia made that New Year's resolution in 2012. She joined the track team at her high school and lost 50 pounds, eventually being able to stand in front of that mirror again and call herself beautiful.  She also began painting self-portraits as a means of embracing her own appearance and finding beauty within every flaw. 'Little did I know that love was so conditional,' LaNia explained in her speech, reports The Daily Orange. 'It was like accepting the terms and conditions that you check when you're making a new Facebook or something.' But then over the summer of junior year, LaNia gained the weight back. 'Every pound that I gained, I lost a pound of love,' she said. 'So you can do the math of how much love I lost for myself. I would look at myself in the mirror and say, ""Oh my gosh.""' Lessons learned: LaNia's journey began after making a New Year's resolution to lose weight and love herself more back in 2012 . Talented: Before coming to Syracuse, the Louisville native had been accepted to a highly-selective art program at The Kentucky Governor’s School for the Arts . However, her paintings tell a different story. 'When it comes to painting a self-portrait, I could turn those things that I didn't really love into something that was beautiful not only to me, but to others,' LaNia told Cosmo. 'Beauty is learned. Beauty is something that we have learned over time,' LaNia told Cosmo. 'Now I'm actually understanding that it's not other people accepting me that leads to happiness.' Focusing more on her artistic flair than her physical appearance, LaNia became more confident, more outspoken, and vowed to take more risks. She was accepted to a highly-selective art program at The Kentucky Governor’s School for the Arts and even had the confidence to confess to a man that she thought he was 'the most beautiful man on this damn earth.' But for LaNia, the real moment of self-acceptance came one night when she was getting ready to go out, and noticed that her jeans were not fitting quite right. 'Little did I know that love was so conditional': LaNia lost 50 pounds after deciding she wanted to change her appearance, but later gained the weight back, which caused her to change her outlook . Taking the stage: LaNia recently decided to share her journey to self-acceptance with her peers . 'My love-handles was poking out a little bit, so I looked in the mirror and said ""Oh, that doesn’t look too good, but somebody’s going to love them someday,""' she explained. LaNia says that she realized then that she could not count on others for validation on loving herself, because, as she told the Syracuse crowd: ' you are the only thing that you are promised your entire life.' 'We learn that if something is flawed, it's supposed to become something else,' she added to Cosmo. 'And I am learning that I, LaNia, my body, everything, it does not need to be like something else.'","LaNia Roberts is a freshman painting major at Syracuse University, in New York, and specializes in creating colorful self-portraits .

"Comcast today confirmed it has abandoned its bid to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2billion and  create a mega-size TV and internet provider. 'Today, we move on. Of course, we would have liked to bring our great products to new cities, but we structured this deal so that if the government didn’t agree, we could walk away,' Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said in a statement. On Wednesday night, it emerged that Federal Communications regulators decided that merger wasn't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock that would have bogged the deal down for months and may have killed it entirely. This followed fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like Disney and 21st Century Fox. Scroll down for video . Comcast CEO Brian Roberts declared, 'today we move on' in announcing that the company was abandoning its bid to buy Time Warner Cable . Mega-merger: The $45.2billion deal would have merged Comcast's 30million customers with Time Warner Cable's 11million. The new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers . Comcast, already the biggest cable and internet provider in the country, has 30million subscribers. Time Warner is the no. 2 cable company in the US and the fourth-largest broadband TV and internet provider. 'Comcast NBCUniversal is a unique company with strong momentum. Throughout this entire process, our employees have kept their eye on the ball and we have had fantastic operating results. I want to thank them and the employees of Time Warner Cable for their tireless efforts,' Roberts said. The proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid TV market with more than 27million customers across the nation. On Wednesday night, the Wall Street Journal revealed that FCC regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size TV and internet provider was in the public interest. Staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars. The hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline, at the very least. Columbia University professor and net neutrality activist Tim Wu tweeted: 'Comcast merger is dead.' CNN's Brian Stelter reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the FCC decision. 'This is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal I can remember,' said S&P Capital IQ Tuna Amobi. One concern, for example, is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online-only video providers for connecting to its network. Dish, the satellite TV company behind the new Web video service Sling TV, and Netflix are opposed to the deal. Another charge is that Comcast hasn't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought NBCUniversal. The company says it has, except for one circumstance when the FCC found it wasn't promoting a stand-alone Internet service. Comcast says it fixed that. Pushback against the merger  picked up in the last couple weeks.","Merger between two largest cable companies have given the new firm control of 57percent of broadband internet market and 30percent of paid TV .

Explanation: Wildlife experts who studied the skeleton told Fox News they appear to be from a young dog . Sightings of the animal have been reported throughout Mexico and much of the US, particularly in the Southwest, where it is usually determined that suspected chupacabras are just emaciated, sickly coyotes. The description of the chupacabra varies, but typically those who claim to see the animal describe it as being about the size of a small bear, with a row of spines along its back. In 2004, a rancher near San Antonio killed a supposed chupacabra that he claimed had been killing his livestock. DNA from the animal later revealed that it was a coyote with demodectic or sarcoptic mange. In a dozen other cases where the suspected chupacabra's body has been discovered, DNA testing showed that the animal was some sort of wild canine with severe skin disorders, particularly mange. LEGEND OF EL CHUPACABRA . The word comes from two Spanish words - 'chupar', to suck, and 'cabra', goat. The first reported sighting was in 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood. Thus, the legend of the livestock killing, vampire-like chupacabra was born. Since then, the legendary beast has been spotted across the Americas and even the world. A Mexican incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on El Chupacabra in 2012. Earlier this year, yet another Mississippi sighting came when a Leake County man actually shot and killed what he claimed was El Chupacabra. Even a Belarusian town had a Chupacabra sighting this past July . SCIENCE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN . Scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be El Chupacabra are actually wildlife like coyotes, foxes, and stray dogs infested with parasites. Most commonly pointed to is the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes mange. Mange is a painful, potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel, making for an even more ghoulish looking beast. In humans, Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies and a consequent itchy, painful rash as the parasites burrow around, leaving their feces under the skin. 'Goat sucker': The legend of El Chupacabra likely originates from a 1995 case in Puerto Rico where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds. It has been described as hairless, or as having spines along its back, and as having blue or red eyes .","Vonda Thedford, 55, said she was driving along a Pittsburg County rural road earlier this month when she spotted the mysterious carcass .
When she stopped to look at the dead creature, she was disturbed to see it had 'a little truck' in place of a nose, 'little toes' and 'hair on its tail'
The restaurant worker says the images have left people baffled and no-one has been able to identify the bloated and hairless critter .
However, wildlife experts who studied the animal's skeleton told Fox News it appears to be that of a young dog ."
"Cleared: 53-year-old Graeme Finlay, a former naval serviceman . A cruise ship passenger was yesterday cleared of beating up two elderly holidaymakers in a row over rudeness at the dinner table. Graeme Finlay, 53, went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner. After being cleared Finlay, an ex-naval serviceman from Glasgow, said: 'It's been hell. It's put me off boats forever.' The frail couple accused Finlay of an unprovoked attack that left the grandfather with a gash to his forehead and his wife with two fractured vertebrae. But the 16-stone gas worker insisted he only acted in self-defence when hit by Mr Phillips wielding his crutch and denied attacking his wife. The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. He told how he had put on five-stone by comfort eating since his arrest more than a year ago, and added: 'I'm really delighted with the verdicts and very, very relieved.' He said: 'It's been very stressful for the last year and a half. I go to church and I'm on the golf club committee, and it's been awful seeing my face in the news. 'I'm very sorry about everything that happened that night, I really am, but I told the truth in the court and I'm thankful that the jury believed me.' In his evidence, the defendant recalled how he was travelling alone on the Canary Islands cruise in January last year and felt shunned when he joined two couples – including Mr and Mrs Phillips – for dinner in the restaurant. After looking at the menu there was an 'awkward' silence and he moved to another table with a couple he had previously met. Both Finlay and the elderly couple spent the evening drinking separately and enjoying the musical entertainment. According to Finlay they later found themselves in a lift together and he rebuked the couple for their rudeness towards him at dinner. Finlay claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of hot chocolate at him, swore and struck him with his crutch. He told the court: 'I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself, I covered my face with my arms, I didn't want my eye poked out.' Innocent: The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm . Cruise: Finlay went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner (file photo) He described to the court how he swung his arms outwards from his face and felt them connect with Mr Phillips. The 'victims' insisted they had not argued with Finlay or ignored him at dinner and were subjected to a vicious assault as they headed to bed following a relaxing evening. Mrs Phillips briefly lost consciousness when she fell against a wall. In her evidence, she said: 'I saw Ron lying on the bulkhead and this great big guy going boof, boof, boof (she swung a punching motion). 'He must have hit him five times. I put my hand on his arm and told him 'leave him alone you will kill him.' Finlay was later forced to leave the ship and make his own way home. He was interviewed by police and charged.","Elderly couple accused Graeme Finlay of knocking them unconscious on boat .

"A 16-year-old schoolboy is fighting for his life in a coma after being driven to attempt suicide following months of bullying by a gang who slashed him in the face. Bradley Parkes was discovered hanging in the woods with a suicide note saying taking his own life was easier than what he was going through. His mother Tiffany, 35, shared a picture of her son in hospital and said he had been tormented for months by a gang of teenagers in Coventry. She described how her son had been robbed at knifepoint several times and even slashed in the face. Schoolboy Bradley Parkes, 16, is fighting for his life in a coma after a suicide attempt. His mother shared this picture saying: 'Hope all you b******s are happy my son is fighting for his life' 'It all started in about August last year and Bradley has even been held at knifepoint,' she told the Coventry Telegraph. 'One time he was walking from one friend's house to another and this gang robbed all three of them. 'They even cut his face with a knife and told him not to tell people. He's even had his hand broken. 'Every time they see him they just take everything off him. People know all about this gang and they are arrested for all sorts.' Bradley's devastated family are at his bedside at Birmingham Children's Hospital and they have been warned to prepare for anything including brain damage. Bradley was discovered hanging in the woods with a suicide note saying taking his own life was easier than what he was going through . Ms Parkes, a mother-of-five, said she wanted to do everything in her power to help her son pull through. 'He's in an induced coma at the moment and they think he has swelling on the brain,' she said. 'The doctors have said the severity seems medium at the moment, but they've said I should prepare for anything from him not waking up to having possible brain damage. The Manchester United fan was found unconscious in Willenhall Woods yesterday afternoon. He had just passed his first course at Ernesford Grange School and was planning to go to college. His mother was joined at his bedside by daughters Beyonce, 12, and Nevaeh, ten months, and sons Logan, eight, and four-year-old Blane. She said: 'He left a suicide note saying he was taking his own life as it was easier than what he was going through.' Ms Parkes said the bullying escalated after Bradley gave a statement to the police about the gang, who are aged between 14 and 18. 'He's been called a grass and all sorts,' she said. 'When he was held at knifepoint we decided enough was enough and went to the police. 'The other boy who was also robbed was too scared to make a statement, but Bradley wanted to. 'One of the gang members was charged and is now on remand in prison. He's up in court next month. 'They have smashed people's windows, vandalised people's homes and even set fire to someone using a deodorant can and a lighter. Bradley's devastated family are at his bedside at Birmingham Children's Hospital and they have been warned to prepare for anything . 'It left the person with burns on their stomach. Since that, all the grass stuff started and it made Bradley's life hell.' She slammed West Midlands Police for failing to take her repeated complaints seriously. 'I have gone to the police lots of times but it doesn't do anything. And not many people do go to the police as they are scared. I'm running out of options,' she said. Friends and family have left messages of support on Bradley's Facebook page. Alyssa Crawley wrote: 'Stay strong bradley you can pull through it', while Jae Williams said: 'Keep fighting brad been with u since the start of school i know you can do this'.

"It has no bathroom, no mains electricity and the only way to reach it is by boat or a novelty 'Noddy' train. But that hasn't stopped this modest timber shed being put up for sale for £230,000 – making it one of Britain's most expensive beach huts. Measuring just 15ft by 10ft, the remote beach hut on Mudeford Spit in Christchurch, Dorset, is the same price as a five-bedroom house in Herefordshire and more than a detached four-bedroom house in Kingswood, Hull. Owners will also have to shell out between £2,500 and £4,000 a year in ground rent to Christchurch Borough Council for use of the hut which can sleep up to five people. A beach hut (pictured) on desirable Mudeford Spit in Christchurch, Dorset, has gone on the market for £230,000 - the same price as a family home in many parts of Britain .

Hut 39  commands spectacular views across the Solent, although the vista is presently blighted by a rubbish skip dumped on the beach for hut owners to use for their over-winter repairs. Despite their hefty price tags, the huts at Mudeford have no mains water or electricity, although this one does have a solar panel for 12v electric lights and power, a fridge and a full-size gas cooker. It has a kitchen, living area, mezzanine sleeping area and a sun terrace with incredible views over  Christchurch Bay to the Needles and the Isle of Wight. Owners can only sleep at the huts between March and October, although they can visit any time of year, and they have to share a communal shower block.

The hut can sleep ten (at a squash) with a first floor mezzanine, two sofa beds and a pull-out double bed, and it has a small kitchen area and fridge freezer for the £270,000 price-tag . The beach hut's remote location means it can only be reach by boat or a novelty 'Noddy' train, followed by a half-mile hike across the dunes. It boasts a desirable position on the end of a row near the river entrance, meaning there is nothing but open space next to it. The current owner, who doesn't want to be named, is selling the hut privately. Steve Barratt, chairman of the Mudeford Beach Hut Association, said: 'Most huts these days have solar panels to meet lighting and entertainment needs and most have fridges, making the overall living experience better. They are a home from home. 'The main benefit of being in a hut is that even if the weather is changeable and you would not consider visiting the beach from home, being there means that as soon as the rain stops you can open the doors to enjoy the natural beauty of the sandbank. 'In the summer thousands of visitors come to the beaches for the day and as a hut owner you can have the benefit of a busy seaside scene that will evaporate when the visitors leave and by 7pm the beach becomes a quiet, social retreat you can share with your beach friends.'

"With Britons downing a caffeine-shake-inducing average of 70 million cups of coffee per day, Pret has revealed a secret that the nation may want take note of - how to get a free cup. Clive Schlee, chief executive of the coffee giant, revealed he has given his staff the power to hand out a coffee on the house to people they like or fancy. 'The staff have to give away a certain number of hot drinks and food every week,' Mr Schlee said. Scroll down for video . FEMAIL writer Deni Kirkova travelled to four different Pret A Manger shops in London to find out what it takes to get a free coffee from staff. Here she is after failing to secure a freebie at their Gloucester Road store . 'They will decide ""I like the person on the bicycle"" or ""I like the guy in that tie"" or ""I fancy that girl or that boy."" So, do the staff at Pret ever take advantage of their enabled good will? And what does it take to secure a free morning caffeine hit? FEMAIL decided to find out. Deni Kirkova, 24, paid a visit to six different Prets across London. On three of the visits, she wore no make-up, her glasses and a casual outfit consisting of jeans and a plain top. Before paying a visit to the next three coffee shops, she amped up the glamour by removing her glasses, applying a full face of make-up and donning a little red dress with a fair share of cleavage and leg on show. Deni then returned to High Street Kensington to find out whether she could bag a free coffee in her glam getup - and went into the South Kensington branch twice to find out if the result would differ depending on whether it was a man or woman serving. Here's how Deni - who didn't tell the staff she was a journalist until after she had been handed her drink - got on... Deni, dressed 'plainly', fails to get a free coffee at Pret in High Street Kensington (l) and Notting Hill Gate . Deni paid a visit to Pret's High Street Kensington, Notting Hill Gate and Queensway outlets, where she tried three different approaches: nonchalant, sad and friendly. Dressed in her casual attire, she popped into High Street Kensington's Pret just as she normally would: making little effort but still being polite. She left with a coffee - and a dent in her purse. At Notting Hill Gate's shop, she decided to put her acting skills to good use. She said: 'It was a fellow female who served me, she was really glamorous herself and I just figured that flirting was out of the question here. 'So, I went for the ""sad"" approach. I told her how bad my day had been and asked her how she was but while she smiled a lot, she still charged me. Feeling annoyed, I paid and left.' At the Queensway shop, Deni was feeling lucky. Makeup-free Deni Kirkova gets a free hot chocolate from friendly barista, Dean, at Pret A Manger, Queensway . She said: 'As soon as I walked in, I had a feeling I would get a free coffee. I just felt more confident and the barista guy looked cool. It wasn't busy so I thought it could work. 'I smiled but didn't try hard and asked how he was. It worked as he called me sweetie! 'I asked for a small hot chocolate and didn't get my purse out. He handed it to me and said ""Happy St George's Day; don't worry about it"".' Deni then revealed that she was a journalist on a mission and asked him to divulge the reason why he gave her a free coffee - and how other people can get one, too. Deni fails to get a free coffee at Pret A Manger, Gloucester Road . Deni returns to South Kensington and manages to bag a free cookie . 'The main reason I give out free things - and I have no quota and give out around 300 a month - is when someone is nice,' he explained. 'I am not impressed by the ladies who come in and flirt, batting their eyelids and twirling their hair, nor those who are grumpy and take it out on the staff.' Deni then swapped her casual clothes for her 'glamorous' look and headed to Gloucester Road, where she had to pay for a hot chocolate from a female barista. The same thing happened at South Kensington on her first visit. She decided to try her luck again, this time making sure she got served by a male barista, who gave her a free cookie because of her 'beautiful smile'. Deni asks Xaxa to recommend a cake - and in the end she decides on a cookie . Deni with Xaxa, who gave her a free cookie at Pret A Manger, South Kensington . She managed to wangle a free mocha in Victoria station's Pret from a chap named Nacer, who wanted to 'make her day'. Finally, to round off the day, she went back to High Street Kensington to try get a freebie dressed a bit more glamorous - but was made to pay for her espresso. The verdict? Deni said: 'The glam outfit got me more freebies but I don't think it's all about that. 'As Dean said, he's not interested in giving out freebies to girls who come in batting their eyelashes and twirling their hair nor those who come in in a bad mood and take it out on him. 'So don't try to flirt a freebie off a barista or try to make them feel sorry for you - it's all about radiating happiness, a wide smile, and spreading the joy. 'Although as the experiment shows - a little red dress won't hurt...!' Deni Kirkova gets a free mocha from barista Nacer at Pret A Manger, Victoria . Deni tries Pret A Manger, High Street Kensington, once more - this time in the red dress - and still nothing . In response to FEMAIL's undercover work, a spokesperson for Pret said: 'The giveaways are something we’ve been doing for a number of years, and have never been a secret. 'We often get feedback from customers about how our shop teams have really brightened up their day, just through one small gesture of giving them a treat on the house. 'There aren’t any rules, it’s about random acts of kindness. Team members tell us they often give away treats to their regulars and customers they think are in need of cheering up. It’s our way of empowering our team members and giving something back to our loyal customers, and we get great feedback from both.'

"Big beauty: Tibetan mastiffs can weigh 80kg . Just a year ago they could command prices of up to £1.2million each. But Tibetan Mastiffs are now so unpopular in China they are being sent to slaughterhouses – and their meat put into cheap hotpots. The dogs' dramatic decline in fortune is being partly blamed on the Chinese government's wide-reaching anti-corruption crackdown. Previously, wealthy businessmen would give the prized mastiffs to officials in the hope of influencing their decisions. Luo Yi, general manager of China's largest Tibetan Mastiff puppy farm, told People's Daily Online: 'The anti-corruption drive means people not daring to hand them out as gifts - nor would anyone take one as a gift.' It is also thought recent bans on owning dogs of more than 50kg in several Chinese cities - including Beijing, Zhengzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin - has had a huge impact on the breed's popularity. Tibetan Mastiffs – which were traditionally used in Tibet to herd other animals and are known for their loyalty - can weigh up to 80kg. China's mastiff market collapse was revealed after animal-welfare workers rescued a group of the dogs that were being transported to a slaughterhouse. The abattoir they were heading to provides hotpot meat for restaurants. The dogs' skin can also be used for leather belts. Rescuers said they found the 20 mastiffs in cramped cages. A third of the dogs were already dead and none had been given food or water for three days. Several were suffering from broken bones. Shocking trade: Twenty Tibetan mastiffs were recently found crammed into cages on their way to a slaughterhouse like the dogs in this picture - taken on a motorway in the Chinese capital Beijing in 2009 . It is feared that across China hundreds of the dogs are meeting such a cruel fate. Mastiffs are also being stolen from the streets by ruthless gangs, who sell them to the slaughterhouses, say animal charities. Unscrupulous breeders are also offloading their 'imperfect' specimens to the abattoirs. Luo Yi, whose puppy farm is in Tibet, said some of his fellow breeders had damaged the quality of the breed to make more money. 'Driven by profits there was a lot of cross-breeding which resulted in a deterioration of the Tibetan mastiff in terms of appearance as well as temperament,' he explained. There was now a glut of poor-quality dogs that can't be sold, he added. Loyal: Tibetan mastiffs, like the one here, were originally used by people in Tibet to herd other animals . In their heyday: A visitor plays with one of the dogs at a Tibetan mastiff show in Shenyang city four years ago . Meanwhile, Chen Youjun a specialist in Tibetan mastiff photography, said: 'The rapid pace of urbanisation across China has made more and more people now realise Tibetan mastiffs are not animals well-suited to city living.' The breed's boom began in 2005 and led to the dogs being seen as status symbols. Just 13 months ago one puppy sold for £1.2million, which is thought to be the highest price ever paid for a dog. A property develop bought the golden-haired one-year-old from breeder Zhang Gengyun in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Mr Zhang said of his dogs: 'They have lion's blood and are top-of-the-range mastiff studs.'

"They are some of the most violent events on the planet, throwing out millions of tonnes of gas, ash and molten rock with each eruption. Yet the majority of the world’s volcanoes are found deep underwater where immense water pressure does weird things to the lava that bubbles out of them. Now scientists have finally been able to record one of these eruptions as it happens to discover the sound it makes - and they are surprisingly quiet for such a violent event. Scroll down to watch and listen to an underwater volcano erupting . The majority of the world’s volcanoes are found deep underwater and now scientists have been able to record one of these eruptions as it happens to discover the sound it makes. The bubbling lava erupting from the volcanic vent Hades (above) produced a distinctive acoustic signature . Rather than the explosive roar emitted by their cousins on land, underwater volcanoes give off a muted thrum instead. However, the research could allow scientists to monitor undersea volcanoes far more effectively than they have before. Volcanoes lurking hidden under the world's oceans may play a far greater role in climate change than previously though. Scientists found that underwater volcanoes, which were long assumed to ooze lava at relatively steady rates, in fact erupt in pulses. A new study has shown that these submarine eruptions follow regular cycles that can range from just a couple of weeks to 100,000 years. The researchers claim these eruptions appear to be linked to changes in the Earth's orbit that occur over time. Surprisingly the researchers also found that these eruptions also appear to be clustered during the first six months of each year. The findings may now mean that models predicting how human activity will change the climate will need to be adjusted. Volcanic eruptions are known to throw huge amounts of gas into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide that are thought to increase global warming. However, volcanoes also release aerosol gases that are now known to reduce global warming by creating a reflective barrier against the sun. Using their unique sound signature, researchers will be able to detect different types of eruptions and record the gases being released far more accurately. Bob Dziak, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Newport, Oregon who led the research, said: ‘Detecting seafloor volcanism is important because it is a very significant process in terms of chemical impacts on the ocean and natural hazards. ‘Even though roughly 70 per cent of Earth’s volcanic activity occurs under the water, it has remained largely unobserved. ‘So, the more of these events that we can detect remotely using acoustics, the more we can understand Earth’s processes and how the planet works.’ Underwater volcanoes are known to be widespread on the floor of the world's oceans at joins in the tectonic plates. Most are located in the deep ocean, where their activity can be difficult to measure, although some in shallow water can erupt with enough lava to create new islands. Others erupt with explosive results. A recent study found that emissions from underwater volcanoes may play a far greater role in influencing the climate than had previously been believed. Rather than oozing lava at relatively steady rates, they in fact erupt in pulses that follow regular cycles ranging from just a couple of weeks to 100,000 years. In the latest study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the scientists used an underwater vehicle to visit the West Mata Volcano, 3,937 feet (1,200 metres) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean near Samoa. Eruptions from underwater volcanoes can sometimes form new islands like this one off the coast of Japan. A recent study found that emissions from underwater volcanoes may play a far greater role in influencing the climate than had previously been believed . They found different eruptions were occurring at two of the volcano’s vents – nicknamed Hades and Prometheus. Hades produced large lava bubbles that were released slowly, while Prometheus gave off explosive releases of tiny gas bubbles. They managed to film the eruptions as they happened and using hydrophones, recorded the sound they produced. They then analysed the acoustic signatures produced by each explosion, showing they are different. The graph above shows the acoustic signature as lava bubbles from Hades volcano (marked by red arrows) Scientists have struggled to study underwater volcanoes like the one above as they are hard to spot erupting. Using their unique sound signature, researchers will now be able to detect different types of eruptions and record the gases being released far more accurately . This video of Mount Tavurvur erupting on 29 August 2014 shows what volcanoes above ground sound like .","Geologists used undersea vehicles to record  two underwater volcanic vents - called Hades and Prometheus - as they erupted near Samoa .

"The family of Everybody Loves Raymond actor Sawyer Sweeten are said to be  in 'absolute shock' at the child star taking his own life because he exhibited no suicidal warning signs, his manager said. Sweeten, 19, shot himself in the head while visiting a family member's home in Texas on Thursday morning. His manager, Dino May, told Us Weekly there were no signs of trouble prior to him taking his own life in the upstairs part of the house while family members were downstairs. May said: 'Everybody was shocked. 'There was no depression, no nothing. He was a good kid. Teenage stuff, but no depression, no signs or anything.' The young actor, who appeared in 139 episodes of the popular US sitcom, was said by his manager to be anti-drugs, very quiet and very shy. Scroll down for videos . Pictured front left: Sawyer Sweeten stands alongside the Everybody Loves Raymond cast (L-R - Brad Garrett, Monica Horan, Madlyn Sweeten, Sawyer Sweeten, Sullivan Sweeten, Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Doris Roberts, Peter Boyle) Shock death: Child star, Sawyer Sweeten, seen riding on a motorcycle last month, killed himself while visiting family in Texas yesterday. He was found with a gunshot wound to his head . When news of the suicide broke, actor and comedian, Ray Romano, 57, who worked with Sawyer for nine years starting from when he was just a 16-month-old baby, said he was 'terribly saddened, by the news'. He added: 'He was a wonderful and sweet kid to be around. Just a great energy whenever he was there. My heart breaks for him, his family, and his friends during this very difficult time.' Sawyer appeared in 139 episodes of the popular US sitcom and also took small parts in television shows Even Stevens and Frank McKlusky C.I alongside his twin brother Sullivan in the early 2000s. The teenager played Geoffrey Barone on Everybody Loves Raymond, while his twin brother played Michael. Their older sister Madylin also played their older sibling on the show, Ally. 'This morning a terrible family tragedy has occurred. We are devastated to report that our beloved brother, son, and friend, Sawyer Sweeten, took his own life. He was weeks away from his 20th birthday,' said Madylin in a statement. 'At this sensitive time, our family requests privacy and we beg of you to reach out to the ones you love.' Sibling actors: Sawyer Sweeten is pictured, left, in 2010 alongside his sister Madylin and brother Sullivan who also both starred in the show .

Sawyer's mother Elizabeth posted a photo on Facebook on Wednesday saying how much she loved her three oldest children. She also shared a post on Facebook last Thursday that showed her and her oldest sons bowling with the family, and one on Easter of the extended family celebrating the holiday. Sawyer's Raymond costar Doris Roberts paid tribute to him on Facebook, writing; 'It is with great sadness that I learned the news that Sawyer Sweeten, who played my grandson Geoffrey Barone on Everybody Loves Raymond, died at his family's home in Texas. 'He was a very sweet young man who will be dearly missed. Make sure your loved ones know how much you care about them, and please check in with them if you haven't touched base with them for a while. It's very important to keep in touch.' Patricia Heaton, his television mother, wrote; 'Sawyer Sweeten was a funny and exceptionally bright young man. He is gone from us far too soon.' Everybody Loves Raymond ran from 1996 - when the twin boys were just 16 months old - to 2005. The child actor, centre, appeared on stage with the show's cast in 2010 to accept a gong at the 8th Annual TV Land Awards . Devastated family: Sawyer, left, Sullivan and Madilyn with their other sister Maysa (second from right) Television mother: Patricia Heaton, who played Sawyer's mother Debra Barone on the hit show, wrote this message on Twitter . Based on the stand-up career of lead actor Ray Romano, the show, based on Long Island, was primarily about his strained relationship with his parents and his brother . The children, especially the twins, had smaller, cameo moments and in the beginning were too young to speak. The series developed a loyal following in the US, and was shown by Channel 4 in the UK. Sawyer and his brother hadn't acted since the show finished, though their sister did go on to appear in several films, including American Splendor and Eagle Eye. She continues to act and lives in Los Angeles. The three siblings last appeared together in public at the 8th Annual TV Land Awards in 2010. They also have a younger sister Maysa, and four half-siblings; Emma, Guiliana, Elliette and Jaymeson. Madylin wrote on Facebook Thursday evening; 'At this time I would like to encourage everyone to reach out to the ones you love. Let them have no doubt of what they mean to you.' In March, Sawyer' mother's husband Jerry posted a photo to Facebook of Sawyer on a motorcycle, writing; 'Sawyer is riding around on a really kick ass 883 Iron!!! So proud that both my sons have done so well in learning how to ride!' Sawyer (left) and his brother Sullivan started working on Raymond when they were just 16-months-old . Sawyer was born in Brownwood, Texas in 1995, and also had roles in the film Frank McKlusky, C.I. and the popular television show Even Stevens. The cast of Everybody Loves Raymond was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series seven times by the Screen Actors Guild, winning the coveted Actor in 2003. The show meanwhile won the Outstanding Comedy Series award at the Emmys in both 2003 and 2005. Overall, it earned 69 Emmy nominations during its run, winning 15, mostly for acting. Raymond starred Ray Romano and Patricia Heaton as Raymond and Debra Barone, a couple raising their three children in Long Island. The other main players were Raymond's parents Marie and Frank, played by Doris Roberts and Peter Boyle, and his older brother Robert, played by Brad Garret, who lived together across the street.

The child actor (left) is pictured with Sullivan and Madylin in 2004, a year before the show's final season . It was one of the most watched shows on the air during its ninth season, and the second most popular comedy behind NBC's Friends. When asked if he had a fondest memory from his time on the show in 2010, Sawyer said; 'All my memories are fond.'

"A 15-year-old boy has been arrested for allegedly robbing, beating and sexually assaulting a woman on a Chicago train after his mother recognized his face on released surveillance images and turned him in to police. DeShawn Isabelle punched the 41-year-old woman in the head from behind and then dragged her to the ground by pulling on her hair before continuing to punch her in the head and face as she crouched in the fetal position, according to Assistant State’s Attorney Joe DiBella. Isabelle also stole $2,000 in cash that the woman was going to wire back to her family in Thailand and spent it on junk food, Air Jordan track suits and his graduation fees, DiBella said. Scroll down for video . DeShawn Isabelle, 15, has been arrested for allegedly robbing, beating and sexually assaulting a woman on a Chicago train after his mother recognized his face on surveillance images and turned him in to police . The middle school student was sitting in the otherwise empty carriage when the woman boarded the CTA train in Oak Park on Monday at 3pm, according to the Chicago Tribune. During the brutal beating, Isabelle put his hands inside the woman's pants and sexually assaulted her, according to DiBella. The teen also allegedly groped the woman over her clothes and slapped her buttocks and then sat on her head as he continued to beat her. Isabelle pinned the woman down with his knees when the train stopped at the next station, prosecutors said. When no one entered the carriage, he then dragged the woman by her hair to a partially enclosed area and continued to punch, kick and stomp all over the woman's body as he pushed her face down and demanded money, DiBella said. Isabelle then stole the woman's iPhone and got off on the Cicero stop to hop a train heading in the opposite direction, DiBella said the teenager later told authorities. The woman pushed the car's emergency button after the train began moving again and was attended to by CTA personnel. She was left with bruises and cuts all over her body as well as a concussion after the six-minute ride. Isabelle was sitting in the otherwise empty carriage when the woman boarded the CTA train in Oak Park on Monday at 3pm and allegedly beat and assaulted her during the six minute ride before getting off at Cicero . DiBella said the woman was still vomiting from the extent of her injuries on Wednesday, according to NBC Chicago. Isabelle's mother turned her son in to the police after she recognized his face in surveillance photos publicly released by the CTA following the brutal attack. DiBella said the teenager admitted to robbing, beating and sexually assaulting the woman and gave a handwritten confession. Isabelle's fingerprints were also matched to the train window he was seen touching and kicking in the CTA surveillance video before attacking the woman, according to DiBella. Police also searched the middle school student's home and recovered the jacket he is seen wearing in the video of the assault, DiBella said. Officers were also able to recover the woman's iPhone after Isabelle told them where he had discarded it, according to prosecutors. Isabelle was charged as an adult with aggravated sexual assault and robbery and is being held on $1million bail. The teen was previously convicted as a juvenile for misdemeanor theft. Isabelle's mother became aggravated as DiBella held a press conference to discuss the prosecution's version of the case, according to the Chicago Tribune. 'Don't talk that s*** about my child,' she yelled, before she was told to leave.","DeShawn Isabelle allegedly punched the woman in the head and dragged her to the ground by her hair before repeatedly beating her in Chicago train .

"A former Utah high school teacher accused of having sex with three of her male students took a plea deal Wednesday to avoid a trial, sobbing as she accepted the agreement in court. One of the boys was 16 and two were 17 when they were having sex with Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35. One testified that he considered her to be his girlfriend during their yearlong tryst. But the boys were all minors, and Utah law also says a person cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust. Altice could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Former Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35, pictured here in court on Wednesday, pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse involving three male students . Lengthy prison sentence: Altice accepted the agreement in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. She could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month . Altice pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. School officials knew about Altice's inappropriate behavior and didn't do enough to protect the students, the boys and their parents say. In one of two lawsuits filed against the Davis School District, the plaintiffs said the running joke at the high school was, ‘Who is Ms. Altice sleeping with now?’ Davis School District spokesman Chris Williams said he would love to comment on the allegations but that the civil lawsuit precludes him from saying anything. Prosecutor Susan Hunt said the three victims are on board with the plea deal, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Altice is scheduled to be sentenced May 28. Each count carries a possible sentence of 1 to 15 years in prison. Altice's attorney, Ed Brass, said his client wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial. Brass previously defended Altice, saying she was no longer the boys' teacher when the sex occurred. Altice's attorney said his client, pictured in court back in January, wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial . Altice was first arrested in October 2013 after a student reported having a relationship with her. Two more victims later came forward with similar allegations. She was out on bail during most of the criminal proceedings until allegations emerged earlier this year that she had sex with the third victim following her 2013 arrest. A judge ordered her to jail, where she's been for the three months. Brass asked the judge Wednesday to let Altice out on bail until her sentencing, but the judge denied the request. Brianne Altice was hired by the Davis County School District in 2004 and had been teaching at the high school since August 2012. She was put on leave from the school after the allegations came to light and later fired in February 2014. She had been ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor, in connection to her suspected affairs with three students. In mid-March, one of the alleged victims brought a $647,000 lawsuit against the Davis County School District accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the 'flirtatious' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him. More legal trouble: Two students have filed lawsuits against the Davis County School District in Utah accusing officials of failing to fire English teacher Brianne Altice, pictured in court in January, who is accused of having sex with three boys . Earlier this month, another student sued the district for hiring Altice, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. Court documents detailed how at times, the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with Altice, sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her. On her part, the 35-year-old Altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems. According to the complaint, the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical. Similarly to the first lawsuit, the new complaint alleged that the school district was aware of Brianne Altice's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on  bail for charges relating to the first two students. The student who brought the initial lawsuit in March accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He stated that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 . One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 . He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal.","Former Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse involving three male students .

"A team of  experts is hoping to enter the record books by building the world's fastest bike powered by hand. Engineers developed the  Human Powered Vehicle (HPV) and will attempt to beat the women's arm-powered speed record in Nevada later this year. It will be piloted and powered by paracyclist Liz McTernan and will need to travel in excess of 21.39 miles per hour (34.42 km/h) over 656ft (200-metres) to beat the record. Engineers have developed a Human Powered Vehicle (HPV) (pictured) and will attempt to beat the women's arm-powered speed record in Nevada in September. It will be  powered by paracyclist Liz McTernan and will need to travel in excess of 21.39 miles per hour (34.42 km/h) over a 656ft (200-metre) stretch of tarmac . The current benchmark is held by Tracy Miller  who broke the record on 13 May 1995 on a bike called Chairiot. Ms McTernan's HPV was been designed by mechanical and composites engineers and students from Plymouth University led by Adam Kyte, lecturer in Mechanical and Marine Engineering Design, working with students Matthew Sharman and Rhys Parsons. Mr Kyte told MailOnline that the team has had to design the whole thing from scratch. 'The standard design for a bike isn't the best in terms of aerodynamics,' he said. 'On our bike we've put two wheels at the front and one at the back to make it more aerodynamic but this presents an interesting challenge because we need to steer the front wheels and drive at the rear wheels.' The JIVR Bike, previously known as JIVE Bike, is an electric bike with a chainless drivetrain. A built-in electric motor allows users to commute up to 15.6mph (25km/h) in three  modes - full electric, full manual and assisted pedalling. It has a range of 20 miles (32km) on a single charge in assisted-pedalling mode and takes two hours to recharge. The £1,499 ($2,270) bike’s accompanying JIVR app comes with with an intelligent dashboard that allows them to travel around the city in safe hands. Customers can reserve the JIVR bike online. This means Ms McTernan's body faces forwards, looking towards the floor, with her legs tucked underneath her body. 'The motion from the rider therefore has to pass through a chain and then to the drive at the back,' continued Mr Kyte. The frame of the handcycle is made from aluminium with the help of University technicians Julian Seipp, Rick Preston and Neil Fewings and the team are now building the aerodynamic shell from an advanced composite material. Elsewhere, Mr Kyte said that because Ms McTernan has limited use of her legs the steering system instead is controlled by her head. Pads either side of her helmet are used to control the front wheels and move the bike in different directions. Detailed tests were held over two days earlier this month, one day in the lab and one day in the field with Ms McTernan. But, instead of working on speed, these tests were designed to test the mechanics.

Ms McTernan, who last year ranked in the world's top eight in her sport, said: 'I had first tried out a prototype in October but I was really surprised to see how compact and well engineered the new bike is. 'It was great to get out and test the current model, but there is a lot for me to get used to in terms of the steering and brakes, the riding position and the weight I have to propel. 'I am now going to concentrate on my World Cup events in June and July, but am looking forward to getting back on the track well ahead of the record attempt in September.' Handcycling is growing in popularity and annual speed trials for a range of HPVs are held on the long straight roads of Battle Mountain, Nevada, where competitors can build up speed over a five-mile (8km) run-up before being measured over a 656ft (200 metre) stretch.

Mr Kyte said: 'After months of planning, design and building it was great to be able to welcome Liz to Plymouth and to embark on the first real tests with her at the controls. 'The tests have provided us with a lot more information, and we are now fully analysing the results, while Liz's comments on the day are also hugely important. 'We will be factoring all of them into our work over the coming months to ensure that we have the best possible opportunity to break the record in September.'","Engineers from Plymouth have developed a Human Powered Vehicle (HPV)

"The biblical-style ramblings of accused killer Charles Severance, 54, were revealed during his court appearance on Thursday (pictured) An accused serial killer's rambling manifesto revealed details of his chilling plan to 'Knock. Talk. Enter. Kill. Exit. Murder', a prosecutor has said. Charles Severance, 54, who has been charged with the murders of Nancy Dunning, Ron Kirby and Ruthanne Lodato, in Alexandria, Virginia, was in court for a hearing on Thursday. All three victims were gunned down at their homes in daylight attacks: Dunning in 2003, Kirby in 2013 and Lodato last year. At court on Thursday, prosecutor Bryan Porter argued Severance, who was once a fringe candidate for political office, should face just one trial as his writings linked the three murders,The Washington Post reported. Severance's writing appeared to echo a biblical passage and also included the words: 'The last scream of a victim echoes to eternity... Murder on my mind, and my mind on murder.' The prosecution alleged that Severance's plan to kill was outlined in a bizarre piece called 'Parable of the Knocker', based on a bible passage called Parable of the Midnight Knocker. Judge Jane Marum Roush also decided at the hearing that Severance's trial should be moved from Alexandria to Fairfax County because the possibility of an impartial jury seemed unlikely after the hysteria which surrounded the murders. Severance was arrested in March 2014 over the murders after he sought asylum at the Russian Embassy in D.C. He was reportedly 'sent away' from the embassy and told he was an 'unwanted guest'. Accused serial killer Charles Severance, 54, had several outbursts at his court hearing on Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia and was reprimanded by the judge . Alleged  serial killer Charles Severance was escorted out following a hearing in his case at the Alexandria Circuit Court on Thursday. His trial will be moved to Fairfax County, a judge ruled, over fears for an impartial jury due to the hysteria surrounding the murders . The murders caused panic among the residents of the wealthy Washington D.C. suburb of Alexandria after they were warned by authorities that a serial killer was on the loose. The shootings were random but took place just blocks from each other when the victims opened their front doors at the same time of day. Ruthanne Lodato, a married mother-of-three, was killed on February 6 last year after a man knocked on her door at 11.30am and opened fire on her and a nurse caring for her mother. Lodato, 59, was rushed to hospital in critical condition but did not survive. The nurse, who was shot in the arm, gave police a description of their bearded attacker. Several months earlier, in November 2013, regional transportation planner Ronald Kirby, 69, was shot dead at his home. In December 2003, real estate agent Nancy Dunning, 56, was gunned down. Ballistics revealed similarities in bullet fragments at the three murder scenes. Pictured left, Ruthanne Lodato, 59, a married mother-of-three, was shot dead at her home in Alexandria last year. Several months earlier, in November 2013, Ronald Kirby, 69, was also killed . Left, real estate agent Nancy Dunning, 56, was gunned down in Virginia in December 2003. Similar bullet fragments were found at the murder scene to two killings years later, and a police sketch of a suspect released (right) Severance had built up anger after a court ruling in 2000 which banned him from having contact with his son, which he detailed on his personal website, MentalDisorder.com. On the website he claimed that mental health tests, which he refused to take, were conducted by, 'secular (demon possessed) humanist-priests, democracy government regulated mad-doctors, agents of psychiatry, and other weak hypocrites'. Alexandria Commonwealth’s Attorney Bryan Porter told the court on Thursday that Severance's anger drove him to kill, The Post reported. Defense attorneys argued for Ms Dunning's murder case to be tried separately but the prosecutor said that ballistics evidence and the defendant's writings made a connection between the three killings. During the court appearance on Thursday, Severance made frequent outbursts and was reprimanded by the judge. When discussing him making an obscene gesture at another court appearance, The Post reported that the defendant held up his middle finger and said: 'That’s West Virginia. That’s not an obscene gesture.' The trial is due to begin in October. The three victims were shot at random outside their front doors in broad daylight in the wealthy DC suburb of Alexandria, Virginia .","Charles Severance, 54, has been charged with murders of Nancy Dunning, Ron Kirby and Ruthanne Lodato, in  Virginia, over the space of a decade .

"Hundreds of police officers lined the roads to in a guard of honour for a hero policewoman who was killed by a bus seconds after pushing her daughter out of its path and saving her life. Sergeant Louise Lucas, 41, was off-duty and on a shopping trip with her eight-year-old daughter Olivia in Swansea, South Wales, when she was struck as they tried to cross The Kingsway - a busy road in the city centre. Onlookers say the pair were inches from the bus but Sgt Lucas managed to push her daughter to safety and took the full impact of the collision. Scroll down for video . Respect: Hundreds of police officers lined the roads in a guard of honour at the funeral of policewoman Louise Lucas in Cardiff today . Tragic: Sgt Louise Lucas (pictured left with her brother Robert Pain and right in her uniform) was killed earlier this month when she was hit by a bus while trying to save her eight-year-old Olivia . The mother-of-three, from Llanishen, Cardiff, was rushed to the city's Morriston hospital where doctors battled to save her but she later died. Her daughter escaped with minor injuries in the incident on March 31. Police officers of all ranks paid their respects at her funeral at Christ Parish Church in Cyncoed, Cardiff, today, while her hearse was led by four police motorcycles and two police horses. More than a hundred mourners joined police to fill the congregation, where the church's Easter cross was placed outside so personal flowers in memory of Sgt Lucas, who was a Beaver leader, trained rugby referee and Welsh learner, could be laid on it. Her husband Gavin Lucas, 36, walked into the church hand-in-hand with Olivia and their seven-year-old son Lloyd to one of Sgt Lucas's favourite songs - Bette Midler's 'Wind Beneath My Wings' - with the line 'did I ever tell you, you are my hero'. He paid tribute to his late wife saying his love for her would remain in his heart forever and read a poem, which he originally wrote for their wedding day a decade ago but adapted for her funeral. 'A sergeant at work she really did do well. Total dedication to the police, that was our Lou. As you can see today, they will miss her too,' he said. He continued by saying the couple's three children - including 21-year-old Grant - had made their lives complete: 'She will be in our hearts forever, let's try not to be glum,' he read. Mourners: Police of all ranks turned out to pay their respects and join the hundreds of people grieving the loss of the popular police officer . Funeral: Her coffin is carried into Christ Parish Church in Cyncoed, Cardiff, before her husband Gavin walked inside hand-in-hand with their daughter Olivia and seven-year-old son Lloyd . Hero: Officers watch as the hearse makes its way towards the church, which had placed its Easter cross outside so personal flowers in memory of Sgt Lucas could be laid on it . Commemoration: Hundreds of people had to stand outside the packed church and listen to the popular service over a tannoy . Sgt Lucas's brother Robert Pain described her as 'a light that will never go out in our hearts'. He said: 'My sister was an example to everyone of how to live life. I never got to tell Lou how important she was to me. I know in my head she knew it.' Sgt Louise Lucas pictured with her husband Gavin, 36, who told the congregation she would remain in his heart forever and read a poem . He shared with the church tales of their childhood and said Christmas festivities at their home were 'magical'. He said every year she would run into his room to wake him up and as adults she rang at 5am every Christmas morning at their former family home just minutes from the church. 'I never looked forward to that early morning call but I know this year it will be very much missed,' he said. South Wales Police chief constable Peter Vaughan told the congregation and dozens who stood outside listening to a tannoy: 'She was a devoted police officer who was fearless in confronting evil. 'She was inspirational and passionate about people and was a terrific person blessed with physical and moral courage, small in stature but huge in character.' He described her as a 'mother hen' to her officers at Llanishen police station. Superintendent Alun Morgan said: 'Her children, Grant, Olivia and Lloyd, have suffered a loss that those so young should never have to endure. Louise loved her family and her family loved her.' The 41-year-old, who had a love for designer lables and lived her life to the full, was a worshipper at Christ Church where a huge congregation marked her life. Vicar Trystan Hughes said: 'We were privileged in this church to have known her well. She was an enthusiastic and loving member of the congregation here. 'We're privileged to call her and her family our friends. We know, like you, the joy and love that she brought to others. Now many of us are feeling that there's a hole left in our lives where Louise's smile and Louise's laughter used to brighten up our day. 'Today we come with great sadness but also with gratitude for the time we had with Louise and the joy she shared with us. It's fitting that many of you are wearing pink today, as the family asked - Louise would have loved that.' On the way to the crematorium after the service the cortege paused for a brief moment of silence outside the police station in Cardiff where she was a popular community officer before continuing on to a private service at Thornhill Crematorium. Speaking at the time of her death, her eldest son Grant, a police community support officer who gave a reading at today's service,said: 'Mum was the best there is and was simply amazing. I am absolutely well and truly gutted.' Grant said that he wanted to make his mother 'proud' and would help to raise Olive and Lloyd. He added: 'It's mad how my mum and I became much closer over the last couple of weeks and had it all planned out. On behalf of the family, we would like to thank all friends for their support.'

"A woman gave birth in her office toilet before quietly returning to her desk with the newborn baby wrapped in two sealed bags, and put it in her desk drawer. Kim Pappas, 25, was two hours into her working day at Ceva Logistics in Wyandotte, Michigan, on March 31 when she disappeared to the bathroom to deliver the boy - and cut the umbilical cord with cuticle scissors. Nobody knew she was pregnant. Charged: Kim Pappas, 25, has been charged with premeditated murder after giving birth in her office toilet then wrapping her baby boy in a plastic bag and secretly putting him in her desk drawer. The baby died . Her attempt at secrecy, however, was foiled minutes later when two employees went to the restroom, which was covered in blood. Returning to the office of the freight management company they saw traces of blood on Pappas' clothing, and found the lifeless infant wrapped up at her feet. Pappas has been charged with premeditated murder. According to Fox, workers went to the bathroom after hearing moaning and crying - but Pappas had already left. They alerted emergency services and went round every employee. Noticing the blood on Pappas, she was questioned and they searched her desk. It was not until they discovered the baby in the drawer that she admitted what had happened. Shock: Nobody at Ceva Logistics, Michigan, knew Pappas was pregnant until they saw blood in the cubicle . Court: Pappas appeared in court on Friday via videolink to be arraigned. She has been denied bail . The child was sealed inside a plastic bag, which was wrapped in a tote bag. He showed no signs of life at the office and was later pronounced dead in hospital. It is believed he was in the bag for between 15 and 30 minutes, according to the Detroit Free Press. Initially, Pappas claimed she had a miscarriage but an autopsy suggests the baby died by suffocation. Pappas appeared via video link in court on Friday to be arraigned. She is facing charges of felony murder, premeditated murder and first-degree child abuse, and has been denied bail, the Free Press reported.","Kim Pappas did not tell anybody she was pregnant before giving birth .

"A Walmart employee has been applauded for his honesty after finding $4,400 worth of cash in the parking lot and handing it over to authorities, who returned it to its relieved owner. Brian Cassidy was picking up trash outside the store in Bangor, Maine on Thursday when he discovered the wet stack of money beneath a large piece of paper in the parking lot. He immediately contacted store security to tell them what he had found and, realizing it was a sizable sum, they then contacted the police department, Sergeant Tim Cotton said. Officer Dustin Dow went to the store to take the report and learned that a man had visited the security office last winter to claim he had lost about $4,000 in the parking lot. Great work: Brian Cassidy, right, is pictured being presented with a Bangor Police Department Challenge coin by an officer after he found $4,400 cash in a Walmart parking lot and alerted security . The man, who was later identified as Ou Chen, said at the time that he had put the money in an envelope in his pocket after leaving work at a nearby restaurant. He had intended to send the money home to his family, Cotton said. But after clearing snow off his car and driving home, he realized that his pocket was empty. Chen went to the security office to ask if the money had been turned in or if surveillance footage had revealed what could have happened to it, but nothing emerged. When Dow heard of the story, he went to the nearby restaurant, Kobe Steakhouse, and asked for the man, and Chen confirmed he had misplaced the cash. After counting the money at the station, the officer returned to the restaurant to give it back to him - and to take a picture showing him gladly accepting it. Returned: The money belonged to Ou Chen, who lost the $4,000 as he cleared snow off his car last winter after leaving his job at a nearby restaurant. He told Walmart about it at the time but they could not find it . Stash: Cassidy found the money, pictured, while picking up trash near the Walmart parking lot last Thursday . Cotton applauded Brian for his honesty, particularly because the Walmart employee found the money while working at a job that does not pay much. 'Brian is not getting rich doing this and has dealt with other issues over the past year,' Cotton explained in a lengthy Facebook post. 'Brian, like many people, has even had to sleep in his car for a time when things were rough.' In recognition of his honesty, Cassidy was presented with a Bangor Police Department Challenge coin 'for being honest and having great integrity in doing his job', the department said. 'Brian Cassidy personifies what we hope is in all of us,' Cotton wrote. 'Thanks Brian, the men and women of the Bangor Police Department salute you.' Scene: Cassidy, who works at this Walmart in Bangor, Maine, was thanked for his honesty and integrity .","Brian Cassidy was picking up trash from the parking lot of the Bangor, Maine store last Thursday when he found the wet stack of cash .

"Detectives probing the murders of a Playboy bunny and a 16-year-old schoolgirl 40 years ago have offered a £40,000 reward in a bid to bring their killer to justice. Eve Stratford, a 22-year-old glamour model who worked at London's Playboy club, was found with her throat slashed in her Leyton home on the evening of 18 March 1975. Six months later, Lynne Weedon, 16, was  attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow at 11pm on September 3, as she returned from a night out with friends. She was found abandoned and barely alive at an electricity sub-station the next morning and died a week later. Eve Stratford, 22, a Playboy bunny, was stabbed between eight and 12 times when she was murdered on the evening of 18 March 1975 . Both murders were linked in July 2006 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims, who did not know each other. It appears the motive was sexual - Lynne had been raped, and it is likely Eve had also been raped although detectives haven't been able to rule out consensual sex. The reward was posted last night as detectives appealed for information, which could lead to the identification, arrest and prosecution of those responsible, on BBC's Crimewatch show. Lynne's mother, Margaret Weedon, described the murder 40 years ago as a 'true life sentence' for the family. Lynne Weedon (right) was beaten over the head with a blunt object. Detectives believes Lynda Farrow (left), who was knifed to death in 1979, was also a victim of the same killer . She said: 'We have missed out on so much; she missed out on life, no relationship or marriage, no career or children or even just travelling the world, all taken from her. 'We are left 40 years on always wondering what it would have been like. 'We are well aware that whoever murdered Lynne also murdered Eve Stratford. That young lady also had her life snubbed out. Her family have died now. Another true life sentence. 'The hurt eases but the pain still sits deep somewhere inside. There are so many questions. So many thoughts. So much heartache. 'I will make a mother's plea for anyone who can tell us some information about the person who took my daughter and Eve Stratford's lives to come forward. Please, please give us some sort of closure.' Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh from Scotland Yard  said he was hopeful the killer had let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend or even a cellmate or medical professional. He said it is likely the suspect for both murders is now in his 60s or 70s. The glamour model was 22 when she was killed in her home and police said her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times . Police believe Lynne was followed on foot from Great Western Road into The Short Hedges (pictured right), before she was hit with a blunt instrument - her body was thrown over the fence and she was left for dead . Mr McHugh said detectives are keeping an open mind but have previously said it is possible the killer knew his victims, particularly Eve who had a huge circle of friends and acquaintances. He added: 'It's inconceivable the killer of Eve and Lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years. 18 March 1975: Playboy bunny Eve Stratford found  with her throat slashed at her home. 3 September 1975: Lynne Weedon, 16, was attacked and raped in an alleyway  at 11pm. 10 September 1975: Schoolgirl died in hospital from her injuries. July 2006: Murders linked in 2007 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims. March 2015: Police launched fresh appeal on the 40th anniversary of their deaths. April 2015: Detectives offer £40,000 reward for information about killings. 'It's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend, even a cellmate - and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us.' Mr McHugh appealed in particular to mental health professionals and prison officers who may have received disclosures from a patient or prisoner. Former Met Police detective Colin Sutton believes a third woman, Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home four years later in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer. Miss Stratford worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966. She was 22 when she was killed in her home and police said her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times. Detectives believe she may have known her killer and invited him into the flat she shared with her boyfriend Tony Priest, the lead singer with the pop band Onyx, who found her body. Miss Stratford (left) worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966 . This map shows the three unsolved murders all took place in close proximity - it is believed they are all linked . She was found dead in the bedroom of her flat at 5.30pm with a nylon stocking tied around one ankle and a scarf binding her hands behind her back. An hour earlier a neighbour had heard a male and female voice talking, apparently calmly, in her flat. There was no sign of forced entry. A blood-splattered bouquet of flowers she had bought earlier that day lay next to her body. She was last seen walking alone near her home in Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton, shortly before 4pm on a snowy day in March. Later that year Lynne was beaten over the head with a blunt object as she took a short-cut to her home in Hounslow. She was then thrown over a fence into the grounds of an electricity sub-station before being raped and left for dead. A school caretaker looking after the grounds found her still alive and she was taken to West Middlesex Hospital where she died a week later. The post-mortem examination found her skull was smashed with a heavy blunt instrument, but the weapon was never recovered. Anyone with information is asked to call the incident room on 020 8785 8099 or, to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

"An extremely rare species of shark has been discovered off the Gulf of Mexico. However, this little critter is more likely to get you cooing rather than crying out in fear. The tiny nipper - measuring just 5.5 inches long - was caught during a 2010 government research trip and its body remained frozen while biologists went about identifying it. This week scientists revealed the dinky creature is a pocket shark - a miniature variation of the more popular kinds. The young male is the second of its species ever seen. Up from the deep: An extremely rare species of shark has been discovered off the Gulf of Mexico . Tiny teeth: However, this little critter is more likely to get you cooing than crying out in fear . The first pocket shark was found 36 years ago in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru and it's been sitting in a Russian museum since. It's believed the newly-discovered pocket shark was just a few weeks old as he is extremely small and only weighs a mere half ounce. Strangely, this type of shark has two pockets next to its front fins; their purpose is not known. It's not quite like a kangaroo, which uses its pouch to carry young, but few species have pockets this large - about 4 percent of the shark's body. 'It's cute,' said Tulane University biologist Michael Doosey, who co-authored a study in a zoological journal identifying the shark. 'It almost looks like a little whale.' Close encounter: The tiny nipper - measuring just 5.5 inches long - was caught during a 2010 government research trip and its body remained frozen while biologists went about identifying it . Putting a name to the face: This week scientists revealed the dinky creature is a pocket shark - a miniature variation of the more popular kind . Extremely rare: The first pocket shark was found 36 years ago in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru and it's been sitting in a Russian museum since . National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries biologist Mark Grace has spent more than 30 years going through bags upon bags of fish to identify them. It took him more than three years to get to near the end of the freezer, when he plopped a bag on the table and let it thaw. 'I wasn't really sure what it was,' Grace said. 'That pocket over on the pectoral fin, I had never seen anything like that on a shark.' It's a small miracle that he was not thrown away. A couple of times, the lab with the freezer lost power. Once identified, the shark was shipped to New York and France for high-tech examinations that wouldn't puncture the specimen. Dissection: The truly strange thing about this species strange is its twin pockets - while no one knows what they are for, some experts believe that they may secrete some kind of glowing fluid or pheromones . The shark also has unusual belly patches not seen in most sharks. The only other pocket shark was a female adult about 17 inches long; it is believed that adult females may be larger than males. But the truly strange thing about this species strange is its twin pockets. While no one knows what they are for, based on the Russian specimen Grace and Doosey speculated that they may secrete some kind of glowing fluid or pheromones. The Gulf specimen has umbilical scars, showing he's probably a few weeks old, Grace said. Because of that they think he was born in the Gulf. He was captured in February 2010 by the ship Pisces about 190 miles off the Louisiana coast. 'There's others' out there, Grace said. 'We just haven't caught them yet.'","The tiny nipper was caught during a 2010 government research trip .

"The Taliban annual 'spring offensive' began today in Afghanistan with the jihadi group claiming responsibility for  108 attacks in the opening five hours. A US air base near Kabul and military outposts in Nuristan were targeted today as the militants continue to pursue territory in north east Afghanistan. According to the official spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, over 80 per cent of Afghanistan is currently 'controlled' by the Taliban. Whilst their figures are exaggerated, the Taliban's new offensive is set to the start of fresh violence in the troubled country. Taliban militants opened the offensive today with a failed rocket attack on a US base in Bagram air base, situated close to the Afghan capital city of Kabul. Taliban militants opened the offensive today with a failed rocket attack on a US base in Bagram air base, situated close to the Afghan capital city of Kabul. The rocket landed harmlessly in base and despite the Taliban claims that they had 'killed and wounded hundreds of Americans', no casualties have been reported. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were also reportedly detonated in Kunar and Khost province. Casualty numbers remain unconfirmed but the attacks symbolize a worrying indicator of the broad areas being targeted by the Taliban. The Taliban announced the launch of Operation Azm, meaning 'determination', on Wednesday, revealing fresh plans to target government buildings and Afghan security forces. The Taliban have been waging an jihadi insurgency since they were forced out of power in late 2001. With the emergence of ISIS, the Taliban are already facing a struggle for power in Afghanistan. The extremists want to turn Afghanistan into an Islamic Emirate, governed by strict sharia law. In December, photos emerged of a robber being publicly executed by Taliban fighters with machine guns. The Taliban announced the launch of Operation Azm, meaning 'determination', on Wednesday, revealing fresh plans to target government buildings and Afghan security forces in what is expected to be the bloodiest fighting season in a decade. With NATO forces pulling back from the frontlines, concerns remain whether trained Afghan forces will be able to consistently repel the expected barrage of Taliban attacks. 'The Islamic Emirate is going to launch the spring operations under the inspirational name of 'Azm' (Determination) at 5 am on 24th April 2015,' the Taliban said in a statement on Wednesday, using their official name. 'The main targets of these operations... will be the foreign occupiers, especially their permanent military bases... officials of the stooge regime, their military constellations, especially their intelligence, interior ministry and defence ministry officials.' Former Afghan Taliban fighters are seen holding weapons before they hand them over, as part of a government peace and reconciliation initiative, at a ceremony in Jalalabad recently. NATO's combat mission formally ended in December but a small follow-up foreign force has stayed on to train and support local security personnel. US President Barack Obama last month backpedaled on plans to shrink the US force in Afghanistan this year by nearly half, agreeing to keep the current level of 9,800 US troops until the end of 2015. The Taliban, who have waged a deadly insurgency since they were ousted from power in late 2001, said the announcement would damage any prospect of peace talks as they vowed to continue fighting. Aside from the Taliban, the Afghan government has also repeatedly warned of the Islamic State (IS) group making inroads into the country. President Ashraf Ghani blamed IS for a suicide attack last Saturday in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100 others. If verified, that would mark the first major attack by the jihadists in the country. President Ashraf Ghani blamed IS for a suicide attack last Saturday in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100 others. Afghan security forces are struggling to cope with the new offensive across Afghanistan  particularly with the gradual withdrawal of NATO forces . The upsurge in attacks has taken a heavy toll on ordinary Afghans. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), the number of civilians killed and wounded up by 22 percent in 2014 compared to the previous year. In the first three months of 2015, civilian casualties from ground fighting were up eight percent on the same period last year, a new UNAMA report said. But in their statement, the Taliban said their 'top priority will be given to safeguard and protect the lives and properties of the civilian people' during the offensive.

"A five-year-old Chinese girl who was left at home alone suffered broken bones and internal bleeding when she fell 150ft from a window. Little Jiaojiao only survived because rain canopies, laundry racks and wet grass broke her fall in Zheng Du City, Central China. Her mother, Zheng Jiayu, 31, who left Jiaojiao at home on her own, now cannot afford the huge £100,000 medical bill, according to People's Online Daily. Survivor: Little Jiaojiao pictured in hospital after falling from a 150ft from a window while her mother was out . Jiaojiao (pictured here before the accident) only survived because rain canopies, laundry racks and wet grass broke her fall in Zheng Du City, Central China . Zheng and the youngster were playing at home on Sunday when Jiaojiao said she was hungry. Her mother closed the windows and doors and left the flat for 10 minutes while she bought takeaway food. When Zheng returned, her daughter was nowhere to be seen. Believing Jiaojiao was playing hide-and-seek, she began looking in the wardrobes. To her horror, she discovered an open window and saw a crowd had begun to gather around a bench below. A lifeless child in a pink jacket was sprawled across it. ‘Did a toddler fall down?’ Zheng Jiayu shouted to the spectators, recognising the child's outfit. ‘She can still speak, come down quickly,’ the neighbours called back. Jiaojiao was bleeding from her eyes, nose and mouth, was covered in mud and kept asking for her mother. A neighbour had found the five-year-old lying on the grass and carried her to the bench. Jiaojiao was rushed to Chengdu Second People’s Hospital and a doctor said she had punctured her lung and sustained multiple fractures. Her pelvis had broken into pieces and she had severe bruising and scratches, as well as internal bleeding. Rain canopies, laundry racks and wet grass broke the little girl's fall and doctors said it was a miracle she was conscious . Jiaojiao's pelvis had broken into pieces and she had severe bruising and scratches, as well as internal bleeding . Luckily her head and neck were not injured and doctors said it was a miracle she was conscious. However, Jiaojiao went into a coma not long after she arrived at hospital because of excessive bleeding. She only regained consciousness after an emergency blood transfusion and an operation on a wound measuring 20cm in length. She was transferred to Huaxi Hospital and surgeons were able to repair the damage to her legs during a three-hour operation yesterday. Jiaojiao, holding back her tears before the operation, told her worried mother: 'Mum, I will get better day by day.' She is still in the intensive care unit but has already begun to ask for ice cream. Unfortunately she can only be fed through a tube. On the day of her fall, Jiaojiao’s father was at work and her grandparents were out of town. ‘I was supposed to be at work, but no one is at home,' said Zheng, who suspects her daughter pushed the window open. 'So I took a day off to watch my child.' Before the fall: Jiaojiao proudly shows off her picture of a pond before the accident at her home on Sunday . The family has been left with a large medical bill, estimated to be £100,000, compared to their £640 monthly income. ‘I am so happy that my child is alive, but the medical bill will be huge,’ Zheng said. ‘Not matter how difficult this road is, we hope to accompany our daughter every step of the way and create more miracles.' Neighbours have organised a fundraiser to help pay for Jiaojiao's treatment, her nursery has donated £1,000 and friends and family have given the family £960. Zheng added: ‘Jiaojiao is such a sweet-talker. She says hi to everyone in the neighbourhood. That’s why everyone loves her.'","Jiaojiao, 5, fell 150ft when her mother, Zheng Jiayu, left her at home alone .

"New pictures have emerged of Louis Tomlinson's wild night of partying with a group of five girls. The One Direction star was seen barefoot and sat on the edge of a sofa during a stay at London's Soho Hotel on Wednesday night, in which he appeared to be rolling a joint while sat next to a box filled with a suspicious substance. And now, a series of newly-released Snapchat shots of the raucous gathering have emerged, appearing to show the 23-year-old singer in his hotel room in the company of friends in the small hours of Thursday morning. Scroll down for video . Up all night: Louis Tomlinson is clearly visible in previously unseen pictures from his wild night out with five girls, taken before he was pictured rolling a 'suspicious cigarette' in his hotel room in London . Jokes: The Snapchat video shows Louis back in his room at the Soho Hotel in London with his female friends, as one of them jokes that they aren't sure which member of One Direction he is . One social media snap captioned with the time showed the wild party going on until at least 5.48am. Another image shows newly-single Louis partying at the nightclub beforehand in the company of a green-haired young lady holding up a cigarette, with the caption 'love' over the image. Shots taken from a Snapchat video show the back of Louis within the hotel room while a person - whose face is obscured - lays on the couch in front of him. Across the image reads the joke caption: 'apparently hes one direction lol? Harry? Dunn', hinting that the girls pretending to be unaware which member of the globally-revered group he was. Change of clothing: Although Louis was seen returning to the Soho Hotel in the same Brooklyn-emblazoned jumper that he wore in the 'spliff' picture, he seemed to have removed the sweater for a time . Crowd in: Louis returned to the Soho Hotel after leaving Cirque Le Soir at 4am with his female friends, in the same t-shirt he was seen wearing in the Snapchat images . Perhaps taken from the very same video, the young singer is also seen playing the 'air guitar', according to the written comment. Louis - who split from his long-term love Eleanor Calder weeks ago - was photographed leaving the Soho Hotel after a long night of partying with his pals in the city on Thursday, with a rather sheepish look on his face. He was still clad in the very same outfit he had worn during his raucous night out, which saw him leave Soho's Cirque Le Soir nightclub at 4am and head back to his hotel room to continue the party. After the party: Louis returned to his hotel in London's Soho on Thursday, apparently after the pictures of him with the roll up were taken - he is wearing the very same Brooklyn sweater as in the images . That's the shirt! As Louis arrived back at his Soho hotel at around 4.30am on Thursday morning, he was wearing the very same white tee as in the Snapchat images . Raucous: The 1D star seemed in fantastic spirits as he returned with his female friends and a man who appeared to be a member of his security team . Clinging on: A pretty brunette held onto the star's arm as they entered the hotel . Although Louis was seen wearing the same white 'Brooklyn' jumper when he was pictured with the suspicious 'cigarette', the garment he was seen walking around the hotel in the following day, the Snapchat images show him to be wearing a t-shirt. And it's the very same white top he wore on his return to the hotel after leaving the club, when he was seen getting out of a taxi filled with his gaggle of female friends. The party pals stepped out of the car and made their way as a group into the hotel, seemingly to carry on the atmosphere. Tired? Since spitting from his long-term girlfriend Eleanor Calder in March, Louis has enjoyed several nights out with mystery females . Popular location: Two of the young ladies who spent the evening celebrating with Louis were later seen leaving the Soho Hotel . The original picture showed Louis perching on the edge of the sofa in the hotel room, presumably after their all-night celebration. The image, which shows the One Direction star poised with the suspicious roll-up and sitting next to a plastic tub containing a dry, green weed-like substance and rolling paper, was taken in the early hours of Thursday morning. That same day he was photographed returning to his London hotel in a disheveled state clutching a glass of water. The singer has recently been letting his hair down and enjoying his newly-single status, after breaking up from his girlfriend of four years, Eleanor Calder, in March. In the original picture, apparently taken in London  during this two-day party session, Tomlinson appears to be smiling as he balances a magazine on his lap, smiling distractedly at a girl by his side as he prepares the suspicious cigarette. It is the latest blow to the boy band just one month after Zayn Malik announced his decision to quit the group. 'Happy days': What Louis Tomlinson was heard saying as Zayn Malik smoked what appeared to be marijuana as the band was ferried to a stadium in Lima, the capital of Peru, for a concert . Shortly before his announcement it had emerged that Zayn, 22, and Louis were being forced to post bonds worth close to $12,000 to be allowed into the Philippines where they were due to play a concert in Manila. The money was to be forfeited if either were caught using illegal drugs while there. And the new picture comes in the wake of a video filmed last April where the pair were seen joking about drugs as they appeared to share a joint during the Latin American Leg of their 2014 stadium tour. The explosive video obtained by Daily Mail Online last May sent shock waves through One Direction’s young fan base. Still partying: Louis headed for a night on the town in London on Thursday . Past love: Louis ended his four-year relationship with Eleanor Calder back in March . Louis could be heard narrating from behind the camera as he filmed his bandmate on their way to a One Direction concert in Lima, Peru. At one point he announced: ‘So here we are, leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days!’ Fellow band members Harry Styles, Liam Payn and Niall Horan were not present as, during the 15 minute journey in a smoke filled SUV, Louis, from Doncaster, and Zayn, from Bradford, joked with each other and three members of their crew who are travelling with them. A member of the team asked about the filming: ‘Are we allowed to talk contraband in this?’ Louis replied: ‘Yes, that’s what it is about.’ Current line-up: The four-member version of One Direction performs in South Africa last month after the departure of Zayn Malik to pursue a solo career . The way they were: Clean-cut One Direction - from left Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne . Adopting a faux serious tone as he focused on Zayn who sat beside him wearing jeans and a Bob Marley T-shirt, Louis said: ‘Zayn takes his job very seriously. He makes sure he goes through a two hour intense warm-up before every show. Just to get himself in the zone for the show. ‘One very, very important factor of Zayn’s warm up of course is Mary J herself. IN fact I will present it to him now for some fantastic singing.’ The band faced heavy criticism after the video leak with thousands of fans dumping tickets to their shows. Liam Payne tweeted an apology saying, ‘I love my boys and maybe things have gone a little sideways. I apologize for that.’ He added: ‘We are only in our 20s and we all do stupid things at this age.’ MailOnline has approached the band's spokesperson for comment.","New images have surfaced of Louis Tomlinson's all-night partying session, which appeared to end at around 6am .

"In what appears to be an attempt to steal some of the attention away from today's Apple Watch launch, Samsung has teased its next-generation wearable. Simply referred to as 'the next Gear', images of the watch's circular face were unveiled as part of an announcement about Samsung's upcoming developer scheme. Samsung's previous watches have all had rectangular faces, or in the case of the  Gear S, a curved design. Simply referred to as 'the next Gear', images of the watch's circular face (pictured) were unveiled as part of an announcement about Samsung's upcoming developer scheme. In its press release, Samsung said: 'The new wearable device will be the 7th generation of Samsung Gear with a wrist watch type' Motorola, Huawei and LG currently offer round watches, while the Pebble Steel and Apple Watch are square. In its press release, Samsung said: 'Members of global developer community can get early access to the Software Development Kit (SDK) of the company's next generation of the Gear device. 'The new wearable device will be the 7th generation of Samsung Gear with a wrist watch type.' It added that this is the first time Samsung has released its wearable SDK to  developers before the official product announcement, but didn't reveal release dates for either the software or the new device. Samsung's previous watches have all had rectangular faces, including the Gear Live (pictured left), or in the case of the Gear S (pictured right), a curved design . Motorola (Moto 360 pictured), Huawei and LG currently offer round watches, while the Pebble Steel and Apple Watch are square. Paul Lamkin, editor-in-chief of Wareable told MailOnline: 'It's hardly surprising Samsung has announced plans for a circular smartwatch, the Orbis device has been on the web rumour mill for a while' Asus claims the £119.99 VivoWatch (shown) has a 10-day battery life. It goes on sale in May . Earlier this week Asus announced its VivoWatch, the first Asus wearable designed for fitness tracking. It has built-in heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and a Happiness Index that shows a person's overall mood. It uses a numeric score, based on the wearer's activity level and sleep quality to shown a summary of how healthy the wearer's lifestyle is. A low score suggest the wearer should adjust their exercise and sleep habits, while a normal or high score provides motivation to maintain their healthy lifestyle. Asus claims the £119.99 VivoWatch has a 10-day battery life, and the watch case is IP67 water-resistant. It goes on sale in May. It did not reveal price details or any other specifications either. Elsewhere in the release Samsung said it has already worked with CNN, Yelp, Baidu, FidMe and Apposter in developing apps for the next gadget. Paul Lamkin, editor-in-chief of Wareable told MailOnline: 'It's hardly surprising Samsung has announced plans for a circular smartwatch, the Orbis device has been spinning on the web rumour mill for a while now but the timing, on Apple Watch launch day, is a little puzzling. 'Samsung's betting big on its own proprietary software and it makes sense to get developers in early to pack out the Tizen app store with circle-friendly apps. 'After all, with 3,000 Apple Watch apps reportedly already on offer, the Korean company is playing catch-up to its long-time rival, despite the fact it’s been in the game a lot longer.' Apple's smartwatch officially went on sale today, but anyone turning up to buy one in the high street will be disappointed as none of its stores have them in stock. Instead, consumers have to pre-order the watches online or go to select partner shops and boutiques to buy the Watch today. Usually, Apple launches generate long queues outside stores. But analysts believe the company feared the queues might be 'embarrassingly small' and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang. In fact, despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are keen to adopt a new generation of wearable technology, pre-orders have far exceeded expectations. As a result, the company's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today. Analysts believe Apple is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year. Apple's Watch officially went on sale today but anyone turning up to buy one on the high street will be disappointed as none of its stores have them in stock. Instead, consumers have to pre-order the watches online or go to select partner shops and boutiques to buy the Watch today. The Trainline app is pictured . Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble, told MailOnline: 'It was rather sad not to see all those technophiles camping outside Apple Stores this week. 'I doubt this new sales strategy will do much harm to sales of the Watch, as Apple has incredible brand loyalty, but neither should it underestimate the impact those queues had. They are the most photographed and talked about queues in the world and I can think of no other brand gets that kind of exposure for a product launch. 'That queue is more than just brand hype, it's a phenomenon, and it's also free global PR for Apple.'","Korean firm teased the watch with  strapline 'Get ready for the next Gear'

"He's all three emergency services rolled into one. Andrew Hichens has become the first person to be trained and equipped as a so-called first responder to all types of 999 call. Mr Hichens, 28, will be working with one PC and two Police Community Service Officers in Hayle in Western Cornwall where the emergency services have been brought together under one roof. Jack of all trades: Andrew Hichens is trained to respond to crimes, fires and medical emergencies . New role: Father-of-two Mr Hichens has taken up his unique role in Hayle in Western Cornwall . As 'Tri-service Safety Officer', he does not have the power to make arrests and will mostly be patrolling his beat and spreading safety messages while on hand to respond to most 999 calls. Devon and Cornwall assistant chief constable Paul Netherton said there were plans to introduce the post to other areas. He said: 'The tri-service officer is a ground-breaking idea. It brings together the skills and training of the three emergency services into one individual.' Father of two Mr Hichens said: 'I want to become a familiar face in the community, someone the public are happy to see and who can respond to any incident or enquiry.' He applied for the role after eight years as a fireman, training as an emergency first responder, and completing a PCSO course. Badge of honour: He is called a 'tri-service safety officer' However, Devon and Cornwall Police Federation chairman Nigel Rabbitts said the new role would never be the same as having a fully-trained policeman, paramedic and fireman on call. He dismissed the new job as a 'publicity stunt' designed to reassure the public rather than provide any effective policing. He said: 'I don't see what there is to gain from it apart from some sort of public reassurance. Maybe the money should be better spent on full warranted police officers.' He also said he could not see it catching on, adding: 'To do all three would be impossible and you wouldn't be able to obtain your professional competencies.' Ready to go: Mr Hichens will mostly be patrolling his beat and spreading safety messages in his new role . Former Met officer Chris Hobbs said the job was unlikely to be represent the future of the emergency services as it would only really suit small, quiet, and rural beats. He said: 'If someone is able to accumulate all those numerous skills in becoming a jack or master of all trades that is fine. 'But realistically people join the police to be policemen, the fire service to be firefighters, and the ambulance service to be paramedics. 'Finding a good number of people that are able to qualify in all three is asking an awful lot. 'It is a great idea in a rural community but a bit of a non-starter in bigger towns and cities.'","Andrew Hichens on call to deal with crimes, fires and medical emergencies .

"Momentous: Kim Woodward is the first woman to be appointed head chef at the Savoy Grill . A former MasterChef semi-finalist has become the first woman to run the prestigious Savoy Grill kitchen in its 126-year history. Kim Woodward has been appointed head chef at the famous venue, which has hosted lunches for the likes of prime ministers, musicians and captains of industry for decades. The 34-year-old follows in the footsteps of a string of maître chefs who have headed the kitchen since its opening in the Strand, London in 1889. Auguste Escoffier — dubbed ‘chef of kings’ — was installed by hotel manager César Ritz when the Savoy first opened. Since then, a number of well-known chefs have followed, including Marcus Wareing and Andy Cook — but never a woman . Ms Woodward, who lives in Camden, said: ‘It is an absolute honour for me to be the head chef here in one of London’s most iconic restaurants. Obviously there is so much history here, and the people who come through the door come here for the classic dishes that the Grill is famous for.’ At the five-star, art deco Grill, which is now part of the Gordon Ramsay stable, Woodward will head a team of about 35 chefs, of whom some 40 per cent are women. It marks her return to the venue — she was a sous chef between 2010 and 2012, before becoming head chef at the York & Albany gastropub in Camden. She reached the semi-final of the 2011 series of MasterChef: The Professionals. The Cheshire-born chef said she would continue the ‘masculine” culinary traditions established by Escoffier, including a daily roast trolley, and classics such as Beef Wellington and Dover sole. It was more important to keep the Grill true to its traditions of “great quality cuts of meat and fish” rather than regain the Michelin star lost when it closed for refurbishment in 2007, she said, adding: ‘People are here because it is a classic grill.’ As well as powerful men, the Savoy Grill has been a magnet to some of the world’s most famous women including Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Doris Day and Victoria Beckham. It was also where Vivien Leigh met her future husband Laurence Olivier. Heritage: But the Materchef contestant has promised to continue the 'masculine' traditions of five-star Grill . Escoffier created a number of famous dishes at the Savoy, including Peach Melba in 1893, in honour of Australian singer Nellie Melba, and Melba Toast in 1897. Another signature dish, Omelette Arnold Bennett, was created for the novelist and is still on the menu. Ms Woodward said she hoped to bring her own trademarks to the Grill, including a tonka bean and strawberry millefeuille dessert.","Kim Woodward has been appointed head chef at world famous restaurant .

"Two chapters of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity are under investigation after they allegedly disrespected disabled veterans by spitting on them, shouting verbal abuse and urinating on the American flag during a charity weekend. Students from Zeta Beta Tau at both the University of Florida and Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, have been accused of the deplorable behavior against the ex-servicemen during the Warrior Beach Retreat in Panama City on April 17. The event is designed to give those who have sacrificed their lives for their country a relaxing break with their families at the luxurious Lakedown Wharf Resort. But instead of being acknowledged for their service, some of the attendees claim they were subjected to taunts and watched as the drunk youngsters, who were attending a formal, threw beer off the balcony. Scroll down for video . Allegations: Students from Zeta Beta Tau at both the University of Florida (pictured) and Emory University have been accused of disrespecting the ex-servicemen during the Warrior Beach Retreat in Panama City on April 17. It is not know whether anyone in this picture was involved . According to reports the police were called and the hotel security responded. They managed to get the situation under control and some of the students involved were thrown out of the hotel, but no arrests were made. Nicholas Connole, who served 18 months in Afghanistan and nine months in Iraq told WJHG the students spat at him and his service dog. 'That's just so disrespectful and it hurts,' he said. 'I come and I feel honored and I feel safe and that I belong, but now I feel like I'm defending myself.' Haley Riley, who was attending the event with her wounded husband, said beer bottles were thrown at them and students threw up in the elevators. Linda Cope, founder of the Warrior Beach Retreat, told the station she's never seen such disgusting acts. Around 60 veterans from both Iraq and Afghanistan attended with their families. She set up the event in to honor her son Joshua - an army sergeant who lost both of his legs. She described how the students were urinating off of the hotel balcony and onto an American flag. 'I have not stood up and said anything about spring break because we constantly want to get the support of the community, but if this is at all indicative of what these college students do we need to get rid of it,' she said. They also ripped a flag to shreds and were trying to run around with it in front of the wounded veterans. Zeta Beta Tau International confirmed that three members of the University of Florida chapter have been expelled from the fraternity and both university chapters have suspended all activities. However they are still investigating what has happened. The branch at the campus in Gainsville, Florida, is already under 'conduct probation' following an alleged hazing incident. A spokesman representing the nationwide fraternity said: 'Early this week our Fraternity was made aware of reports regarding an incident between several members of two of our chapters and veterans of the Warrior Beach Retreat during independent trips to Panama City Beach. 'While the details of their actions are still under investigation, there is no doubt that some of our members engaged in ugly and unacceptable behavior. Their actions have no place in ZBT or anywhere, and they will not be tolerated. Repercussions: Three members of the University of Florida chapter have been expelled. The branch was already under conduct probation following an alleged hazing incident . 'On behalf of our entire organization, I want to apologize to veterans, both those who were in Panama City Beach, and those who have felt the pain from afar, as well as to their families and all who support the Warrior Beach Retreat and had worked to make it a positive and meaningful occasion for attendees. 'I am deeply saddened that the actions of our members ruined this special event and failed to show the respect our military and their families so deserve. 'As we continue our investigation, our chapters at the University of Florida and Emory University have suspended all activities and are fully cooperating in our investigation. In addition, we have already expelled three members of the University of Florida chapter from our organization who we found to have been behaving inappropriately, and we will take any further action necessary as we learn more. 'Our Fraternity also has issued an apology on behalf of all of our members to the Warrior Beach Retreat, the organization that was hosting the veterans to provide them and their families with the opportunity to relax and recharge. 'We are honored that hundreds of our ZBT brothers have served in the military and are disgusted that certain members of our Fraternity failed to exhibit the behaviors we expect from them towards our nation's heroes — respect, gratitude and honor. 'We are committed to fully addressing the events that took place, and will be hiring an independent investigator to help us gather all of the facts. Short-term, we are actively working with the resort, with the Presidents of both universities and with the local police to fully understand the events that took place. In all instances, we have a zero tolerance policy towards this type of behavior and are committed to appropriately disciplining any members of our Fraternity who were involved. 'We also look forward to working with our members to make amends for this disgraceful situation by identifying opportunities to serve those who have done so much to serve us.' University of Florida President Kent Fuchs has personally apologized for the behavior of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity members toward the veterans. Probe: Officials at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, has deplored the actions and is investigating whether any of their students were involved. However they are yet to find any evidence tying the branch's fraternity members to the deplorable behavior in Panama City . In an email to Cope, he wrote: 'The incidents and behavior you and others have described (in letters and phone calls) and the offense to the wounded warriors and other guests are unacceptable. 'We are pursuing an investigation of the matter to learn more about the involvement of University of Florida students and whether disciplinary action will be needed.' Cope responded by saying: 'I said do your investigating, but I want to know what you're going to do. What are you going to do? I think they all should be put on probation. I'm hoping that this will make a dramatic change in their life to realize they do not need to take the sacrifice and the service of these men and women in vain.' Emory University are looking into the allegations, but could not confirm reports that any of their students were involved. A spokesman however said the behavior was not acceptable at the university. They said: 'If any members of our community are identified as being responsible, they will be held accountable for their actions by the university.' The fraternity's mission statement on its website reads: 'Mindful of its founding in 1898 as the Nation's first Jewish Fraternity, ZBT will preserve and cultivate its relationships within the Jewish community. It reads: 'Since 1954, ZBT has been committed to its policy of non-sectarian Brotherhood, and values the diversity of its membership. ZBT will recruit and initiate men of good character, regardless of religion, race or creed who are accepting of these principles.'","Zeta Beta Tau students are being investigated for the 'disgusting' acts .

"Birmingham is the rat capital of the UK and the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs, according to new research. The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. Scroll down for video . A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs . Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_ . While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland. The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem .","Birmingham had almost 15,000 call outs for rats, more than any other city .

"A young father has paid tribute to the toddler son he almost lost by getting a massive tattoo of the boy's portrait on the left side of his face. Christien Sechrist, a 20-year-old from Houston, Texas, had a black and white image of his young son Perseus etched onto the left side of his head in July. But a snapshot of the tattoo is quickly helping the young father to gain national attention after it was shared on Imgur earlier this week. And despite his critics' negative reactions to his tribute tattoo, Christien told Buzzfeed that he doesn't regret his decision to get the controversial ink, even claiming that he would happily get it done again. Bold statement: Christien Sechrist (pictured) has a large tattoo of his son's portrait on his own face . The detailed portrait of the trainee electrician's son Perseus, which features his chubby cheeks and big eyes, takes up the entire left side of Christien's face, starting at the corner of his eyebrow and ending down by his chin. There is even some additional detail featured on his ear lobe. When he shared a picture of his new ink on his Facebook page last summer, Christien gave a shout out to the tattoo artist who designed the creation by thanking him for accurately rendering his son's image. 'Thanks Cody Gibbs for doing awesome work on me. Looks just like my son,' he wrote. But Christien soon found himself being berated by his friend Ashlee Nicole who asked if the picture was a joke. After Christien confirmed that it wasn't, Ashlee expressed her frustration with his choice of location for the tattoo, noting that the ink would likely make it difficult for the young father to get a job in the future. 'Why on your f****** face?! How are you ever going to get a real f***** job to support your son with a tattoo on your face?' she asked. Doting dad: The 20-year-old, from Houston, Texas (thought to be pictured with his son Perseus), insists that he has no regrets about his distinctive facial ink, and claims that his young son 'loves it' Snap a selfie: Christien has eagerly defended his facial ink to his friends on Facebook, many of whom questioned why he chose to get the tattoo in such an obvious location . 'It's not funny!' Ashlee continued. 'I'm going to make you come live with [me] so you don't do stupid sh** like this. Although it is a nice tat, you should have put it somewhere else.' Christien went on to call it a 'beautiful tattoo of a beautiful face on top of another beautiful face'. Meanwhile, another friend, David Overbey, predicted that regret would eventually set in. 'I give it [three] years before the regret starts [rolling] in,' he said, before noting: I'm not judging [though]. I think it's great work. But society frowns upon face tattoos.' Christien responded by saying: 'Well my son looked at it [and] smiled so that's all I care about.' Meanwhile, Derek Farmer argued that there are better ways to express his love for his son. Artistic expression: Christien already has a large tattoo design on the right of his face and the back of his head (pictured) Family ties: The doting dad posts numerous pictures of himself and his family on his Facebook account . 'You don't need a portrait of your child on your face to convince your love for him,' he wrote. 'It takes more than that.' Although not everyone was so judgmental. Cody Meyers commented: 'Yeah bro that does look sick, I plan on getting allot of art done [sic].' It's nine months later and Christien is still a fan of his ink, telling Buzzfeed that his son 'loves it'. He also has a large tattoo design of a skull and a flower on the opposite side of face. And contrary to popular opinion, the tattoo enthusiast said the his dramatic face ink has not affected his ability to find work.","Christien Sechrist, from Houston, Texas, made the decision to get the unique facial art in July last year .

"A new study has shown women still have an increased risk of breast cancer years after stopping taking hormone replacement therapy . Hormone replacement therapy increases a woman's risk of breast cancer up to eight years after she has stopped treatment, scientists have warned. The new findings come from experts who conducted one of the world's largest studies into the effects of HRT - used to ease the effects of menopause. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK have both revealed strong evidence that HRT increases a woman's risk of breast, womb and ovarian cancers. The Million Women Study, a collaboration between Cancer Research UK and the NHS, results suggested that women who are using combined HRT have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. And researchers found if women use HRT for more than 10 years, their risks are even higher. Now scientists involved in the Women's Health Initiative study have warned, after further follow-ups, that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone HRT therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer, up to eight years after they stop treatment. After going through the menopause a woman's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen. It triggers menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings. HRT treats the body by introducing female sex hormones. There are three types, oestrogen-only HRT, cyclical HRT  - where oestrogen is taken continuously but progesterone is given either monthly or every three months - and continuous combined HRT, where both female sex hormones are taken at the same time. In the early 1990s, some smaller studies suggested the therapy would reduce a woman's risk of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. To examine whether that was the case, the Women's Health Initiative in the US was tasked with investigating. They enrolled more than 26,000 women aged 50 to 79 in the study. Meanwhile, in the UK  another key study, the Million Women Study, explored the effects of HRT on women aged 50 or over. Both concluded that women prescribed HRT were at a higher risk of breast cancer, than those not receiving the treatment. WHI researchers had intended to follow the women up until 2005, but in 2002 it became clear women taking HRT were suffering higher rates of heart disease. Those women who took the combined HRT, which boosts the body's levels of both female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone, have an increased risk of breast cancer up to eight years after treatment . They discovered it was the women taking either the combination HRT or those taking oestrogen-only treatment that were going on to suffer heart problems. As a result, all women were asked to stop taking their treatment - HRT or placebo - immediately. After the reported increased risk in breast cancer for women taking combined HRT, use of the therapy dropped dramatically. The new study, led by Dr Rowan Chlebowski, an oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, and one of the initial investigators on WHI, focused on a woman's risk of breast cancer after stopping HRT treatment. He told Time: 'It looks like hormones have longer term lingering effects. 'For oestrogen and progesterone together, we see an increase in risk - even years after you stop. 'But for oestrogen alone, it looks like the hormone may be more favourable in reducing breast cancer risk than we thought before. 'The oestrogen alone findings are now quite compelling that we may have to call it risk reduction.' In total, researchers examined 27,347 women aged 50 to 79 years old, who had been through the menopause. They had all taken part in two previous WHI studies, having enrolled at 40 centres across the US from 1993 to 1998. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK are the two largest studies into the effects of HRT. Both found strong evidence the treatment increases a woman's risk of breast cancer, pictured, with the latter finding it doubled a woman's risk . In the first two years, after stopping HRT treatment, researchers noted a sharp decrease in breast cancer risk in those women who had taken both oestrogen and progesterone. But the study authors noted: 'Subsequently, breast cancer risk increased throughout the intervention phase and became statistically significant.' Even up to five-and-a-half years later, breast cancer risk remained high. In addition, the researchers note that at an eight-year follow-up a 'risk reduction was not observed'. But for those women taking oestrogen only treatment, the risk for invasive breast cancer fell. However, despite the findings, Dr Chlebowski urged caution. He said while the results do show a higher than normal risk of breast cancer years after stopping HRT, it is only 'a little more risk than we thought with oestrogen and progesterone'. 'But it's always difficult to figure out how to categorise that risk,' he added. 'It's different for each woman.'","HRT increase risk of disease up to eight years after stopping treatment .

"A tiny Scottish hamlet named Towie is bracing itself for the world's next gold rush - after prospectors found evidence that it sits on major deposits. The remote community in Aberdeenshire does not even have a shop but local streams have been well known for grains of gold of 'significant size' for decades. Towie has been ignored by investors in favour of the oil industry but a two-year investigation has revealed the possible existence of gold deposits worth millions. A significant deposit is believed by scientists to lie somewhere near Towie which shares its name with the popular Essex reality TV show . Sleepy Towie, population 300, has a single road, a few houses, primary school, church, graveyard and a community hall . Turkish mining giant Koza Altin Isletmeleri and a Highland firm GreenOre are now seeking planning permission for further investigation. GreenOre managing director Gavin Berkenheger, 31, said: 'This area in Aberdeenshire has all the right hallmarks of a major deposit to be hiding underneath the surface. 'We looked at the geology and found some really exciting rocks with potential for a large deposit. 'Over two years we have found that the whole of Aberdeenshire is a ripe area for gold mineralisation. We're just trying to locate where the gold deposit is.' He added: 'A 3.5million ounce gold deposit is currently being developed by Dalradian Gold in Northern Ireland. We hope to repeat this success.' Sleepy Towie, population 300, has a single road, a few houses, primary school, church, graveyard and a community hall. Gold was discovered by Aberdeen University in nearby Rhynie in the 1990s and has long been spotted in local streams. Gold was discovered by Aberdeen University in nearby Rhynie in the 1990s and it has long been spotted in local streams . GreenOre Gold has been working on the site for the last two years and more recently received backing from Koza, controlled by Turkish businessman Hamdi Akin Ipek. They have carried out test drills with more planned, pending pemission. Mr. Berkenheger said the the development of a gold mine was at a very early stage but claimed the area had 'enormous potential'. Panning for gold: Local streams have been well known for grains of gold of 'significant size' for decades . He added: 'We're testing the rock and soil to sample whether it has the potential for gold beneath it. 'We're trying to locate where this deposit will be and we will jump those hurdles when we get there. 'The only way we will know for sure is when we start drilling which we hope to be doing next year. 'Initially we will cover the area with stream sediment sampling - the old-school way. 'Then from the streams with high gold content, we will crack open any rocks we think have the potential of hosting gold. 'The mineral sector has neglected for too long in Scotland because we're so rich with oil and gas but we don't have to be so reliant on that because we're also rich with mineral deposits.' Locals said the prospect of finding gold was 'exciting'. Peter Argyle, local councillor for Aboyne, Upper Deeside and Donside, said: 'Having gold in the area is a very exciting prospect, but it is something that will require a great deal of thought and consultation.

"Ed Miliband has been accused of stooping to a 'shameful' new low by blaming David Cameron for the Mediterranean refugee crisis. The Labour leader  used a keynote campaign speech today to suggest the deaths of hundreds of refugees fleeing North Africa could have been avoided if the Prime Minister had done more following his intervention in Libya to remove the former dictator Colonel Gaddafi. In a briefing note sent out before the speech, Labour went further - claiming the crisis was 'in part a direct result' of Mr Cameron's foreign policy. The allegation provoked a furious response from the Tories who this morning demanded that Mr Miliband apologise for the 'outrageous and disgraceful' remarks. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband, speaking at Chatham House in central London this morning, has been accused of stooping to a 'shameful' new low by blaming David Cameron for the Mediterranean refugee crisis . David Cameron and the former foreign secretary William Hague, speaking in Lincoln today, were accused of neglecting Libya after helping to topple Colonel Gaddafi . It comes after Mr Cameron held emergency talks with EU leaders in Brussels yesterday over how to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis. The Prime Minister announced the deployment of one of Britain's biggest warships - HMS Bulwark - as part of beefed-up efforts to prevent more refugees packing onto tiny boats. Up to 1,750 refugees have lost their lives trying to reach Europe this year - out of around 35,000 who have tried to make the crossing. The vast majority of the migrant boats set off from the Libya, which has descended into chaos in the aftermath of the 2011 revolution which saw Colonel Gaddafi swept from power with the support of France and Britain. Over 200 illegal migrants were  rescued by Italian Guardia di Finanza boat 'Denaro' in the Mediterranean Sea this week . The refugees will be shipped to the Italian mainland after being rescued by Italian coast guards . Mr Miliband today accused the Prime Minister of taking his eye off the ball by failing to secure a stable transfer of power in the wake of the uprising. The Labour leader said this failure had contributed to the crisis today. But the suggestion sparked a furious response from the Prime Minister today. Mr Cameron said: 'Let me be clear about what Ed Miliband has said. I have learned as Prime Minister that it is so important in a dangerous and uncertain world that you show clarity, consistency and strength on these foreign policy issues. 'People will look at these ill-judged remarks and they will reach their own conclusions.' Former foreign secretary William Hague slammed the 'ill-judged, opportunistic remarks'. He said: 'Foreign policy is not something that you can just discover 13 days before polling day. 'This is the first time in five years that Ed Miliband has troubled himself to make a full length speech on foreign policy.' Environment Secretary Liz Truss said Mr Miliband should withdraw the 'outrageous and disgraceful' remarks. 'Accusing the Prime Minister of causing these deaths - whether directly or indirectly - I think is wrong,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'Ed Miliband feels like he's losing the argument and he's lashing out. Of course we should be talking about foreign affairs but it has to be done in a proper manner.' Seek and destroy: Britain will send one of its biggest warships, HMS Bulwark (above), to the Mediterranean within days as part of plans to targets boats used by human traffickers . David Cameron held high-level talks with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi (left), German Chancellor Angela Merkel (top left) and French President Francois Hollande (top right) at a European Union summit yesterday . A senior Tory source added: 'This takes Labour's relentless negative campaigning to a new low.' The source pointed out that Mr Miliband had supported the intervention in Libya which he now blamed for causing the crisis. Nick Clegg said the Labour attack was a 'distasteful' attempt to make political capital from the Mediterranean refugee crisis. Mr Clegg insisted that 'a considerable amount of thought went in by the international community' to the aftermath and 'a huge amount of help and assistance and money has gone into trying to do our bit from outside'. He acknowledged that it was 'legitimate to say that things then spiral in directions that you can't fully predict'. 'All I would plead for is a little less finger-pointing wisdom from Ed Miliband - when he supported the intervention in the first place - and a little bit more adherence to facts about exactly who is ending up on these boats, why they are and what we can now do about it to stop this terrible tragedy,' he said. Mr Cameron was given a rapturous reception in Tripoli in September 2011 after flying into the capital following the Nato bombing campaign which allowed rebels to overthrow Colonel Gaddafi . Libyan rebels overthrew the country's dictator Colonel Gaddafi (right) with the support of British, French and US airstrikes . But the shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander defended Mr Miliband's attack – and insisted the Prime Minister had failed to plan for the aftermath of Colonel Gaddafi's downfall. He said: 'It is a failure of post-conflict planning for which the international community bears responsibility. That's not a matter of dispute, it's a matter of fact.' In his speech to the Chatham House think tank today, Mr Miliband said: 'The tragedy is that this could have been anticipated. 'Since the action, the failure of post-conflict planning has become obvious. David Cameron was wrong to assume that Libya's political culture and institutions could be left to evolve and transform on their own. 'It should have been avoided. And Britain could have played its part in ensuring the international community stood by the people of Libya in practice rather than standing behind the unfounded hopes of potential progress only in principle.' In March 2011 Labour and Tory MPs united to back military action against Libya to stop Muammar Gaddafi committing a ‘bloody massacre’. The country’s then dictator had threatened to slaughter his own people to cling on to power after a rebel uprising in the east of the country. The Commons vote came after the UN Security Council passed a motion giving Britain, France and the US the authority to use ‘all necessary measures’ to protect Libyan civilians. Labour leader Ed Miliband said he supported the action, arguing it was ""a just cause, with a feasible mission, and it has international support"". Less than six months later, in November 2011, after Western bombing raids allowed Libya’s rebel forces to sweep the Gaddafi regime from power, Mr Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy flew into Tripoli. It was the first visit by Western leaders since the dictator 42-year-rule had come to an end. Mr Cameron praised the Libyan fighters as ‘lions’ and described their revolt as the moment ‘when the Arab Spring could become an Arab Summer’ in which ‘we see democracy advance in other countries too’. But in the three years since Colonel Gaddafi was toppled, the country has descended into chaos. There has been no effective government since the 2011 uprising. Instead, there are hundreds of different armed groups fighting for territory and influence. It currently has two rival governments, one based in the capital, Tripoli, and the other based hundreds of miles away in the port of Tobruk. People smugglers are taking advantage of the subsequent chaos and confusion tearing the country apart to ply their trade with little to no threat of being caught. With ISIS also having established strongholds in the towns on Sirte and Derna, and with smaller bases elsewhere in the country, fear of capture and execution at the hands of the radical Islamists is driving the desperate migrants to leave Libya as quickly as they can, dangerously overloading vessels.","Tories accuse Ed Miliband  of stooping to a 'shameful' new low in campaign .

"A rare Bentley which has lain gathering dust for years has been bought for almost four times its estimated value - but still needs a full restoration. The 1954 Bentley R-Type Continental Fastback was estimated to sell for around £200,000 by auctioneers but ended up being sold for £739,212 - a record for the auction house. Originally commissioned by Welsh racing driver R D Weatherall and painted in his racing colour of purple - the license plate still bears his initials. The 1954 Bentley R-Type Continental Fastback (pictured) sold for almost four times its estimated value . The rare Bentley needs a full restoration after it was allowed to gather dust in a barn over the past 15 years . More than 45 people placing bids on behalf of bidders from around the world in the room, over the phone and on the internet. The Bentley eventually sold a to an anonymous British car collector - who faces the task of restoring the car to its former glory. But when it is ready, it could be worth more than £1million - and would prove itself a wise investment for the buyer. A strong market and rising prices mean vintage vehicles are increasingly popular as financial investments - and the value of some classic cars rose by 257 per cent between 2005 and 2013, it was recently reported. But when it is ready, it could be worth more than £1million - and would prove itself a wise investment for the anonymous British collector who bought it . Earlier this week, a clapped out 1962 Aston Martin DB4 Series III went on the market - offering car fanatics the chance to restore the virtually untouched vehicle - with the promise of being worth three times its £220,000 price tag when finished. The R-Type was the second series of post-war Bentley automobiles, replacing the Mark VI. It was considered the epitome of British luxury in the 1950s as well as being the first car to carry the Continental nameplate. It was the fastest production car of the period as it could reach 120mph. But despite its speed capability, the Continental model was produced specifically for the domestic market in continental Europe. And despite vehicles having the same uniform style, each car was unique in detail and unlike almost every car of its time, the Continental had an all-aluminum body. Richard Charlesworth, Bentley's director of royal and VIP relations, described the 1954 Bentley as 'one of the rarest and most iconic cars of its time' as only 218 were made. He also referred to it as 'almost the Bugatti Veyron of its day'. However, this white model is far from fast after spending the past 15 years gathering dust in a barn. When new, the Bentley was the world's fastest four-seat car - capable of 120mph. This was thanks to a 4.9-litre engine which developed almost 180bhp - a large figure for a 61-year-old car. Tony Cavell, director at Barons, said the winning bid was 'an absolutely fantastic result'. He added: 'A 'lost' car always attracts collectors' attention, and when it's such a rare, iconic and valuable machine, that interest can lead to a frenetic bidding battle such as we saw yesterday. 'It will be fascinating to see the 'journey' the Bentley now takes, as its restoration commences.' This virtually-untouched 1962 Aston Martin DB4 Series III went on the market for £220,000 will be worth three times the price if fully restored .","The Bentley R-Type Continental Fastback was expected to sell for £200,000 .

"The former Navy SEAL who killed Osama bin Laden will host a 'machine gun fun' shooting competition at a conservative fundraising event which costs $50,000 a ticket. Robert O'Neill, who claims the distinction of personally shooting dead the Al Qaeda leader, will treat specially-invited guests to a weekend shooting retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Potential attendees were contacted by the right-leaning For America non-profit and told to write back by May 10 for a chance to open fire alongside O'Neill. Shoot with The Shooter: Supporters of a conservative nonprofit were offered the change of a luxury stay in Wyoming with Robert O'Neill, pictured while still in the Navy, which would include a 'machine gun fun' contest . Citing 'security reasons', the invitation, acquired by the Washington Post, did not say exactly when the event would be - but was clear about the hefty price tag. For their substantial donation, guests will be put up in the Amangani Resort Hotel, a sprawling luxury complex perched in the Rocky Mountains, on the edge of the Grand Teton National Park. Also included is the Jackson Hole Shooting Experience, which will see clay pigeon shooting, pistol events as well as the 'machine gun fun' session. The shooting will take the form of a competition, in which guests will try to beat O'Neill's score. Lock and load: Part of the double-handed trip would see guests try out the Jackson Hole Shooting Experience, including pistols, clay pigeon shooting as fully automatic weapons. The gun range is pictured above . Lush: Guests would be housed at the Amangani Resort Hotel, a mountain hotel complex on the edge of a national park . He has described his shooting prowess in great detail previously, specifically how he hit terrorist leader Bin Laden three times in the head, ending his life. Describing the top-secret 2011 raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, O'Neill wrote: 'He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up].' In the account for Esquire magazine - written while he was still anonymous - O'Neill continued: 'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap!' 'The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! same place. 'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath.' A spokesman for O’Neill told the Washington Post that he was participating in the big-money event 'as a favor to a friend who has been helping him out'. On its website, ForAmerica claims to spearhead a new conservative movement on social media. Its introductory texts says that conservatives are 'outnumbered and being hit on both flanks', which it identifies as 'the radical Left' and moderate Republicans. O'Neill leaped into the public spotlight last autumn, coming forward to identify himself as the solider previously known only as The Shooter on Veterans' Day last winter. He spoke at length to Fox News about his exploits in a two-part documentary, and has made numerous speaking engagements since. However, his public discussions of a top-secret mission have angered many in the SEALs, including top commanders who said he was breaking the organization's code of honor by seeking fame. It later emerged that he was being investigated by The Naval Criminal Investigative Service for allegedly revealing classified information. An NCIS spokesman today confirmed that the investigation is still active.","Robert O'Neill revealed himself last year as soldier who killed bin Laden .

"Police have charged a woman with fraud after she allegedly faked a terminal illness to raise thousands of dollars from sympathetic strangers. In August 2014 Elizabeth 'Elle' Edmunds established an online fundraising page claiming she had ovarian cancer and seeking money for medical treatment. Police alleged the 31-year-old mother from Belmont, near Newcastle in NSW, used a falsified doctor's certificate stating she had terminal cancer to raise about $2500 from her page. In February, Ms Edmunds told a Belmont Local Court she was put up to the act by her violent partner John Heagney, and did it because she feared for her life. Elizabeth 'Elle' Edmunds, 31, was issued a court notice this week for the offence of two counts of obtaining benefits by deception, after she faked having terminal cancer to raise money in 2014 . In October, a report was made to police regarding Ms Edmund's activities, and detectives from the Lake Macquarie Local Area Command soon after launched an investigation. She was issued a court notice this week for the offence of two counts of obtaining benefits by deception, and will appear at Belmont Local Court in June. Police inquiries into the matter are continuing and investigators are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. Ms Edmunds went into hiding after revelations of her alleged fraud came to light last year. ‘I was in fear for my life,’ she told Belmont Local Court, near Lake Macquarie in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney, at a hearing in February. She said Mr Heagney had tried to kill her and had severely beaten her on two occasions last year. Heagney claims Ms Edmunds faked the violence and was a self-harmer who punched herself, and that the two dates on which the alleged violence took place, October 20 and November 17 last year, related to the faking of the cancer. In April last year, Ms Edmunds sat her family down and told them she had cancer and doctors had given her just three years to live. She went to great lengths to present herself as a terminal cancer patient, shaving her head and faking hospital visits for chemotherapy treatment. Strangers set up a Facebook page and online crowd-funding account to raise money for her – but the ruse was exposed in November when Heaghney posted a status update that Ms Edmunds was not sick at all. Ms Edmunds’ stepdaughter, Kyala, 19, even got a tattoo on her chest in dedication of her stepmother when she thought she was dying of cancer. The tattoo read: 'Where there is love there is hope ... Elle'. Ms Edmunds said  she believed her mind had tricked her into believing she had the terminal illness – and she even underwent chemotherapy using pills she bought on the internet . Ms Edmunds told Belmont Local Court former partner John Heagney (pictured) forced her to fake the illness . In April last year, Ms Edmunds sat her family down and told them she had cancer and doctors had given her just three years to live . Ms Edmunds said her father and brothers and sisters had been 'shattered' by the cancer 'diagnosis' - and even more so when they found out it was fake. At the time, it was believed Heagney then ended their relationship after learning of Ms Edmunds’ deception. In a hearing in February, Ms Edmunds said Heagney was devastated about the ruse, but not because she deceived him. 'He was shattered because we'd been found out. He was in on it just as much as me. It was his documentation, doctors. 'I went through with it because I was in fear. 'I had to tell people that I had cancer under Johnny's instructions because I had his gun charges and that was the only way for me to get off the gun charges,' she told the court. 'If I hadn't done it I would have been killed.' It’s alleged the 31-year-old Belmont mother falsified a certificate from a Sydney doctor that stated she had the disease, and allegedly raised about $2500 from the page .

The mother from Lake Macquarie, NSW, went to great lengths to convince friends, family, and strangers that she had cancer, shaving her head and faking hospital visits for chemotherapy treatments . Last November, Ms Edmunds told Woman’s Day she genuinely believed she was sick. She said she believed her mind had tricked her into thinking she had the terminal illness – and she even underwent chemotherapy using pills she bought on the internet. Ms Edmunds told the magazine she was sorry for her deception. The court heard today that Ms Edmunds last year pleaded guilty at Belmont Local Court to possessing unlicensed firearms, which she claimed  were Heagney's weapons. Ms Edmunds, who has fled to Queensland and says she is in hiding and living 'in fear of my life', arrived at court with her mother, Judy Edmunds, and three support people including a domestic violence refuge worker. Ms Edmunds told the court Heagney had made vicious verbal and physical attacks on her on the dates in October and November last year. She said a row had erupted on October 20. 'John started to yell at me and call me ... a f***ing dumb c***, a stupid sl** [and] nothing but a piece of s***, I'm going to kill you. 'Johnny ... punched me in the face with a closed fist. I said ""well, just kill me now"". I went into the bathroom. He came from behind me and put his arms around and covered my face and nose and stopped me from breathing.' Heagney said he felt he 'was having a nervous breakdown' because he had been acting as 'a full time carer for Elle.'

"An 82-year-old woman died after sitting in the same chair in her South Carolina home for six months, authorities have said. Barbara Anne Beam was being looked after by her elderly sister and nephew when she passed away in her bedroom in Greenville on January 2. The coroner's office found she died from a blood clot in her lung and ruled that her death was homicide by neglect. Prosecutors are now deciding whether to charge the family members. Officers were called to the home on January 2 and the smell was so bad that some of the first firefighters on the scene set up a fan by the door. Scene: Barbara Beam died in her South Carolina home in January after sitting for six months and prosecutors are considering charges against her caretakers. The identity of the woman pictured is not known . An officer noticed ulcers on the back of the 200-pound woman's legs and that body fluids were staining the sunken seat of her chair, according to the police report. The sister told the officer that Beam 'stays in the chair located in the bedroom and that she had not moved out of the chair for approximately six months,' according to a police report. She added that, a few hours before her sister's death, Beam refused to eat and they watched a soap opera together in her bedroom before she went to the kitchen. When she returned, Beam was slumped in her chair and the sister and nephew could find no pulse. When paramedics took Beam out of the chair and put her on the floor, her legs were still bent in a sitting position when the officer arrived. She was not wearing pants, according to the report. When she died, she also had deep vein thrombosis, which are clots caused by sitting for long periods of time, and a serious infection that started in her kidneys, the coroner's office said. 'The decedent had significant ulcerations and wounds - pressure ulcers, essentially - on her legs from prolonged inactivity and prolonged time spent in a chair,' Dr. James Fulcher, the deputy medical examiner who performed the autopsy said, the Greenville News reported. Police have turned their file on the case over to prosecutors, who are reviewing it, Greenville Police spokesman Johnathan Bragg said on Friday.","Barbara Beam died in the home she shared with her sister and nephew in Greenville, South Carolina in January .

But for one luxury South African resort, Etali Safari Lodge, which offers game drives and walks to see the continent's Big Five, one of the animals is often ticked off the list before leaving the hotel. One African elephant has take a particular liking to resort's pool and deck area - so much so staff have nicknamed the elephant Troublesome. This elephant has taken such a liking to the Etali Safari Lodge's pools he has been nicknamed Troublesome . The cheeky African elephant has subverted the resort's efforts to keep him from emptying their pools . Troublesome isn't shy of the resort staff and has no problem spraying them with water from his trunk . Troublesome is a regular visitor to Etali in the Madikwe Game Reserve and has become a regular visitor to the splash pools there over the past four years, much to guests' amusement. Video footage shows the cheeky African elephant wandering into the complex as if he owns the joint - he certainly knows his way around - before seeking refreshment from the splash pools. Troublesome likes to dip his trunk into the pools for a drink, but also enjoys having some fun with the humans and has no problem spraying them with water - or maybe he's reminding them who's boss. While sundowners on the deck overlooking a herd of local elephants is a regular feature for Etali guests, having an elephant joining them for a drink isn't part of the plan. Troublesome has been a regular visitor to Etali in the Madikwe Game Reserve for the past four years . A guest watches on as Troublesome wanders around the deck and pool area as if he owns the joint . Safety concerns and the fact he is emptying out the pools with his antics have led resort staff to take action and try to keep their four-legged friend out of the grounds, but it appears Troublesome is living up to his name and keeps out-witting them. Etali Safari Lodge's manager Kristoff Potgieter said efforts to deter him have fallen on deaf ears. 'After our previous incidents with Troublesome and the other elephants around the lodge, we have tried to deter them from emptying out the splash pools,' he said. The more conventional interaction with the elephants (centre) is with a sundowner on the deck by the pool . The splash pool at the luxury safari resort is regularly emptied out by the visiting elephant . Troublesome has thwarted attempts to deter him because he likes the clear water offers by the resort . 'However Troublesome is no ordinary elephant, he wandered around the pathways of the lodge looking for his gap, and keeping our staff and guests on their toes! 'Finally he figured out that he could make it to the edge of our main pool at the edge of the main lodge wooden deck. 'He just cannot resist the cool, clear water of our pool.' When Etali boasts it offers 'guests a unique and personal African bush experience wherein nature, relaxation and luxury combine to form an unforgettable memory', they're not kidding.","African elephant has regularly visited Etali Safari Lodge for four years .

"A husband sot dead his eight-year-old son and wife before killing himself at a gas station in Georgia last night. Christopher Whitmore, 36, pulled up behind to where his wife was parked with their son Grayden in the backseat and killed his child before turning the gun on Melissa Ball, 27, and then himself. Police said Ball and Whitmore had a history of domestic issues and were separated - but at this stage it is unclear what motivated the horrific shooting in Varnell. Killed his family: Christopher Whitmore murdered his wife Melissa Ball (left), 27, and their eight-year-old son Grayden (pictured together, right) before turning the gun on himself at a gas station in Georgia last night . Ball was seen pulling into the joint Shell station and McDonald's in her Ford Focus at around 7pm, when her husband drove up behind her in his 2010 Dodge. Both had got out of their cars when Whitmore drew a handgun and started shooting. A Tennessee man named Jeff Holmes, who said Ball was his niece, wrote on Facebook: 'Please pray for our family. My beautiful neice Melissa Ball and her son Grayden were taken from us tonight in Varnell Georgia. We are in total shock.' According to her Facebook page, Ball worked at a pediatrician's office in Dalton. Police say all of the victims lived in Beaverdale, around ten miles east of Varnell, New York Daily News reports. Horrific shooting: A gas station in Varnell, Georgia was seen cordoned off last night after Christopher Whitmore shot his son, wife and then himself . A recent picture of her has attracted a flood of comments from bereaved friends, with one writing 'such an angel' and another posting 'miss you so much already dear friend'. Sheriff Scott Chitwood told The Dalton Daily Citizen the couple had 'domestic issues'. Police received the call at 6:49pm that people had been shot in the parking lot of a convenience center at 3896 Cleveland Highway. Chitwood added: 'Investigators have determined Ms Ball pulled up to a gas pump at the Shell station in her 2013 Ford Focus and immediately after she pulled up Christopher Eric Whitmore drove up and parked directly behind her. Investigation underway: Police said Ball and Whitmore had a history of domestic issues and were separated . 'They both exited their cars and both walked to the back door (passenger side) of the 2010 Dodge Mr Whitmore was driving. 'Investigators determined at that time Christopher Eric Whitmore pulled out a handgun and shot their son while he was sitting in the back seat of the Dodge. 'Whitmore then immediately pointed the gun at Ms. Ball and shot her, and then shot himself.'","Melissa Ball was parked at gas station  with son Grayden in the backseat .

"Mexican restaurant Chipotle has decided to tap into the $70 billion food delivery market by teaming up with an app to bring burritos straight to customers' doors. The fast-casual chain will work with the Postmates app to begin offering delivery for online and mobile orders in 67 cities, according to a report in Nation's Restaurant News. But Mexican food fans should know that the restaurant plans to add a nine per cent service charge - with the delivery fees for Postmates beginning at $5 and up, depending on distance and demand. New venture: Mexican restaurant Chipotle has decided to tap into the $70 billion food delivery market by teaming up with an app to bring burritos straight to customers' doors . Chipotle is thought to have turned down previous offers of collaboration with third-party delivery services - but has now given Postmates the green light, New York Daily News reports. The app hires independent contractors who drive their own cars in a similar model to Uber taxis. Chipotle has gone from strength to strength in recent years and this month two presidential candidates have been spotted in their restaurants. Republican contender Marco Rubio is a regular in the outlets and recently told MailOnline that he always tips staff. Cashing on delivery market: The fast-casual chain will work with the Postmates app to begin offering delivery for online and mobile orders in 67 cities . And just one day into her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton was seen in a Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio where she ordered a chicken dish with guacamole, a chicken salad and fruit juice. Chipotle is not the only franchise hoping to cash in on the lucrative delivery market. Starbucks, which will deliver cups of coffee in parts of Seattle and New York by the end of the year, has also partnered with Postmates. Taco Bell recently announced plans to test a delivery service this year, McDonald's 'McDelivery' program is in the planning process and Burger King has launched a pilot program in select markets, including parts of New York City, through bkdelivers.com.

"She embraced him, thanked him, held his hand and forgave him. Holocaust survivor Eva Kor had waited 70 years for a moment such as this – and now, at last, she was face to face with a former SS man on trial for his alleged part in the slaughter at Auschwitz. Oskar Groening looked startled at first, then smiled. He placed a kiss on her cheek and listened to the words of the 81-year-old woman who, with her twin sister, was once the subject of Josef Mengele’s monstrous human experiments. Embrace: Seventy years after Auschwitz was liberated, Eva Kor embraces former Nazi guard Oskar Groening . Redemption: Holocaust survivor Kor takes the hand of Groening as he stands in the dock accused of complicity to murder 300,000 people . Auschwitz survivor Eva Kor has spoken of how infamous Josef Mengele stood over her bed and laughed after she was injected with a 'deadly germ' Groening (pictured) described in chilling detail Wednesday how cattle cars full of Jews were brought to the Auschwitz death camp, the people stripped of their belongings and then most led directly into gas chambers . Groening, who worked for an insurance company after the war, has testified as a witness in other Nazi trials . The extraordinary moment of reconciliation took place as the 93-year-old former death camp clerk – known as the Bookkeeper of Auschwitz – prepared to listen to Mrs Kor’s evidence in a trial that could condemn him to die in jail. She claims Groening was so overwhelmed by her unexpected gesture that he fainted. Mrs Kor was criticised by other victims and their families for her public forgiveness. ‘Not only criticism,’ she said. ‘They called me a traitor.’ But she explained: ‘As long as we understand my forgiveness that the victim has a right to be free, you cannot be free from what was done to you unless you remove from your shoulder the daily burden of pain and anger and forgive the Nazis – not because they deserve it, but because I deserve it. ‘When I talk to survivors, and I say why on earth does my forgiveness hurt you, they have no answers. I guess victims like to have more victims; the bigger the crowd, the better. I don’t understand it. ‘The victims, 70 years after liberation, with 300 others, they were all talking about their experience, falling apart – “poor me… what have they done to me?” ‘I don’t forget what they have done to me. But I am not a poor person – I am a victorious woman who has been able to rise above the pain and forgive the Nazis.’ When she approached him before the hearing, she held her arms outstretched towards his – and this most unlikely pair became locked in an embrace. Recovery: Miriam and Eva Kor as shown in a 1949 photo. Eva Kor and her twin sister Miriam were among the 1,500 twins (amounting to 3,000 children) Dr. Josef Mengele experimented on in Auschwitz . SS Sergeant Oskar Groening is  on trial charged with complicity in the killing of 300,000 Jews at the Nazi extermination camp . Asked yesterday why she had hugged him, she said it had not been planned and added: ‘I wanted to thank him for having some human decency in accepting responsibility for what he has done. ‘I was always interested in meeting him face to face because I believe that there is a human interaction that I cannot predict and no one else can predict.’ Mrs Kor later tweeted: ‘I met Oskar Groening, introduced myself reached to shake his hand-he grabbed my arm & fainted-I screamed 4 help. It was a strange reaction!!’ She said Groening bore responsibility for helping to run the wartime concentration camp – but urged him to spend his last days teaching others about the evil of Nazism. In a moving interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme she continued: ‘He is 93 years old. Putting him in jail is absurd. But he can do some good…’ Mrs Kor travelled more than 4,000 miles from home in Indiana, US, to the hearing in Luneburg, Germany. Groening was known as the 'Bookkeeper of Auschwitz' because it was his responsibility to collate and ship the valuables of the doomed back to the SS in Berlin . Josef Mengele (1911-1979), the notorious Nazi German physician, in an image taken from from Nazi Hunter: The Wiesenthal File, by Alan Levy . Her family had been among hundreds of thousands deported in cattle trucks from Hungary and Romania to death camps such as Auschwitz. Groening’s job at the camp was to collect and tally money stolen from the new arrivals and then send it to Berlin. He denies being an accessory to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews there but has begged forgiveness for what he called his ‘moral guilt’. It was at the camp that the ten-year-old Eva and her twin sister Miriam were singled out by Mengele for his grotesque genetic experiments. Being chosen ‘didn’t mean the person was assured a life’, she said. ‘It meant you were not immediately taken to the gas chamber.’ She told how she had to stay alive for the sake of her twin sister. She knew if she had died, it would effectively sentence her sister to death – one twin without the other would have been useless for the experiments. Survivors from Auschwitz (pictured), who are plaintiffs in the case, travelled from the United States, Canada, Hungary and elsewhere to attend Groening's trial . Between May 16 and July 11, 1944, Groening was on duty when 450,000 Hungarian Jews were transported there, with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival. Pictured, Auschwitz survivors . She said: ‘She would have been killed immediately, and Mengele would have done comparative autopsies. So I spoiled their experiment. I survived.’ Mengele used 1,500 sets of twins in his experiments, and only an estimated 180 to 250 individuals survived. Mrs Kor described how she was injected with a ‘deadly germ’ that she still cannot identify. ‘Mengele stood by my bed and was laughing sarcastically after reading my fever charts and saying I had only two weeks to live. For those following two weeks I have only one single memory: crawling on the barrack floor and trying to reach a faucet (tap) at the other end of the barrack for some water. ‘As I was crawling and fading out of consciousness, I kept saying to myself, “I must survive”. And I did.’ Mrs Kor said she asked the defendant if he knew Mengele. ‘He told me no.’ She also asked if he knew what happened to the files Mengele kept on the twins he subjected to experiments. Those files, she said, ‘have disappeared from the face of the earth’. She added: ‘I still don’t know what was injected into my body, and I don’t know what was injected into my twin sister’s body, who died 20 years ago, nor into the bodies of any of the other twins.’ Appealing for any information about the files, she said Miriam’s kidney failed in 1987 and although she donated one of her own, Miriam subsequently died. ‘I believe in this big world we have talked so much about human rights that I should have the human right to find out what they injected into me 70 years ago.’ Groening told the court on Tuesday that he is 'morally guilty' but not directly responsible for any deaths .","Eva Kor, 81, embraced former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening, 93 .

"The rogue trader facing charges he manipulated the share market and helped trigger a trillion dollar Wall Street crash will remain in jail for the weekend after failing to pay his £5million bail. Navinder Singh Sarao, 37, is facing extradition and is wanted by American prosecutors after allegedly causing the 2010 Wall Street 'flash crash' and making more than £26 million using a fraudulent trading technique. Sarao, of Hounslow, west London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday and was bailed with a surety of £5 million. Suspected rogue trader Navinder Sarao (circled) lived in his parents' modest home because it gave him a split-second advantage worth millions of pounds . Sarao (pictured in court) spent a third night in custody last night after failing to pay the £5million surety demanded by the courts to grant him bail . However, he has remained behind bars since his brief appearance, and will remain there over the weekend after an official from the magistrates' court today said it had not received the money. The spokeswoman said: 'It hasn't been paid and it can't be paid over the weekend. He will therefore remain in custody until at least Monday when he is able to pay the money.' The former Brunel University student allegedly made £550,000 in five minutes on the day of the 'Flash Crash', the biggest one-day collapse in Wall Street history. He is accused of using computer programs to create 'spoof' transactions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and faces charges which could carry a 380-year prison sentence. It's claimed he did all this from his parents' semi-detached home in Hounslow, west London, where he ran his one man trading company. He was arrested at the address on Tuesday afternoon at the request of American prosecutors. Under bail conditions he will be tagged and he has surrendered his passport and must live at the family home - keeping to a curfew of between 11pm and 4am at that address. His parents have also agreed to surrender their passports as part of the bail conditions. A full extradition hearing for Sarao has been set for August 18th and 19th, with a preliminary hearing on May 26th. Sarao's family's semi-detached house in suburban west London (pictured), from where he traded . After his arrest earlier this week made headlines across the world, details of his life have been revealed by former colleagues. One of which told MailOnline today: 'He was a super human trader - we were in awe of his ability to make money. When he left Futex he took £2.5million from his account with him. That was unheard of. 'We were all encouraged to set up offshore accounts. If he has as much money as people think then that's where it'll be.' He is said to have 'loved making money, not spending it', and friend told MailOnline he would make £250,000 a day trading. Despite his alleged wealth he would travel to work late so he could buy off-peak tickets, only have lunch if he could find cut price sandwiches and shunned drinking in pubs for pints of milk at his desk.

"Danny Alexander has finally replied to the infamous note left in the Treasury by a Labour predecessor, saying there was 'no money' left. Liam Byrne, who was Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Gordon Brown, left a memo on his desk after Labour's election defeat in 2010. The memo, found by his Liberal Democrat successor David Laws, said: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid that there is no money. Kind regards and good luck.' Mr Alexander, the present Chief Secretary, today finally got round to sending a letter to Mr Byrne apologising for the late reply – saying it was because he had been 'fixing the economy'. It said: 'The deficit halved. Jobs up. Growth up. That's the Liberal Democrat record,' he wrote. 'We won't let you – or the Tories – screw it up!' Scroll down for video . Danny Alexander tweeted a picture of himself with his response to the infamous note left in the Treasury by his Labour predecessor Liam Byrne, saying there was 'no money' left . Mr Alexander, the present Chief Secretary, today sent a letter (left) to Mr Byrne apologising for the late reply to his original note (right) – saying it was because he had been 'fixing the economy' The original note has haunted Labour since it was first published in the days after Coalition was formed in 2010. Ed Balls sparked a furious response from David Cameron earlier this month after he dismissed the letter as a 'jokey note'. The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by Mr Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is joined by his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez at The Devonshire Arms in Sheffield today . The Deputy Prime Minister is hoping his message that the Lib Dems can be trusted with the economy will help turn around his party's dire position in the polls . He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Liam Byrne, who was Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Gordon Brown, left the original memo on his desk after Labour's election defeat . Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending – it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books – it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' The Prime Minister said Mr Balls's response was 'frankly the most appalling thing I have heard in this election campaign so far'. He claimed Balls was Ed Miliband's third choice to be shadow chancellor and was frankly 'the country's last choice to be put in charge of this nation's finances'. He said: 'The note that was left was correct. It said there was no money left. Let us think about the consequences of what we inherited and what we had to do. We had to make difficult decisions, we had to find efficiencies in government spending, we had to put up some taxes. 'We had to make some very very difficult decisions to get this country back on track. That note that said there is no money left was referring to the fact that our budget deficit was forecast to be bigger than the budget deficit in Greece when I became prime minister.'","Labour's Liam Byrne left a memo for the incoming Coalition government .

Government authorities in the city of Qingyuan in the north west Guangdong province were tipped off about an illegal cotton mill. When they arrived at the mill in Qing Cheng District on Wednesday, they found large quantities of fake cotton goods and another more unexpected discovery. Inside a locked room officials found Xie  making cotton products. Speaking with a stammer, he said that in 1997, aged 16, he voluntarily went to Qingyuan with the mill owner, but was locked away in cramped living quarters and treated like a slave. Each day he was given a huge workload and was beaten. 'They would often force feed me horrible things and when I would struggle they would hit me in the head with a hammer,' Xie said.

In fact neighbours said they always had an inkling someone was being held illegally in the building. Neighbour Mr Xie said he could hear cries of pain every night which he initially thought were from a child being punished. Over time he knew there was someone held inside the building, but because the doors were always locked he couldn’t be sure. 'When the police arrived we helped the guy to leave the building,' Mr Xie said. 'He was shaking all over saying that if he left the building the owner would beat him to death.' When police arrived at the mill, the couple fled the scene.","Xie Shisheng was just 16 when he was imprisoned in a Chinese cotton mill .

"This is the university equality officer at the centre of a sexism and racism row pictured in front of a 'no white men' sign showing  their tears dripping into a cup. A picture of Bahar Mustafa, 27, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, pretending to cry was posted online  as she was being accused of discrimination. The handmade poster also refers to a ban on 'cis' or cisgender men, a term used of those whose mental gender and physical sex match, which is the opposite of transgender. Message: This picture of Bahar Mustafa, the student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University, shows her posing in front if a 'no white men' sign while pretending to cry . Row: Ms Mustafa appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this Facebook post . The photograph first appeared on Miss Mustafa's Facebook profile on Tuesday, six days after she told white people and men 'not to come' to a meeting she was organising to discuss 'diversifying the curriculum'. She wrote on Facebook last week: ‘Invite loads of BME [black and minority ethnic] Women and non-binary people!! Also, if you’ve been invited and you’re a man and/or white PLEASE DON’T COME just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only.’ Non-binary is a term used to describe people who do not consider themselves exclusively male or female. Miss Mustafa, 27, added: ‘Don’t worry lads we will give you and allies things to do’, followed by a wink. The event’s online page said it was open to ‘self-defining BLACK and ETHNIC MINORITY women and non-binary people with gender identities that include “woman”.’ A notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped, stating: 'Allies now welcome!' Miss Mustafa, pictured at a demonstration, describes herself as a ‘queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy’ and previously organised a 'BME ONLY social’ before showing the film Dear White People . The post was met with outrage by students of the university, one of whom described the exclusive policy as 'patronising beyond belief'. The story was covered by student newspaper The Tab just hours after Miss Mustafa first posted the image. Goldsmiths' union eventually backed down after a backlash from students. The ban on men and white students is surprising, since the organisers claim to promote ‘zero tolerance’ for ‘all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression’. A senior union member told student newspaper The Tab that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students. In the hours after the story made national news yesterday, a friend of Miss Mustafa again posted the picture of her pretending to cry to Facebook. He wrote: 'When you thought the cup in the picture was big enough for white tears'. In February, Miss Mustafa, whose Twitter biography says she is ‘queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy’, also organised a 'BME ONLY social’ before showing the film Dear White People. Today her friends posted supportive messages on her Facebook page and also offered her a place to stay if she needed it. But not everyone was so supportive. One Facebook friend, called Jessie, wrote: 'You do not speak for me. I voted you into the position of Welfare and Diversity Officer. 'Your passion is inspiring. But I can't defend this. We cannot best ""them"" by being them. We cannot demand to be included by excluding. 'To specifically exclude a group of people from any event is to become the oppressor. As the oppressed, we should not wish to inflict upon others that pain which we know to be harmful to us. 'This is not the Goldsmiths I love'. Bahar Mustafa, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a 'diversity' meeting . Graduate: Miss Mustafa recently completed an MA in gender and media studies and won election to become the union's Welfare and Diversity Officer . Miss Mustafa recently graduated from Goldsmiths with an MA in gender and media studies. Criticism: Critics have said that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students but friends have also defended her . She is understood to live with her mother Nursen, 55, father Ismail, 57, and sister Ipek, 23, in Enfield in a £450,000 three-bedroom terrace. The Daily Mail tried to contact Miss Mustafa but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her Facebook account. A friend told MailOnline  she 'does not want to talk to you'. Yesterday a spokesman for Goldsmiths said the university had no part in the decisions of the union, adding: ‘We are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression, including racism, sexism or any other form of bigotry. ‘We have written to the students’ union to express our concern.’ The union said: ‘Goldsmiths Students’ Union places huge importance on equality and diversity. ‘It is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face. ‘The accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly'. Goldsmiths has insisted the Student Union is a separate organisation over which it has no control .","Elected diversity officer Bahar Mustafa caught in racism and sexism row .

"Your wedding is fast approaching and, as a last hurrah, you decide to celebrate in the most extravagant way possible - with a trip to ‘Space Vegas'. Here even a 'poor space miner can maybe strike it lucky at the zero-g roulette tables'. That’s the fantastic future imagined by one artist, whose awe-inspiring drawings of a next-generation space station in orbit reveal what space travel may one day look like. Taking one of several imaginative space planes, in this future timeline you’ll be partying to your heart’s content in an orbital extravaganza. Concept artist Alex Brady from Cambridge has created beautiful pictures of what space travel might look like. He imagines a space station of tomorrow similar to Las Vegas (shown in image), with neon lights and plenty of attractions . The images were created by concept artist Alex Brady, 32, from Cambridge in the UK, who normally works on video games and movies. But for these drawings he decided to try his hand at imagining what the future of space travel might look like. A space settlement would be a large structure, comparable in size to a town or small city, built in Earth orbit. It would have similar amenities and services to towns and cities on Earth, and would enable people to live in space. The ISS currently houses six astronauts at a time, but a space settlement would have hundreds or thousands of people on board. Future space settlements may also have artificial gravity by rotating around an axis. ‘It’s inspired by super yachts docking at the casino marinas in Monaco, as well as Macao and of course Las Vegas,’ he told MailOnline. ‘I liked the kind of trashy, flashy future in movies like The Fifth Element. ‘They’re absolutely preposterous but also cheerful and dynamic and irreverent.’ In the main image of Space Vegas, a fantastic array of colours and attractiosn can be seen, including a Ferris wheel and a lit-up cowboy. Several spacecraft docked at the space station can also be seen, based on similar designs for space planes. It is located in orbit around Earth, allowing planes to seemingly take off from Earth and then return to the planet with relative ease. The cone-shaped space station is also shown in a state of partial completion, with space planes again making the journey from the ground. ‘It’s inspired by super yachts docking at the casino marinas in Monaco, as well as Macao and of course Las Vegas [pictured],’ artist Alex Brady, 32, told MailOnline. ‘I liked the kind of trashy, flashy future in movies like The Fifth Element' The station is located in orbit around Earth, allowing planes to seemingly take off from Earth and then return to the planet with relative ease .

The cylindrical design would allow the space station to rotate and provides its inhabitants with artificial gravity . And Mr Brady has also given his take on how humans might get into orbit in the future on a variety of space planes. These are commonly known as single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicles, as they could take off from a runway and land back on Earth without having to use an expendable rocket - like the Space Shuttle had to. His designs incorporate efforts from Europe, the US and India. And such imaginings aren’t that far-fetched; Esa recently tested its unmanned IXV (Intermediate Experimental Vehicle) spacecraft.

But when it comes to space stations, Mr Brady says his designs are a little different and more free-form than others that have been devised. ‘I tend to think space stations are usually depicted in a rather austere way, like in the amazing sequences in 2001: A Space Odyssey,’ he said. ‘I don’t like to second guess Stanley Kubrick, he is one of my favourite artists and a genius, but I imagine maybe space cities to be like our cities here on Earth; cluttered, crowded, busy, a little dysfunctional. ‘I think to an extent we like our cities that way. Big but also full of smaller, human details and regional variation.’ He adds that these images aren’t meant to be taken as a wholly serious look at the future of space travel, but rather ‘a light-hearted imagining of the future where even a poor space miner can maybe strike it lucky at the zero-g roulette tables!’ Mr Brady says his designs are a little different  than others that have been devised, such as in 2001: A Space Odyssey (image from the movie shown).

"A cocaine smuggler who was caught crossing the Atlantic with £200million of drugs got so hungry on the trip he started snorting part of the one-tonne haul. Benjamin Mellor ripped open one of the 41 bales of cocaine after food ran out and he broke his wrist, Cork circuit criminal court heard. The 35-year-old window cleaner, from Bradford, was one of three Brits who were arrested after Naval officers stormed the yacht 200 miles off the south-west coast of Ireland in September. Irish Navy personnel stand guard behind the mountain of cocaine that was found on the yacht Makayabella . He was jailed for eight years yesterday after admitting drug trafficking and importation. Thomas Britteon, 28, also received eight years for the same charges while John Powell, 70, was sentenced for 10. The scheme began in 2013 when Powell took charge of the 62ft Makayabella in the Caribbean. He sailed it for a year as a charter boat to provide a cover story before picking up the 1,025kg consignment of cocaine in Venezuela last August. The 35-year-old window cleaner, from Bradford, was one of three men who were arrested after Naval officers stormed the yacht, pictured being brought into Cobh,  200 miles off the south-west coast of Ireland in September . A photo captures the moment Irish Navy ship LE Niamh approached the Makayabella . The yacht was taken to the Haulbowline naval base following the Navy operation before being searched . A map showing where the previous ship had to be rescued and where the smugglers carrying £200million of cocaine were intercepted . He was accompanied by Mellor, with both being paid £100,000 for the trip, and later by Britteon, from Grimsby, who was to receive £20,000. But the plot started to unravel when another vessel, known as the Sea Breeze, had to be rescued in the Irish Sea after it ran out of fuel. Irish authorities became suspicious at the large amount of food, diesel, cannabis and satellite phones found onboard. The Makayabella was simultaneously reported to be floundering in the Atlantic, leading Irish and UK authorities to suspect that the Sea Breeze was attempting to rendezvous with the yacht. Inspector Fergal Foley, a Garda investigator, said the Makayabella was in a grim state when they found it and was running out of drinking water. He said: 'To be blunt, they were delighted to see the navy'. Powell’s son Stephen, 48, from Guiseley, West Yorkshire, was a ‘major player’ in Britain’s drugs underworld and was the ‘main man’ behind the operation, the court was told. He has already been sentenced to 16 years for conspiracy to import cocaine. Both Mellor and Britteon were described as ‘simply hired help’. Powell was given a longer sentence because he had flown out to inspect the yacht and knew through his son about the whole plan.","Benjamin Mellor ripped package of drugs open after food ran out .

Here's hoping: Jewelry brand Jet Set Candy's Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm comes in 14K gold vermeil (L) and sterling silver (R) and retails for $198 and $148, respectively . Eligible bachelor: Prince Harry is one of the eight 'future husbands' listed on the charm's playful spinner wheel . The charm has a double-sided Wheel of Fortune-style spinner, allowing wearers to predict their fate with one quick spin. While the front lists one-year-old Prince George and 30-year-old Prince Harry, as well as other more generic options such as ‘Duke’, ‘Marquess’, ‘Earl’, ‘Viscount’, ‘Baron’ and ‘Commoner’, as the options for your future husband, the flip side offers eight 'future homes', allocating you anything from a palace, castle or estate to an abbey, manor, house, cottage – or even foreclosure. Meanwhile, the charm silently acknowledges that 32-year-old Prince William, who is awaiting the birth of his second child with Kate, is already taken - by not mentioning him at all. The jewelry brand, which is perfect for anyone who has the travel bug, also sells similar spinner charms for other cities, as well as various destination pendants, luggage tag charms, link bracelets, engraved bangles and more. Jet Set Candy's founder and designer Nicole Parker King launched the collection in 2014 after traveling on six different continents and nearly 50 countries .

"For most couples, a  peck on the lips is a quick way to show affection. But for Kerrie Armitage, a kiss from husband Peter can trigger agonising hives. The mother-of-three, from Leeds, suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water. She was diagnosed two years ago after her skin erupted in agonising blisters when she got caught in a rain storm. Now the 28-year-old has had to stop kissing her husband of four years, because the saliva on his lips can trigger a painful flare-up. Kerrie Armitage, from Leeds, suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water. She claims a kiss from her husband Peter (right) can trigger a painful flare-up, due to contact with his saliva . She said: 'Because Peter's lips are wet, the saliva can make me react. He's got to make sure his lips are dry before he gave me a kiss. 'It's not every time - I can do the same thing time and time again and not react, but then I'll do it once more and get a flare-up.' Her condition means that external exposure to water is the main problem, rather than drinking liquid. The situation has become so bad that hugging her children can trigger an episode, as their body heat makes her sweat - and she has trained herself not to cry. However, she added an allergic reaction tended to depend on the circumstances. 'For example, if Peter was to give me a kiss on a hot day when I'm flushed, I'd probably flare up, but maybe not if I was in a cool environment,' she said. 'It can be frustrating but he's really supportive. 'After years together, it's become normal. You learn how to get used it. But it can be bothersome.' Mrs Armitage now faces a daiily battle to protect her skin from agonising flare-ups - and has also been forced to give up her job as a cleaner because she cannot not touch water. Even hugging her children Katie, nine, Emily, two and four-year-old step-daughter Savannah,  can become a nightmare as their body heat can trigger a reaction. 'It affects every aspect of my day to day life,' she said. 'I have to choose between doing the washing up and bathing my kids. My hands can't take them both – it's too painful.' She added: 'When I've got my children sat on me giving me a cuddle their body heat can cause me to sweat and have a reaction. Her condition has become so bad that her hugging her children can trigger an episode, as their body heat makes her sweat - and bathing them can be problematic . 'Even tears can trigger the hives. I've had to train myself not to cry. 'I've learned not to get too angry or frustrated, as this can make my body flush and cause me to sweat, which can be very painful.' Due to her condition, Mrs Armitage must ensure she bathes in under 10 minutes to try and minimise the allergic reaction. 'I've found the closer the water is to body temperature the faster I react, so I have really hot baths to try lessen the reaction,'she siad. 'I also  don't drink cold water - it feels quite sharp at the back of my throat - so I stick to coffee.' Mrs Armitage, who has to keep antihistamines and an EpiPen with her at all times, also suffers from exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Previously a size eight, with a keen interest in fitness, the exercise allergy combined with side effects of her medication have seen her expand to a size 14. She discovered this second allergy just months after her urticaria diagnosis after playing on a Nintendo Wii Fit game at home. 'It was completely out of the blue,' she said. 'I couldn't breathe, I was on the floor struggling to get air into my lungs. 'Thankfully, I stopped the exercising straight away and my breathing slowed, but I was left feeling quite sick for a few days afterwards.' The mother-of-two suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water. She was diagnosed two years ago after her skin erupted in agonising blisters when she got caught in a rain storm. Swellings known as weals appear between 15 minutes and two hours after exposure to water . She can now tell when an episode may strike - and knows she must stop whatever she's doing when she feels the earning signs. 'I can't articulate what's happening at the time - it all becomes quite foggy in my head,' she said. On another occasion, Mrs Armitage was forced to sit on the floor, gasping for breath in the middle of Leeds' White Rose shopping centre after a reaction was triggered by simply walking up a flight of stairs. In a vicious cycle, the anaphylactic reaction causes her to sweat which, in turn, triggers her water allergy. She said: 'The two worst episodes I've had have been after no more than five minutes – the equivalent to a warm up. Urticaria, also known as hives or nettle rash, is a condition in which short-lived swellings occur anywhere on the body. These swellings (weals) may be pale, pink, or red, of different sizes and shape and itchy. As the raised weals flatten, they leave red marks that disappear usually in a day. New weals may then appear in other areas . The itchy reaction is caused by the release of histamine in response to a number of different triggers. Some form of it affects 20 per cent of people at some point. However, aquagenic urticaria - triggered by water of any temperature - is extremely rare. The weals appear between 15 minutes and two hours after exposure to water. In more severe cases drinking water can cause minor swelling in the throat. There is no known cure. Symptoms can be lessened by reducing exposure - such as taking quick showers, applying petroleum jelly to the skin as well as taking anti-histamines. 'I've had to rule out exercise completely now, it's just too much of a worry.' Mrs Armitage, who has spoken out as part of Allergy Awareness Week, has also had to teach eldest daughter Katie how to administer an EpiPen injection. Now, she faces a daily checklist to ensure she's done everything she can to avoid reactions. 'Before leaving the house I have to ask myself if I can get to the bus stop or if it's too far and likely to trigger my reactions,' she said. 'I have to check if it's going to rain and make sure I have back-up clothing in case I get too hot or too cold. 'My social life has gone to pot. 'Before, I could just say, ""of course I'll come out' but now, it's, ""where are we going? What's the weather? Can I park somewhere close so I don't have to walk and risk my anaphylaxis triggering?""' 'There are all these stupid little things I have to consider.' Amena Warner, nurse advisor at Allergy UK said: 'Urticaria is also known as nettle rash or hives. 'It is a red raised itchy rash and is very common, affecting one person in five at some point in their life. 'In most people, it settles quickly and is no more than a mild inconvenience, but in some people it can be severe and long lasting. 'A very rare form of urticaria is that which is triggered by water, which is called aquagenic urticaria, the red raised itchy rash comes up on contact with water. 'Treatment can help the symptoms and the person should receive specialist information from an allergist/immunologist.' This week is Allergy Awareness Week.

"While time travel may be something that we've only seen in sci-fi films, some scientists believe it may be commonplace in as few as 85 years. From biometric scanning to iPad-controlled hotel rooms, glimpses into the future of travel have already begun popping up in airports and resorts around the world. Here, MailOnline Travel looks ahead at exactly what holidaymakers can expect from flights and accommodations in the future, and attempts to answer the age old question: when will teleportation become a reality? What does the future of travel hold? Think: biometric scanning, sustainable hotels and personalised bookings . By 2030... In 15 years, digital advancements will have made the discovery, planning and booking of a journey into a seamless and intuitive experience. 'Travel search and booking will be as easy as buying a book on Amazon,' explains Skyscanner's CEO and Co-Founder Gareth Williams. Instead of tapping away at your computer to book flights and accommodations, Global Futurist Daniel Burrus tells Skyscanner that in the future, each of us may have an 'e-agent,' inside a watch or small piece of jewellery, that goes everywhere with us. 'It could have the face, voice and personality of our favourite actor or comedian and appear to use as a 3D hologram image, or inside a virtual environment, at our verbal command,' he explains. The travel experience will become much more personalised in the next few years, including using biometrics . While that seems a bit extreme, it's not outside the realm of possibility that the travel experience will become much more personalised in the next few years. Computers, through analysing our searches online and cross-referencing our preferences, will be able to use predictive algorithms to make tailored suggestions. This predictive software, as it's known, will also likely take into consideration the personal data we post about ourselves on social media when developing detailed itineraries. And when we do jet off, it will be even easier than it is today. The flight-booking site believes that major technological advances will have eliminated the need for check-in lines and desks. Instead, you will be able to drop your bag at automated points in the terminal. Forget having to carry a passport, digital scanning technology will make check-in a seamless process . 'Biometric face recognition software and machine-readable passports - incorporating a digital boarding pass - will mean that clearing customs will take less than a minute, and high-speed laser molecular scanners will security check hand luggage in seconds as you walk past them toward the departure lounge without even breaking your stride,' Steve Tooze, special projects editor at The Future Laboratory tells MailOnline Travel. In fact, we may not even need to wait a decade and a half. At Incheon airport in Seoul, South Korea, for example, departures will soon operate a biometric immigration system, using facial recognition and machine-readable passports, and at Singapore Changi Airport's T4, which is due to open in 2017, many similar technologies will also be utilised. And while we may see the beginning of space travel by 2030, many expect the hotel of choice to be those located underwater. Though today, underwater rooms are considered a rare luxury, many out-to-sea hotels are currently being developed - such as Dubai's Water Discus Hotel - and will undoubtedly change the  accommodation landscape entirely. Today, underwater hotel rooms are considered rare luxuries, they're expected to become more mainstream . By 2050... Plane manufacturer, Airbus, recently predicted the development of travel trends over the next 50 years and their planes look like something out of a sci-fi film. According to the company, passengers will be able to relax in massage seats that serve drinks and vitamins, as well as provide either a sea breeze or fresh pine scent. Sound showers will help ensure the perfect night's sleep, while special shades will help block out the light. Plane manufacturer, Airbus, believes that planes in 2050 will be made of panoramic windows . Such stunning windows will make for 360-degrees views of the world's wonders and attractions . But if you prefer a view, the plane will also be made up of panoramic windows that can turn transparent at the wave of a hand. And bonus: such a 360-degree view would offer incredible views of world wonders and attractions. Taking a page from some long-haul carriers, bars will also become more prevalent on flights, while pop-up pods will offer private spaces. Airbus research also suggests that every flight in the world could, on average, be around 13 minutes shorter, which would save millions of tonnes of excess fuel annually. In the next few decades, aircraft interiors will bear little resemblance to the packed cabins of today . Bars are expected to become more prevalent on flights, as well as socialisation pop-up pods . 'By the middle of the next decade, aircraft interiors will bear little resemblance to the packed and often frustrating cabins of today,' Tooze adds. 'Memory foam seats will morph to each passengers shape as they sit down, as smart lighting eliminates the effects of jet lag, and sleep hormones sprayed at strategic moments in the flight mean you'll never have to listen to a screaming toddler on long-haul ever again. 'Each seat will have individual climate control and holographic communications and entertainment hubs that allow you to watch films and music from your personal collection on the cloud and chat to friends, family and colleagues as you fly – and sonic disruptors will stop you disturbing everyone around you.' It's believed that space travel will impact holidays of the future, becoming a reality for luxury seekers . Skyscanner's The Future of Travel Report, however, focuses a great deal more on the ways that space travel will impact holidaymakers' future journeys. By 2030, they estimate that space travel will be a reality for ultra-luxury travellers and perhaps by 2050, it will become even more mainstream. In the report, futurist Daniel Burrus says: 'We will be able to book more affordable trips into space where we can go up there and stay long enough to enjoy.' Whether or not we end up colonising on the moon, Skyscanner's Filip Filipov points out that the possibility of flying in low orbital space will radically cut inter-continental flight times. 'In the case of Virgin Galactic, whose ship can orbit the Earth for 2.5 hours, a regular traveller might see a London to Sydney flight in 2.5 hours if the same technology can be applied safely in commercial aviation.' And if the same technology can be applied in commercial aviation, long-haul flights may cease entirely . By 2100... In the next century, the sky is the limit - quite literally. According to researchers at the Future Laboratory and their new report, Sustainable Holiday Futures, giant airships, man-made mobile islands and intelligent hotel rooms will all be commonplace in the next 100 years. Imagine a coastline with floating resorts that can move from destination to destination. This is precisely the future if Thomson Holidays has anything to say about it. Sustainability will be an 'integral' part of every holiday as early as 2030, the report continues, with some claims that artificial islands may even produce their own food and water. This idea of zero-impact travel, in which resorts may look like cruise ships in the sky, will leave no environmental trace whatsoever. Man-made mobile islands will be commonplace in the next 100 years as will the idea of zero-impact travel . In hotel rooms, everything will be automated and highly-personalised. Many hotels have already begun to roll out iPad-controlled lights, sound and room service features and that will only grow in popularity in the coming decades. But futurologist Ian Pearson predicts the that the hotel room of tomorrow will take this technology a step further. In his opinion, we can expect hotel bedrooms to incorporate pillows with sleep-aiding massage technology and holographic wall systems that will project personal trainers or even friends and family in 3D. And we may not even need planes at all! Teleportation could be a regular occurrence by 2080 . And forget long-haul flights to get where you need to be. Teleportation could become a regular occurrence by 2080, according to Dr Mary Jacquiline Romero from the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Glasgow. 'The good thing about teleportation is that there is no fundamental law telling us that it cannot be done and with technical advances I would estimate teleportation that we see in the films will be with us by 2080.'","Skyscanner's Future of Travel report predicts personalised hotel visits .

"He's a sexy, single surfer who also happens to know his way around the kitchen, and now Sydney's Dan Churchill, 25, has the US eating out of his hands - literally. But there was one Hollywood starlet in particular who was won over by his 'Bro Burgers' and cheeky Aussie charm - blonde bombshell Blake Lively. Appearing as a guest star alongside Lively on Good Morning America (GMA) on Tuesday, Churchill appeared to be living the ultimate Aussie dude's dream -  touring the US to promote his cook book 'Dude Food' and flirting over food and Ryan Reynolds with Gossip Girl glamazon Blake Lively. 'I was told it was time to do my teaser with Blake and I was like, ""Wow! This doesn't happen every day"" At that moment I realised I was representing a lot of fellas throughout the world,' Churchill told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Burger for Blake: Dan Churchill whips up a 'Bro Burger' on Good Morning America, meeting Blake Lively too . Bye Blake: Churchill admitted to Hollywood star Blake Lively that he crushes more on hubby Ryan Reynolds . New kid on the block: Sydney's  Dan Churchill takes on New York with live cooking segment at Times Square . Ahead of the GMA segment, Churchill had taken to Instagram with a post revealing Blake Lively was on the call sheet that same day, in a post that read: . 'Just on a real quiet note... I will do my best to honour every little boys dream tomorrow...,' a cheeky insinuation of what he hoped was to come. Adding '#IDontKnowWhatToDoWithMyhands #ThisGotReal.' While Lively, married to Ryan Reynolds remained above board friendly, Churchill was able to live out one dream, getting a photo with the star and even mentioning his crush on husband Ryan Reynolds to the star. 'I am not one to go all fan-boy like so I kept my cool but there was one thing I had to be honest about,' Churchill revealed. 'I said ""Blake, I am a massive fan of your work (as are the rest of the legends in my country), however my brothers would not look me in the eye if I didn't admit how much of a massive fan we are of your man Ryan.""' And just like that the bond was formed, according to Churchill. 'She absolutely loved it and couldn't stop smiling. I think she loved that I was real and could hold an honest conversation.' So long Sydney: Churchill hits the NYC sights, saying a temporary goodbye to Sydney while on US tour . Surfing the USA:Churchill makes waves with appearance on Good Morning America for 'Dude Food' cook book . The starlet also shared with Churchill that her neighbour was a good cook and that her and Ryan often will get into the kitchen. 'Blake is an absolutely amazing woman, very down to earth and obviously doesn't want to be seen as just a ""star,"" he said. 'It was definitely a moment like this that showed me, no matter how different our lives  are, food is something we all have in common and can get happiness, smiles and maybe a few cuddles from.'

Bromance banter: Churchill was said to hit it off with ESPN reporter Jesse Palmer talking girls and hangriness . A barrel of laughs and burgers: Churchill gets cheeky on set of Good Morning America appearance . Adding cheekily, 'boys I am talking to you.' And it wasn't just Lively that was won over. Tim McGraw, the hit country singer also got a photo with Churchill, who was also on set to promote news song and a GMA producer was heard raving about Churchill saying has 'nailed it' and that women will love his 'Aussieness' and that the 'Bromance' is real. Mateship with McGraw: Churchill took a moment to get a sneaky snap with country star Tim McGraw . And on set Churchill certainly knew how to work the camera. Standing alongside co-hosts Lara Spencer and ESPN Reporter Jesse Palmer, Churchill dished up a 'wicked, bad boy' chutney to go alongside his legendary 'Bro Burger' dazzling the hosts with his Aussie charm and catchy colloquialisms. The young chef also undoubtedly won over  Palmer, with Churchill saying 'a clear bromance was formed' with fist pumps, banter and tips on how to get out of trouble with a woman. Sydney style: Churchill throwing a cheeky surfer 'shakas' signal while wandering the streets of NYC . 'There's a whole chapter on impressing girls and a recipe called ""Getting out of the dog house,"" says Churchill. 'So if you're ever in trouble mate...' he laughs, and the 'bromance' connection was made. Churchill told GMA he was inspired to create a healthy cook book for guys, because he was getting more attention from their girlfriends from him. Churchill the charmer: Churchill pictured sweet talking the girls at Cosmopolitan magazine in America . 'So I wrote ended up making a book to look after them and have their back,' he said. Ever the charmer, Churchill also threw in some local words in a bid to butter up with his burger eating companions, citing 'ground beef' instead of mince, 'cilantro' instead of coriander and 'erbs' instead of 'herbs.' It's safe to say the segment was a success and Churchill wowed cast, crew and Hollywood stars alike. Surfer shenanigans: A sneaky visit to YouTube where Churchill keeps mum about 'shenanigans' that went on . 'It went so quickly but it was one of the most exciting moments of my life, I couldn't be more stoked,' he said. 'What was most amazing was the response I was getting from ABC and the rest of the production team, they loved it and said I was real, relatable and authentic.'

"A primary school teaching assistant has been suspended after a colleague discovered white powder in her bag and reported it to the police. It has been reported that Lisa Heath, 45, an assistant at Willowtown Community Primary School in Gwent, had been carrying Class B amphetamines after police were called and quizzed her. She initially denied the drugs were hers, saying they had been planted on her, but later changed her story, accepting a caution for possession. Lisa Heath, 45, an assistant at Willowtown Community Primary School, Gwent (pictured), admitted carrying a Class B drug on the premises and has now been suspended from teaching . A spokesman for the school told The Sun that Miss Heath had been suspended, adding that she was being dealt with 'through the appropriate internal channels.' Gwent Police confirmed its officers were called to the school in Ebbw Vale on March 19 after receiving reports a controlled substance had been discovered on the premises. A police spokesperson added: 'A 45 year old woman voluntarily attended Tredegar Police Station where she received a caution for possession of a controlled substance (class B).' Blaenau Gwent Council has confirmed that the school immediately suspended the member of staff following the incident. A spokeswoman for the local authority said: 'We take such incidents extremely seriously and this matter is now being dealt with by the school and its governing body, together with support from the council, through the proper internal procedures. We are unable to comment further.' The maximum penalty for possession of amphetamines is 5 years in prison plus a fine. For supply the penalty is up to 14 years imprisonment and a fine. If the amphetamines are prepared for injection they become class A drugs and increased penalties apply. There is no indication this was the case with Ms Heath. When a reporter from the paper went to Ms Heath's home, a man claiming to be her son emerged and denied that she had been suspended or found with drugs. Most amphetamines (pictured), a form of chemical stimulant, are Class B drugs, meaning the maximum penalty for possession is five years in jail plus a fine . He also threatened to attack anyone going near the property with a hammer. Willowtown has 379 pupils aged between three and 11 years old, with 15 full-time members of staff, supported by four part-time teachers. Ebbw Vale, the area in which the school is located, is among the most deprived in Wales, and a third of the pupils qualify for free school meals, above the Welsh average of around 20 per cent.","Lisa Heath, 45, quizzed by police after colleague saw white powder in bag .

"Whether he is in a car park, a factory or even a field, Ed Miliband is never far from a lectern during the election campaign. The Labour leader has been touring the country with the prop in an attempt to make him appear more statesmanlike. He has delivered key speeches in the campaign stood behind the lectern. But it has also been deployed when he is just making some brief remarks or holding question and answer events with members of the public. The Labour leader has been touring the country with the prop in an attempt to make him appear more statesmanlike - using it in a north London street on April 16 and then in Lincoln the next day . He has delivered key speeches in the campaign stood behind the lectern - including at a NHS rally in Leeds on April 23 (left). But it has also been deployed when he is just making some brief remarks or holding question and answer events - and even in the middle of a field in Nuneaton yesterday (right) Mr Miliband’s enthusiasm for speaking from behind a podium comes after his disastrous party conference speech last September when he forgot to mention the deficit while speaking without a lectern or autocue. As Mr Miliband launched Labour’s election campaign at the top of the ArcelorMittal Orbit in Olympic Park last month he spoke in front of the lectern branded with a Union Jack flag and the Labour logo. When he unveiled the party’s manifesto in Manchester he also spoke from behind the lectern. And during his audience question and answer in the first televised leaders’ debate on Channel 4 and Sky News he chose to speak from behind a lectern, while David Cameron chose instead to have a stool on stage. The lectern has also been used in some more unconventional settings though. As he spoke in the car park of an engineering factory in Loughborough the lectern was put on a small raised platform next to a puddle. When he visited the national Composites Centre in Bristol he conducted a Q&A in front of an aeroplane with the lectern. The revelation that Mr Miliband had brought in leadership coaches after Mr Miliband faced ridicule yesterday after being pictured standing at a lectern in the middle of a field in a bid to look prime ministerial. Then this week as he launched Labour campaign billboards in Nuneaton, he spoke from behind a lectern, even though he was in the middle of a cricket pitch. The constant use of the lectern is thought to be part of a strategy to make Mr Miliband look more like a man who could be prime minister. Last month it was reported that he had hired US speech coach Michael Sheehan on a £10,000 daily fee to improve his delivery and charisma. Mr Sheehan’s website includes a video where he advises politicians on how to speak at a lectern, including not holding onto the sides in what he calls a ‘death grip’. It comes as it was revealed that Mr Miliband has hired a 'leadership consultancy' firm which coaches people to look 'authentic' and cope with anxiety, it has emerged. The Labour leader, who has seen his party's lead in the polls slip with less than two weeks until the general election, has engaged the services of 'ExtendedMind' – a specialist firm offering 'performance coaching'. Labour leader Ed Miliband meets supporters at Oaktree Community Centre in Acton, west London, where he posed for pictures after speaking to local Labour Party members . Mr Miliband has hired a 'leadership consultancy' firm which coaches people to look 'authentic' and cope with anxiety . Mr Miliband's dire personal ratings have long been seen as a major electoral asset for the Tories. However in recent weeks there has been a marked upturn in his popularity - as voters get to see more of the Labour leader. A Labour spokesman today did not deny Mr Miliband had hired a consultancy firm to help his performances. He said: 'We never comment on anybody we may or may not have employed.' According to the ExtendedMind website, they provide help 'in order to build leadership skills that deliver lasting organisational change'. According to its website, the company works to help body language and breathing, and to tackle 'the anxiety we all feel to different degrees when communicating an important message to others'. They provide intensive coaching to work on body language and how to look authentic. Its website boasts how it works with 'leaders' to 'communicate their messages with greater impact' and insists that learning 'new communication techniques' does not mean someone is in-authentic. 'Any new behavior will feel inauthentic at the beginning, and will seem so to others, too. But with repeated practice we move from 'acting' to 'being'.' Ed Miliband, speaking at Chatham House in London this morning, has hired a 'leadership consultancy' firm which coaches people to look 'authentic' and cope with anxiety, it has emerged . The Labour leader, who has seen his party's lead in the polls slip with less than two weeks until the general election, has engaged the services of 'ExtendedMind' – a specialist firm offering 'performance coaching' But Conservative Michael Ellis said the revelation showed there was 'nothing authentic about Ed Miliband'. He said: 'He's had to hire someone to tell him how to act like a leader. Even after all his extensive coaching, could you imagine him standing up to Putin on the world stage? He should ask for his money back.' Mr Miliband has staked the success of his campaign on performing better then public expectations in head to head debates with David Cameron. He even hired US speech coach Michael Sheehan on a reported £10,000 daily fee to improve his delivery and charisma, it has been reported.","Mr Miliband has started taking a lectern with him everywhere he speaks .

"Almost everyone longs to be reunited with deceased friends and family. Now an app, dubbed 'Project Elysium', claims to do just that by creating a 'personalised afterlife experience' with loved ones who have passed. The technology, which is still under development, could be a step towards uploading memories and personalities into computers, allowing people to live on in virtual reality. Almost everyone longs to be reunited with deceased friends and family. Now an app dubbed 'Project Elysium' claims to do just that by creating a 'personalised afterlife experience' with loved ones who have passed. The app's developers have yet to reveal exactly how the technology will work . Created by Australia-based Paranormal Games, the app's developers have yet to reveal exactly how the technology will work. What little we do know comes from their Twitter account, which features a screenshot showing someone being transformed into a 3D model. An accompanying caption says: 'Modelling my bestie and business partner Nick into Project Elysium. Our first demo will be personal to Nick.' Dr Albert Rizzo, director of medical virtual reality at the University of Southern California said he believes potential users would have to send pictures and video of the deceased to the developer. What little we do know comes from their Twitter account, which features a screenshot showing someone being transformed into a 3D model. An accompanying caption says: 'Modelling my bestie and business partner Nick into Project Elysium. Our first demo will be personal to Nick' But the company may also need to harvest even more data so that they can construct the person's personality, mannerisms and movements. 'If I knew I had an incurable disease, maybe I would do a full body scan and have a digital replica created,' Dr Rizzo told DailyMail.com. 'And I would sit down for 20 hours and have people ask me questions about my life and what I think about different things.' He says this can all be programmed into virtual reality to create a living record of someone that people can interact with using VR headsets such as Oculus Rift. But experts are divided over how this can impact a user's mental health. Some argue that it can provide real comfort and support in times of grief, while others say it may prevent people from moving on from trauma. Bina48 is a robotic head that uses a 'Mind Clone' of the memories, belief and feelings of a real person . It may be possible to live forever by uploading your memories, thoughts and personality onto a computer within the next ten or twenty years, according to a leading pioneer of the technology. The technology, which is similar to that seen in the film Transcendence starring Johnny Depp, is being developed by entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt. She has already created a disturbingly realistic robotic 'clone' of her wife Bina that she hopes will be a prototype for the technology. The robot apparently shares the ideas and personality of Bina by creating a database of her memories, beliefs and thoughts, along with information taken from social media interactions and blogs she shares. This allows the robot, called Bina48, to express opinions and interact in conversations like a real, living person. Mrs Rothblatt, 60, an internet radio entrepreneur who lives as a transgender woman, believes the these 'Mind Clones' could eventually be used to help provide social interactions for people living alone and even help recreate the personalities of people after they have died. 'I think helping people to confront difficult emotional challenges done in a safe environment is a positive thing,' said Dr Rizzo. 'When people avoid processing things, this is when it comes back and haunts them.' 'I don't think there is any disrespect to the dead to want to view them and interact with them,' he added. Project Elysium has been entered into the upcoming Oculus VR Jam 2015 contest. To be eligible for the jam's grand prize, the team have to showcase more screenshots by April 27, followed by video footage the week after. The grand prize winner in this track will receive $100,000, with runner ups earning $50,000, $30,000 and $10,000 respectively.

"This is a shocking collection of harrowing photographs of the death and destruction visited on Armenians by Ottoman Turks a century ago that were taken by an American and a colleague who risked imprisonment to smuggle them out and show the world the full horror of what happened. John Elder and Armin T. Wegner both documented the unimaginable suffering they witnessed in images which helped build a case against a Turkish government which still denies the slaughter of up to 1.5million Armenians constituted genocide. As Armenians mark 100 years since the atrocities, many Western countries still do not use that word, and US president Barack Obama is once again unlikely to do so in his upcoming statement marking the anniversary despite pledging he would during his election campaign. Scroll down for video . An image of a starving Armenian orphan taken by John Elder. More than 150,000 Armenian children were left parentless by the end of 1918 . Armenian deportees travel on foot in 1915 as taken by Armin Wegner, including women and children on an unpaved road in the desert sun . A crowd looks on as Armenians are hanged in the street in Constantinople before their forced removal to the desert had begun after April 1915 . This image was titled 'Abandoned and murdered small children of the (Armenian) deportees' by Wegner and was taken in 1915-1916 . Wegner, a volunteer military nurse, set up clandestine mail routes with foreign consulates and embassies to get many hundreds of notes, annotations, documents, letters and photographs of the Armenian deportation camps to Germany and the United States. He did so in defiance of strict orders from the Turkish and German authorities aimed at preventing any evidence of the horrors of the 'genocide' reaching the outside world. But his ruse was discovered and he was arrested by the German authorities and put to serve in cholera wards in Baghdad at the request of the Turkish command. There he fell seriously ill, and German-born Wegner left for Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in November 1916. Hidden in his belt were his photographic plates, and those of other German officers, with images of the Armenian massacre to which he had been a witness. His images, which along with Elder's were provided to MailOnline by the Washington DC-based Armenian National Institute, still retain the power to shock as the world marks the 100th anniversary of the 'genocide' today. In one, two Armenians are pictured hanging in the street in broad daylight in the capital Constantinople  while a crowd, including women and children, looks on. The image was taken in 1915 just before the mass deportation of Armenians to the desert had begun. Hundreds of thousands were forced from their homes in Anatolia and herded towards Syria. A skeleton iresting in a refugee graveyard while a black clad figure walks away from the camera in Igdir, now in Eastern Anatolia in Turkey . Armenian deportees sleeping in the street in 1915 in the Syrian region of the Ottoman empire. They are mostly women without families . Orphans of the massacre take a rest. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians were forced from their homes in Anatolia and herded towards Syria . Three generations of the same family of refugees take shelter from the son in a makeshift tent. Many of those targeted for expulsion starved to death, were shot or bayoneted by Ottoman Turkish soldiers . Genocide is defined as the 'deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group.' It was apparently coined by Polish-born US jurist Raphael Lemkin in his work 'Axis Rule in Occupied Europe' in reference to the Nazi extermination of the Jews. The word literally means 'killing a tribe' from the Greek 'genos' meaning 'race' or 'kind' Lemkin wrote that: 'It is intended to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aimed at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.' Thanks to Lemkin's campaigning work, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on December 9, 1948. The then two million strong Armenian minority were persecuted by a government suspicious that as Christians they were more loyal to Christian governments like that of Russia than they were to the Ottoman caliphate. Though they had thrived under Ottoman rule, despite being regarded as 'infidels' by their Muslim rulers, the Armenians were resented for their relative prosperity and success compared to many Ottoman Turks. The Ottoman government began their campaign in earnest after Armenians organized volunteer battalions to help the Russian army fight against the Turks in the Caucasus region. The Ottoman government used this as a justification to begin their forced 'removal' of Armenians the war zones along the Eastern Front in a bid to 'Turkify' what remained of a ailing empire. The deportation began following the rounding up of 235 Armenian leaders and intellectuals in the capital on April 24, 1915 - the anniversary of which is marked today. Many of those then targeted for expulsion starved to death, were shot or bayoneted by Ottoman Turkish soldiers. Another photograph shows the bodies of three murdered young boys lying in a gutter, one of them stripped naked, while two others look on. More than 150,000 Armenian children were left parentless by the end of the First World War. And in a third of Wegner's incredible images taken in 1915, a band of Armenian deportees, including a woman carrying a baby, children and elderly men, stagger through the desert along an unpaved road in the blazing suns towards their hellish new lives as refugees. Elder, from Pennsylvania, was a relief worker in the Armenian capital of Yerevan from 1917 to 1919. Refugees struggle to make their way along the Igdir road. The city was occupied in 1920 and is now part of a region of eastern Turkey . 'A 15-year-old child who died of starvation', according to Wegner, who took the image of the two bodies of young boys in 1915-1916 . Armenian deportees living in the open desert with bedding as their only shelter, though luckier families in the background have tents . He also painted a heartrending picture of the nightmare he witnessed using his camera. The divinity student defied instructions given to relief workers and other foreign personnel to evacuate the Caucasus, fearing that tens of thousands more Armenians would die of starvation if the relief programs were discontinued. He and fellow YMCA colleague James Arroll remained at their posts channeling relief fund to orphanages and soup kitchens. The pair were instrumental in providing care for thousands of Armenian orphans and arranging for the training and employment of 11,000 adults. Elder's pictures of orphans are particularly harrowing, some of them clearly starving with angular bones poking through the stretched skin of their shrunken bodies. In one eerie shot a human skeleton is pictured resting in a refugee graveyard while a black clad figure walks away from the camera in the background. In another refugees desperately forage for food by a railway track. In light of such evidence Obama's reticence to use the word 'genocide', in a bid to placate America's Turkish allies, has disappointed many. Several US officials said there had been a sharp internal debate over whether to use the 100-year anniversary to call the killings 'genocide' and make good on the president's campaign promise, particularly after Pope Francis used the term earlier this month.

Armin Wegner (left) fearlessly documented the horror with his camera just like Elder, who took this image of an Armenian refugee (right) A burial service is held at a deportation camp. Wegner describe the scene as 'Armenian deportees living in the open desert under makeshift tents. Clothing of some deportees is already worn to rags' A painfully thin orphan of the massacre (left) taken by Elder in Yerevan, now the capital of Armenia, in 1918. Wegner captioned the image on the right: 'Fleeing from death. An Armenian mother on the heights of the Taurus Mountains whose husband has been killed' That comment by the Pope prompted an angry response from Turkey, which recalled its ambassador to the Vatican. Several European governments and parliaments are also expected to use the word in discussions of the events 100 years ago. The number of Armenians who died during this period is in fact only around 300,000, according to Turkey, which still blames 'war and disease' rather than a targeted programme of extermination by the Ottoman government. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, said at a press conference on Wednesday he 'would not want Obama to use the word ""genocide"" and would not expect such a thing.' The country's prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu accused the European Parliament of 'enmity' against Turkey over its vote to use the term to describe the killings. In his formal statement on the anniversary he also insisted that Armenian losses were among many in the First World War and that it was a form of 'discrimination' to focus on Armenians and not on 'Turkish and Muslim Ottomans' who died at the same time. His words did not stop dozens of Armenians from gathering on Wednesday for an annual commemoration ceremony at a chasm at a site called Dudan, near the city of Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey, where it is believed there is a mass grave to victims of the 'genocide'. Around 10,000 are thought to have been led here by Turkish military police in 1915 before being brutally murdered and thrown into the cleft in the rock.

"A male student accused of raping his classmate has sued Columbia University for failing to protect him against backlash and harassment. Authorities rejected Emma Sulkowicz's case that Paul Nungesser, a German citizen, was a 'serial rapist' who assaulted her after class. Nonetheless, the case gathered international attention as Sulkowicz, a senior majoring in visual arts, publicly paraded her mattress in protest, calling for his indictment. And according to Nungesser's lawsuit citing 'gender-based harassment and defamation', Columbia presented the allegations as fact on a university-owned website. Scroll down for video . 'No protection': Paul Nungesser is suing Columbia University for allowing Emma Sulkowicz to parade the school and take campus-provided transport with her mattress in protest against him, calling him a rapist . The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, three days after a judge tossed out another gender-based lawsuit brought by a male student against Columbia University. Defendants include the school, its board of trustees, President Lee C. Bollinger and Professor Jon Kessler. The lawsuit sought unspecified damages. 'Columbia University's effective sponsorship of the gender-based harassment and defamation of Paul resulted in an intimidating, hostile, demeaning ... learning and living environment,' the lawsuit said. Roger Hornsby, a Columbia spokesman, said the school had no comment. Email messages requesting comment from Bollinger and Kessler were not immediately returned. In his lawsuit, Nungesser said a Columbia-owned website had presented as fact that he sexually assaulted Sulkowicz, a senior majoring in visual arts. It said that the school allowed Sulkowicz to carry a mattress into classes, the library and campus-provided transportation as part of her senior thesis, that Kessler approved the 'Mattress Project' for her course credit and that Sulkowicz's pledge to carry her mattress to graduation may prevent Nungesser and his parents, who'd like to fly from Germany, from participating in graduation ceremonies. 'Day-to-day life is unbearably stressful, as Emma and her mattress parade around campus each and every day,' the suit said. As a result of publicity that resulted in media reports in 35 countries, the lawsuit said, Nungesser 'has been subjected to severe, pervasive ... and threatening behavior by other Columbia students, believing that Paul is a `serial rapist,' whenever Paul has appeared at university activities.' Nungesser became the target of international attacks following the claims, which were dismissed by a judge . The complaint also said he wants to stay in the United States, where he has been dating a girlfriend for over a year, and is seeking consulting work in New York, though job prospects have been 'severely jeopardized' by the school's support of Sulkowicz. In an email responding to a request for comment, Sulkowicz wrote: 'I think it's ridiculous that Paul would sue not only the school but one of my past professors for allowing me to make an art piece. 'It's ridiculous that he would read it as a `bullying strategy,' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation, when really it's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma I've experienced at Columbia. If artists are not allowed to make art that reflect on our experiences, then how are we to heal?' Sulkowicz has argued her case was badly mishandled by the school disciplinary panel after she reported in 2013 she was raped in her dorm months before. She was among 23 students who sued Columbia last year, saying it mishandled sexual assault cases. She also attended President Barack Obama's State of the Union address in January at the invitation of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.","Paul Nungesser was accused of raping former friend Emma Sulkowicz .

"Islamic State have reportedly launched their own 'health service', bearing remarkable similarities to the publicly funded British health service, the National Health Service (NHS).

Everything is living up to my expectations completely and we really need your help. 'It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' The video comes at a time when jihadis on social media, most notably British fighter Omar Hussain, has called on European doctors to join Islamic State. British female jihadi Aqsa Mahmood, could also be drafted into working as part of the Islamic State Health Service.

Aqsa Mahmood originally had high hopes of becoming a doctor before she left her family home and traveled to Syria in November 2013. The 20-year-old, who was privately educated Craigholme School and Shawlands Academy in Glasgow, is currently believed to be a prominent member of the fearsome al-Khansaa brigade. The al-Khansaa brigade is an all-female militia, mostly foreign female jihadis, who patrol the streets and punish any woman caught committing acts against Islam. However it is likely that with mounting casualties, any jihadi with medical training will be drafted in to work in the ISIS hospitals in Raqqa and Mosul. The new video also comes after nine British medical student reportedly traveled to Syria last month, claiming they were going to help treat the war victims. The students are all believed to be of Sudanese origin and were studying at a medical school in Khartoum, Sudan. The four men and five women reportedly crossed the Turkish-Syrian border last month. Their families traveled to Turkey, desperately attempting to persuade them to come back from the war-torn country.

"Diet Pepsi will no longer contain the sweetener aspartame due to customer fears over its safety . Diet Pepsi will no longer contain the sweetener aspartame due to customer fears over its safety. The controversial sweetener has been linked to a range of health problems, although research has shown it to be safe. PepsiCo said today it is dropping the ingredient from the popular drink in the U.S. in response to customer feedback. Diet Pepsi, Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi and Wild Cherry Diet Pepsi will now contain sucralose, another artificial sweetener commonly known as Splenda. The decision to swap sweeteners comes as after a decade of plummeting sales. Consumers have shifted away from diet drinks because of perceived health concerns about artificial sweeteners, specifically aspartame. The ingredient, used in fizzy drinks and diet products, has been at the centre of critical reports dating back decades linking it to everything from cancer to premature birth. This is despite the Food and Drug Administration stating that more than 100 studies support aspartame's safety. However these assurances have failed to convince some people, who continue to report adverse reactions, such as headaches and nausea after consuming foods containing the sweetener. The sweetener, which is about 200 times sweeter than sugar, is widely used to sweeten diet sodas. It is also used by rival Coca-Cola Co in its drinks such as Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Schweppes Diet Lemonade. In a statement today, PepsiCo said: 'Diet cola drinkers in the U.S. told us they wanted aspartame-free Diet Pepsi and we're delivering.' The reformulated drinks will begin appearing on shelves in August. Sales in PepsiCo's beverage business have been hurt by a long-term decline in soft drink sales in the United States. And Coca-Cola said this week that sales volume for Diet Coke fell 5 percent in North America in the first three months of the year. Executives at Coke and Pepsi blame the declines on perceptions that aspartame, first sold under the brand name Nutrasweet, is not safe. Consumers have shifted away from diet drinks because of perceived health concerns about artificial sweeteners, specifically aspartame . Despite aspartame's poor reputation, it has been ruled a safe food ingredient by food watchdogs in Britain, the EU, the USA and around the world. Last month, a study commissioned by Britain’s food watchdog found eating the sweetener had no impact on the body or behaviour of people who claimed to be sensitive to it. Aspartame has established itself as an important component in many low-calorie, sugar-free foods and beverages and is primarily responsible for the growth over the last two decades in the sugar-free market. It is currently consumed by over 200 million people around the world and is found in more than 6,000 products. These include carbonated soft drinks, powdered soft drinks, chewing gum, dessert mixes, puddings and fillings, frozen desserts, yogurt, tabletop sweeteners, and some pharmaceuticals such as vitamins and sugar-free cough drops. Aspartame is a nutritive sweetener made by joining two amino acids (protein components) -- L-phenylalanine and L-aspartic acid, with a third component called a methyl ester group. Very little is needed for a sweet taste, making aspartame virtually non-caloric. 180 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose. Source: http://www.aspartame.org/ . The research had been evaluated by independent experts, peer reviewed and published in the journal PLOS ONE. In December 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published an opinion on aspartame following a full risk assessment and concluded it was ‘safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure'. This was supported by Britain’s Committee on Toxicity which said the sweetener was safe and there was no need for action, such as taking it off the shelves, to protect public health. But Erik Millstone, Professor of Science Policy at the University of Sussex, insists there is good quality independent research which raises safety concerns. An EU funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater risk of having a premature baby. It is rare for a mother to be to give birth early - before 37 weeks - assuming all aspects of the pregnancy have been normal. The research found this low risk was increased by 38 per cent if the woman was drinking an average of one can of diet drink a day. The statistics, gathered by academics in Denmark, showed that a woman who routinely drank at least four cans a day could increase the risk by as much as 78 per cent. This meant that if the risk of a premature birth was normally one in a 100, it increased to 1.78 in 100. The professor also highlighted work by the independent Ramazzini Foundation in Italy. Scientist there have published research suggesting aspartame caused several types of cancer in rats at doses very close to the current acceptable daily intake for humans. Despite having virtually, if any calories, But low-calorie artificial sweeteners actually raise the risk of obesity, researchers fear. The popular sugar alternatives found in diet drinks and in sachets in cafes and restaurants may also increase the odds of diabetes. The sweeteners under the microscope are saccharin, which is found in Sweet’N Low, sucralose, which is found in Splenda, and aspartame, which is found in many diet drinks. The Israeli researchers warned that ‘today’s massive, unsupervised consumption’ of artificial sweeteners needs to be reassessed.","Aspartame has been linked to a range of health problems .

"Frogs that build underground ‘sex nests’ to mate with their partner have been found by a team of researchers. The intriguing males build these secret chambers to avoid predators. The discovery was made by researchers in the Atlantic forest of Serra do Japi in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. A new species of frog has been found in Brazil. Called Hylodes japi, it was found to mate underground in secret chambers. Males and females typically find a spot to mate in about five minutes. And the male will cover up the eggs to protect them from predators. Shown is another torrent frog, the Waterfall frog . The new species of torrent frog, reported by New Scientist, is called Hylodes japi. The amphibian, part of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group, is characterised by light stripes on its size, while it is also relatively small, according to the researchers. And when it comes to mating, this family of frogs has a unique trait not seen in other frogs. They typically like to live near fast streams and, if a pair decides to mate, they will spend five minutes searching for a private spot. ‘The male quickly carves out a chamber by excavating the sand around small rocks at the bottom of the stream,’ said Agata Blaszczak-Boxe from New Scientist. ‘Then, like Christian Grey from Fifty Shades he invites his mate into his sex dungeon, which is only just big enough to fit the two amorous amphibians.’ The amphibian, part of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group, is characterised by light stripes on its size, while it is also relatively small, according to the researchers. It was found in the Atlantic forest of Serra do Japi in the State of São Paulo, Brazil . Once the female has laid her eggs, the male then covers up the entrance with sand from the stream. The reason for this is not only to protect the eggs from predators, but also from tadpoles of the species - as they are known to be cannibalistic. Finding the frogs wasn’t easy, either - they are so secretive that the researchers had to don camouflage gear in order to observe them. A new species of glass frog (shown right) has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides. The creature, named Hyalinobatrachium dianae, was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica and has a distinctive call. While most of its body is a brilliant lime green, like all species of glass frogs, the skin on its underside is see-though, making its organs easily visible. The animal’s heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract are easily visible. Scientists were surprised to stumble across the frog, given that a through survey of the region was conducted late last century, and reported their find in the journal Zootaxa. The frog was named by Brian Kubicki who discovered it, after his mother Janet Diana Kubicki to thank her for supporting his interest in science, Costa Rica’s Tico Times reported.","A new species of frog has been found in the State of São Paulo, Brazil .

"A Montana judge who was censured by the state's high court for his comments about a 14-year-old rape victim has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. Scroll down for video . Selected: Former District Judge G. Todd Baugh has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence. Legal case: Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez (right) shared some responsibility for her rape by teacher Stacey Rambold (left) Baugh, who served almost 30 years as a state judge, stepped down last year after being censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said. Fehr said Baugh had been nominated for the award by members of the bar association, but she declined to say who that was or why he was chosen. Case: Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence . Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. Baugh later apologized for his remarks. He was also censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days . Marian Bradley, Northwest regional director for the National Organization for Women, said the award was inappropriate given Baugh's conduct on the bench. Regardless of his prior accomplishments, Bradley said the Rambold case cannot be overlooked. 'The last chapter in his career, he put himself out there and did not protect a young girl and did not protect a community,' Bradley said. 'Giving him a lifetime achievement award is going to send people into tailspins.' Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. In December, state District Judge Russell Fagg wrote in a column for the Billings Gazette that Baugh handled more than 30,000 cases in his career. 'He has made thousands of good calls, and a few bad calls, as have all of us,' Fagg wrote. 'Bottom line: Baugh is a wonderful person.'

"This is the shocking moment a deputy's bodycam captured the officer shooting a dog dead.

The video, shot on Kempink's body camera, showed the deputy jumping a fence as he went to investigate a burglar alarm  going off at the property last Friday. Scroll down for video . This is the shocking moment a deputy from Pasco County Sheriff shot a dog dead while responding to a call . He started to walk towards the home, but was stopped by two black Rottweilers which had ran out towards him across the garden. Within seconds of them approaching, he shot the closest dog, 18-month-old Cowboy which is barking at him. He then turned his gun on the other which ran off. The horrified owner, Carla Gloger, appeared moments later and shouted at the officer: 'They're not even vicious.' Kempink responded: 'He came right at me ma'am. I got it on camera, I got it on camera.' The video, shot on Kempink's body camera, showed the deputy jumping a fence into the property where he as then confronted by two dogs . Within seconds he had shot the first Rottweiler which was barking at him and turned his gone on the other . But Ms Gloger told the deputy: 'He came right at you but not to hurt you.' Kempink then called his station but the owner, who was becoming more and more upset, shouts for him to put her pet out of its misery. Tragically, when the dog sees the officer lift his gun, he attempts to crawl away. Ms Gloger shouted for Kempink to wait, and said: 'Is he ok? No, he's not. 'Shoot him all the way,' she told him. 'Kill him.' Another loud bang can be heard yet the devastated owner continued pleading with the officer to shoot him. 'Shoot him again. I can hear him suffering, shoot him. He's just a puppy.'

"Many people have the bad habit of squeezing blackheads and pimples on their faces. But for one New York-based writer, the urge to stand in front of a mirror and poke at and squeeze her pores for hours on end became so bad that it actually started 'sabotaging' her life. In an inspiring essay for Marie Claire, Jenna Marotta, 27, tells of her experience with dermatillomania - a compulsive skin-picking disorder that left her face bleeding - and how she managed to overcome it. 'I'd descend ""into the mirror"" for up to four hours a day,' Jenna writes in the essay, explaining how her actions horrified her parents. 'I would nick and squeeze and yank at every clogged pore on my face.' Scroll down for video . Obsessive behavior: Jenna Marotta, 27, of New York, says her habit of picking at the pores on her face was so all-consuming that it became 'self-sabotaging' At first, Jenna was just looking for a way to break out of her binge-eating routine. As a child she developed bad eating habits - she would skip breakfast and lunch, then stuff her face with whatever she wanted for hours when she got home. Her binge-eating cycle continued through college and after graduation, when she moved back home to her parents' house in Illinois. 'I knew I was bingeing while I was bingeing,' she writes, adding that part of the problem was that she would head to the kitchen whenever she felt bored. 'So I decided to find a new place to spend my ample downtime.' That place became her parents' bathroom, where her mom kept a stainless steel 10x magnifying mirror and an array of Tweezerman tweezers. Jenna's use of the tweezers started off innocently enough, with her plucking out stray hairs along her eyebrows. Then she started to become obsessive, revisiting her brows several times a day and moving on to other areas of her face, where she would use those same tweezers to clear out pores and remove ingrown hairs. 'At one point, I became convinced that there was a lone dark hair trapped under my chin,' she says. 'I could think of nothing more vital than removing this growth from my face. In the process of freeing the (probably imagined) hair, I dug an eighth-inch deep hole.' Getting better: After accidentally going ten days without touching her pores when she forgot to pack her tweezers for a trip, Jenna managed to move away from her bad skin habit. She still sees a psychiatrist . Jenna was aware that her skin-picking was growing out of control and visited a 'battalion' of dermatologists, who told her that her problem was psychosomatic. So she enrolled in an an outpatient program for mental health. But once the three-week program ended, she insisted she had her problem under enough control to move on her own to New York City. The problem was not under control, however. Though the dreaded magnifying mirror was back at her parents' house in Illinois, Jenna would still lean in close to her own bathroom mirror to pick at her pores. 'I would tweeze and squeeze, filling my garbage can with tissues dotted with blood,' she writes, adding that she would hide out in her bedroom to avoid seeing her roommate, who might question her about the bloody tissues she threw out in the bathroom. And she didn't stop at using tweezers. Jenna admitted that she's also 'attacked' her face with an extruder, an earring post, an unspooled paperclip, a pushpin, a toothbrush handle, the rough side of a nail file, lotion caps, and nail clippers. One of Jenna's most agonizing memories was when the writer had to interview Steve Carrell after picking at a cyst on her chin until it bled. She worried the blood wouldn't dry in time to apply makeup before the interview. 'The urge to self-injure just always pulses through my head and hands,' she says. 'And it's my go-to method of procrastination when I have a deadline.' Luckily, while travelling to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah this January, Jenna forgot her tweezers at home, resulting in ten whole days during which she didn't pick at her face. Now, the 27-year-old says she has overcome her condition - and is working on being 'nice' to herself. 'I continue to work with a psychiatrist to stay on track since I first put the tweezers down,' she says. Dermatillomania - or compulsive skin picking - is an impulse control disorder characterized by the uncontrollable desire to pick at one's skin. Some sufferers have the condition so severely they pick at their skin until it is damaged. Sufferers usually start by picking at their face before moving on to other parts of the body. The condition is often categorized as an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). It can lead to bleeding, bruising and infections. CSP will often be carried out after the individual has experienced a high level of tension which has caused an urge to carry out the behaviour. The skin picking is often accompanied by a feeling of relief or even pleasure due to the reduction in anxiety levels. However, once the damage has been done, those affected will often be left with a feeling of depression or hopelessness. Although the damage that is caused can be very severe, the gratification experienced can lead the individual to carry out CSP again and again. Treatment usually involves counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy.

"New York and Connecticut authorities are in search of a woman accused of stealing the identity of a cancer-stricken fashion executive who lay dying in a Manhattan hospital. Surveillance cameras caught the thief taking $9,000 out of the account of Kate Sullivan at Chase branches in Commack and Freeport on September 23, 2014. State police say the female suspect then racked up $4,000 in bills after opening four store credit cards in Sullivan's name in New Haven, Connecticut. Thief: Surveillance cameras caught a thief (left) taking $9,000 out of the account of Kate Sullivan (right) at Chase branches in Commack and Freeport on September 23, 2014 . Sullivan, who had lung cancer, was informed of the fraud while fighting for her life at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She died five days later. The 50-year-old had worked as a marketing executive for fashion designers Kimora Lee Simmons and Diane von Furstenberg. According to CBS New York, the suspect had Sullivan's Social Security number and a signed copy of her driver's license. Other documents she allegedly used were forged. Sullivan's family was, unsurprisingly, horrified by the news. 'I was just pretty violated and felt kind of helpless standing there with my sister and then knowing that there's some woman trying to clear out her bank account while she lays here fighting for her life,' her sister, Sarah Sullivan, told CBS New York. State police say the female suspect then racked up $4,000 in bills after opening four store credit cards in Sullivan's name in New Haven, Connecticut . The thief posed as Sullivan in Chase branches in two Long Island towns. A teller at one of the locations caught the fake documents but the suspect fled before authorities could be called . 'I just want to make sure nobody else goes through what my family's been going through the last couple of months.' In the weeks following Sullivan's death, her sister discovered new store and credit card bills in Sullivan's mail . 'I've had to fax death certificates and affidavits to all of the creditors and fly in to meet with the police and lots of other stuff I didn't need to deal with while I'm mourning my sister's death,' she said. Detectives from New Haven were scheduled to speak with a New York State Police investigator Thursday afternoon, according to city police spokesman Officer David Hartman. Detectives in the New Haven Police Department's Financial Crimes Division were shown a picture of the suspect and none are aware of any connection to open New Haven cases at this time.

"Police have confirmed the body of a woman found in the boot of her car is that of 35-year-old missing public servant Daniela D'Addario. A 27-year-old man, believed to be her boyfriend, has been charged with her murder after  fleeing from officers when they stopped the car and made the grim discovery on Wednesday night, in Bermagui, on the NSW south coast. Ms D'Addario, a former teacher at Canberra High School, had been in a ‘very tumultuous relationship’ with Josaia 'Joey' Vosikata, 27, for about four months friends say. She found out a month ago that he had a secret wife and children back home in Fiji after he moved into her apartment in Canberra. Ms D'Addario and Mr Vosikata were reported missing by her concerned family members in the ACT on Monday. Scroll down for video . Missing 35-year-old public servant Daniela D'Addario has been found dead in her car . Ms D’Addario's body was found in the boot of her blue Hyundai Getz just after 8.30pm on Wednesday . Ms D’Addario’s friend Chris Reid told the Daily Telegraph: ‘When she found out he had a wife and kids in Fiji she left him but then, unbeknown to us the reasons, she got back together with him.' Mr Reid told the Canberra Times Ms D'Addario was as 'a beautiful girl'. 'She's funny, she's witty, she's always the life of the party. She's gorgeous - with beautiful big eyes. Always generous and caring and a big animal lover,' he said. Daniela has been described by friends as 'a beautiful girl' after she was found murdered . Her boyfriend was extradited from NSW to the ACT on Friday and was charged with her murder . A 27-year-old man was arrested in the Bermagui area at about 4.30pm on Thursday after fleeing into bushland at around 8.30pm on Wednesday. He was taken to Batemans Bay police station and has since been extradited to the ACT. An ACT police spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that he has been charged with Ms D'Addario's murder and will face the ACT Magistrates Court on Friday where bail will be opposed. The couple had reportedly been in a ‘very tumultuous relationship’ for about four months. Mr Vosikata (left) reportedly has a wife and children back in Fiji .

One of Mr Vosikata's relatives wrote on Facebook  in Fijian on Friday: 'Stand firm small bro. What are you worried about. We all know you. The people of naibati is praying for you.' Channel 7 News captured the moment when he was finally arrested by police. Officers were shown chasing the man into bushland and over a fence before pouncing on him. ‘We believe there may have been some sort of domestic relationship that had soured. As a result of that information we were on the lookout for that vehicle,’ Detective Superintendent Peter O'Brien said earlier on Thursday. Police stopped the man in a blue Hyundai Getz car on the Bermagui to Tathra Road in the Bega Valley - the same car that Ms D'Addario was reported to have been driving when she went missing with Mr Vosikata on Monday. The couple were believed to have been staying in the Bermagui area after last being seen on Sunday.

"New cases: The decision not to prosecute Lord Janner over historic abuse claims has prompted 30 more alleged victims to come forward . A dossier on Lord Janner is among 114 files on child sex abuse that has vanished from the Home Office, it was revealed today. The 1986 Janner file is mentioned in an investigation into an alleged government cover up but its contents remain a mystery. The Home Office has refused to comment on the dossier, which could potentially conceal the name of a second person, it is alleged. Last year NSPCC boss Peter Wanless led a review of Home Office files from 1979 to 1999 and concluded it would be 'impossible' to unearth this and the other 113 missing files. According to the Daily Mirror the paper, titled ‘Greville Janner MP [redacted] re evidence in child abuse cases’ is listed as ‘not found’ and ‘presumed transferred to the MoJ [Ministry of Justice] but not located’. It came as it emerged up to 30 people have now reportedly told police they were abused by Lord Janner, with more coming forward since it was announced he will not be charged with child sex offences. Publicity surrounding the case has encouraged a new wave of alleged victims to come forward, The Times said last night. The news came as Britain’s law chief spoke out publicly for the first time since she ruled the former MP would not face a trial because of his dementia. Yesterday the Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders dared her critics to challenge her in court, and said she is not afraid to see the controversial move tested by a High Court judge. In an appearance on Newsnight she said her decision on Lord Janner was correct when asked if she would not change her mind. She said: 'No. I’ve considered the decision very carefully. I mean this wasn’t an easy decision to make and I am very aware of the disappointment and frustration that some people will feel around the decision and I feel frustrated that we cannot and haven’t been able to prosecute it. Scroll down for video . The news came as Alison Saunders, the new Director of Public Prosecutions, has dared her critics to challenge her in court after she decided Lord Janner could not face trial because of his Alzheimer's . An explosive dossier compiled by MP Geoffrey Dickens is believed to be among 114 files known to have been lost or destroyed by the Home Office. In 1983 the Tory MP for Huddersfield West said he had eight names of 'really important, public figures' who unless they were arrested he would ‘expose in Parliament’. Based on his descriptions, these are thought to include MPs, civil servants, a diplomat and even a Buckingham Palace official. Some had links to the Paedophile Information Exchange, who wanted sex with children legalised, he said. Dickens handed his '40-page dossier' to the then Home Secretary Leon Brittan, which set out allegations of a paedophile circle ‘operating and networking within and around’ the Westminster elite. Another copy was kept by Mr Dickens' wife and another was allegedly handed to the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Thomas Hetherington and then the police. All the copies vanished and nothing came of the investigations but now the Dickens dossier is central to allegations that there was a high level cover-up to protect those in power. 'But I have to apply the code for Crown Prosecutors and that means I look at the evidence first: I was satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction. 'And then I look at the public interest, which means taking into account Lord Janner’s medical condition and his dementia, which is so severe that in my view he would not be able to stand trial. Not just in my view, but more importantly, in the view of the medical experts and we had four medical experts where I was able to take their advice.’ She also brushed aside calls for her resignation, insisting that ‘making the right decision is not a resigning issue’. In an interview with London’s Evening Standard yesterday, the DPP dismissed claims that she was part of an Establishment cover-up. She admitted that she has paid a ‘heavy price’ for the decision, but said: ‘If somebody wants to challenge my decision I’m not afraid. 'The proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review. I’m confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up.’ Mrs Saunders said she was right to avoid the ‘easy option’ of sending the case to court for a judge to throw out. Last week Leicestershire Police said they were considering a legal challenge, most likely a High Court judicial review. Victims also have the right to review charging decisions, but so far no one has come forward with a request.","Publicity surrounding case has prompted 30 people to contact police .

"Lewis Hamilton is creating a bit of a track record for himself  - and this one isn't on the starting grid. Celebrating his win at the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday, he sprayed champagne straight into the face of one of the hostesses. But a leading group which campaigns against sexism has condemned the behavior of the driver - who used to date ex-Pussy Cat Doll Nicole Scherzinger - as 'selfish and inconsiderate', saying he should be forced to apologise for 'specially directing' the bubbly into the woman's face. Others have called the driving ace an 'embarrassment to the UK', while another said his behaviour showed that he was an 'ignorant clown'. Scroll down for video . Right in the ear: Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the Chinese Grand Prix by spraying the hostess in the face with champagne . Not impressed: The hostess looks less than impressed as she is sprayed with champagne on the podium in Shanghai on Sunday . Trademark move: It's not the first time the racing ace has sprayed a grid girl with bubbly - he's also done it after winning the Spanish Grand Prix and even at the Austrian Grand Prix, where he lost out on the top spot . Caught by surprise: The hostess's colleagues laugh in the background as she gets a soaking from the champion British racing driver . Drenched: Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship . Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object, a campaign on media sexism and 'sex object culture', said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part. 'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future. For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it. 'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position. 'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.' Ms Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world. She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women. On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'. Another user simply said: 'Man please stop spraying Champagne on the Podium Ladies. They don't like it', while one outraged user said he was a 'scumbag - an embarrassment to UK'. Another wrote: 'Have a bit more respect for the ladies please. Spraying Champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot.' And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.' It is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move. He celebrated in a similar fashion after winning Spanish Grand Prix last year, which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on top of the World Championship table. And although he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to teammate Nico Rosberg, he didn't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess. The 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on Graham Norton's talk show in 2013. Sprayed: He's made it a signature move, here Hamilton sprays a hostess at Montmelo at the Spanish Grand Prix at Circuit de Catalunya . But not everyone was offended by his behaviour. Many found his actions amusing, while another said: 'I can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @LewisHamilton.. Lighten up people!' Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship yesterday. But it wasn't all smiles at yesterday's race after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference. His Mercedes partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that ‘Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.’ Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. The world champion, sitting beside his teammate, told the press conference yesterday: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race. 'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' Soaked: It wasn't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference . Smiles: The Mercedes driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning the Chinese Formula One on Sunday . A visibly angry Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race. 'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him. 'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him. Then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer, so I'm unhappy about that.' The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded. It culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in Rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team. This proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown.

"A motorist known as Mr X who spent five years trying to dodge a £60 speeding fine has been jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice. The driver, who is named Ashley X after changing his surname by deed poll, was caught on camera driving his Honda sports car at 67mph on a 50mph section of the M11 in Essex in 2009. Instead of coughing up a fixed penalty fine, he initially ignored Essex Police's attempts to confirm who was driving the car before making up a series of stories to shift the blame, Essex Police said. The driver was caught on camera driving his Honda sports car at 67mph on a 50mph section of the M11 . Pc Roy Keyes, from the force's casualty reduction team,  said: 'Ashley X was determined to avoid paying the £60 fine and having three penalty points on his licence. 'But for five years he tried to deny the offence and committed two serious offences which ultimately led to him being sent to prison.' X tried to fight the speeding charge in six different courts, concocting various stories including that his cousin was driving, faking a letter from that cousin purportedly confirming this and claiming this cousin had already paid the fine. After being found guilty of failing to provide a driver's details he challenged the verdict at Chelmsford Crown Court and the Court of Appeal but both claims were rejected. When police looked more closely at the case,  they found the 'cousin' who X claimed had been driving, and discovered he was in fact a friend, who never owned the car and denied writing any letter admitting that he had been the driver. The driver tried to convince authorities that his cousin was driving the car at the time of the offence . X, from Ruislip, west London, finally admitted perjury and perverting the course of justice at Ipswich Crown Court on Thursday. Judge Martyn Levett sentenced X to nine months imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay costs of £1,200. Essex Police praised the Crown Prosecution Service for its perseverance in bringing the case against the 35-year-old motorist. Do you know Mr X?

"A down-on-their-luck couple from Ohio struggling with chronic conditions that left them unable to make a living were found dead from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning this week, less than two months after their desperate pleas for help went ignored. Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, created online fundraisers on GiveFroward.com and GoFundMe.com in late February begging Good Samaritans for financial help. Mrs Speidel wrote that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and were close to having their electricity and Internet service shut off. Hopeless: Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, Ohio, took their own lives this week, more than two months after they created online fundraisers begging for financial help . Heartbreaking: The middle-aged couple died from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning caused by two charcoal grills they had dragged into their bedroom . Last-ditch effort: Mrs Speidel wrote on GiveForward.com in late February that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and cut down their food intake to one meal a day . After having paid $500 to their landlord to prevent their immediate eviction, Mrs Speidel stated that they were left with only $33 to their name. To stretch their meager funds a little farther, the impoverished, ailing couple were forced to limit their food intake to a single meal a day and did not have enough scraps to feed their two cats. ‘I have turned in every direction possible and don’t know what else to do,’ she wrote. ‘If you can help, we will be forever grateful and will even pay you back once we get back on our feet.’ The Speidles were hoping to raise $1,000, but the online campaign failed to draw any donations whatsoever. On Tuesday, the couple's landlord, Doug Elleman, arrived at their rental at 225 West High Avenue to discover a pink handwritten note warning passersby of carbon monoxide inside, reported Bellefontaine Examiner. Firefighters who were called to the scene entered the residence and discovered a pair of charcoal grills filled with smoldering coals. Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were pronounced dead at the scene. Orpahns: The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa (pictured right as a baby with her father) and 20-year-old Kira Speidel . Columbus Dispatch reported that a note found nearby confirmed that the husband and wife had made a suicide pact. The couple had removed their beloved pet cats from the house to spare their lives. They were later found wandering outside. The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa and Kira Speidel. In a post left last month on her parents' GoFundMe.com page, which has since been removed, 20-year-old Kira called the couple 'the hardest-working people I know.' She went on to say that now that they can no longer work because of their physical ailments, 'they have nowhere to run.' Police Chief Brandon Standley said the town has resources available for people in need like the Speidels, adding that it's tragic that they thought they were all out of options. In one of her online pleas, Jodi Speidel mentioned she had applied for assistance and was told to wait. Her GiveForward.com campaign description indicates that despite her infirmities, Speidel was able to land a new job but needed some help to tie them over until her pay checks started coming in.","Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were found dead in their Bellefontaine, Ohio, home Tuesday .

"The daughter of troubled ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne has been mugged by a gang on bikes in central London who took her phone which reportedly had private texts from her father. Former model Bianca Gascoigne, 28, was targeted by the gang of eight on Tuesday afternoon as she talked on her mobile while walking in Marylebone. The attackers are thought to have grabbed her phone and then attempted to snatch her bag, but ran away when she fought them off. Miss Gascoigne, pictured with her father Paul and brother Regan. Mr Gascoigne adopted the 28-year-old after he married her mother Sheryl in 1996 . The theft reportedly left her in tears and she is said to have been left devastated given the nature of the text messages stored on her phone. According to the Sun's Dan Sales Miss Gascoigne told a friend: 'I was walking across the road and was suddenly surrounded by this gang of eight. 'They were all hooded up so I couldn't see them properly. It was terrifying.' A friend also told the newspaper: 'She's furious because these lowlifes will be able to go through private texts, some were with her dad Paul.' Miss Gascoigne later took to her Twitter page, where she too branded the muggers 'low lifes'. She posted: 'Beautiful day shame it just got ruined by being robbed! Got ambushed by a bunch of lowlifes on bikes.' Miss Gascoigne took to her Twitter page after the attack, where she branded her muggers 'lowlifes on bikes' A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were informed of the theft of a mobile phone, which happened at about 3.45pm on Tuesday in Wimpole Road, Marylebone. 'An appointment has been made to speak to the victim.' Mr Gascoigne adopted Miss Gascoigne and her brother Mason after he married her mother Sheryl in 1996. They also have a child together called Regan. The couple divorced two years later but the 28-year-old and the former England international are still said to be incredibly close.

Last year, Miss Gascoigne hit out at Twitter trolls who attacked her saying she should have done more to help her step-father, who has had a well-documented battle with alcohol abuse. It came after he was led away from his home Sandbanks, Dorset by police and an ambulance crew following worried neighbours' calls to emergency services. One online bully told the glamour model her step-father was 'done' and another branded her 'attention seeking'. But she hit back tweeting: 'There are some sick twisted people out there have some compassion don't know why people feel the need to be so nasty & have opinions they know nothing about.' Last month, Mr Gascoigne, a former Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United midfielder, insisted he was healthy and wasn't drinking again during a TV appearance on BT Sport. The star then put a recent stint in hospital following an apparent alcohol binge down to 'just to a little blip', and insisted other photos of him shopping in a off-licence earlier this year didn't mean he had resorted to his old habits.","Former model was walking in Marylebone and was surrounded by gang .

"Hungry for power: SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon last night admitted she understands concerns of English voters about her party being involved in a coalition government. The Scottish First Minister said: ‘I understand how people south of the border think, “Oh my goodness how will it work? It’s a mess”.’ She also suggested that David Cameron had been ‘not unhelpful’ to the SNP by gaining the party greater publicity. ‘At every Westminster election I’ve fought until this one, the biggest challenge that we’ve had to overcome is being heard and being relevant. We don’t have this problem this time,’ she told The Times. ‘The message it’s given to people in Scotland is – if this is the attention we get just from the SNP riding high in the polls, imagine how loud our voice would be if that was translated into seats. So in that respect I absolutely think it is not unhelpful.’ Miss Sturgeon’s remarks came after she had insisted that she would put Ed Miliband into Downing Street even if Labour wins 40 fewer seats than the Tories in a hung Parliament. Polls suggest the SNP is on the brink of a landslide on a scale unprecedented in modern British politics, winning as many as 50 of Scotland’s 59 Commons seats. That would be all but certain to leave it holding the balance of power at Westminster for the first time. In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Miss Sturgeon insisted: ‘Even if the Tories are the largest party, if there is an anti-Tory majority, my offer to Labour is to work together to keep the Tories out.’ Asked whether Mr Cameron’s party being ahead of Labour by ‘ten, 20, 30, 40’ seats would have an impact on her decision, she said: ‘Governments in the House of Commons are about who can command a majority. 'If there is an anti-Tory majority, yes... we would work with Labour to stop the Tories getting into Downing Street.’ Pledge: Miss Sturgeon’s remarks came after she had insisted that she would put Ed Miliband (right) into Downing Street even if Labour wins 40 fewer seats than the Tories in a hung Parliament. Left, David Cameron . Labour has ruled out a coalition with the SNP but on more than 100 occasions in recent weeks senior figures have refused to rule out a less formal arrangement. Most likely are vote-by-vote negotiations which would see the SNP agree to support a minority Labour government in key Parliamentary votes, after seeking to extract concessions for Scotland. The Prime Minister called Miss Sturgeon’s threat to prop up a weak Labour government ‘frightening’ and said it would lead to ‘economic ruin’. Nick Clegg said last night he would not support any deal with Labour that relies on it being propped up by the SNP. The Liberal Democrat leader said his first talks would be with the party with most seats – which most polls indicate will be the Tories.","Leader said she understands concerns about SNP being part of coalition .

He claims campaigning has not left him with enough time to attend NHS appointments. Certain things can make people become more at risk of developing back pain, including smoking. The increase in risk  may be because smoking has caused tissue damage in the back or because smokers tend to have unhealthier lifestyles than those who don't smoke. Source: NHS .

"The first ever mixed race Miss Japan has lifted the lid on some of the horrific racial abuse she has faced on her way to the top. Ariana Miyamoto says it was often punishing growing up as the only black girl in her class in the port town of Sasebo near Nagasaki, where the US has a naval base and where her African-American father met her Japanese mother. The 20-year-old  was born and raised in Japan, speaks fluent Japanese, and was last month chosen to represent her country in the Miss Universe pageant. Scroll down for video . Ariana Miyamoto, 20, was crowned Miss Japan last month, but has faced horrific racial abuse growing up . Ariana with her father Bryant Stanfield and a step sibling (left). As a youngster (right) she grew up in Japan . Some critics of Ariana's win have complained she is a mixed race 'hafu' and not Japanese enough . But the beauty queen had to use her first television appearance after her selection to apologetically explain to reporters that while she doesn't 'look Japanese' on the outside, on the inside there are 'many Japanese things about her'. Many in the country have expressed hostility to Ariana's title win as they expected the award to go to a 'pure' Japanese woman and not a 'hafu', meaning half Japanese, which has echoes of the discredited term 'half-caste'. 'Is it okay to choose a hafu to represent Japan?' one commenter typically wrote online after Ariana's win. Speaking about her childhood in an interview with MailOnline Ariana, who goes by her mother's maiden name, said: 'There was pretty much a spasmodic vomit of racial abuse heaped upon me. 'I was called a n****r by some of my peers. Some of them threw trash and even a blackboard duster at me. 'I'm Japanese through and through, but in Japan if you look ""foreign"" you are often not accepted as Japanese. But I am Japanese - 100 percent. 'Skin colour bears no relationship to what a person is. It's just one of the differences like wearing blue clothes or wearing red clothes.' 'I have no objections against the word 'hafu' and I accept myself as being hafu. 'With so little multi-culturalism in Japan the term is somehow understandable, although it has made me wonder who I am at times.' Ariana has been inspired by American singer Mariah Carey's struggle to get to the top as a mixed race artist, exemplified in her film Glitter, in which she plays a young singer battling discrimination to make it to the top. Ariana with her mother. She says she is 'Japanese through and through. I am Japanese - 100 percent' Ariana will represent Japan at Miss Universe having fought her way to the top despite racial prejudice . The beauty queen grew up in Sasebo near Nagasaki but spent two years with her dad in the US as a teenager . From his home in Jacksonville, Arkansas, Ariana's father Bryant Stanfield, 43, said his face hurt from non-stop smiling since his daughter scooped the Miss Japan award from a line up of more 'typical' looking Japanese women earlier this month. But he admits he's been dismayed by some of the racist comments her win has generated in Japan. 'Just get to know her. Just don't attack her. She will represent Japan very well,' he told MailOnline. 'She's told me all about the bullying and how kids used to treat her; how they hated her (wavy) hair; threw things at her; even threw trash at her. 'All pretty despicable stuff. But I always told her, and her Mom said too, 'you gotta be tough'.' Divided from the Asian and Russian land masses by fierce currents, many Japanese have long believed in a myth of racial purity, although the islands' inhabitants are a result of a hodge-podge of different migrations mainly from Korea, China and the south seas. The only 'native Japanese' are the Caucasian-looking Ainu people, pushed to near-extinction to Japan's northernmost reaches. Today, those perceived of belonging outside the mythical Japanese race are regularly discriminated against leading to a type of apartheid, particularly when it comes to renting housing. A recent ruling by Japan's ministry of justice in Kyoto declared that a 'No foreigners allowed' rule by landlords is not in fact discriminatory, thus cementing some of the institutional and casual racism non-Japanese face in contemporary Japan. The Japanese like to think of their society and culture is unique according to Theodore Bestor, a professor of anthropology and Japanese studies at Harvard University which, in a study, put Korea and Japan at the top of racially homogeneous countries, largely unwilling to accept an influx of foreigners. Miss Japan has said there was 'pretty much a spasmodic vomit of racial abuse heaped upon me' growing up . Ariana with her Japanese mother and a male friend. She claims she was called a 'n****r' by her peers . The Miss Universe hopeful with a step sibling. Her father says she is 'proud of both' her heritages . 'One of the ways in which Japanese think of their own society as 'unique' is to emphasise the homogeneity of Japanese society and indeed by lots of comparisons, Japan is certainly a much more homogeneous society than say the United States,' Bestor told Columbia University's Asian Topics. 'And, it's often said by Japanese that they are ethnically homogeneous, that there are no real foreign populations in Japan.' The election of a mixed race Japan is a first for one of the world's most ethnically homogeneous states . The election of a black Miss Japan might be a step away from that misconception and Mr Stanfield agrees that the choice of his daughter represents some kind of progression in  Japan. Conversely, he feels his dark-skinned daughter would fair better in today's America despite some recent headlines created by racial strife in Ferguson. 'It's different in America. Her being what and who she is; there is not a second thought,' he said. In reaction to the racist carping on Japan's social networks since her crowning, he believes some of the received wisdom about 'Japaneseness' might be at fault. 'Some people, for a lack of a better word, some people are ignorant. I'm not saying that the whole of Japan is ignorant but there some people who just don't know,' he said, adding that in his three years in Japan he personally had never experienced any racism. It was an encouraging sign that the Japanese judges picked a mixed race Miss Japan, he agreed, showing the progressive aspects of a country that still has the death penalty and where one tourism minister described his own 'one-race' countrymen as 'not keen' on immigration or foreigners. In contrast, Mr Stanfield said, in terms of race relations the US is a much more rosy place than it once was. 'Things are changing here,' he said, and agreed that the spread of more liberal attitudes towards gay marriage was just one example of how American is more enlightened and 'changing for the better.' 'Its not a rapid change but slowly but surely it's coming around.' 'I have to say what my daughter went through in Japan she would not have experienced in the US. There are always some people here who don't like you because of the way you look or because you are different so I'm proud of her sticking it out in japan and doing what she did - becoming Miss Japan.' As a young man, Miss Japan's father's life reads like that of the American lead in Madame Butterfly, where a handsome naval officer falls in love with a Japanese geisha before finally leaving Japan and his Japanese bride and their daughter behind. He met Ariana's Japanese mother while on duty in the US navy at Nagasaki in the 90s. 'We moved stateside for a little while but her mother actually wanted Ariana to be born in Japan,' he said. Ariana's father Bryant Stanfield, 43, says people in Japen will 'never be as proud of her as I am' 'After that my duties meant I couldn't be in Japan for any length of time and slowly her mother and I drifted apart. There's no bad history. Her mother and I just went our separate ways.' Not until Ariana was a teenager did she renew her bond with her father. After Mr Stanfield remarried and had three more children, they were joined by Ariana more permanently three years ago when Ariana stayed in Arkansas for two years to learn English and attend US high school. English is not widely spoken in Japan despite Herculean education efforts to teach it. After returning from the US, Ariana started a career in modelling in Japan. It is a pastime often considered too 'showbiz' by a traditionally-minded country, and one where beautiful half-Japanese 'hafu' offspring dominate. Ariana's father is in little doubt she is proud of both heritages. 'She's fully aware of who she is and she's fully aware of where she comes from. 'She's aware of both sides - the black side and the Japanese side,' he said. 'She just wants everyone to get along and accept one another for what they are not because of the colour of their skin, but for who they are as a person. 'Please tell Japan to just accept her, and just be be proud of her. Though I know they will never be as proud of her as I am.'","Ariana Miyamoto was born and raised in Japan and speaks fluent Japanese .

"James Webster, 35, was spared jail after admitting outraging public decency . A voyeur who used a hidden camera to film up women's skirts as they bent over freezers in Lidl has been spared jail. James Webster targeted female shoppers at the Lidl store in Maidenhead, Berkshire, as they hunted for bargains in the large chest freezers. The 35-year-old was caught after attracting the attention of a fellow shopper, who spotted him moving the bag he was carrying closer to his unsuspecting victim. Security guards discovered Webster had cut a hole in the bag through which he placed the lens of a camera so he could carry out his covert filming. He admitted outraging public decency at a previous hearing and was warned that he could face prison. But Webster walked free from court after magistrates sitting in Slough, Berkshire, ordered him to complete a sexual offences treatment programme, as part of a three year community order. Opening the case, Helen Gambrill said: 'On January 12 the defendant was in Lidl in Maidenhead and outraged the public decency, namely filming up the skirts of women in that store. 'That offence came to light when a member of the public saw the defendant and thought he was acting in a strange way.' The court heard the shopper spotted Webster positioning his satchel, with a lens protruding out, under the skirt of a woman. Webster, who at the time was living in shared accommodation in White Waltham, near Maidenhead, was confronted by security guards and tried to cover the lens before denying any wrong-doing. However, after seeing an appeal for witnesses to the crime in a local newspaper he turned himself in to police. Webster  immediately showed remorse, telling a police officer, 'I threw the camera away in frustration on the day I did this.' He accepted that his actions had a sexual purpose but admitted he had no idea why he had carried out the crime. Francis Domingo, defending, said Webster had been struggling to deal with a break-up at the time and was incredibly ashamed at his actions. 'From the moment I've seen him, I can tell you this - Mr Webster has expressed nothing but sincere remorse over what took place,' he said. Webster, now of Fengate, Marsham, near Norwich, had been smoking cannabis around the time of the incident, but was now clean, the court was told. Webster had targeted women as the shopped at Lidl in Maidenhead, Berkshire (pictured) Sentencing him, Presiding magistrate Mark Lovett said: 'We note the early guilty plea and the fact that you were very upfront about it from the very beginning. 'You were remorseful for your actions. 'On the other hand, you did show obvious intention - you went equipped. This was hardly accidental.' He added: 'The other point I have to make is that you're not 18, you're 35, for goodness sake. 'That kind of action from someone of your mature years is quite extraordinary.' Webster was handed a three year community order  and was ordered to take part in a sexual offences treatment programme. He was also told to pay £85 in costs and a £60 fine.","James Webster, 35, took photos as victims leaned against display cabinets .

"Police captured coyote who led them on a chase through downtown New York City on Saturday. Cops began following the wild animal after it was spotted scurrying through Battery Park City at 6am, The New York Post reported. Officers trailed it on foot and in patrol cars as it ran across roads and dipped between cars. For two hours it evaded capture, with one witness describing hows cops were chasing it 'like a suspect'. They then managed to corner it at Merchants River House on South End Avenue and shot it with a tranquilizer dart, the Post reported. It was then put in a cage and taken away into the care of the ASPCA. It is not known whether it was the same coyote that was spotted in Manhattan's riverside park on Wednesday. At least four coyotes have been spotted around Manhattan so far this year, and one was seen clambering around on the roof of a Queens bar before disappearing, says Sarah Aucoin, the director of the city's Urban Park Rangers program. Three of the animals were captured in Manhattan and released in Bronx parks with established coyote populations, she said. Cops began following the wild animal after it was spotted scurrying through Battery Park City . For two hours it evaded capture, with one witness describing hows cops were chasing it 'like a suspect' Officers trailed it on foot and in patrol cars as it ran across roads and dipped between cars . Police chased after the fourth on Wednesday in Manhattan's Riverside Park, even using a helicopter before until the animal secreted itself in deep brush near Grant's Tomb. There's no firm count of coyotes or sightings in the nation's biggest city, but the population is probably at least in the teens, says wildlife biologist Chris Nagy, a co-founder of a study group called the Gotham Coyote Project and the research director at the Mianus River Gorge in Bedford, New York. With some coyotes ensconced and breeding in the Bronx, others are likely heading into Manhattan this spring to seek their own turf, said coyote project co-founder Mark Weckel, a conservation biologist at the American Museum of Natural History. Coyotes were once creatures of Midwestern plains and southwestern deserts. But they have dramatically expanded their range in the last two centuries, partly because of declines in their predators, such as wolves and cougars, experts say. Although coyotes have been hunted for sport and killed as threats to livestock, they're now found from coast to coast. There are an estimated 30,000 in New York state, where they were first noted in the 1930s, the state Department of Environmental Conservation says.

"TV insiders say Lily James (pictured), who stars in the new Disney cinema hit Cinderella, would be ideal as Mary in the new TV adaptation . They were left broken-hearted when writer Julian Fellowes announced that the next series of Downton Abbey would be the last. But at least the hit show's millions of fans can now look forward to more fun from the Oscar winner. He plans another heady TV mix of romance, class struggle and social snobbery, this time based on the work of Anthony Trollope, one of Britain's greatest novelists. Lord Fellowes, 65, has revealed he is to turn Trollope's 1858 novel Doctor Thorne into a new three-part historical drama for ITV. He said: 'Doctor Thorne is one of my favourite novels. It is romantic and funny and I am absolutely delighted to be doing it. I said yes to it straight away.' He added: 'It is rooted in darkness and starts with a murder, which spreads its shadow over many of the principal characters.' The novel tells the story of Doctor Thomas Thorne, who lives in the village of Greshamsbury in Barsetshire with his beautiful niece, Mary, a girl blessed with every gift except money. Mary has grown up alongside the Gresham sisters – Augusta, Beatrice and Alexandrina – and their handsome brother Frank, whose home is the great house and estate at Greshamsbury Park. When the terrifying Lady Arabella Gresham discovers that her son Frank has fallen in love with Doctor Thorne's penniless niece, she is horrified. And the situation is made all the more fraught because Doctor Thorne is harbouring a secret about Mary's parentage which threatens to bring everyone's world crashing down. Trollope's tale is considered one of his best works and Fellowes's track record in both television and film is likely to attract an A-list cast. TV insiders say Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham in Downton, and Lily James, who plays Lady Rose in the show and who stars in the new Disney cinema hit Cinderella, would be ideal as Thomas Thorne and Mary. But one source last night said that ITV would be keen to ensure that the cast of the new drama was not filled with faces from Downton. TV critics want Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham in Downton, to appear in the new television show . The tale is considered one of Trollope's best works . Several actresses, including Anna Chancellor, who made a guest appearance in the last series of Downton Abbey, Juliet Stevenson and Janet McTeer could all be likely contenders for the role of the snobbish Lady Arabella. The project is the realisation of a life- long ambition for Fellowes, a huge admirer of Trollope's work. He revealed plans for the new drama at a dinner held at The Athenaeum Club in London on Friday night to celebrate the bicentenary of Trollope's birth. Fellowes was a speaker at the event. He told The Mail on Sunday that there was a snobbishness towards Trollope in certain quarters and he hoped the adaptation would lead to a flood of other series. 'I think television has just woken up to the fact that there are all these wonderful stories by Trollope which have never been done. How much more interesting than the 88th version of Pride And Prejudice.' Fellowes revealed that many of the characters in Downton Abbey and his Oscar-winning 2001 film Gosford Park had been inspired by Trollope. He said Gosford Park's Lady Trentham and Downton's Dowager Countess of Grantham – both played by Maggie Smith – were very similar to Doctor Thorne's Lady Arabella, and that Gosford's imperious Lady Sylvia, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, was a 'classic' from a Trollope novel. Also at the Athenaeum Club was fellow Trollope fan Sir John Major. He discovered Trollope when he was 13 and likened the author to a 'friend for 60 years'. In an article in The Mail on Sunday's Event magazine he wrote: 'I invite others to make his acquaintance. Few, if any, will be disappointed. And most – like the young boy who once rummaged through the library shelves in Brixton – will find a love for life.'","Lord Fellowes, 65, has revealed he is to turn Trollope's 1858 novel Doctor Thorne into a new three-part historical drama for ITV .

"Sacked: Peter Gale was dismissed by Nonsuch High School For Girls in Surrey two weeks ago . The male headmaster of a leading all-girls’ grammar school has been sacked after sending a series of private emails to a teenage pupil, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Peter Gale, 47, was dismissed by Nonsuch High School For Girls in Surrey for ‘unprofessional and inappropriate conduct’ two weeks ago. At the time of the announcement, the school’s governors failed to release any more details. However, an investigation by this newspaper has discovered that Mr Gale – who became the academy’s first male head when he was appointed to the post 18 months ago – sent informal emails over a period of months to the sixth-form pupil, including messages written at night and during the holidays. School rules strictly forbid teachers sending messages to pupils from private email accounts. The Cheam academy has described Mr Gale’s actions a ‘serious breach of safeguarding procedures’. Despite this, the National Union of Teachers appeared to play down the seriousness of his conduct. In a statement to The Mail on Sunday, the union implied Mr Gale’s actions only amounted to a breach of the school’s information and communications technology rules. The governors – who began their investigation following a tip-off – are said to have been ‘stunned’ by the NUT statement. The specialist science college and languages school, which counts singer Katie Melua and Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell among its alumni, passed judgment on Mr Gale at an internal disciplinary hearing earlier this month, ruling he had broken rules in place to prevent personal communications between staff and pupils. It is understood this was in breach of guidance telling teachers never to use a private email account to send messages to pupils, partly for their own protection. The school has refused to reveal the precise content of the emails, but it is understood they were informal and read like text messages. It is believed there were also concerns about the way Mr Gale, the former deputy headmaster of all-girl Rosebery School in nearby Epsom, had treated the student differently from other pupils. Mr Gale, who is understood to be unmarried and who lives in Godalming, Surrey, declined to comment directly to The Mail on Sunday. Messages: An investigation by the Mail on Sunday has revealed it was a series of 'informal' emails to a sixth form pupil which led to his dismissal from the specialist science college  (pictured) Alumni: Former pupils include Kate Melua (pictured) and Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell . But a statement sent to this newspaper, released by the NUT’s London Regional Secretary Bob Stapley, said: ‘The alleged misconduct related to communication with a student which breached the school’s policy on the accepted use of ICT [information and communications technology]. ‘Mr Gale accepted he had breached the school’s policy and that as headmaster he had responsibility for ensuring he and other staff acted in accordance with the policy. Defence: The NUT have said: 'Mr Gale vehemently denies he behaved inappropriately towards any student and no such finding was made'. Pictured: The school's motto . ‘Mr Gale vehemently denies he behaved inappropriately towards any student and no such finding was made. Mr Gale appreciates that this placed governors in a difficult situation given that rumours could have a negative effect upon the reputation of the school.’ The statement added he was considering whether to appeal against ‘the severity of the sanction imposed by the Disciplinary Panel’. Chairman of governors, Tony Hyams-Parish, said in a letter to parents this month: ‘The governing body has terminated Peter Gale’s employment at Nonsuch High School for Girls due to serious breaches in applying safeguarding procedures and instances of unprofessional and inappropriate conduct. ‘This was not an easy decision, especially because we recognise that since Peter’s appointment there have been many positive changes within the school led by Peter and the senior leadership team. ‘However, the governing body and staff take their safeguarding responsibilities towards students very seriously and, importantly, any breaches of safeguarding procedures, and have therefore acted promptly to address these matters.’ Carol Dickie, the school’s bursar, said the education of the 1,200 pupils would be unaffected by the sacking, despite it coming just weeks before GCSE and A-level exams.","Peter Gale dismissed from Nonsuch High School For Girls a fortnight ago .

"When something goes bump in the night, the last thing you expect is for grandad's old cane to be responsible. But that's the kind of thing the unfortunate owners of some of the world's most haunted pieces of furniture have had to deal with. From the Indiana 'ghost cane' to the 'chair of death', these regular household fixtures are sure to give you the creeps. Scroll down for video . This haunted mirror (left) is said to contain the trapped souls of the wife and children of a Louisiana slave master while Bruno Amadio’s portrait of a weeping child (right) was thought to have been cursed . Four people reportedly died shortly after sitting in this 200-year old 'chair of death' now in Philadelphia . This 'conjure chest' is said to have caused the death of 17 people close to a slave master who murdered a slave, causing her fellow slaves to have a conjurer curse it . During the middle of the 19th Century in South Carolina, Jacob Cooley murdered a slave named Hosea for building a chest which did not meet his standards. Hosea’s fellow slaves took revenge, asking a conjurer to curse the chest – leading to the death of 17 people close to Cooley, including his first-born son. The curse was later lifted by a ‘conjure woman’, and the chest now resides in the Kentucky History Museum. When Mary Anderson’s grandson saw the ghost of his grandfather in the family home in Indiana, she decided to ease the boy’s fears by selling the cane he had owned. The winning bidder was asked to write a letter to the youngster letting him know that the cane was doing ok – and the $65,000 walking stick is now housed in Antigua’s Golden Palace Casino. Bruno Amadio’s portrait of a weeping child hit the headlines in the 1980s when a Yorkshire firefighter claimed to have noticed the painting left unscathed at the scene of numerous house fires, leading to rumours that it was cursed. The case of the haunted bunk beds of Wisconsin became infamous in 1987 when Alan and Debby Tallman’s purchase from a local junk shop led to nine months of terror . Newspapers organised bonfire burnings of copies of the painting to rid the country of the curse. The case of the haunted bunk beds of Wisconsin became infamous in 1987, when Alan and Debby Tallman’s purchase from a local junk shop led to nine months of terror. Radios would switch stations unexpectedly, the children became ill and there were even sightings of a witch-like figure at night. The family reached out to a pastor and, for a while, the house settled down – until Christmas 1988, when Mr Tallman heard a voice beckoning him to the garage, where a blazing inferno appeared before vanishing instantly. Pennsylvania's 'chair of death' was the most famous of hundreds of priceless historical artefacts kept at Baelroy Mansion in Philadelphia. The 200-year old chair is believed to have belonged to Napoleon – but the ghost which haunts the piece of furniture takes the form of a young woman named Amelia, who appears in a blue haze. When Mary Anderson’s grandson saw the ghost of his grandfather in the family home in Indiana, she decided to ease the boy’s fears by selling the cane he had owned (pictured) The chair obtained its name after four people died shortly after sitting on it, and it is said that the same fate will befall anyone who dares to sit there. A grisly story is behind a haunted mirror kept in Louisiana. In 1817, a slave called Chloe was caught eavesdropping on a conversation and punished by having an ear cut off. Covering her wound with a green turban, Chloe sought to win back her master’s affection by poisoning his family before nursing them back to health - but got the dosages wrong, killing the wife and two children. Chloe confessed to fellow slaves who, fearing blame, killed her. Tradition dictated that when a family member died, all mirrors should be covered to allow the soul to pass over to the other side. But one mirror in the house on Myrtles Plantation in St Francisville was left uncovered and ever since visitors have reported seeing a dark-skinned ghost wearing a turban, while a mirror at the house - which is now a bed and breakfast - is said to contain the trapped souls of the wife and children.

'By fitting myself into awkward places and positions I questioned where, how, and why, I fit into the family structure,' Marcus said in a statement. 'I am captured climbing up walls, crawling into window panels, hanging from doors, whereas my family members sit at the kitchen table, watch television, and maintain there daily lives.' Marcus, a dancer since she was four years old, was living in Brooklyn, New York pursuing a career as a professional dancer  when she learned of her father's diagnosis. Marcus said the experience forced her to revisit her past and also reevaluate her role in her family . Marcus said she has been working on the project for more than a year and said in the end, she was able to accept the struggle, and found love and acceptance in the home with her family . After her move to Atlanta, the project, which she has been working on for more than a year, unfolded while she was working on a photo series for a graduate studies class at Savannah college of Art and Design. While home one day, she walked past her dad, who was fast asleep on the couch in the living room after a long day of dialysis treatment. This was a moment that spoke to her and she decided to climb the wall, which was captured as the first image in the series. 'It was symbolic to how I have felt being back in the space and how we mentally exist in different worlds,' she said of that moment. 'This was the first image in the series that actually took me some time to understand. The images were captured throughout the house as she is seen performing a different move in each frame as she explores her place in the family structure . Using lights, a tripod and a timer, Marcus said each process of creating the images is different as she moves around the spaces in the home to capture the spontaneous moments . While she is waltzing around the home, her family members are seen maintaining their daily lives. She said because they are used to her dancing around the house it does not seem like anything unusual to them . 'From there I continued to create these images that demonstrated how I felt unseen and trapped within my own home.' The  images were captured throughout the house including the living room, at her family's kitchen table, in a bathroom and in bedrooms as she explores her place in the family structure and also the tensions of returning to her childhood home as an adult. While she is seen performing a different move in each image, her family performs their daily routines while the timer flickers capturing the spontaneous moments. The project, which Marcus said proved to be very emotional at times, was a way for her to cope with the transition through dance and helped her heal. 'Overall this project has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of my family and myself,' she said. 'I have learned to accept and love them wholeheartedly.' For her thesis exhibition, Marcus will present a selection of images from Choreographing My Past and a video installation on May 8, 2015 at Arnika Dawkins Gallery in Atlanta. 'By fitting myself into awkward places and positions I questioned where, how, and why, I fit into the family structure,' said Marcus . The project gave her a deeper understanding of family and herself, and she learned to accept and love them wholeheartedly, she said .","Shoccara Marcus moved from Brooklyn, NY to Atlanta, GA in 2011 after her father was diagnosed with cancer .

"Gran Canaria – just off the coast of Africa, yet still in Europe – is one of the most popular winter holiday retreats for Britons. Gareth Huw Davies visits the volcanic outpost in the Atlantic, said by one scientist to enjoy the best climate in the world, and draws up his list of things to see and do… . Golden opportunity: The glorious dunes at Maspalomas, and, above right, Santa Ana Cathedral in Las Palmas . 1...Style revolution . Is a design revolution brewing in the Canary Islands? The Apollo hotel, built at the dawn of the tourism boom in the resort of Playa del Ingles, has been entirely revamped as the swish, sumptuous, adults-only Bohemia Suites & Spa. Rooms, looking over the rippling dunes of Maspalomas, include stylish touches such as an illuminated armchair by designer Philippe Starck on the balcony. Opened in 2012, the Bohemia is an elegant retreat smack in the centre of a busy destination on Gran Canaria’s southern tip. It is one of only two places on the island included in Design Hotels’ global list of 260 independent properties. Each place reflects the ideas of a visionary hotelier, in this case German Rembert Euling. Golden wonder: The three-mile-long Las Canteras is a must-see for sun worshippers . 2...Sea Symphony . Gran Canaria is just four hours from the UK, making it one of the most easily reached locations for guaranteed winter sun. In 1996 a US academic concluded that it enjoyed the best climate in the world. At the end of Gran Canaria’s best beach – the three-mile-long Las Canteras – they set the seaside to music. The Alfredo Kraus Auditorium (named after the Canarian tenor) was built in the 1990s as a ‘theatre of the ocean’, set on a pedestal of volcanic stone. This is one of the most drum-rollingly impressive locations for any performance centre. See the Atlantic rise and fall through an enormous picture window behind the stage, while you watch distinguished visitors such as the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, or the island’s own philharmonic orchestra and world stars at the Canaries Jazz Festival. Why not opt for the winding route through the mountains, and stop off at the old villages such as San Bartolome along the way . 3...Take the high road . There are two ways to cross 30-mile-long Gran Canaria: take the dull but fast coastal motorway, which runs along the eastern and southern fringe of this circular island, or follow the twisty, switchback route right through its 6,000ft-high heart. When the light is right, there is a dreamy vista of mountain upon mountain. The road passes towering ravines and an ancient volcanic crater, scattered with the ubiquitous cardon cactus. Centuries separate the crowded coastal resorts and old villages such as San Bartolome, with its cobbled streets, where the air is fresh and clean. On this island of so many paths, the finest of all is the Pilgrims Way, the Camino de Santiago. Unesco World Heritage Site Old Las Palma was a favourite of the likes of Columbus . 4...Plaza perfect . Old Las Palmas made a rare and long-lasting export to the New World – its little central square, the Plaza Mayor de Santa Ana. With its neat arrangement of town hall, Santa Ana Cathedral, Episcopal Palace and other civic buildings all in one place, it was taken as the model for many of the main squares in Central and South American cities in the 16th and 17th Centuries. Today, old Las Palmas is recognised as a Unesco World Heritage Site for its role as an architectural staging post between the Old and New Worlds. Columbus called here three times on his journeys west. He is celebrated in the Old Town in the fine old Columbus Museum, Casa Museo de Colon, where he is thought to have stopped in 1492. Visit Europe's only coffee plantation, and also try the grown tropical fruit and vineyard . 5...Coffee break . In the shade of ancient pines in the Agaete Valley, under the Tamadaba mountains on the north of the island, they raise a rare crop. This is the world’s most northerly coffee plantation, and the only one in Europe. We visited La Finca de la Laja, where we were shown around the estate by the infectiously enthusiastic Victor Lugo Jorge, who was naturally keen to show us a photograph of Stephen Hawking on a recent visit. Receiving visitors, and serving a delicious lunch of home produce, is the latest stage in a busy diversification at this combined Arabica coffee plantation, tropical fruit farm (they raise guava, oranges, avocados and mangos), vineyard, cheesemaker, and olive oil producer. Enjoy a colourful starter of papas arrugadas at Smile Cooking in Las Palmas . 6...Raising a smile . Papas arrugadas – small wrinkled potatoes boiled in salt water and then baked, and topped with a red and green pepper mojo sauce – is the brightest dish in the Canary Islands. It certainly made for a colourful starter on our visit to Smile Cooking in Las Palmas. At Smile, you can observe the chef at work, and try your hand at the dish in question if you choose, before settling back to enjoy a meal. One local star helping to raise the island’s culinary standards is Xavier Franquet, executive chef at the Bohemia Suites & Spa’s 360° Restaurant. Xavier worked at the famously innovative El Bulli restaurant in Spain, and offers a menu full of invention and daring. The restaurant, on the hotel’s eighth floor, is also open to non-residents.

"The Director of Public Prosecutions who let off Lord Janner over alleged child sex abuse started her career at a legal chambers when the disgraced Labour peer was a top QC there. Alison Saunders, 54, sparked outrage last week when she decided  the 86-year-old should not face a string of charges of paedophilia against nine children because he has dementia. Today, newly-released documents revealed damning evidence that abuse was covered up by police and social workers for more than 20 years. And now it has emerged Mrs Saunders' law career got off to a flying start when she secured her pupillage – a barrister’s training contract at 1 Garden Court Chambers in London in 1983. It has been revealed that the country's top prosecutor Alison Saunders (right) who ruled that Lord Janner (right) would not face trial over alleged child sex abuse trained at the same legal firm where he was a QC . Last night, The Sun revealed that Mrs Saunders trained in the same in legal chambers where Lord Janner had practised. The Bar Council, the training body for barristers, confirmed Janner worked at the legal firm from the mid-1950s up until 1986. But a spokesperson for the CPS insisted the pair had never met, despite a three-year overlap of their time at the firm. She told MailOnline: ‘It is common knowledge that Alison Saunders had her pupillage at Garden Court chambers. 'But the DPP and Lord Janner have never met. This is ridiculous.’ The chambers were Saunders and Janner practised at 1 Garden Court was dissolved in 1989. Since then, a different and unconnected family law chambers has operated from the same address. By Richard Marsden for the Daily Mail . Alison Saunders graduated in law from Leeds University in 1982 and was called to the Bar in the following year. Her pupillage – a barrister’s training contract – was at 1 Garden Court Chambers, the same offices where Lord Janner practised employment law. She joined the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, after which she shaped policy on child victims. In 2001, she became chief prosecutor for Sussex and oversaw the prosecution of paedophile Roy Whiting for the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne. After a short time as deputy legal adviser to the attorney general from 2003, she returned to the CPS two years later to set up its organised crime division. In 2009, she became chief crown prosecutor for London and then Director of Public Prosecutions in November 2013. Now, the country's top prosecutor is facing calls to quit from campaigners and alleged abuse victims. Pete Saunders, director of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said the revelation is 'an insult' to survivors of abuse. He told The Sun: 'On the evidence how can we not conclude that they might be covering for each other. Lord Janner (pictured after being sworn in as a Queen's Counsel in 1971) worked at Garden Court Chambers from the mid-1950s until 1986 . It is scandalous and an insult to to all the survivors who have spent decades fighting to get themselves heard.' The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was enough evidence to charge Janner with 22 offences from 1969 and 1998. While admitting that dementia is not 'a bar' to prosecution, Mrs Saunders has defended her decision not to bring charges against Janner, adding she was surprised at the political backlash she has faced. Janner’s family have issued a statement insisting he was ‘entirely innocent of any wrongdoing’ - but he has been suspended from the Labour Party. ‘Dementia in itself isn’t a bar to either a trial or to a trial of the facts, but you have to look at – and the law is very clear about this – is there a need to have a trial on the facts for the public protection?’ she told the BBC. ‘In many of the cases where we do use that procedure, it’s because there’s an ongoing risk to the public. Again the medical evidence was very clear in this case: there was no ongoing risk.’ But her links to the shamed peer come as it emerged the judge tasked with reviewing the mistakes that prevented Janner from being brought to trial in the past was a close friend of the barrister hired to defend Janner against claims of abuse. Lord Janner turned to the late George Carman QC - who also represented paedophile Jimmy Savile - when he was first investigated in 1991. Sir Richard Henriques considered Mr Carman a mentor at the Bar, The Times reported. But Mrs Saunders has insisted that  Sir Richard's friendship with Mr Carman would have no influence on the review.","Alison Saunders sparked outrage when she ruled peer wouldn't face trial .

"One-eyed police killer Dale Cregan has been sent to the same psychiatric hospital as Moors murderer Ian Brady after going on hunger strike for the second time. The 31-year-old has reportedly been transferred from HMP Manchester, formerly Strangeways, to Ashworth Hospital, a high-security psychiatric unit in Maghull, Merseyside. Cregan, who was jailed for life after shooting police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in 2012, was said to have started refusing food at the Category A jail after being moved to solitary confinement. Scroll down for video . One-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan (above left) has reportedly been  moved from the Category A prison to the same secure psychiatric hospital as Moors murderer Ian Brady (above right) A source said told the Sun: 'He's playing the system. 'If he's offered a move he likes, he will start eating.' Brady, who was jailed for life in 1966, was sent to Ashworth Hospital over 30 years ago. Together with Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002, he tortured and murdered five children in Greater Manchester between 1963 and 1965. In 2013 a mental health tribunal ruled that Brady should stay at Ashworth, despite the notorious killer arguing that he was not suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and should go back to jail. Cregan, who lost an eye in a brawl, was told he would die in prison when he was jailed for life without parole in June 2013. He was already on the run for the murders of David Short, 46, and son Mark, 23, when he killed the two policewomen after luring them to a house with a fake 999 call before shooting them 32 times on the doorstep and then throwing a grenade at them. It was claimed he was sent to solitary confinement at HMP Manchester last month after being caught smuggling a mobile phone and cannabis into his cell. Before the fallout sources told the Daily Star Sunday that Cregan had an enhanced status and was allowed additional time in the games area and yard, as well as a flat-screen TV and DVD player in his room.

But the benefits were taken off him after he was caught smuggling for a second time. 'Cregan has burned all his bridges in here,' the source reportedly told the newspaper. 'He has not eaten since he was sent into segregation.' Ashworth hospital offers comfortable bedrooms and patients are allowed personal items such as CDs, photos and books. Art and music workshops, pottery and cooking classes, and social events such as bingo and film nights are also offered to the patients.

"Chris Christie's wife has quit her big-money job on Wall Street in what could be a sign her husband has decided to run for president in 2016. May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video . Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co . According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire . Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him . She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return. He later tried to clarify his comments by saying 'we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state.","Mary Pat Christie, 51, quit her position at finance firm Angleo Gordon & Co .

"A Labour candidate has denied launching a foul-mouthed attack on a political rival for pointing out he lives in a £1.5 million home. Michael Foster was appearing at a public ‘hustings’ in the Camborne and Redruth constituency when he objected to mention of his luxurious four-bedroom home by Loveday Jenkin who is standing for the Cornish party Mebyon Kernow. Ms Jenkin claims Mr Foster turned to her and said: ‘You c***. If you pick on me again I will destroy you.’ Labour candidate Michael Foster, pictured, said not many people in Cornwall would be hit by the mansion tax . However, a rival candidate pointed out that Mr Foster lived in a £1.5 million house, pictured, near Falmouth . Loveday Jenkin, pictured, is running in the same constituency for Mebyon Kernow - the party for Cornwall . She said the alleged outburst came after he was questioned about Ed Miliband’s plan to impose a mansion tax on all homes worth more than £2 million. Mr Foster, a former media agent who has represented celebrities including Sacha Baron Cohen and Anne Robinson, said it was a marginal issue in the Cornish constituency, adding: ‘How many people do you know who live in £1 million houses?’ Ms Jenkin then turned to him and said, to laughter and mocking jeers: ‘You do Michael!’ Labour was last night at the centre of a race row after text messages were sent to Asian voters in a key marginal constituency urging them to cast their postal ballots for ‘all Asian candidates’. One of the messages was apparently sent by Mohammed Hanif, a Labour councillor in Tory-controlled Pendle, previously identified as being at high risk of election fraud. Tory MEP Sajjad Karim said the ‘intimidating’ texts ‘were a flagrant abuse of election laws’. Mr Hanif refused to comment. Councillor Mohammed Iqbal, local Labour Party agent for the council elections, said: ‘There is nothing illegal in this. Any individual is free to send a text message asking a friend or family member to consider voting for a certain candidate.’ According to estate agents, Mr Foster’s £1.5 million home, which overlooks Port Navas Creek, ‘makes the most of its splendid position, with timber decks, balconies and an open sitting room seemingly hanging over the water’. Ms Jenkin also claims that when the event concluded, Mr Foster tried to ‘square up’ to her, but she avoided the confrontation. She said: ‘He clearly has an anger management problem, and no understanding of the problems affecting Cornish people.’ She added that at a previous hustings he was asked – after Miliband mentioned his two kitchens – how many he had and replied “three, but only one of them is in Cornwall”.’ Mr Foster, who sold his stake in literary agency PFD in 2013, also owns a property worth more than £1 million in London’s fashionable Primrose Hill. Mr Foster said: ‘This is totally false. We have had six hustings in Camborne and Redruth and there are two more. All have been conducted politely, in a friendly manner.’","Michael Foster denied launching a foul-mouthed attack at a rival candidate .

"Robert Downey Jr has been accused of making a racist remark about an Oscar-winning Mexican director during an interview. The actor, who is promoting his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron, was asked what he thought of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's claim that superhero movies were 'cultural genocide'. The Hollywood star told The Guardian: 'Look I respect the heck out of him. I think for a man whose native tongue is Spanish to be able to put together a phrase like 'cultural genocide' just speaks to how bright he is.' The controversial comments sparked a furious backlash on Twitter, with some calling it 'racist' and 'ignorant'. It comes just three days after the 50-year-old, who plays Iron Man in the film, walked out of an interview with Britain's Channel 4 after interviewer Krishnan Guru-Murthy talked about his history of drug abuse and his time in prison. Scroll down for down . Robert Downey Jr (left) has been accused of making a racist remark about Oscar-winning Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu during an interview. The Avengers star said: 'I think for a man whose native tongue is Spanish to be able to put together a phrase like 'cultural genocide' just speaks to how bright he is' Mr Inarritu, who took home the Academy Award for best director for Birdman at this year's ceremony, slammed action films in an interview with Deadline in 2014. He said: 'I sometimes enjoy them because they are basic and simple and go well with popcorn. The problem is that sometimes they purport to be profound, based on some Greek mythological kind of thing. And they are honestly very right wing. 'I always see them as killing people because they do not believe in what you believe, or they are not being who you want them to be. 'I hate that, and don't respond to those characters. They have been poison, this cultural genocide, because the audience is so overexposed to plot and explosions and shit that doesn't mean nothing about the experience of being human. He added: 'Superheroes…just the word hero bothers me. What the f*** does that mean? 'It's a false, misleading conception, the superhero. Then, the way they apply violence to it, it's absolutely right wing. 'If you observe the mentality of most of those films, it's really about people who are rich, who have power, who will do the good, who will kill the bad. Philosophically, I just don't like them.' The comments came just three days after the 50-year-old, who plays Iron Man in the film, walked out of an interview with Britain's Channel 4 after the interviewer talked about his history of drug abuse . The Avengers: Age of Ultron press tour has been mired in controversy. Jeremy Renner and Chris Evans were forced to apologize on Thursday for calling co-star Scarlett Johansson's character in the blockbuster movie a 'slut,' saying it was just a tasteless joke. Renner, who reprises his role as Hawkeye in the sequel 'Avengers: Age of Ultron,' made the offending comments in a TV interview alongside fellow superhero star Evans, who plays Captain America. An interviewer asked them what they thought about Johansson's character, Black Widow, opting not to get together romantically with either of them. 'She's a slut!' Renner told the Digital Spy interviewer, triggering huge guffaws from Evans, who added: 'I was going to say something along that line... a complete whore.' Social media, perhaps inevitably, went ballistic, and on Thursday Renner's publicist issued an apology on his behalf, saying the actor was simply exhausted from the slog of promoting the new movie. 'I am sorry that this tasteless joke about a fictional character offended anyone. It was not meant to be serious in any way. Just poking fun during an exhausting and tedious press tour,' he said. Evans' representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a statement to Entertainment Weekly he said: 'We answered in a very juvenile and offensive way that rightfully angered some fans. 'I regret it and sincerely apologize.' The comments sparked a furious backlash on Twitter, with some calling it racist and ignorant . During a recorded interview which aired in the UK on Wednesday, Downey Jr looked visibly uncomfortable when he was asked personal questions. The news anchor asked Downey Jr to explain a comment in a five year-old interview with the New York Times, in which he said: 'You can't go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal.' Responding, Downey Jr, 50, said: 'I could pick that apart for two hours and be no closer to the truth than giving you some half-arsed answer right now. I couldn't even tell you what a liberal is.' But, when asked about his relationship with his father, Downey Jnr gets up and says: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy can be seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone. At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' The original 2012 The Avengers became the third-highest grossing movie in cinema history, taking more than $1.5 billion at the box office, only beaten by Avatar (2009) and Titanic (1997).

"Haul: The cherry picker collecting drugs from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool . The amount of drugs being thrown over the fence into one prison is so high that warders have been forced to deploy a cherry picker to remove them. Packages containing heroin and cannabis were cleared from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool - hurled there from the outside by friends of inmates who missed their intended targets. The hydraulic crane also recovered so-called 'legal highs' as well as 22 phones, three Sim cards and six chargers from the 60ft roof, contained in a total of 14 bubble-wrapped packages. Officers at the jail, privately run by controversial firm G4S, disclosed the haul in an internal document, which dramatically highlights the extent of drug use among the jail's 1,300 inmates. Dave Thompson, director of the Category B prison, said: 'These items were thrown over the prison walls by criminals on the outside and it required a cherry picker and staff to retrieve them from inaccessible rooftops.' Altcourse, the first prison in the UK to be designed and constructed for a private operator, has been criticised for drug-related violence. After a three-day visit last June, chief inspector of prisons Chris Hardwick wrote: 'There have been 38 serious assaults in just four months before the inspection. Gang issues and the availability of drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances [legal highs] were a significant factor in much of the violence.' G4S insists that Altcourse runs an effective anti-smuggling operation, and that the cherry picker is part of a 'high-visibility' approach to show inmates they will 'root out packages from anywhere'. 'We are committed to preventing drugs coming into our prison and we are encouraged that, at the same time as our seizures of banned substances have increased, the numbers of prisoners testing positive for them has come down,' said Mr Thompson.","A cherry picker was called in to clear drugs from roof of HMP Altcourse .

"A hiker exploring Chile's natural wonders got the shock of his life on Wednesday afternoon when a volcano erupted before his eyes. A man identified as Walter Witt on YouTube was casually filming a serene forest with gentle waterfalls a short distance away from the foot of the 6,500-foot-high Calbuco volcano. Since being posted online the video has over 72,000 views. 'There aren't many people here,' the hiker says in Spanish in the video. 'Beautiful, the volcano there...'he says just before the volcano begins to blow. Scroll down for video . Nothing to see here: This hiker's surroundings are serene up until the moment a volcano erupts before his eyes and he runs for the hills . 'Wow,' he then says with shock as he pics up his camera and travels as far away from the erupting volcano as he possibly can. The Volcano has been dormant since 1972 and neither scientists nor government officials predicted the eruption, reports Mashable. Volcano Calbuco, believed to be among the three most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes, had erupted for the first time at 6pm local time on Wednesday. An estimated 1,500 people were forced to flee the nearby town of Ensenada after the eruption, while several smaller townships were also cleared. Locals described an apocalyptic scene as ash clouds were shot six miles into the air creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night's sky. Another unexpected eruption in the Los Lagos Region  heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated, residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded. 'Beautiful volcano': The hikers speaks about the volcano's natural beauty just seconds before it erupts . The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway. Previous and equally violent eruptions at Calbuco have continued for up to a week, according to a volcanologist from Oxford University who told Dailymail.com it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The volcano is located near the tourist town of Puerto Varas and the city of Puerto Montt, a little more than 620 miles south of Chile's capital, Santiago. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert, setting up an exclusion zone of 12.5miles around the volcano, barring access to the area. Trevor Moffat, who lives in Ensenada, some six miles from the volcano, said the eruption happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' 'Wow': The hiker expresses his amazement at the volcanic eruption before quickly traveling to safe territory . Up in smoke: Volcano Calbuco, in southern Chile, erupted forcing 1,500 residents from Ensenada, about 10 miles away,  to flee their homes .","A man identified as Walter Witt on YouTube was casually filming a serene forest a short distance away from the foot of the Calbuco volcano .

"Racing legend Tony McCoy ended his career as a jump jockey without adding to his haul of more than 4,300 winners. His two, third-place finishes at Sandown Park in front of a packed crowd of 18,000 race fans brought an end to the greatest racing career in history. McCoy, 40, has been champion jump jockey for the past 20 years, and when he was handed the trophy for the final time today by former Arsenal player Ian Wright, it emerged that the Irish jockey will be allowed to keep it in perpetuity. An emotional Tony McCoy takes a moment after he finished third in his 17,630th race at Sandown Park . Some 18,000 people packed Sandown Park to see the 20-time Champion Jockey on his final two rides . McCoy was joined on stage by his wife Chanelle and daughter Eve and young son Archie . McCoy, known to racing fans as AP, was cheered on by his wife Chanelle, and children Archie and Eve. In a career that has lasted more than 25 years, McCoy has ridden in more than 17,000 races and fallen an estimated 1,000 times breaking almost every bone in his body at least once. McCoy looked clearly emotional has he waved to the crowd after finishing third aboard Box Office in his final race. The record-breaking jockey admitted that, unusually, he had difficulty sleeping last night before his final professional rides. McCoy has been Champion Jockey in Britain and Ireland since 1996. During his career he has had 4,348 winners since his first victory in in Thurles, in Tipperary, Ireland on March 26, 1992 aboard Legal Steps. His first British winner was in Exeter in 1994, riding Chickabiddy to victory. AP McCoy was reduced to tears as he competed as a professional jockey for the last-ever time on Saturday . An emotional McCoy couldn't contain his emotions as he waved to the crowd after his last race . McCoy was congratulated by fellow jockeys as he prepared for his final ever race after in Sandown Park . Speaking to Channel 4, McCoy said: 'Today has been way beyond my expectations and thanks to Sandown and all the people who have been here today. It’s been an honour and a privilege. I’ve had a brilliant way of life for the past 25 years. 'I think it’s so much easier to enjoy and be successful in what you do if you like the people you work with and I’ve been incredibly lucky in that respect.' After the race, he was joined on stage by his family where he addressed the crowd. 'I would like to thank the BHA for allowing me to keep the trophy. I have had it a long time. 'I don't think I will ever celebrate retirement. I feel more sadness but I aware it had to happen It felt very different driving in and going into the Weighing Room. 'I went into the sauna for three-quarters of an hour and I will probably never go into one in my life again. 'There has been the last time this and the last time that over the last few weeks but this really is the last time. Last night was probably the first time in my life I didn't sleep well. My routine is going to have to change so much I will have to adapt.' McCoy announced his retirement in February but it was only the passing of the Grand National and his last rides at Cheltenham that made reality hit home. The racing legend was swamped by photographers and punters following his last professional race . McCoy was presented the Champion Jockey trophy by Ian Wright - McCoy is an Arsenal fanatic . McCoy added: 'Race riding has been an addiction. The reason in the last two weeks I have not been riding as much was because I wanted to get myself prepared. 'That is why I announced my retirement when I did. I wanted to prepare myself for not being a jockey. 'I thought that was the best way of coping with it. It has been easy until the last couple of weeks. I am well aware the next two days , two weeks, two months, two years are going to be the most difficult.' 'I have been very lucky and what I would say to the young lads in the weighing room enjoy every moment of it. 'In any sport to be successful you have to be prepared to work harder than anyone else. I think I have got talent but I have never thought I am the best at anything. When I look back I don't think I leave much behind.' In his final race, he was beaten by his long-time rival and friend Richard Johnson - who has been runner-up in the Champion Jockey race to McCoy for the past fifteen years. Speaking after the race, McCoy tipped his friend to take over from him next season. 'I’d like Richard Johnson to be Champion Jockey because he made me achieve a lot of the things that I did. 'I would never have achieved the numbers I have done if it wasn’t for Richard Johnson. That’s no disrespect to Sam Twiston-Davies or Tom Scudamore or Jason Maguire. We have numerous lads who could be Champion Jockey, but personally I would like Richard Johnson to be Champion Jockey.' In advance of his final rides today, stars from across sport, entertainment and racing paid tribute to McCoy, among them, Arsene Wenger, manager of his beloved Arsenal. The Arsenal boss said: 'I would like to congratulate you AP on your outstanding career. It’s absolutely exceptional what you have done and at Arsenal, who we know you support, we are inspired by that kind of dedication, quality and consistency that you have achieved in your career. Well done.' Presenter Clare Balding said: 'I admire him so much for his skill in the saddle, for his dedication to the sport, for being able to stay at the top of his game for 20 years. 'But I almost admire him more for turning away now, for being able to bow out at the top, I think that takes so much courage. He knows he could carry on for another five years but he doesn’t want to doubt himself. 'He knows that if he doubts himself for a second that will travel down the reigns and the horses won’t believe what he’s always believed, that he is the best.' Sandown Park was packed with fans eager to watch McCoy in his penultimate race on Saturday . The retiring 20-time champion jockey admitted he went into the final two rides of his career with a heavy heart . Retiring jockey McCoy insists he will never return to professional racing after his Sandown farewell . Dame Judi Dench, Actress: 'A winner. He’s a winner. I can’t imagine how he is going to feel, I must say, retiring from having such a kind of glittering career. He was born to ride a horse, he was born to win too. It’s wonderful to meet him and be able to say to him, you’re a legend.' Ian Wright, who presented the Champions Jockey trophy McCoy said: 'AP McCoy is made of something else altogether. For 20 years he has been at the top of his game, riding winners, week in week out. I can think of no other sportsman or woman who can match his record. Like the Arsenal team of 2003/04 he’s proven that he truly is an Invincible. It was an incredible honour to award him with his trophy for the final time on the day he retires.' Trainer Jonjo O’Neill, who : 'He’s a brilliant all-rounder. He was the one man out there you didn’t want riding against you. I was lucky to get a lot of use out of him – more than anybody else. He’s fantastic on the lesser horses and he gets just as much of a kick out of winning a selling plate race as he does the Gold Cup. He gives it the same ride, that’s why he’s very special.' JP McManus, Racehorse Owner and long-standing employer: 'I get enormous pleasure from AP riding. If he is on one of my horses then it’s a bonus but if it’s somebody else’s I still get a thrill out of it. We’ve had many great days winning the Grand National and a Gold Cup. There’s never a right time [to retire], but it’s nice that he’s picking a time of his choosing. He’s an ironman and a lovely man. I’ve grown to love him more and more, as my family have. There’s something deep and great about him.' Tony McCoy signs autographs for punters on his final-ever day as a jockey at Sandown .

"A Chilean artist has been jailed after dyeing a famous hot spring in Iceland pink with food colouring. Marco Evaristti, the South American artist who is based in Copenhagen, poured red fruit dye into the Strokkur Geysir, found around 70 miles to the north east of Reykjavik, at dawn. When they boiled, vibrant pink steam blew up from the ground as a result. Professing that 'nature belongs to no one', he did not seek permission from local authorities before the stunt. He has since been jailed for two weeks after landowners lambasted his efforts as 'vandalism'. Scroll down for video . An artist has been jailed after pouring food dye into the Strokkur Geysir natural hot spring in Iceland, causing its the water to turn bright pink . Artist Marco Evarastti defended his artwork, saying nature belonged to 'no one'. Icelandic authorities jailed the Chilean national for 15 days . 'This is not art,' Garðar Eiríks­son, a spokesman for the landowners of the Geysir area told local news outlet mbl.is. 'I am deeply sorry that a visitor to out country comes up with such an idea. I have very few words to describe my disgust at these actions.' Evaristti defended his artwork, describing himself as a 'landscape painter'. 'I do what I do be­cause I'm a painter, a land­scape painter who does­n't use a can­vas, I paint di­rectly on na­ture. 'I do not ask for per­mis­sion be­cause na­ture be­longs to noone. I be­lieve in free­dom of speech and I believe na­ture does­n't be­long to cer­tain peo­ple, but to every­one.' 'I love mother nature. If I love a womn I give her a diamond ring. That's why I decorate nature, because I love it.' The artist has carried out the same stunt four times across the world including at a frozen waterfall in Norway last year. Boasting of the 'installation' on his website, he wrote: 'The 5th Pink State has seen the light of day. 'This morning the utopian state of Pink State claimed as it´s new territory the magnificent Strokkur Geysir in Iceland.'

"Vince Cable prides himself on being the Tories' bogeyman in the Coalition Cabinet. 'I'm regularly voted their least popular Cabinet member,' he says with his familiar hangdog smile. Just as David Cameron and George Osborne privately describe Nick Clegg as a 'closet Conservative', they regard Cable a closet Labour politician. Not surprising, since he once was a Labour politician, albeit a councillor, in the 1970s. Scroll down for video . Vince Cable wants a substantial role in government and envisages working with the Conservatives again . Similarly, some Labour MPs fantasise that if only boyish Ed Miliband could have persuaded Uncle Vince, with his provincial bank manager's air and twinkly peacock blue eyes, to defect, Labour would walk the General Election. With Cable in charge of Labour's spending plans, voters would stop worrying that would-be PM Red Ed might do something barmy. But as we sit on the terrace of the quirkily named Barmy Arms pub by the Thames in his Twickenham constituency, Business Secretary Cable says something, which on first hearing, sounds even more barmy. Not only is he ready to spend another five years helping the Tories run Britain, he wants to replace George Osborne as Chancellor. 'Yes, I know,' he shrugs, acknowledging the apparent contradiction, 'I've spent my whole political life fighting the Conservatives.' How does he sit down with Tories he privately despises? 'When we have a business meeting we put the guns at the door and sit down and talk,' he smiles. He complains of 'nasty and vicious stuff' from the Tories. And after one heated Cabinet verbal exchange with Defence Secretary Liam Fox, Cameron rushed up to Cable on his way out and begged him to keep it secret to stop the Coalition collapsing. He describes another confrontation with junior Tory Business Minister Matt Hancock, an ally of Osborne sent to 'spy' on Cable. 'He came to my office with a list of plum jobs he wanted. I said, 'No, I'm the boss.' He was very cross, stamped his feet, got up and slammed the door.' So how, and more to the point, why, does Cable want another five years of more of the same? 'Because I've realised it is possible to be business-like with them. I can envisage a scenario in which I would stomach working with the Tories if the situation required. You have to let your head rule your heart.' In the interview, Mr Cable said the Prime Minister and the Chancellor were 'highly intelligent guys' and added that they 'don't snarl at each other' He knows full well the significance of what he is saying. 'It's important coming from me because I'm the one seen as having the least affinity with the Tories.' Cable is also quick to make clear he does not rule out working with Labour. But he 'envisages' remaining in a government led by Cameron, not Miliband. Cable says he would stop 'the nasty tail of Right-wing MPs wagging the Tory dog' if Cameron scrapes home. He denounces 'horrendous' public spending cuts proposed by Cameron and Osborne – 'almost all affecting the disabled and working poor'. But with Cable, the difference is strictly political, not personal. In the next breath he says: 'Cameron and Osborne are highly intelligent guys and I respect their abilities. I have perfectly affable discussions with them. We don't snarl at each other.' His warm words for the Tories are all the more remarkable, bearing in mind that, around the corner, Conservative chiefs have sent extra teams of canvassers to Twickenham to try to 'decapitate' Cable. No one seriously thinks they can overturn his 12,000 majority. Giving a timely reminder to local Tories in his middle-class constituency, home of the chaps of the English Rugby Football Union and Hampton Court, of his fondness for Dave and George will do him no harm. They don't call him a wily old fox for nothing. His criticism of Miliband is all the more wounding, sounding like a disappointed father or headmaster. His warm words for the Tories are all the more remarkable, bearing in mind that, around the corner, Conservative chiefs have sent extra teams of canvassers to Twickenham to try to 'decapitate' Mr Cable . 'He could have done so much better and has made two really big mistakes. He should have said up-front on the financial crisis that we [the last Labour Government] screwed up seriously and done a mea culpa. 'And I feel let down by his foolish plan to cut university tuition fees to £6,000. It is a low-grade response. He couldn't resist a cheap soundbite at our expense. Very poor judgment. And his fiscal policy is so vague.' Two days after the Election, Cable celebrates his 72nd birthday. Tall, tanned and languid, he looks lithe enough to reprise his dainty-toed appearance in Strictly Come Dancing in 2010. Yet, audaciously, the evergreen septuagenarian has set his sights on a new star turn – Chancellor in a Tory-led Government. 'I'm up for having a substantial role. My prime interest is the economy. There are two economic departments in Whitehall and I've done one of them for five years. I'll leave you to do the maths!' It sounds highly unlikely. Certainly less likely than a Lib Dem leadership contest if, as some predict, Clegg loses his seat. Cable loyally insists his party boss will survive and vehemently denies he wants his job. But canny Cable can't resist pointing out: 'I'm quite a bit younger than Gladstone, Churchill and Ronald Reagan.' All three led governments in their eighth decade. We can do the maths, Vince.","Lib Dem MP said he's realised it's 'possible to be business-like' with Tories .

"Ten years ago, I signed a letter backing Labour in the 2005 Election. Earlier this month I signed a letter backing the Conservatives for this one. Why the conversion? I'm not a tribally political animal. I am someone who runs and starts businesses, but most importantly wants to see our country succeed. I back whatever works. Five years ago the world was facing catastrophic economic problems. We had stared into the abyss of a complete failure of the international financial system, and managed – via huge State intervention – to avoid total collapse. The recovery of the UK since then has been extraordinary. We have outperformed every other major economy. Former Blair ally Charles Dunstone (pictured) is now supporting the Conservative Party in the election . When I speak to investors and business people around the world, they see the recent British story as something of a miracle. The jobs figures alone are astounding: 2 million more people are in work – a figure representing many, many personal triumphs. Businesses are starting in record numbers. I really believe David Cameron and George Osborne deserve much of the credit for this incredible turnaround. But back to ten years ago. In 2005 I supported New Labour because they had ended the tyranny of 'or' – the idea that you could only have a strong and growing economy 'or' a fair and compassionate society. New Labour recognised that the one helped pay for the other; healthy tax receipts from business meant more money for schools, hospitals and helping the poorest in our country. Put simply, Tony Blair understood that in order to spend money, you first need to earn money. I'm genuinely concerned that this view isn't shared by the current Labour Party – and that business is viewed as the problem, rather than the essential engine that gives politicians the ability to provide that fair and compassionate society. What's more, they do not seem to understand how businesses work. Take their energy-freeze policy. This betrays a basic misunderstanding of how markets work. Companies would have elevated prices in anticipation of a freeze – and kept them high despite the recent drop in the price of oil. This is just one clumsy intervention that would end up costing people money. The current Government has made it very clear that the UK is open for business and endeavours to make business welcome here. It's vital, because fundamentally, the business world is driven by confidence and positive sentiment. The former Carphone Warehouse boss said Mr Cameron deserved credit for turning around the economy . However, it is very fragile and hard to nurture, and the mobility of the modern business world means a tech firm can start up as easily in Berlin or Silicon Valley as they can in London, so they're not going to pick a place which they perceive will make it hard for them to thrive. We need a government that backs business, not one that views us as cartoon capitalists; a necessary evil to bring in money at best; the embodiments of greed at worst. Because the truth is the vast majority of those working in business are trying to build something good and to employ more people. There is such a thing as turning an honest profit. The man running a local bakery and employing ten people is a capitalist. The woman starting up a tech firm in her attic is a capitalist. These people are doing our economy and our society a service. They are not to be stigmatised but backed. I'm backing the Conservatives for this Election as they've shown a determination to stick to the course even when the tide of opinion was turning against them. A couple of years ago, a chorus of voices were urging George Osborne to change direction. He ignored them, the plan paid off, and now those same people are patting him on the back for his resolve. I like what they've done for small businesses too. Everyone's got to start somewhere. I started selling mobile phones from my flat. And in the age of the start-up, government has to make life easier for people to get going. He said the current Labour Party, under Ed Miliband, viewed business as the problem, rather than the essential engine that gives politicians the ability to provide that fair and compassionate society . I was speaking to an Italian contact recently who told me that anyone starting a small business in Italy gets sucked into a quagmire of bureaucracy, treated like some massive enterprise with their own accounting department. He couldn't believe that in Britain you could get online and register your company in a few short steps – and that is to the Conservatives' credit. Most of all I like the confidence that is growing in our economy. What the economist Keynes called 'animal spirits'; what used to be called the feel-good factor; whatever you call it, that can-do feeling has been returning. Economic success isn't decided on high, it is the collective result of millions of people feeling that we are heading in the right direction; willing to take chances and work hard to succeed. This confidence has returned, beyond doubt – but we must make no mistake, it is a very fragile thing. Indeed, it still hasn't returned to many of our near neighbours. I'm not a party loyalist and I have never donated money to any party. But on this occasion I really felt I had to speak out as our economic recovery truly hangs in the balance. For me the choice is clear. And it is not a choice between backing business on the one hand and promoting fairness on the other. There is nothing progressive about attacking business and undermining our economy. If the economy fails, frankly it is not the richest who suffer, it's the poorest. It would be a huge and tragic irony if well-meaning people ended up hurting the most deprived in our country. But that is what I fear would happen with a Labour-SNP government – one that is anti-business, anti-aspiration and pro-spending money we haven't even earned yet. It comes down to this: we have come a long way in the past five years. Clawing our way out of recession has meant a lot of hard work and sacrifice. We are rounding the corner and really getting somewhere as a country – and we would be crazy to throw it all away now.","Charles Dunstone backed Labour in 2005 election, but now supports Tories .

"An international panel of scientists will today launch a major inquiry to discover whether official world temperature records have exaggerated the extent of global warming. The panel, convened by the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), the ‘climate sceptic’ think-tank led by the former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson, will focus on thousands of ‘adjustments’ that have been made to temperature records kept at individual weather stations around the world. Sceptics have argued that the effect of such adjustments – made when instruments are replaced or recalibrated, or heat-producing buildings are erected close to weather station sites – has skewed the records. Sceptics: The panel will look at whether 'adjustments' made to temperature records around the world have made climate change appear worse - or whether they actually manage to cancel each other out . The panel will also examine ‘extrapolations’ – when the records include virtual figures from places where there is no actual measuring station, instead basing them on the figures of other stations in the same region. In some areas, such as the Arctic, these may be hundreds of miles away. Sceptics claim that the effect of the adjustments is usually to revise temperatures from decades ago downwards, and to increase recent readings, so that the warming trend of the past 150 years looks larger than it really is. The panel has been drawn from leading universities around the world, and includes scientists with widely differing views on climate change. Panel member Professor William van Wijngaarden, a physicist and climate expert from York University in Toronto, said he had been concerned about the records’ quality for many years, after noticing that when you examined an individual station ‘you’ll see a sudden jump’. Such jumps, he said, were not natural, but the product of adjustments. ‘Sometimes you get “corrected” data without knowing exactly how it has been changed. I’m a scientist. I’m not going into this with any preconceptions. But if some of the corrections have not been properly made, then we’ll find out. We want to see all the actual station data.’ Dr Benny Peiser, the GWPF director, said the panel would try to look at all the thousands of stations whose data goes into the three main world temperature records – those kept by the Met Office, Nasa, and the US government agency that deals with weather. Tensions: The group have brought together people from all sides of the debate to look into the problem, and is asking as many people as possible to hand data over. Pictured: Climate change protest . ‘The question is, do the adjustments balance each other out?’ he asked. ‘Do they make half the stations a little warmer, and half a little cooler, or is there evidence of bias? ‘It may turn out there is no problem. It may that there is.’ He said the panel’s work would be ‘transparent’, with all data made available though a public website. The panel’s chairman is Professor Terence Kealey, former vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham. He said: ‘While we believe that the 20th Century warming is real, we are concerned by claims that the actual trend is different from – or less certain than – has been suggested. ‘We hope to perform a valuable public service by getting everything out into the open. ‘We hope that people who are concerned with the integrity of climate science, from all sides of the debate, will help us to get to the bottom of these questions by telling us what they know about the temperature records and the adjustments made to them.’","Climate sceptic group Global Warming Policy Foundation launch inquiry .

"Last week Qatar's Constellation Group sensationally snapped up a majority stake in the company that owns Claridge's, the Connaught and the Berkeley Hotel. The eye-catching purchase was just the latest made by the Qatari ruling family, who for the past eight years have been quietly buying up prestigious properties – including the Shard – in an attempt to win a place in the British Establishment. They now boast a property portfolio worth an estimated £740 million, and have spent £11.6 billion collecting trophy assets in the UK. Just last week their sovereign wealth fund snapped up Canary Wharf for £2.6 billion. Last year, the oil-rich country became the first commercial sponsor of Royal Ascot.

"One Direction star Niall Horan has led the tributes to BBC broadcaster Colin Bloomfield who has died from skin cancer, aged just 33. Bloomfield, who worked at BBC Radio Derby for 10 years as a presenter, reporter and Derby County commentator, died at a hospice near his hometown of Shrewsbury yesterday morning. Fellow broadcasters have paid tribute to the 'perfect colleague' and ‘consummate professional’ whose positive outlook on life made him such a popular figure. And Derby County supporter Niall Horan, who is one quarter of boyband One Direction, has also described Bloomfield as a ‘super great guy and great commentator’. Hugely popular BBC Derby broadcaster Colin Bloomfield has died aged 33 after battling skin cancer . One Direction star and Derby County supporter Niall Horan (pictured together) was among the first to pay tribute to Bloomfield, who passed away yesterday at a hospice in Shrewsbury following a battle with cancer . The star, who has met Bloomfield several times, said on Twitter: 'Sad to hear to hear of the passing of Colin Bloomfield. He was a super great guy and great commentator. 'And had a huge passion for Derby county, he will be sadly missed around the ground, condolences to his family and friends.' Bloomfield lost his battle with cancer after it spread around his body from a cancerous mole. The malignant melanoma was removed from his leg 10 years ago but returned in 2013 and last year he was given only months to live. Heartbroken colleagues paid tribute to the talented broadcaster following the news he had passed away at 7.05am yesterday. Radio Derby's editor Simon Cornes said: 'Reporter, producer, commentator, presenter - Colin was all of those. 'You're lucky in radio if you're good at one of these things but Colin's talent was a rare one and he was extraordinarily accomplished at all of them. He made it seem easy. We know it isn't. 'If you were designing the perfect colleague you'd come up with Colin. His modesty was disarming but it was his warmth and his positive attitude to life that made him so popular with everyone at Radio Derby. 'We've lost our friend but it's a mark of the man that so many of our listeners feel they've lost their friend too. All of us are going to miss him dreadfully.' Bloomfield (pictured with fellow broadcasters Ant and Dec) died early yesterday morning at the age of 33 . Dozens left emotional tributes to Bloomfield on Twitter last night, including Niall Horan from One Direction, Burton Albion manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and glamour model  Maria Fowler . Derby County spokesman Colin Gibson, who had worked with Bloomfield at BBC Radio Derby, said: 'As a broadcaster he was the consummate professional. 'He could be - at one time - eulogising about what was happening at Neighbours and the next turn he'd being interviewing the prime minister and he would do them both brilliantly. He could really turn his hand to anything. 'His bravery during his fight with cancer had to be admired, preferring always to talk about the Rams or his beloved Shrewsbury Town rather than the pain he was going through.' Derby County president Sam Rush said: 'He will be sadly missed by everyone at Derby County Football Club as we had a tremendous working relationship with him. 'He can only be described as an inspirational individual and both a wonderful and humble young man.' At Derby's match away at Millwall yesterday that finished 3-3, Rams' supporters chanted his name, singing 'there's only one Colin Bloomfield'. And as Shrewsbury Town won promotion to League One after beating Cheltenham Town 1-0, the Shrewsbury players revealed t-shirts paying tribute to Bloomfield. Posting the tribute on its official Twitter page later, the club accompanied a picture of the players with: 'FOR THE FANS: Shrewsbury Town players don shirts with Colin Bloomfield and Lloyd Burton on!' Lloyd Burton, a young supporter of the club, also lost his battle with cancer this week. As Shrewsbury Town won promotion to League One after beating Cheltenham Town 1-0 yesterday, the Shrewsbury players revealed T-shirts paying tribute to Bloomfield and young supporter Lloyd Burton, who also passed away from cancer this week. The T-shirts read: 'For you Lloyd Burton and Chris Bloomfield' (pictured) Also paying tribute was fellow broadcaster Jake Humphrey, who wrote on Twitter: 'Devastated Colin Bloomfield has lost his fight. Ten minutes on the phone to him and you were walking on air all day.' Henry Winter, from the Daily Telegraph, added: 'RIP Colin Bloomfield. Hugely respected BBC football commentator and presenter. Only 33. Thoughts with his family, friends and colleagues.' And broadcaster Mike Sewell said: 'Extremely sad to hear that broadcaster Colin Bloomfield has passed away. Life is precious and at times cruelly short. RIP.' Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, manager of League Two side Burton Albion, wrote: 'I might add deeply saddened by the untimely death of the very popular BBC presenter Colin Bloomfield.' Maria Fowler, a glamour model and former The Only Way Is Essex star who grew up in Derby, also paid tribute to Bloomfield. In a series of messages, she said: 'I've just heard the news and am so so sad. Rest in Peace Colin Bloomfield. A truly brave and amazing man. You were amazing. I'm so sad. 'I'm so so sad. You were so brave Colin and now with the Angels. You will be so missed by everyone in Derby.' And Bloomfield's former colleague Jonno Baker wrote: 'Rest In Peace to my friend and the bravest man I've ever known. You were an incredible person.' Bloomfield (pictured) had set up a charity appeal prompted by his diagnosis which has so far raised £60,000 . These were the last tweets written by Colin Bloomfield, who passed away at a hospice near Shrewsbury today . Bloomfield's most recent battle with melanoma started in September 2013, but he was no stranger to the disease having first encountered it in 2001. A cancerous mole was operated on and turned out to be a malignant melanoma. Five years later, in 2006, he was given the all-clear. But in May 2013, he discovered a lump on his groin. Since then he had been undergoing various treatments and initially that helped shrink some of the tumours in his brains and lungs. However, further scans in the last few weeks revealed the tumours in his brain were increasing in size and earlier this month, he went to a hospice near his home town of Shrewsbury. After a courageous fight, he lost his final battle at 7.05am yesterday morning. A charity appeal prompted by his diagnosis has so far raised  £60,000 in just over two months. The money will be used to make hundreds of schools in Derbyshire and East Staffordshire 'sun safe', by educating youngsters about skin cancer prevention.","BBC Radio Derby broadcaster died in hospice at 7.05am yesterday morning .

"Comedian Dom Joly proved he still had work to do on his diving despite training from Tom Daley, after making a real splash in the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race in Brazil. The 47-year-old was invited to join other international celebrity guests onboard boats in the six-strong fleet for the start of the sixth leg, from Itajaí to Newport, Rhode Island, U.S. As the fleet headed out of harbour, the guests all jumped off the vessels. Joly, who is also a travel writer, shone with a flying leap off race leaders Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing's boat, skippered by his compatriot, Ian Walker. Dom Joly soars like a bird as he leaps from the yacht in Brazilian waters . But the action turns more into a jump than a dive as the water comes nearer . It's feet first on this one as the comedian plunges into the depths . Earlier, Joly said he was a dab hand at diving after being trained in the sport by Britain's Olympic medallist, Tom Daley, for TV show Splash! However this jump was more 'tourist abroad' than diving expert. The daredevil Joly earlier climbed the 30-metre (100-foot) mast of the racing boat for a special 'selfie' pic before it set out to sea. The Volvo Ocean Race started last October from Alicante, Spain and is currently in its sixth leg. It will visit 11 ports in total and cover 38,739 miles before finishing in Gothenburg, Sweden, on June 27. The comedian and travel writer joined up with team Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing for the world yacht race . Dom Joly climbed the mast for an impressive selfie in Brazil - but then claimed he was stuck . The boats are expected to take around 17-20 days to reach Newport, the seventh port to host the race. No British sailor has won the 41-year-old race, which was originally launched in Portsmouth as the Whitbread Round the World Race. The race started on October 4, 2014, day of the first In-Port Race in Alicante, Spain, and will finish with one last In-Port Race on June 27, 2015 in Gothenburg, the Swedish home of Volvo. Dom Joly is pictured walking out with the rest of the Abu Dhabi team . The 38,739-nautical mile route will include stopovers in Cape Town (South Africa), Abu Dhabi (UAE), Sanya (China), Auckland (New Zealand), Itajaí (Brazil), Newport (Rhode Island, US), Lisbon (Portugal) and Lorient (France). A 24-hour pit-stop in The Hague is scheduled between France and Sweden.

"It's legal just one day a year, and this Anzac Day Australians took advantage of the opportunity to play the century-old tradition of two-up in pubs and clubs all around the country. The game, which dates back to Australia's goldfields and the first recorded games are believed to have taken place in the late 1790s, made a resurgence as a way to pass time in the trenches. On Saturday, as Aussies commemorated the centenary of the landing at Gallipoli, thousands of men and women took their chances with the coin game in the spirit of the diggers. After participating in dawn services and memorial services to remember the sacrifice and bravery of those who landed at Gallipoli in 1915, and to honour all other active and returned servicemen and women, the crowds wandered down to their local RSL or pub to take part in the game of chance. Up and down the country men and women, most with a beverage in hand, were yelling 'heads' or 'tails' as coins were thrown in the air. While the game is considered a form of gambling and is illegal at all other times, two-up is allowed on ANZAC Day across Returned Servicemen League clubs (RSL) and pubs. Versions vary between the original two-coined game (with three outcomes) and three-coined version (with two outcomes), the latter preferred by many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters. Wagering expert Damian Deguara, who writes for website The Great Tip Off, told Daily Mail Australia that: 'It's that one time of the year when the law permits men and women across this great country of ours to follow in the footsteps of our brave Aussie diggers and keep to the old gambling tradition.' 'Two Up is a pretty simple game, all you need are coins, a wooden stick (the kip) to flip them into the air and a crowd of screaming punters yelling ""heads"" or ""tails"". 'Most punters have their corner, you are either a heads punter, a tails punter or someone who goes with either depending on your intuition.' Scroll down for video .

"Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness. After surgery, the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened, and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning. For some women, the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent, which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects – including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue – can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. But experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called EndoPredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £2,500, although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the NHS. Surgeon Hemant Singhal said: 'I think there is a good case for the NHS to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy.' Professor Kefah Mokbel, consultant breast surgeon at St George's Hospital, London, said: 'With this test we can help patients make an informed choice, whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone.' Becca Cornford, a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11, six and four, was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence . She said: 'I dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy. I was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children.' Professor Mokbel operated on Becca in December at the Princess Grace Hospital, London, and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the EndoPredict. A low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds. 'I could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return,' she says. 'There is no treatment that places your chances at zero. But if you have regular monitoring, there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early.'","Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests .

'Excited': She marked her return to work by apologizing for her 'hurtful' actions and has asked fans for a second chance . Making amends: The post continued on a second page, she said it is never acceptable to speak to someone else in that manner . She's back! The 28-year-old has been reinstated as an ESPN sports reporter after being filmed attacking tow clerk Gina Michelle (right) for her looks and social status in a video the sparked mass outrage . 'My remarks were completely out of line. Under no circumstances is it ever acceptable to speak to another human being in the manner in which I chose that night. 'That's not who I am as a person and hope those who only know me from this incident will give me a second chance to prove to you how much I value integrity, character and treating people with respect.' She has appeared intermittently on Sports Center providing updates from Nassau Colosseum. McHenry's car had been towed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Virginia, where she left it overnight on Easter Weekend. When she picked it up, infuriated, she resorted to insulting the employee's looks, intelligence, and social status. But despite viewers' calls for harsher punishment, the network has reinstated the 28-year-old to her role with a spot on SportsCenter this weekend. Confirming the news to Sports Illustrated, senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said: 'She knows she made a mistake. She’s owned up to it. I think she is just really anxious to get back to work.' Vantage point: She uploaded an image from her seat during the game . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry was suspended for one week after the April 6 video surfaced . Markman insisted 'she has a lot of potential as a reporter', adding, 'she is young, she’s learning some things, but I really do believe in her.' He continued: 'We had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard. She knows that, and especially at the beginning. 'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn’t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office, where clerk Gina Michelle was stood behind the counter. 'I’m in the news, sweetheart, I will f*****g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying  in the video. Michelle can be heard warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding: 'That’s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . Warning: Since Britt McHenry's outburst, this sign has been placed on the door of the Chinese restaurant . Scene of the tirade: This is the towing yard in Arlington, VA, where McHenry's abusive rant happened . Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money… with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Although she issued an apology on Twitter, the sportscaster did not approach Michelle directly. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further . At first, McHenry tweeted insisting she had been in the right. But that post was deleted within hours. Employees at the beer hall-cum-Chinese-restaurant Hunan Number One told Daily Mail Online the sports reporter left her car in the parking lot overnight despite clear signs on the door that cars will be towed, warning bar-goers that the restaurant would not be responsible 'if your car is towed from the parking lot'. The venue, which features 'happy hour' from 11am until 9pm, was described by enthusiastic patrons as a prime 'pre-game' spot and online reviewers as a beloved dive bar. Hunan Number One, offers sushi, hot-wings and other bar food, along with 32oz draft beers for around $8, five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine, served up in front of big screen TVs playing sports. When the bar shuts at 2am, the private towing company, Advanced Towing, within minutes began removing cars in concurrence with a rule on the private lot. The firm showed magnanimity, saying it did not want McHenry to suffer. In a statement Advanced Towing said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature. At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry. 'As a small regulated business, we saw no benefit to releasing the video, except to highlight personal attacks employees in jobs like towing, public parking enforcement and others sometimes encounter.

"Comedian Jenny Eclair travelled with her other half on a Painting In Venus break with Flavours . There comes a time in a woman’s life when beach holidays just don’t cut it any longer, when lying on golden sands (unless you’re buried up to your neck) serves only to remind you how much weight you forgot to lose again this year and how ill-fitting your swimming costume is. Being control freaks, most fifty-something females find ‘doing nothing’ a bit boring – after all, there are only so many hours one can spend on a Kindle, and woman cannot live by fiction alone. This is the time when the ‘alternative holiday experience’ tickles your holiday tastebuds and you find yourself looking at brochures for Nordic cruises. Excellent! Everyone looks fat pointing at a fjord while wearing an Aran jumper. But apart from choosing chilly destinations such as the Arctic or Scarborough, your other non-lolling-about option is the ‘activity holiday’, which can range from Pilates to kayaking, or painting to pottery. Yes, I’ve crossed over: the world is divided into those who still want to ‘give it large’ in Ibiza, and those who want to find their ‘inner artist’. An excursion to Venice one day provided inspiration for the budding artists . I’m in the latter camp – and I’ve got the paintings to prove it. Over the past year, I have found enormous pleasure, not in shoe shops, but in the haberdashery department of Peter Jones, or any shop that supplies art materials. I’ve developed a yearning to be creative. I wanted to do something in my spare time that saved my sanity, lowered my blood pressure (without going to the gym), soothed my soul and, with any luck, provided some cheap Christmas presents. Cooking has never been my thing, I’m an enthusiastic but rubbish knitter, but I did do A-level Art, so I decided I fancied being taught how to master watercolours while simultaneously having a holiday somewhere nice. Bingo! Last autumn I found myself spending a week in Treviso, just outside Venice, with a nine-strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks. Now before I go any further, I have to warn any single ladies that if you’re looking for hanky-panky, the Italian painting/cooking holiday combo may not provide rich pickings. With the exception of the painting tutor, Scotsman Hugh, and my other half Geof, we were middle-aged women to the core. Fabulous, hilarious, slightly eccentric middle- aged, middle-class women with plenty of pashminas and photos of dogs on our iPhones! Jenny stayed at the Villa Bianchi, a comfortable farmhouse surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both Treviso and Venice . For seven days, we painters were patiently guided by Hugh through the basics of sketching, paint technique, colour and form, while the cooks stayed in the kitchen making our meals. I know who picked the short straw. But then, as they say, it’s horses for courses. The cooks wanted to chop vegetables into smithereens, while we artists wanted to sit in a medieval market town with a paintbrush in one hand and a glass of prosecco in the other. Of course, it wasn’t all work. Two days into the break, our holiday operator Flavours herded us all into minibuses and took us to Venice. Like schoolchildren with credit cards, we roamed the most beautiful city in the world and came home, inspired by its mind-boggling loveliness, with lots of photos to copy into our art books back at our base, Villa Bianchi. Staying in Treviso, just outside Venice, Jenny stayed in a nine-strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks . Although it was in the middle of nowhere, the farmhouse was comfortable, surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both Treviso and Venice. The grounds were meticulously kept and the garden featured a very attractive landscaped pool. Being the only couple, Geof and I had a separate annexe to ourselves. It might have looked a bit garage-like from the outside, but inside it was large and comfortable and contained a small kitchen (handy if the cooks in the main house aren’t up to scratch). Accommodation in the main villa was simple but stylish, whistle-clean, and with lots of bold splashes of colour and squishy sofas. Outside, a covered colonnaded area meant we could paint outdoors even when the weather turned. In terms of relaxation, the holiday ticked all the right boxes – Geof and I had a completely stress-free break, and other people did the cooking. How marvellous is that? There was no need to feel anxious about restaurant bills as the food and drink were entirely inclusive, even when went out on day trips to Venice and Treviso. As for our artistic endeavours, Geof cheated, having been at art school in the 1960s. Heavenly backdrop: Church of Santa Maria Della Salute at dusk, Venice, just one of the Venetian sights that provided inspiration in the historic city . He quickly became the teacher’s pet, which was slightly infuriating (although secretly I was rather proud of him). And me? Well, I definitely found my inner artist. Unfortunately she’s a bit gaudy and rather heavy-handed on the colour front, but if you like your paintings slightly vulgar, then I’m happy to take commissions (prices on application). So, well done to Flavours. Thanks to you, a ratty, tired old couple came home with a some rather special holiday memories. Now, I’m not saying that any of mine are going on the wall, but a couple of Geof’s might make it into frames. In the meantime, I’m still doing it. My palette, brushes and delicious selection of multi-coloured pans (the little blocks of paint) are always to hand. I love the ritual of it. I like the way my breathing slows down when I have a brush in my hand. I might not be very good at painting but painting is very good for me.

"In the midst of the family's fighting and different claims, Bobby Brown has made a bold move. According to a Saturday report by NBC affiliate 11Alive, the 46-year-old singer has filed for guardianship over daughter Bobbi Kristina's estate. This news comes just days after the 22-year-old's loved ones were split over whether she had awoken from her coma as her father had claimed. Scroll down for video . Bold move: Bobby Brown has filed for guardianship over daughter Bobbi Kristina's estate according to a Saturday report from NBC affiliate 11Alive . Bobby was spotted earlier this week spending time at the DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur, Georgia, where his daughter is being cared for. The daughter of Whitney Houston was recently moved from Emory University Hospital - where she had been treated since being found unresponsive on January 31 - so she could be provided with long term care. While over the weekend Bobby claimed his daughter was awake, her maternal grandmother Cissy Houston clarified to People on Monday that her granddaughter 'is no longer in a medically induced coma' but is not awake nor expected to ever fully recover. Fight for her life: The 22-year-old was found unconscious on January 31 (pictured in October 2012) Bobby, shocked fans on Saturday by revealing that 'Bobbi is awake,' during a Dallas concert last Saturday. And on Monday, the former New Edition hitmaker released an official statement about his child writing: 'Bobbi Kristina's condition has changed and there has been improvement.' While Bobby remains adamant his daughter is awake, his ex-wife's 81-year-old mother has insisted her one time son-in-law is being far too optimistic, saying that even though Bobbi is no longer in a coma, she is irreversibly brain damaged and said that only a miracle could save her. In a new statement, Cissy said: 'I have just returned from visiting my granddaughter Bobbi Kristina in the hospital and while she is no longer in a medically induced coma, she has a tracheotomy and according to the doctors she has global and irreversible brain damage and remains unresponsive. Family bonds: The 46-year-old singer recently claimed at his concert last Saturday that his daughter - pictured together in an Instagram from Bobbi in June of last year - was 'awake' 'Meeting with the doctors and understanding that she can live in this condition for a lifetime truly saddens me. 'We can only trust in God for a miracle at this time. Keep us in your prayers.' A family source told TMZ: 'They have no idea where Bobby Brown is getting his information that Bobbi Kristina is awake, not do they know why Tina said she's awake and no longer on life support.' The other side: Bobbi's grandmother Cissy Houston (pictured in June 2012) said that her granddaughter is not awake but is 'is no longer in a medically induced coma but has global and irreversible brain damage and remains unresponsive' Sad update: 'Meeting with the doctors and understanding that she can live in this condition for a lifetime truly saddens me' (pictured in April 2013) Bobby's lawyer Christopher Brown said in a statement: 'Bobbi Kristina’s condition has changed since moving from Emory University Hospital and there has been improvement. Doctors have indicated that she will have a long life. 'However, Bobbi Kristina is presently embarking on a rehabilitation process and the quality of her life will not be known for years to come. We thank everyone that supports Bobbi Kristina and God is hearing our prayers.' On Monday, Bobby's second wife Alicia Etheredge-Brown - who is currently pregnant with the couple's second child - also released a statement about Bobbi Kristina. By her side: The 46-year-old singer and his second wife Alicia Etheredge-Brown released official statements about Bobbi Kristina on Monday (pictured together leaving Emory University hospital on February 6) 'My husband made an attempt to correct the negative comments he must endure on a daily basis from both family and the public regarding his daughter’s medical condition. He is encouraged by the steps that Bobbi Kristina has made since her hospitalization on January 31, 2015. 'She has made it out of ICU, opened her eyes, and started a rehabilitation that will be long and hard. We will hold on to all the blessings GOD gives us to help her at this time and we look forward to her having a relationship with her unborn sister as our family grows in love and faith.' Adding: 'I just wish my husband could deal with this most painful and difficult time with people surrounding him who fully support and pray for Bobbi Kristina’s recovery and only her recovery. Life is the most precious thing that we all have.' 'My husband made an attempt to correct the negative comments': Alicia - who is currently pregnant with the couple's second child - tried to clarify Bobby's statements (pictured April 16) Brown family: Bobbi Kristina's aunt Tina Brown took to her Facebook page echoing a similar statement of Bobby's on Saturday, that has since been taken down . Bobbi Kristina's aunt Tina Brown took to her Facebook page echoing a similar statement of Bobby's on Saturday, that has since been taken down. 'So many messages, sorry can't answer them all right now but I will get to them later..just allow me this time with my family,,yes,she woke up and is no longer on life support!!!!!:):)God is good!!thanks for your prayers,,still a process,but she is going to be ok (sic).' In March, the only daughter of Whitney and Bobby was moved from Emory University hospital - where she stayed for two months - to a rehabilitation facility in Atlanta. Her legacy: Bobbi Kristina is the only child of the late icon who was found face down and unresponsive in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on February 11, 2012 (pictured just days before her death) In late February, her doctors attempted to take out of her medically induced coma but she began having violent seizures and was placed back on life support. Bobbi Kristina's mother Whitney was found face down and unresponsive in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on February 11, 2012. Autopsy concluded that the 48-year-old icon had accidentally drowned and listed heart disease and cocaine as contributors to her death.","Bobby Brown has filed for guardianship over his daughter's estate .

"This is the moment that an enormous bird of prey launched itself from a roof onto a birdwatcher's head. The rogue European eagle owl has been terrorising the Dutch town of Noordeinde for months and is believed to be behind a spate of vicious attacks. Locals have been advised to arm themselves with umbrellas against the bird, as hoards of twitchers have flocked to the Netherlands hoping to catch a sighting of the impressive bird. Scroll down for video . The enormous bird of prey targeted the blonde-haired woman after launching itself from the roof of a nearby house . Bird brain: The European eagle owl spent around one minute perched on the woman's head, before flying off looking for its next perch. In the most recent incident, the bird was caught on camera showing off its wingspan as it soared from the roof of a house. A woman, who had been observing the creature, barely had time to pull her hood up before the eagle-owl swooped on her head. The wild owl, which weighs around 6lbs, spent around one minute perched her the head, before flying off looking for its next perch. Residents in the town think that it might have escaped from an aviary and has learnt to associate humans with food. 'I have seen photographers and birders from around the country, from The Hague to Spijkenisse, they come from everywhere to see the eagle owl. Our village is finally on the map,' one local is reported to have said. Menno Shaefer is one of a number of photographers who has  paid a visit to the town after hearing about the  owl's unusual behaviour. The 48-year-old, of Zaandam, Netherlands, said: 'I had heard a lot about the owl and decided to visit the site to see it in action for myself.

"Mother-of-two Anna Tilley survived after spending four days in intensive care with blood poisoning, pictured with her son Harry . Patients’ lives are at risk from blood poisoning because hospitals are not implementing a standard treatment that can double their chances of survival, experts have warned. Sepsis, previously known as septicaemia, affects more than 100,000 Britons a year and kills 37,000 – more than breast, bowel and prostate cancer combined. Now a snapshot NHS study reveals that on one surgical ward at a leading teaching hospital, 90 per cent of patients failed to get the correct treatment, involving a simple set of lifesaving measures known as Sepsis Six. After high-profile campaigns in 2013 which exposed the shocking death rates, the method was officially recommended by NHS England. Yet an audit, revealed at the annual president’s meeting of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in March, showed that vital steps in the process are being missed, meaning the condition was more likely to take hold with fatal consequences. The College is now calling for nationwide tracking of the protocol to weed out hospitals that are failing to tackle the problem. Sepsis Six involves blood tests to check for infection; testing the level of lactate, a chemical produced when cells are starved of oxygen; giving oxygen and IV fluids to protect organs and raise dangerously low blood pressure; checking urine hourly to monitor fluid levels and kidney function; and administering antibiotics to clear any underlying infection. The study of 23 patients with sepsis at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary revealed just one in ten had their lactate levels tested. Only 40 per cent were given oxygen, and staff failed to measure urine output in nearly a third of cases. Dr Ron Daniels, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust who helped devise Sepsis Six, warns that, despite being a small sample, the finding of the study was far from unusual. ‘Sadly this and other studies show patients are not getting access to a treatment that saves lives. Every one of the six steps is vitally important, and nothing should be missed out.’ Some 90 per cent of patients were not given correct treatment to prevent blood poisoning on a surgical ward at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, an NHS study revealed . Sepsis occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection, causing multiple organ failure if not treated quickly. It can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body, most commonly the lungs, urinary tract, abdomen and pelvis. It is often a problem that develops while in hospital, after surgery. Those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or cancer are at increased risk. Symptoms include slurred speech, muscle pain, mottled or discoloured skin, poor urine output and severe breathlessness. ‘Delays in the identification and treatment of sepsis can have serious consequences for patients,’ says Dr Seng Wong, who carried out the Edinburgh audit. His research also found Sepsis Six awareness improved after a three-month staff training and a poster campaign. More than half of subsequent patients had their lactate measured, 60 per cent were given oxygen and 90 per cent had their urine measured. Mother-of-two Anna Tilley knows only too well the importance of staff awareness. Four days after Anna developed a sore throat, aches and pains and a high temperature, she was hallucinating, had a mottled rash and was struggling to breathe. ‘My parents carried me to the doctor’s and insisted my GP call an ambulance,’ says Anna. ‘At A&E I waited four hours in a side room. Although I had typical symptoms of sepsis, none of the doctors recognised I was dying.’ The 26-year-old from West Sussex says she was just hours from death when a quick-thinking doctor spotted the danger signs. Anna spent four days in intensive care on oxygen and antibiotics after her liver, kidneys and pancreas all failed. ‘I later learned that without treatment, I would have died in my sleep that night,’ Anna adds. ‘Awareness needs to be raised of this awful condition, which takes so many lives.’","Experts have warned hospitals not using standard treatment for sepsis .

"Spotted: Pippa Middleton is said to have been buying up the mull-cloth nappies in Geneva . With the birth now imminent, relatives of the forthcoming Royal baby will be ready to shower the newborn with expensive gifts from London’s smartest shops. But the Duchess of Cambridge may be in line for a more practical present for her baby – a supply of biodegradable nappies from her sister, Pippa Middleton. At £4 each, the mull-cloth nappies are not cheap and they are yet to really catch on in the UK. But they are all the rage in Europe and Pippa, 31, may have learned of their merits during one of her frequent trips to Switzerland where her boyfriend Nico Jackson lives. Shoppers in Geneva have reported seeing Pippa buying the nappies in a shop there. Most of their appeal comes from the fact that they are made from natural fibres – meaning, unlike conventional nappies, they don’t end up in landfill heaps. Kate is unlikely to be too concerned about their cost but will know that using eco-friendly nappies will please the baby’s grandfather, Prince Charles, a keen environmentalist. Pippa will be aware that Kate adores natural clothing materials. The first photograph taken of Prince George as the family left St Mary’s hospital in London in 2013 showed him wrapped in organic muslin cotton swaddling from a clothing brand Aden + Anais. Pippa has also recently been seen visiting a high-end baby boutique in Geneva where she enquired about a £140 rocking chair. She has also spent a ‘small fortune’ on baby grows from clothing brand Arsène et les Pipelettes, according to an eyewitness. Eco-friendly: The nappies are very popular in Switzerland, but have yet to catch on in the UK . She bought in neutral colours, suggesting that even she has not been told whether Kate is expecting a boy or a girl. Last night supporters of the Duke and Duchess were camped outside the private Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London, where the Duchess is expected to give birth imminently.","Pippa is said to have bought the baby a supply of biodegradable nappies .

"Human traffickers are brazenly offering desperate Libyan migrants passage across the Mediterranean on Facebook. A number of pages, written in Arabic, have reportedly been found on the social media site targeting  refugees fleeing war and poverty.

"George W. Bush 'just stood and took it' when the grieving mother of a dying soldier screamed at him while he paid visit to a military hospital, his former press secretary has revealed. Dana Perino was accompanying the former president as he visited wounded soldiers and their families at the Walter Reed hospital in Washington, D.C. Perino said these regular visits were usually filled with joy, but this particular meeting was one of the exceptions, she wrote in her new book And The Good News Is: Lessons And Advice From The Bright Side. 'The mom was beside herself with grief. She yelled at the president, wanting to know why it was her child and not his who lay in that hospital bed,' Perino wrote in an excerpt published by The Daily Signal. Perino said the woman's husband tried to calm her and that, at first, the president tried to offer the mother some words of comfort before he just 'stood and took it'. Scroll down for video . George W. Bush 'just stood and took it' when the grieving mother of a dying soldier screamed at him while he was paying a visit to a military hospital, his former press secretary Dana Perino has revealed (file photo) She said it was like Bush 'expected and needed to hear the anguish, to try to soap up some of her suffering if he could'. Perino, who served in the Bush administration for seven years, said the president had been in no hurry to leave the soldier's room as the mother screamed at him. And she said it wasn't until they were both back on the president's Marine One helicopter, heading toward the White House, that Bush addressed the incident. 'That mama sure was mad at me,' Perino recalled the president saying as he looked out the window. 'And I don't blame her a bit.' Perino said she then saw 'one tear' fall from the president's eye and down his face, which he didn't wipe away. On that same day at the hospital, Perino said Bush met a young Marine who opened his eyes for the first time while the president was in the room to award him with a Purple Heart. Perino said the family of the Marine, who had been injured when a roadside bomb hit his Humvee, was 'so excited' to see the president and 'gave him big hugs' as they thanked him 'over and over'. After the Marine was presented with the award by a military aide, Perino said his five-year-old son asked the president what a Purple Heart was. Perino said Bush's regular visits to wounded soldiers and their families at the Walter Reed hospital in Washington D.C. were usually filled with joy, but there were also exceptions (file photo) Perino said Bush 'pulled the little boy closer to him' and said 'it's an award for your dad, because he is very brave and courageous, and because he loves his country so much'. 'And I hope you know how much he loves you and your mom too.' Perino said that's when the medical staff noticed the Marine had suddenly opened his eyes. She said the president 'rushed over to the side of the bed' and took the Marine's face 'in his hands' so they could lock eyes. That's when he asked the military aide to present the Marine with the Purple Heart for a second time, Perino said. 'The president had tears dripping from his eyes on the Marine's face. As the presentation ended, the president rested his forehead on the Marine's for a moment'. She said the scene with the Marine, who she would later find out died six days later from his injuries, brought tears to the eyes of everyone in the hospital room that day 'for so many reasons'. 'The sacrifice, the pain and suffering, the love of country,' she said. 'And the witnessing of a relationship between a soldier and his Commander-in-Chief, that the rest of us could never fully grasp.'

"A 26-year-old Mexico native vanished without a trace in Utah a week ago, and now Elizabeth Smart and her father have joined the effort to find the missing woman. Elizabeth Elena Laguna Salgado is from Chiapas, Mexico, and moved to Provo about a month ago to study English. There is no evidence she was kidnapped, but she hasn't made contact with anybody since she disappeared April 16, Provo Police Chief John King said. She usually talked with family in Mexico every day, he said. Where is Elizabeth? Elizabeth Elena Laguna Salgado, 26, from Chiapas, Mexico, was last seen leaving a language school in Provo, Utah, April 16 . Raising awareness: Elizabeth Smart holds a 'missing' poster of Laguna Salgado during a news conference Friday in Sandy, Utah . Mystery: Provo Police Chief John King said Friday that there is no evidence Salgado was kidnapped, but he says they are very worried because she hasn't made contact with anybody for longer than a week . Laguna Salgado's cellphone has been turned off, and there has been no activity on her credit cards or any other sign of where she is or what happened, King said. A volunteer search is scheduled for Saturday morning in Provo. The woman's uncle, Rosemberg Salgado, from California, tearfully begged for help from anyone with information on her whereabouts. He called his niece a ‘beautiful angel’ and an optimistic, spiritual woman who just finished a Mormon mission in Mexico. He said his niece is probably praying and asking God to help her be found. Laguna Salgado was living with roommates in Provo for about a month, her uncle said. Most of her family lives in Mexico. ‘Elizabeth, if you are watching this, please know that we love you and that we are going to be looking for you,’ said Salgado, crying. ‘We won't stop until we find you.’ Asked if his niece mentioned anything odd in recent conversations, Salgado said she told him a boy had been bugging her to go on a date and that she made up having a boyfriend to get rid of him. Spreading the gospel: The 26-year-old woman had just finished a Mormon mission in Mexico. She moved the Provo only a month ago . Last sighting: Salgado was last seen on the afternoon of April 16 leaving the Nomen Global School at 384 West Center Street in Provo . Family's plea: The woman's uncle, Rosemberg Salgado, begged for help from anyone with information on her whereabouts . According to Daily Herald, Police Chief King said there are 'persons of interest,' but police are still interviewing the missing woman's classmates at the Nomen Global Language Center. Kidnapping survivor: Elizabeth Smart was 14 when she was snatched out of her Salt Lake City bedroom in 2002. She was held captive for nine months before being found walking with her captor in a busy street . Smart and her father, who heads Operation Underground Railroad - an organization dedicated to rescuing victims of labor and sex slavery - said they hosted the event to bring attention to the story. Ed and Elizabeth Smart said the the key to finding her in 2004 nine months after she was abducted was that the American public knew her face and her story. Elizabeth Smart was 14 when she was snatched out of her Salt Lake City bedroom in 2002. She was held captive for nine months before being found walking with her captor in a busy street in Sandy — close to where Friday's news conference was held at Rio Tinto Stadium. Smart urged the public to help find Laguna Salgado even though there's no evidence of a kidnapping. ‘Maybe we're wrong, but if we're right then at least we're doing everything we can,' Smart said. 'We really feel someone out there knows where she is or saw her at some point.' Smart recalled what it was like when she was first abducted: ‘It's terrifying. You don't know what's going on. You don't know why it happened to you. You don't know what the future is. You don't know if people are looking for you.’ Salgado was last seen April 16 leaving the Nomen Global School at 384 West Center Street in Provo. Since that time she has not been back to her apartment, shown up for work, or contacted any family members. Over the past week, investigators working the Salgado case have canvassed the route she took to and from school, obtained surveillance videos from business and homes in the area and interviewed known sex offenders living in Provo. Lead: Salgado's uncle said his niece told him a boy had been bugging her to go on a date and that she made up having a boyfriend to get rid of him . Be On the Lookout: Miss Salgado is listed as ‘Missing Endangered’ with the National Crime Information Center. Both the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have been notified of her disappearance .

"A woman made a horrifying discovery when she opened a taped cardboard box labeled 'stuff animals' only to find three puppies covered in urine and suffering from heat exhaustion. The eight-week-old Labradors were found near a Tennessee Goodwill donation site on April 18 without any food or water inside of the box where temperatures were reportedly over 100 degrees. The puppies have worms and are malnourished, and it is likely they have lived their entire lives in a cage, according to McKamey Animal Center where the dogs are being treated. Scroll down for video . Three eight-week old puppies (above) were found inside of a sealed cardboard box on April 18 . The Labradors were found by a woman who said the dogs were covered in urine and suffering from heat exhaustion when they were discovered in the box labeled 'stuff animals' The animals have been named Greta Garbo, Bette Davis and Marilyn Monroe, and have been flourishing since they began treatment, according to ABC. The good Samaritan, who has not been identified, was driving by and saw the box moving when she approached it tearing a hole into the top finding the dogs. 'She said when she opened the box, she could feel the heat come out. They had been there for a while,' Chelsea Fogal, veterinarian at McKamey Animal Center told WTVC. 'It is frustrating when you have someone do something so neglectful and inhumane,' she added. 'But I think these guys really lucked out that someone, a Good Samaritan, came along and found them. 'I think the outcome could have been a lot worse.' The woman then took the puppies to the animal center for treatment. On Facebook, McKamey wrote that the box was securely taped to prevent their escape. McKamey Animal Center in Tennessee, where the dogs have been receiving treatment, said they have worms and are malnourished, and it is likely they have lived their entire lives in a cage . On Facebook, the animal center said the puppies appear to have been neglected over an extended period of time due to their poor condition . 'There was no air ventilation for the puppies and they were covered in urine and suffered from heat exhaustion--the temperature in the box was estimated to be well over 100 degrees,' the center wrote. 'The box had been left at a Goodwill drop off site near HWY 58. The dogs were over heated and covered in urine from a long period of time being inside the box. 'All three dogs are being treated at McKamey Animal Center. 'It would appear they have been neglected over an extended period of time due to their poor condition.' Once the puppies complete their treatment at the center, they will be put up for adoption . An animal service officer investigating the case said they have dozens of leads regarding the incident .

"At his heaviest he tipped the scales at a mind-boggling 70st. But after losing two thirds of his body wight in just five years Paul Mason now faces a new challenge - ridding himself of the unsightly rolls of skin he longer needs. The Brit, from Ipswich, Suffolk, managed to shed a staggering 46st after gastric bypass surgery in 2010 but the NHS have refused to give him an operation to remove his 7st of excess skin. Scroll down for video . Now: Paul Mason, pictured in hospital last month when he was treated for an infection in his leg, once tipped the scales at 70st but has lost 46st in five years . Then: At his largest, the former postman would then eat quadruple portions of fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening . The 54-year-old wanted the surgery done for free but his bid failed after health service bosses said he needed to prove that he could keep the weight off. Despite his monumental weight-shedding feat, Mr Mason has been left with a constant reminder of the size he once was - thanks to the excess skin sagging around his arms, legs and stomach. Speaking after the NHS turned him down in 2012 the former postman told The Mirror: 'The loose skin is having a horrible effect on my life. I can't make any more progress if they don't do these operations.' Mr Mason is now preparing to undergo an operation in the U.S. after plastic surgeon Dr Jennifer Capla, from Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, offered to carry out the procedure free of charge. Speaking to The Mirror, she said: 'I remember seeing an image of him, wheelchair-bound, he couldn't walk. 'To me it was so sad that he had gone through this whole journey and come full circle, and he couldn't even do basic things and no-one would help him.' Turned down by NHS: The 54-year-old wanted the surgery done for free but failed after health service bosses said he needed to prove that he could keep the weight off . Preparing for more surgery: Mr Mason is now preparing to undergo an operation in the U.S. after plastic surgeon Dr Jennifer Capla, from Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, offered to carry out the procedure for free . Road to recovery: Mr Mason, seen walking in hospital in Massachusetts last month, moved to the USA last year to live with his fiance . After an agonising period in which he had to wait for a health visa to be granted, the former world's fattest man flew to Orange, near Boston in September to live with his fiance, Rebecca Mountain. In 2013 Mr Mason appeared on television to tell the world of his blossoming relationship with Ms Mountain. 41-year-old Miss Mountain, who is a slender 8st, asked for his hand in marriage as they appeared live on ABC's The View last year. She first got in touch with Mr Mason on Facebook after she saw a television documentary about his extreme obesity. Appearing on UK breakfast television programme in 2013, in the week they met in person for the first time, she said she 'just felt compelled to reach out and just try to help and that's all it was.' 'I have a lot of drive and just thought I could write letters and support,' she said. 'Things I set my sights on, I just go and do. I just knew that I should try and help. 'He's incredible, a genuine person. Incredibly honest and open about the difficulties he's been through, which helped our relationship.' Former world's fattest man: At the height of his food addiction, he was eating an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs complete with bread and hash browns for breakfast . Found love: In 2013 Mr Mason appeared on television to tell the world of his blossoming relationship with Rebecca Mountain . Mr Mason's binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a deterioration in his mother's health. He quit his job as a postman when his weight stopped him from finishing his rounds. As his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked after full time by council carers. Firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002. Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around. His care bill cost taxpayers an estimated £100,000 a year and is believed to have topped £1million. At the height of his food addiction, he was eating an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs complete with bread and hash browns for breakfast. He would then eat quadruple portions of fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening. Mr Mason finally beat the bulge after an NHS operation to fit him with a gastric band, but his life was left on hold as he waited for further surgery to remove the excess skin it left behind. His latest bout of surgery is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, and Ms Capla will be helped by a large team of doctors, including two surgeons from other states.

"Doctors have condemned a social media campaign which accuses mothers who have a caesarean as being ‘too lazy to have a baby'. The image, which is believed to come from a firebrand American religious group called 'The Disciples of the New Dawn' in the U.S, has been circulating on mother's groups in Australia. University of Sydney's Professor of Gynecology Hans Peter Dietz told Daily Mail Australia the image represents a broader anti-caesarean sentiment which has harmful consequences for women who should be choosing caesareans for health reasons. An offensive image circulating social media which endeavours to shame women who have undergone caesareans . ‘They are suggesting that it's the woman's own fault if she need a caesarean. That’s like saying it’s your fault that have an inflamed appendix, or bowel cancer. It’s plain stupid.’ The world-renowned gynaecologist says a drive to reduce the rates of C-sections is forcing obstetricians to 'act against their own better professional judgment.' ‘While it sits on the the extreme end of the caesarean spectrum, it’s an attitude which is actually widespread in Australia. That’s why I feel it needs to be addressed.’ Professor Dietz said the sharp rise in Caesareans since the 1980’s has triggered a strong movement from people trying to curb the rates. Last year the World Health Organisation said the number of caesarean surgeries needed to drop to 10 to 15 per cent of births . Professor of Gynecology Hans Peter Dietz said the image represents an attitude which is widespread in Australia . ‘The reality is that your average newborn is much bigger now than in the past, and for some women Caesareans are the safest option. It’s downright dangerous to deny women that right.’ Last year the World Health Organisation said the number of caesarean surgeries needed to drop to 10 to 15 per cent of births. It’s believed the anti-caesarean campaign on social media is a bid to pressure mums to into following the WHO appeal.","The image is believed to come from a firebrand American religious group .

"A 73-year-old former soldier has been charged over the death of a man with learning difficulties in Northern Ireland more than 40 years ago. John Pat Cunningham, 27, was shot dead by the Army in a field in Benburb, Co Armagh, in June 1974. Dennis Hutchings, who has been charged with attempted murder, appeared at Omagh Magistrates Court in Co Tyrone today and was released on bail. John Pat Cunningham (pictured left, and right, a photograph held by his nephew Charlie Agnew) was shot by the British Army in a field in 1974. A 73-year-old former soldier has been charged with attempted murder . White-haired Hutchings, of Cawsand, Torpoint in Cornwall, stood solemnly in the dock flanked by a police officer with his arms straight down by his side. The bespectacled man appeared in court wearing navy jeans, trainers, a grey and white-flecked woollen jumper with a navy body-warmer-type jacket. Hutchings was released on bail after speaking only to confirm his identity, date of birth and replied 'I do' when asked if he understood the charge against him. A detective from the PSNI's serious crime branch told the court he believed he could connect him to the charge. Defence solicitor Stephen Clarke requested that reporting restrictions preventing publication of the defendant's name be imposed by the court under human-rights legislation. The 'nature and circumstances' of the offence could raise 'emotive issues', the solicitor claimed. But rejecting the application, District Judge Nigel Broderick said: 'This is an offence which allegedly occurred some time ago.' Releasing Hutchings on bail of £500, the judge also said the principle of open justice was well established in Northern Ireland. 'I am told that Article Two may be engaged but I am not satisfied that there are any justifiable concerns and I must deal with the case as presented,' the judge said. 'I am not minded to make reporting restrictions.' Mr Cunningham, who had the mental age of a child, was running away from an Army patrol when he was shot . The court was told there were no objections to bail subject to four conditions. Hutchings was ordered to surrender his passport and not to contact with any other witnesses. He was arrested in England on Tuesday and was taken to Northern Ireland for questioning by detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland investigating legacy Troubles-related deaths. The case was recently reopened by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and a murder investigation started following a re-examination of the available evidence. Mr Cunningham, who had the mental age of a child between six and 10, had a fear of men in uniform and was running away from an Army patrol when he was killed. The Government apologised for his death in 2013. But earlier this week, Mr Cunningham's family said the investigation did not have their support. The Government apologised for his death in 2013 and the police investigation was re-opened earlier this year . In a statement issued on their behalf by victims campaign organisation the Pat Finucane Centre, a spokesman said: 'Whilst family members have cautiously welcomed the arrest, they have asked the PFC to state categorically that they will only have confidence in an investigative process that is completely independent of the PSNI. 'Cunningham family members said in October 2013 that they wish to see all investigations into British Army killings, including that of John Pat, being investigated by an independent body.' The investigation into the shooting was reopened in March this year. Speaking last month, DI Neil McGuinness of the PSNI said: 'I appreciate this happened more than 40 years ago but I believe there are people in the community today who remember this tragic incident, who knew John Pat and who may have information which would be of assistance to the investigation. 'Our objective is to get to the truth of what happened that Saturday morning so that justice can be served.' Hutchings was excused from appearing at the next court hearing in Dungannon, Co Tyrone, on June 3.

"Set in the grey stones of the Victorian chapel, the red of the two doors makes a bold, slightly unexpected statement. But that distinctive splash of colour is the only clue to the identity of the man who turned this building into a family home. In the early 1970s, Sir Richard Branson brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business. And from then until the present day, the Virgin logo – which has gone on to adorn trains, planes and a multitude of other businesses – has always been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors. Sir Richard Branson converted The Old Chapel in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, into a home in the 1970s . At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at South Leigh in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire. At The Manor, the first Virgin albums, such as Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, were recorded and Branson would use The Old Chapel as a weekend retreat. Other artists using The Manor included Sandy Denny, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and John Cale. 'I saw Richard coming and going into The Old Chapel in the 1970s,' says South Leigh resident Martin Collet, 57. 'I often used to see him in the village pub, The Mason Arms, having a meal with family and friends and he was always very pleasant.' He brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business . The entrepreneur painted the doors of the country retreat his trademark bright red, pictured with Kate Moss . He adds that The Old Chapel wasn't always a complete retreat from Branson's rock 'n' roll world. 'He often had parties there and we heard the music, even though we were four doors away – but it wasn't a problem. I think he only used the house at the weekends, and he was well liked in the village.' Other residents recall that Branson was a regular visitor to the village shop on Sundays, buying breakfast for his overnight visitors. Branson's love affair with this part of Oxfordshire continued after he left The Old Chapel. He owned The Manor until the 1990s and, for two decades, also owned Mill End House in the village of Kidlington, which he sold to his children a few years ago when he moved his base to Necker Island in the Caribbean. 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, who bought it in 2007. 'We haven't had to do much, apart from putting in solid oak flooring and new central heating with Victorian-style radiators.' The four-bedroom home is now on the market for £599,000. At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . The four-bedroom home is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout the building . The village of South Leigh is in the parliamentary constituency of Witney, Prime Minister David Cameron's seat – and the poet Dylan Thomas lived in South Leigh Manor in the 1940s. But the village has another claim to fame, one that relates to The Old Chapel itself. In 1725, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist Church, gave his first sermon in the St James the Great church in the village. It's fitting, then, that a century and a half later, 85 years after Wesley's death, the village came to have a Wesleyan Methodist chapel of its own – the very property that Branson would one day end up converting. Price: £599,000 . Location: South Leigh, Oxfordshire . Bedrooms: Four . Unique features: Converted by Sir Richard Branson; former Wesleyan chapel in the village where John Wesley gave his first sermon . At the time of his first sermon, Wesley was studying at Oxford University. The Jacobean pulpit in St James the Great bears a plaque commemorating the sermon, which is reputed to have lasted two-and-a-half hours. 'We were looking for a property in South Leigh as we had friends in the area,' says recently separated Rowan, 50 – a management consultant with two children, Jacob, 15, and Nancy, 13. 'We fell in love with the house the moment we saw it.' Rowan only found out Branson had been a previous owner on his second viewing. 'That undoubtedly increased our interest, especially when we realised what an excellent job he had done converting it into a home, without losing too many of its original features,' said Rowan. 'And the house ticked all the boxes for us. It has lots of space and is conveniently located for the A40, with good access to London.' At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, pictured is the kitchen . The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden . The building is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout it. Features that Branson added include pine banisters and large round windows offering views across surrounding countryside. The property has an en suite and family bathroom, and the master bedroom overlooks the back garden. A studio room could be used as an office or fifth bedroom. The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden. A kitchen and third reception room complete the accommodation. 'We have the benefit of open space, yet it is still cosy and warm due to a large woodburner in one of the reception rooms,' says Rowan. 'I'll definitely miss the place.' Rowan is moving to Witney so that his children can be closer to their schools and friends.","Sir Richard Branson converted The Old Chapel into a home in the 1970s .

"A veteran has described the hurt he felt after being disrespected by a mob of University of Florida fraternity members during a charity weekend that honors wounded heroes in Panama Beach City. The Zeta Beta Tau fraternity was suspended Friday and charged with obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft, causing physical or other harm, and damage to property for allegedly disrespecting disabled veterans by spitting on them, shouting verbal abuse and even urinating on the American flag. The deplorable behavior against the ex-servicemen occurred at the Warrior Beach Retreat on April 17. 'They actually spat on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts,' wounded veteran Nicholas Connole, who served 18 months in Afghanistan and nine months in Iraq, told WJHG. 'I come and I feel honored and I feel safe and that I belong, but now I feel like I'm defending myself.' Scroll down for video . 'Hurt': Nicholas Connole, a wounded veteran who served 18 months in Afghanistan and nine months in Iraq, said both he and his dog were spat on by university students in Panama Beach City for a spring formal . Disrespected: The soldier, seen here with his wife, said he felt like he had to 'defend himself' against the students, who threw beers and spat from their balconies . Scene: The students were staying here at the Warrior Beach Retreat. The abuse occurred mostly when servicemen were walking past . Allegations: Students from Zeta Beta Tau at both the University of Florida (pictured) and Emory University have been accused of disrespecting the ex-servicemen during the Warrior Beach Retreat in Panama City on April 17. It is not know whether anyone in this picture was involved . Linda Cope, founder of the Warrior Beach Retreat, says she's never seen such disgusting behavior. 'They're a total disgrace for our military,' she told the network. 'They were urinating on the American flag they were throwing things off of the balconies.' The veterans were staying at the Lake Town Wharf Resort and the students were in town for their spring formal. 'I have not stood up and said anything about spring break because we constantly want to get the support of the community, but if this is at all indicative of what these college students do we need to get rid of it,' said Cope. 'Disgusting': Linda Cope, founder of the warrior group, says the frat members were urinating on flags and verbally abusive . Happier times: Nicholas Connole is seen here proposing to his now-wife in a photo from his Facebook. The returned soldier was wounded while serving, but was abused while attending a charity event . Emory University have now finally commented on the incident. In a statement a spokesman said that while they were 'appalled' at what happened, there was 'no evidence  found to implicate Emory students in these reported incidents'. 'If any members of our community are identified as being responsible, they will be held accountable for their actions by the university,' the statement continued. Hope said that the statement was a 'slap in the face to veterans'. 'There were too many students from Emory for none of them to be involved,' she said. 'It is hard for me to believe that no Emory student was a part of this.' According to reports the police were called and the hotel security responded. They managed to get the situation under control and some of the students involved were thrown out of the hotel, but no arrests were made. Haley Riley, who was attending the event with her wounded husband, said beer bottles were thrown at them and students threw up in the elevators. About 60 veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan were also attending a retreat that has been held twice a year for the past six years at the resort. Cope started the event in honor of her son Joshua, who lost both legs in Baghdad in 2006 when a roadside bomb exploded under his Humvee. Zeta Beta Tau International confirmed that three members of the University of Florida chapter have been expelled from the fraternity and both university chapters have suspended all activities. However they are still investigating what has happened. The branch at the campus in Gainsville, Florida, is already under 'conduct probation' following an alleged hazing incident. A spokesman representing the nationwide fraternity said: 'Early this week our Fraternity was made aware of reports regarding an incident between several members of two of our chapters and veterans of the Warrior Beach Retreat during independent trips to Panama City Beach. 'While the details of their actions are still under investigation, there is no doubt that some of our members engaged in ugly and unacceptable behavior. Their actions have no place in ZBT or anywhere, and they will not be tolerated. Repercussions: Three members of the University of Florida chapter have been expelled. The branch was already under conduct probation following an alleged hazing incident . 'On behalf of our entire organization, I want to apologize to veterans, both those who were in Panama City Beach, and those who have felt the pain from afar, as well as to their families and all who support the Warrior Beach Retreat and had worked to make it a positive and meaningful occasion for attendees. 'I am deeply saddened that the actions of our members ruined this special event and failed to show the respect our military and their families so deserve. 'As we continue our investigation, our chapters at the University of Florida and Emory University have suspended all activities and are fully cooperating in our investigation. In addition, we have already expelled three members of the University of Florida chapter from our organization who we found to have been behaving inappropriately, and we will take any further action necessary as we learn more. 'Our Fraternity also has issued an apology on behalf of all of our members to the Warrior Beach Retreat, the organization that was hosting the veterans to provide them and their families with the opportunity to relax and recharge. 'We are honored that hundreds of our ZBT brothers have served in the military and are disgusted that certain members of our Fraternity failed to exhibit the behaviors we expect from them towards our nation's heroes — respect, gratitude and honor. 'We are committed to fully addressing the events that took place, and will be hiring an independent investigator to help us gather all of the facts. Short-term, we are actively working with the resort, with the Presidents of both universities and with the local police to fully understand the events that took place. In all instances, we have a zero tolerance policy towards this type of behavior and are committed to appropriately disciplining any members of our Fraternity who were involved. 'We also look forward to working with our members to make amends for this disgraceful situation by identifying opportunities to serve those who have done so much to serve us.' University of Florida President Kent Fuchs has personally apologized for the behavior of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity members toward the veterans. Probe: Officials at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, has deplored the actions and is investigating whether any of their students were involved. However they are yet to find any evidence tying the branch's fraternity members to the deplorable behavior in Panama City . In an email to Cope, he wrote: 'The incidents and behavior you and others have described (in letters and phone calls) and the offense to the wounded warriors and other guests are unacceptable. 'We are pursuing an investigation of the matter to learn more about the involvement of University of Florida students and whether disciplinary action will be needed.' Cope responded by saying: 'I said do your investigating, but I want to know what you're going to do. What are you going to do? I think they all should be put on probation. I'm hoping that this will make a dramatic change in their life to realize they do not need to take the sacrifice and the service of these men and women in vain.' The fraternity's mission statement on its website reads: 'Mindful of its founding in 1898 as the Nation's first Jewish Fraternity, ZBT will preserve and cultivate its relationships within the Jewish community. It reads: 'Since 1954, ZBT has been committed to its policy of non-sectarian Brotherhood, and values the diversity of its membership. ZBT will recruit and initiate men of good character, regardless of religion, race or creed who are accepting of these principles.'","Zeta Beta Tau suspended and charged for the 'disgusting' acts .

"A father-of-two who chopped off his hand with an electric angle cutter is back at work just  weeks after surgeons reattached it. Gary Lincoln, 48, from Port Talbot in Wales, was working in a house in Cardiff when his jacket sleeve got caught in the blade and his hand was severed at the wrist, leaving it held on by only flesh and skin. He put in in his sleeve 'to hold everything together' and was taken to hospital where surgeons operated on him for more than seven hours earlier this month. Back at work: Gary Lincoln is carrying out light duties at his workshop just weeks after he severed his hand . Mr Lincoln, who runs a furniture upcycling company a interior design firm, said: 'I didn't feel any pain at all. 'It was like hundreds and thousands of tiny electric shocks that didn't hurt, like very intense pins and needles. 'There was a lot of blood. I got my hand free and put it in my sleeve to hold everything together.' The accident happened when he was on his own using an angle cutter, which was fitted with a safety guard. Neighbours called for an ambulance to take him to the Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery at Swansea's Morriston Hospital. 'When it happened my main worry was stopping the bleeding but I was also thinking ""That's it. I've just ruined my life"",' Gary said. 'I'm right-handed but need both hands to do my work. I have a wife and two children. My life would have been devastated.' Orthopaedic surgeon Aso Mohammed re-attached the fractured bones using a plate and screws.

Then plastic surgeons, led by consultant plastic, reconstructive and hand surgeon Ian Josty, repaired the tendons and performed microsurgical reconstruction to the severed nerves and major blood vessels. Waking up in hospital the next day and being able to move his fingers was, Mr Lincoln said, nothing short of a miracle. He added: 'I can move all my fingers, which is absolutely amazing. I cannot believe it. 'I didn't think I would have my hand working again properly. I thought my life was ruined. 'My hands are my work, so I thought I had lost everything.'

"He has long struggled to convince voters that he is a suitable choice for prime minister. Now Ed Miliband has hired a leadership coaching firm that helps people overcome anxiety and find their ‘inner voice’. The consultants drafted in by the Labour leader claim to work with politicians to build ‘leadership skills’ using ‘neuroscience’ and ‘business psychology’. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband, pictured, has hired a US guru who can help him convince himself that he can be Prime Minister . Mr Miliband, pictured, has constantly lagged behind Prime Minister David Cameron in the personal rating polls . Services offered by ExtendedMind include coaching on how to look ‘authentic’ and tutorials on how to build alliances – which may come in useful during negotiations with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. The firm, which uses some American spellings despite being based in Britain, details how it can help politicians on its website. It says: ‘When we’re working with leaders who want to communicate their messages with greater impact, it’s typically the “how” of their style that we support, improving body language, breathing, posture and prosody.’ In a section entitled ‘The Politics of Authenticity’, it adds: ‘Is learning new communication techniques just a question of artifice rather than authenticity? ‘Our answer to that question would be “yes”, if you don’t throw yourself into the learning process and practice! Any new behaviour will feel inauthentic at the beginning, and will seem so to others, too. But with repeated practice we move from “acting” to “being”.’ When Ed Miliband tried to make a conference speech off the cuff in September, he forgot to mention the deficit and was roundly ridiculed. So ever since then he has made sure he always has one trusty aide at his side ... a lectern, right. Whether he is in a town hall, a car park or a factory during the election campaign, the prop – often holding helpful notes to jog his memory – has been there for him to lean on. His advisors believe the lectern makes him look more like a prime minister-in-waiting. But its non-stop UK tour has begun to look increasingly bizarre after he even dragged it into the car park of a Leicestershire factory, where it was carefully positioned between puddles. This week he spoke from a lectern as he launched Labour campaign billboards in Nuneaton, Warwickshire ... even though he was in the middle of a cricket pitch. The website continues: ‘The anxiety we all feel to different degrees when communicating an important message to others – and which can side-swipe our message – can be erased so that our inner voice can find its way into the world.’ And in a sign that the firm could help Mr Miliband prepare to negotiate post-election deals, it notes: ‘Our intelligent networks process encourages people to think about what they want to achieve [and] identify the people who might collaborate with them to achieve those goals.’ Mr Miliband has consistently lagged behind David Cameron in polls on their personal ratings during his five years as Labour leader. But he has seen a slight boost in his popularity since the campaign began last month. After the seven-way televised leaders’ debate on ITV, it emerged that Mr Miliband had been reading from motivational notes – including one reminding him to be a ‘happy warrior’. His cribsheet, found in his dressing room after the clash, also prompted him to ‘relish the chance to show who I am’. Mr Miliband has hired ExtendedMind despite already employing David Axelrod, a former adviser to Barack Obama, on six figures. One Labour MP said Mr Axelrod had so far been ‘invisible’ in the campaign, adding: ‘I don’t understand what we are getting for the £300,000, I think it is an obscene amount.’ Mr Axelrod, who is based in the US, has insisted he is in touch with Mr Miliband ‘all the time’ by phone, text and email. Asked yesterday whether his use of ExtendedMind had been ‘helpful’, Mr Miliband told a press conference: ‘I will let other people make a judgment on those questions. I take advice from a range of people.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘We don’t comment on people we may or may not have employed.’ ExtendedMind did not respond to a request for comment. Tory Michael Ellis said: ‘There’s nothing authentic about Ed Miliband ... even after all his extensive coaching, could you imagine him standing up to Putin on the world stage? He should ask for his money back.’","Ed Miliband is trying to build his 'leadership skills' using psychology .

"With its blend of Portuguese and Chinese culture, it didn’t take us long to discover the unique appeal of Macau. Soon after arriving by high-speed TurboJET ferry from Hong Kong, we were sitting in Antonio, a beautifully tiled restaurant that could easily have been in Lisbon. The food and drink was excellent (owner Antonio Coelho whips up a mean souffle), and the fado singing of entertainer Marcelino was truly memorable. Scroll down for video . Macau has 26 casinos, including the largest in the world, The Venetian . Located at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta at the southern tip of China, Macau comprises a peninsula and two islands – Taipa and Coloane – connected by three dramatic bridges. It was run by Portugal until 1999 when it became a special Administrative Region of China. Wandering with our guide through Macau’s Historic Centre the next morning, it was evident how the Portuguese influence has been maintained through the architecture and cobbled streets. The highlights for us were the Ruins of St Paul’s, elegant Senado Square, and A-Ma Temple, which is more than 500 years old. My husband Neil and I were impressed by just how clean and tidy Macau is – they even have WCs for dogs with entrances marked In and Out. Judith Chalmers and her husband travelled to the city and it didn’t take them long to discover the unique appeal of Macau . After lunch at Cafe Litoral (a fusion of Portuguese, Chinese, Indian, South American, African and Malaysian flavours – it works!) we headed over to the Macau Tower, which has the world’s highest bungee jump. Plunging 764ft in 17 seconds is not for the faint-hearted, but neither is Skywalk X, where you are harnessed and take a thrilling – if that’s the word – walk around the outer rim of the Tower with nothing to hold on to. We were disappointed that, for technical reasons, we weren’t able to see the multi-million-pound production of The House Of Dancing Water. Incredible skyline! View of Grand Lisboa and Wynn Hotel and Casino at dusk . Developed by the man behind many of Cirque du Soleil’s dazzling shows, it features acrobats, motorcycle stunts and fountain effects. Mention Macau and many people automatically think ‘casinos’. There are 26 of them, including the world’s biggest, The Venetian. It looks the size of Wembley and has about 500 baccarat, roulette and blackjack tables. Contrasting scenery! The peaceful Coloane island is world's apart from Macau . Gambling is illegal in Hong Kong, except on horseracing, so thousands from Hong Kong as well as mainland China try their luck here. Free shuttle buses run between the casinos, and as the doorman at our hotel, the Sofitel, said: ‘It’s either that or a Rolls-Royce!’ Lord Stow's Bakery is the home to the Portuguese egg custard tart . The island of Coloane, meanwhile, has green hills, small villages and a peaceful coastline. In the Town Square we were intrigued to find Lord Stow’s Bakery, home to the Portuguese egg custard tart. Launched by Englishman Andrew Stow in 1989, the store is now run by his sister Eileen, and it sells more than 3,000 of the delicacies every day. Macau has a typhoon season from June to September when the bridges can be closed, but a long tunnel keeps the traffic flowing. As a destination, it is far cheaper than Hong Kong and there is plenty of accommodation. The food is wonderful, and when you stir in the Portuguese heritage and influence, you get a fascinating and colourful melting pot.

"A murderer who strangled a woman and put her body in a cupboard has been rearrested after three weeks on the run. William Kerr absconded from a bail hostel in Hull after he was released from HMP Stocken in Rutland on licence in January. The 53-year-old, who was jailed in 1998 for the murder of Maureen Comfort, was apprehended in the street in Waterloo, south London, around 7pm on Friday. William Kerr (left), who strangled Maureen Comfort (right) and put her body in a cupboard 20 years ago, has been rearrested after three weeks on the run . His arrest came after a £5,000 reward was offered for information about his whereabouts on BBC's Crimewatch. Ms Comfort was last seen alive on December 4, 1995. The 43-year-old's body was found in January 1996 by relatives who broke into her flat after becoming increasingly worried about her whereabouts. It was discovered in a wardrobe in her bedroom. Kerr was jailed for life for murder at Leeds Crown Court alongside Christopher Moody. Both men lodged with Ms Comfort in the two months before her death and had a key to the property, the court heard at the time. Kerr served 15 years before being moved to approved premises 90 miles away. Kerr was jailed for life for murder at Leeds Crown Court (above) alongside Christopher Moody in 1998 . During the search he was described by police as a 'very dangerous man' and the public were warned not to approach him. They added that he needed to be returned to prison 'as a matter of urgency'. Detective Inspector Eamonn Clarke, of North Yorkshire Police,  led the search for Kerr. He said: 'Thanks to some information received following the Crimewatch appeal we were able to track Kerr to a specific area of London. 'The information was vital to the effort to trace Kerr as he indicated when he was arrested that he was about to leave the London area after seeing himself on Crimewatch. 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people who came forward.'","William Kerr was released on licence in January but left bail hostel in Hull .

"A 90-year-old grandmother will not receive the $41million jackpot she thought she won at an Iowa slot machine after the state supreme court ruled her wining pull was caused by a software error. Pauline McKee thought she hit it big in 2011 when, after putting a penny in the 'Miss Kitty' game at the Isle Hotel Casino in Waterloo, the screen announced she had won a bonus award of $41,797,550.16. But on Friday the Iowa Supreme Court determined McKee, who has thirteen grandchildren, had actually only won $1.85 because of how the symbols had aligned in the game. The unanimous court ruled that the casino did not have to pay McKee because the game's rules stated that the maximum award was $10,000 and that bonus awards were not allowed. Pauline McKee, 90, will not receive the $41million jackpot she thought she won from the slots at the Isle Hotel Casino (pictured) in Waterloo, Iowa after the state supreme court ruled her win came from a software error . 'I had my doubts from the start, because that's a lot of money for a penny machine,' McKee told the Chicago Tribune after the ruling. 'I was hoping to help my children out financially, but it wasn't meant to be.' Justice Edward Mansfield wrote that the game's rules and pay table, which are available for reading on the machine, amount to a contract between the casino and the player. The contract is binding, whether or not the player reads the rules, he said. 'Any message appearing on the screen indicating the patron would receive a $41million bonus was a gratuitous promise,' Mansfield wrote in a ruling that dismissed McKee's lawsuit. 'The casino's failure to pay it could not be challenged as a breach of contract.' Stacey Cormican, one of the casino's attorneys, said the court's decision will ensure fairness in Iowa's large gambling industry. 'Casinos are required to post rules and follow those rules. If either the patrons or casinos could change the rules in the middle of the game, it would be absolutely chaos,' she said. Cormican said the casino could have been forced into bankruptcy if the court had ruled in McKee's favor. A $41 million payout would amount to about half of the gross revenue the casino generated last year. McKee, a widow, was playing the penny slots with her daughter during a family reunion when she thought she won the life-changing bonus. Casino officials investigated the machine after she informed an attendant that she had won the jackpot. The unanimous court ruled that the casino did not have to pay McKee because the rules of the 'Miss Kitty' game (pictured) stated that the maximum award was $10,000 and did not allow for bonus awards . The machine was reviewed by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission and it's hardware and software was analyzed in a laboratory, which discovered the erroneous bonus message. In 2010 Aristocrat Technologies Inc., the game's manufacturer, also warned casinos that the machine's hardware was susceptible to displaying 'legacy bonus' awards that had not actually been won. A sign on the casino's game read that 'malfunction voids all pays and plays'. The casino gave McKee a $10 card to play while she waited during the initial investigation and eventually paid for her family's rooms. McKee sued the casino in 2012 after the commission determined the casino didn't have to pay-out because of the machine's glitch. Her lawyers argued that the casino had an implied contract with the customers to pay whatever number they were awarded on the slot machine, according to the Chicago Tribune. Judge Mansfield found the argument to be 'contrary to precedent and general contract principles,' he wrote. As for McKee, she said she will not be playing the slots at Isle Hotel anytime soon. 'They didn't give me anything except what I had on the machine,' she said. 'If they're not going to give me any money at all, that's terrible.'","Pauline McKee thought she hit it big when she put a penny in an Iowa slot machine and the game announced she won a $41.8m bonus award .

"After suffering a blow in the September referendum,  Nicola Sturgeon has steadily set about boosting her political profile. In spite of the defeat which prompted her predecessor's resignation, the SNP leader has racked up support across Scotland since, with some fans even hopeful of a victory on May 7. But weeks after having to deny allegations of back-room plotting against Ed Miliband, Mrs Sturgeon has been rocked by more smearing claims yet. For with just two weeks to go until she canvasses polling station queues, the 44-year-old has been accused of savage violence. The SNP leader (pictured right, aged 14) has denied her sister's claims she used to shave the heads off her sister's Barbie dolls . According to her sister, Gillian Owens, the politician was prone to hacking the hair of from dolls as a child. 'She once cut the hair off my Sindy doll, just for fun,' Gillian Owens, a part-time actress, said. Rebutting the claims, the politician told the BBC: 'I deny the allegations levelled at me by my sister. 'I'm sure I didn't cut the hair off her Barbie doll. 'But if I did it - and it's an ""if"" - then there would have been provocation involved, I'm sure of it.' Later posting on Twitter, she added: 'For the record I think my sister is misremembering. I'm sure it was a Sindy doll. #dollgate.' Poking fun at the tale, she told one follower: 'I'm not proud of it... but I've changed. My niece's have never come to any harm.' The accusations sparked a Twitter trend with internet users sharing mocking photographs of beheaded Barbie dolls on Saturday afternoon. The politician poked fun at her sister's claims which sparked a Twitter trend on Saturday afternoon . Twitter users were quick to join in on the joke, sharing photographs of beheaded dolls on the social network . One user shared this photograph of the SNP leader as a murderous doll herself, holding a pair of scissors . A joke Twitter account was set up in the name Barbie Sturgeon in the wake of the claims this weekend . In an interview with The Sun, Mrs Sturgeon's sister told of how they were 'like chalk and cheese' growing up. 'I was into dolls and everything girly. Nicola was into sitting reading. She was a very strong-minded wee girl.' Polls suggest the SNP is on the brink of a landslide on a scale unprecedented in modern British politics, winning as many as 50 of Scotland’s 59 Commons seats. That would be all but certain to leave it holding the balance of power at Westminster for the first time. Mrs Sturgeon did not attend a ceremony at the Cenotaph this morning with other party leaders to commemorate the centenary of the Gallipoli Landings. Laying a wreath a Scottish memorial site instead she later attended an SNP women's rally in Glasgow City Centre. The SNP leader skipped the Cenotaph ceremony to join female voters in central Glasgow at a women's rally .","SNP leader denied claims she shaved the heads of sister's dolls as a child .

"Channel 4's Indian Summers star Olivia Grant headed to Phuket in Thailand before the start of filming the second series . I’ve always had a love affair with Thailand. At the end of filming Channel 4’s Indian Summers last year, I headed to Koh Phangan, an island off Ko Samui, and did a week-long meditation and yoga course. I came away convinced I was going to carry on doing a minimum of 30 minutes of meditation every morning in London – a resolve that was slowly eroded by the stresses of relying on London Underground and from Sunday hangovers. So I jumped at the chance of heading out to Thailand again before the start of filming series two. Despite an 18-hour journey on the flawless Singapore Airlines, I arrived in Phuket still excited about recapturing my zen. Phuket, however, is very different from Koh Phangan. First of all it is much greener, and secondly it is definitely an island with party in its bones. I was staying at the luxurious Sri Panwa resort, which comprises a series of minimalist villas complete with surround-sound systems pumping out Enya, and each with their own saltwater private infinity pool facing out on to the shimmering Andaman Sea. Villa co-ordinator Pim immediately apologised for the increased security around the resort (a Thai princess and Liam from One Direction were there). I’m sure you can just sit and chill in the hotel’s beautiful restaurants or sunbathe on your private terrace, but when Pim dropped me off at my villa, she revealed that another famous Sri Panwa guest – DJ Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim) – was performing at a nightclub called Seduction that evening. I decided zen could wait. Seduction turned out to be off Bangla Road, the heart of Phuket’s red-light district. Having grabbed a tuk-tuk from outside the hotel (complete with strings of fluorescent lights and speakers blaring out Taylor Swift’s Blank Space), I arrived at Patong Beach itself. This is the strip is where zen goes to die. Olivia did yoga at Sri Panwa’s Cool Spa, on a breathtaking platform called Baba Nest, which offers 360 degree views of Cape Panwa (pictured) Bangla Road in Phuket comes to life when the sun goes down. The road is shut to cars and becomes 1,312ft of neon lights, loud music and cheap beer . There are Thai versions of cabaret clubs such as Crazy Horse and Moulin Rouge, while street hawkers sold tickets to ‘ping-pong shows’, which I later discovered were not as innocent as they sounded. Pim ushered me up an escalator to Seduction’s rooftop party venue. Norman had just started his set and was whipping up a good-looking Thai crowd, all of whom seemed as if they were probably doing an MA at Central Saint Martins in London, into a frenzy. The odd British tourist was in there too, looking appropriately smug that they had stumbled into this stylish haven and escaped the booming sex trade below. The wife of one of the owners of Sri Panwa turned to me and whispered that everyone inside the club was ‘VVIP’. Content in this knowledge, I continued my very English head-bob to Norman’s hit song Praise You. The next morning, breakfast at Baba, Sri Panwa’s poolside restaurant, was a glorious affair. I faced my greatest challenge so far… selecting from the breakfast buffet. Room with a view! The luxurious Sri Panwa resort in Phuket features an infinity pool overlooking the Andaman Sea . I always get a bit nervous at buffets. It has to be a carefully managed procedure, and with only a certain amount of space and a plethora of choice, I did an almost ridiculous amount of hovering before settling on a rather ad hoc selection of banana pancakes followed by a Thai fish curry. Curious but excellent is the only way I can describe this combination. It is also testimony to the hotel that all the staff seemed so happy there. I caught a couple of them making faces while squirting the pancake mixture on to the griddle and giggling with a joyousness that I can’t really imagine at a breakfast buffet in London. I whiled away the afternoon reading by my infinity pool, slathering on the factor 50 at every opportunity, as my skin needs to be eased into even the most minimal sun exposure unless I want that a tantalising combination of prickly heat and sunburn. The James Bond Island is a popular feature in Phang Nga Bay, Phuket . I then headed up to Sri Panwa’s Cool Spa, where you can practise yoga on a breathtaking platform called Baba Nest, which offers 360 degree views of Cape Panwa. Our Thai yoga instructor, who coincidentally had a body which looked as if it had been carved out of mahogany, performed the chaturanga at sunset with a sinuousness that reminded me of that scene featuring the yoga instructor from Couples Retreat, for anyone who knows that film. He didn’t quite slap me on the bottom and say ‘Encouragement’, but it was a close-run thing. Then, after a fabulous dinner at Sri Panwa’s beautifully appointed Thai restaurant Soul Food, where the ‘squid on hot plate’ sizzled satisfactorily and the green curry with prawns was to die for, I submitted to the jet-lag and crashed out on pillows on which the maids had placed a shell and an orchid. Returning to my quest for zen the next morning, I headed north of Phuket and took a 30-minute boat ride to a quiet island in Phang Nga Bay, which I had been advised was much less touristy than the Phi Phi islands made famous by the film adaptation of Alex Garland’s The Beach. I was picked up by the staff of the Six Senses Yao Noi hotel and spa who had lined the bamboo pier, and was driven to the complex by a tuk-tuk, which bore no resemblance whatsoever to the ones in Phuket. DJ Hardwell also known as Fat Boy Slim,  performs a set. The DJ also stayed at the Sri Panwa and performed at a nightclub called seduction . The hotel is much more of a retreat than Sri Panwa and puts a lot of emphasis on being an eco-friendly, sustainable resort. The landscaped gardens are supposedly ‘edible’, there’s a space for some of the happiest free-range chickens I’ve ever seen, and a mushroom hut, where the chef harvests fresh oyster mushrooms. But this resort is also beautiful. Each of the villas contains a double bed with white mosquito nets hanging from interwoven horns, the bathrooms have beautiful copper standalone basins, and from the sunken bath there are exquisite views of the strange islets of Phang Nga Bay. The wooden decking leads to a private pool, but you can also pad down to the private sandy beach which stretches below and go for a swim. Fruit and drinks by the pool at Evason Six Senses Hideaway on Koh Yao Noi island . I ate poached rock lobster in coconut milk, lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime, and a beef curry on jasmine rice, at Six Senses’ beautiful Hilltop restaurant before heading to the beach again where the hotel was screening the Hollywood classic Breakfast At Tiffany’s under the stars. As I listened to Audrey Hepburn describe Tiffany, I thought that this hotel also was a great place to head to when you had the ‘mean reds’ – nothing very bad could happen to you here. Back at Sri Panwa and there was just enough time to indulge in one more Asian-style breakfast curry before take-off. I also spotted Norman lounging by his pool, so I wandered over to congratulate him on his set a few nights before. Norman merely shrugged, as if the crazed hero-worship in the club was just a run-of-the-mill Tuesday, so I duly toned down my enthusiasm and sauntered off with the look of ‘Yeah, totally, I feel you. It’s a normal Tuesday night in Phuket for me too.’ And then it was back to London. I may have mislaid my zen in Phuket but I sure had partied. Indian Summers is out now on DVD.

"A new television show will attempt to rescue failed marriages by arranging a full-on two week spouse switch for couples, FYI announced yesterday. The show entitled The Seven Year Switch is an eight episode series in which couples live, eat, and even sleep with a new significant other. The show is set to premiere this summer. Deadline reports that the series is named after the 1955 Broadway show The Seven Year Itch that was later developed into the film starring Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell. The Seven Year Itch: The series is named after the 1955 Broadway show The Seven Year Itch that was later developed into the film starring Marilyn Monroe (left) and Tom Ewell (right) The show's concept is based on the idea that after seven years of marriage, spouses often become restless and regret their decision to wed. The program chooses four couples who have reached the seven year mark and they guide them through the switch. After the switch is complete the couples will be able to decide whether or not they want to stay together or be with someone else. Gena McCarthy, SVP Programming and Development at FYI, said the show is testing if separating people makes them miss one another even more than they imagined was possible. The show for FYI is produced by Kinetic Content who also produce the love-based show Married At First Sight. Married At First Sight pairs a couple based on their scientific match and they then live together for four weeks. At the end of the four weeks they decide if they want to stay together or divorce.

"A British trader accused of triggering a £500 billion Wall Street crash boasted he could earn £1 million in a week in 'volatile' markets. Navinder Sarao, 36, made the bold claim in October last year in an email to business colleagues, which has been lodged in the Northern District Court of Illinois as evidence in any future trial against him. US prosecutors allege Sarao, who was arrested last week, helped to trigger the so-called 'Flash Crash' of Wall Street on May 6, 2010, from his parents' house in Hounslow, West London. Scroll down for video . US prosecutors allege Sarao, circled, helped to trigger the 'Flash Crash' of Wall Street on May 6, 2010 . The crash netted Sarao £27 million in profits, they claim. In an email to a company he set up in a Caribbean tax haven, Sarao asked for an urgent £4.25 million. He wrote: 'I tend to perform better when markets are volatile and this week alone I would have envisaged making at least £1 million.' Sarao appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday and was bailed with a surety of £5 million. However, he has remained behind bars since his brief appearance, and remained there over the weekend after an official from the magistrates' court confirmed Friday it had not received the money.","Navinder Sarao, 36, made the bold claim in October last year in an email .

"Vassilis was born in a boat. His mother was trying to make it from her home on the island of Ammouliani, only a mile across the Aegean, to the mainland. But she was too late. And so a boy came into this world at sea, and there was only one life he was fated to live. A snooze in the sunshine: The Eagles Palace hotel is a fine escape zone for family holidays . Today, tall and bronzed, like a warrior from the legions of Alexander the Great, Vassilis is at the wheel of a speedboat thrumming across the sparkling seas off the Mount Athos peninsula in north-eastern Greece. As we fly along like a turbo-charged bronco, dolphins breach the surface and plunge below, and then a sea turtle, almost 5ft long, slides alongside. Vassilis's eyes instinctively scan the water — and then he shouts with delight. The man who has sailed these waters all his life hasn't seen a turtle here in 25 years. Vassilis is the boatman at the Eagles Palace, a long-established family hotel designed to look a little like one of the many monasteries further along the coast. It is 90 minutes' drive from the airport at Thessaloniki, along a road that meanders through olive groves and low-lying wooded valleys, into a corner of Greece that is a world away from the fleshpots of the party islands far to the south. We are afforded the warmest of welcomes. Out of the blue: The Eagles Palace hotel occupies a pristine location 90 minutes' drive from Thessaloniki . Set on tumbling levels down to its own beach, the hotel is a labyrinth of terrace restaurants (serving food and wine from local farms, vineyards and its very own olive grove), cooling courtyards, beach bars and a large saltwater pool. The beach itself shelves gently into water, which is astonishingly clear because the Aegean sweeps into the bay and then out again every 20 minutes. There is a kids' club, though it seems more suited to children younger than our son, Mike, 11, and daughter Alice, seven. Pavlos is the man if you want to take out a sea kayak or do some light paddle-boarding or more strenuous mountain-biking. Taken for a ride: Guests can head out on jetskis - although watersports at the hotel are not entirely cheap . Unlike most dudes you meet at a watersports hut, he has an MBA from New York - oh, and he runs ultra-marathons, too. He does a brilliant job of shepherding Mike on his first sea kayak outing, helping him to steer his boat nimbly around rocks jutting from the sea bed. Pavlos has just introduced a specialist course for children, which will see them developing their skills on the water as the week goes on. If Pavlos is the urbane young face of adventure sports, Mr Dinos, the watersports supremo, is the salty sea dog who looks as though he might have sailed in his youth with Odysseus. Crucial credentials: Eagles Palace is an awarded member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World group . Crinkly blue eyes smile out from under his weather-beaten cap as he waves his walnut arm and asks: 'What will it be today?' Mind you, the watersports don't come cheap - €70 for two people for ten minutes' parasailing, and €50 for quarter of an hour on a jet ski. But, hey, you're on holiday. While Alice yells to go faster on the jet ski, Mike chooses the more sedate but vertiginous thrills of parasailing. As he is winched up into the piercing blue sky attached to a harness in front of his nervous mum, his face cracks into a huge grin and, despite his legs jiggling around like a demented frog, he calls it the 'best fun ever'. A place to let a week slide by: The hotel has a gently shelving beach lapped by the Aegean Sea . This area of Greece is known for its astonishing panoply of monasteries. Prince Charles is a regular visitor, spending time in the company of the monks in the Simonos Petras monastery, which crouches on top of a rock high above the sea. Such is said to be Charles's fascination with the Greek Orthodox religion that he has installed Byzantine art in his Highgrove garden. Far above the twinkling domes, on the peak of Mount Athos itself, sits a stone building. Who would build a chapel on top of a mountain 6,000ft high, I wonder out loud? 'They have faith,' Vassilis tells me later. Then, he recounts the story of the monk who tumbled over a cliff face and plunged 150 metres straight down. Surely, his fellows thought, he is dead. But he dusted himself off and trundled back up the hill. Miraculous, you might say. A view like few others: The Simonos Petras monastery towers some 800 feet above the Aegean Sea . One morning, Pavlos takes us boys on bikes into the town of Ouranoupoli - where an ancient watchtower stands sentinel above seafront tavernas. Then we head out along a gravel track. Here, trees heavy with wild figs strain over the roadside and olive trees offer dappled corners of shade. And at the end of the path? A monastery which is probably 10th century, and the first of all those built along this peninsula. It is a reminder of the history which seeps through the earth in this land - and courses through the veins of Vassilis and the other descendants of the ancients who shaped this Greek marvel.

The 47-year-old was first arrested in 2003 during a dawn raid on his house. 1,675 images and videos depicting child pornography were discovered by officers. He went on the run for eight years - during which time his mother and father both died - and was reportedly living in Hungary. At the time he left a note for his parents, which read: ‘Dear Mummy and Daddy. Some time ago the police came to my house looking for images of under-age children on my computer. I was arrested. ‘I must apologise for being foolish and thank you for being great parents. Rather than wait and find out what will happen, I will go away.

"A man has been jailed after fathering a child with his own daughter who he raped repeatedly from when she was aged just 10 (file image) A man has been jailed for life after fathering a child with his own daughter who he raped repeatedly from when she was just 10. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given a life sentence after Derby Crown Court after jurors heard how he 'took his daughter's life' through sexual abuse. His depravity was exposed when he impregnated her when she was just a teenager, having 'poisoned' the girl against her mother. As she watched her abuser being led away from the dock the girl ran towards him, crying out: 'I love you and miss you.' Earlier the court heard how her father had been her primary carer for years and began raping her when he felt 'out of sorts or angry'. Despite promising to stop the abuse after each attack, the man carried on abusing her until she became pregnant. In a bid to terminate the pregnancy without raising concern he encouraged his daughter to continue kick boxing, the court heard. Eventually, when the girl refused to tell authorities who the father of the baby was they ordered a paternity test. The pair fled but were apprehended by police and the man taken into custody. Giving evidence the girl told of how she was too scared to reported her father to police and still 'loved him'. 'The abuse has set my life on the wrong course and destroyed the normal childhood and teenage years that everyone deserves,' she said in a statement. 'I feared the consequences of disclosure because I love my dad. 'I know what he did was wrong, but I grew up with my dad by my side. 'I just wanted him to get help to make him better but unfortunately that never happened and it has come to this. 'It's come to me having a baby and to the father being my dad and to him being sentenced and my life falling apart.' The man, who earlier admitted rape, had 'poisoned' the girl against her mother who did not live with them, the court heard. Applying the same sentence as is handed to murderers, Judge Stuart Rafferty QC told the man: 'You took your daughter's life.' Jailing him for a minimum term of 15 years, he said: 'It's difficult to find words that could properly describe the extent of your deprivation and the damage that that deprivation has caused, not to a stranger but to your own daughter. 'Children do not ask to be born. Children are entitled to expect the best from their parents, in terms of care and parental love, that they can possibly receive. 'You gave your daughter a warped variation of that, a variation that suited you, not her. 'And, although I know you have to serve a prison sentence for that, the sentence you imposed upon her is a far greater one.' He added the girl has been consigned 'to a life of darkness'. 'She loved you, as any child loves its parents, and although people may think it strange, she loves you still - that's what children do.' The man was sentenced to life imprisonment at Derby Crown Court (above). His daughter cried: 'I love you' as he was led way from the dock .","Man raped his daughter repeatedly over four years from when she was 10 .

Ms Flynn was in a state of sheer panic as she heard concerned passers-by screaming 'get her out because it's all going to collapse'. Scroll down for videos . 'Disappeared': Chip shop worker Jeannie Flynn, 53, has described the terrifying moment she plunged 10ft underground after a pavement opened up beneath her on a busy southwest London street . Busy street: Ms Flynn was in a state of sheer panic as she concerned heard passers-by screaming 'get her out because it's all going to collapse' She had been walking to her GPs on Thursday morning to pick up a prescription when a man told her to walk around a one-foot hole in the pavement. As she did so the ground gave way and she plummeted downwards. Speaking to The Sun, she added: 'I fell and I think I screamed. Bricks were falling but didn't hit me. I'm grateful I'm not badly injured.' A worker from the Marrakech Express cafe then came to the rescue opening up their basement and leading her upstairs for a coffee. 'I felt like something stronger! I was really shaky,' she joked. Ms Flynn was taken to a hospital in Fulham and was found to have suffered whiplash and bruising. Her partner Chris Jeffries, 48, claims she could have been killed in the accident. Immediately after the incident, onlookers hearing a loud scream before Ms Flynn 'disappeared' down the gap in the road and landed on the rubble below. Ambulance crews were called to the cafe at about 8.50am to provide medical care. A man takes a picture of the five foot wide by two and a half foot long hole that suddenly appeared on Thursday, exposing the cafe's basement below . At the time there was confusion over whether Ms Flynn had been pushing a pram - but this was not the case. Kate Sissons, who witnessed the fall, posted a picture on Instagram, saying: 'OMG! Poor woman and pram just disappeared down this hole on North End Rd. Shes stuck down there. She added: 'Loud scream and all I could see was the pram. Ambulance and fire on way to get her out. Scary. V v scary [sic].' A nearby flower stall owner, who asked not to be named, said she saw a man come running out of the cafe, shortly before the drama unfolded. 'The hole had been blocked off with tables and chairs but she had squeezed through and went straight down,' she said. 'She didn't have a pram or a buggy, it was a shopping trolley. 'The shop owner was shouting out to her ""Don't come through there"". 'We looked over and she was down, all the way down the hole. She had walked onto it and it had collapsed beneath her.' Scotland Yard confirmed that officers attended the scene at 8.42am and that a child had not been involved. Paul Smith, 28, a builder who was walking to work when he saw what he described as a 'shocking' scene. He said: 'Someone had fallen through - just like a trapdoor. It's crazy. There is a huge hole in the floor and someone has fallen through the pavement. 'It is about a metre wide and about eight foot deep. I couldn't see inside to see if it was a man or a woman but it was a person and the police were all around.' Atila Mohammed, who runs the Marrakech Express where the hole opened up in front of in North End Road, said he first became aware of the hole shortly before the incident. He said: 'A young man was passing, he came to me and said ""I was walking along and the pavement has broken"".' Mr Mohammed said that it was while he was checking the man was okay that woman, who was walking quite fast, approached the  hole, which at this point was only quite small. This is the first image that emerged of the incident on Thursday morning, taken by witness Kate Sissons . 'People were outside looking around and everyone said ""Stop, stop, stop"" as she put her foot on the pavement. 'I said ""stop, stop"", but I couldn't stop her. There was only a small hole from the man before, but when the lady stepped there she broke everything and it fell. 'I tried to hold her and she fell all the way down. But she's ok now I held her til the end.' He said he lowered her down the five foot wide by two and a half foot long hole and she walked back up to the cafe via the basement and stairs and gave her a coffee while she waited for paramedics to arrive. The cafe manager claims he warned the council about the hole two years ago as he had noticed it was 'sagging'. Mr Mohammed said: 'We were shocked. We told the council nearly two years ago it looks like its sagging and they've done nothing.' Passers-by stop to take a look at the eight foot deep hole, which has been cordoned off since the incident . A cafe regular, who asked not to be named said: 'When we arrived about 9.10 all the police were here. 'We sit here every day and we were told that there was a large hole in the road and that the lady was running along the road, rushing.' The 76-year-old added: 'The cafe manager came out and grabbed her. She had a green coat and blue/black trousers, I heard. 'I thought the woman who told me was joking, but having said that there has been a big droop in that area of pavement for a long long time. I noticed it away back in February. 'I see elderly people pushing shopping trolleys along here - it could have been them we were all shocked it was an accident waiting to happen.' Laura Hill, 30, who lives in Wimbledon but works as a nanny in the area, walks up and down the road 'at least 10 times a day' and says it could have happened to anyone. 'It's an uneven pavement and a very busy area, with a bus stop really nearby. Lots of elderly people sit outside that cafe in the morning too. 'I walk up and down the street at least 10 times a day with the child I look after in a pushchair. When I heard I thought ""that could've been me"". 'It's all been boarded up now and you have to walk on the road to get past the hole now. People have been stopping to take pictures of it all day.' A London Ambulance spokesman confirmed paramedics were called to the scene at 8.53am after found the patient was 'shaken but not seriously injured' and took her to Charing Cross Hospital. Hammersmith & Fulham Council said that it is investigating claims that Mr Mohammed raised the issue with the council two months ago and the causes of the collapse. A council spokeswoman added: 'The council’s structural engineer has carried out an initial investigation of the basement collapse in North End Road and secured the site. 'The freeholder of the property is legally responsible for the structural integrity of their basement but we are carrying out a full review of what’s happened and will ensure the site is made safe and all necessary actions are taken once we have a full understanding of how this occurred.'

"An FBI agent's sniper rifle (similar to the one pictured) was ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot . An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month . Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case. The agent's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street, but the sniper rifle has not been recovered. Marriott Springhill Suites, the agent's hotel, is next to the city's airport and just down the street from the state's FBI office. The hotel does not have surveillance cameras, according to the police report. Salt Lake City police said the rifle's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer. The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit, but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security. Det. McGowan said police do not know if the thief specifically targeted the agent's car. The sniper rifle was stolen sometime overnight from the parking lot of Marriott Springhill Suites, where the agent was staying. The hotel is just across the street from the state's FBI office .","Rifle was stolen overnight while agent's car was parked at a Salt Lake City hotel across the street from the state's FBI office .

"Brynn Johnson and Cassie Miller have known each other for some time, but seven months ago they were brought together by a terrible tragedy. Cassie was in her car picking up Brynn's son for preschool in Tenino, Washington, when she accidentally ran over Brynn's younger daughter, 17-month-old Rowyn, who was killed. Incredibly though, Brynn forgave Cassie for what happened, acknowledging what happened as a horrific accident. 'It's a hard thing to accept and a hard thing to swallow to this day,' Cassie told KOMO News. Scroll down for video . Pulled together by tragedy: Brynn Johnson (left) lost her young daughter Rowyn in September last year after Cassie Miller (right) accidentally ran over the little girl with her car. The two dealt with the tragedy together . Tragic: Rowyn was only 17-months-old when she was killed instantly in the driveway of her home in Tenino, Washington, in September last year, by one of her mother's friends . 'I mean, I struggle every day.' Brynn then added: 'And both of us blame ourselves.' 'I think more so than blaming the other person we blame ourselves.' The women helped each other get through the tragedy, which occurred on September 16 last year. In order to deal with their grief, they started a charity initiative called Raise for Rowyn, which raises money for families who have experienced child tragedies. I really feel a lot of the time I'm just living for her and doing her work,' Cassie told KOMO. 'And I do want to make her proud.' Brynn added: 'Her and God have this plan and we're helping all of these families for them.' The women even planted a memorial garden at Brynn's home to honor Rowyn and the place she died. Memorial: The women planted a garden in memory of Rowyn and have also started a charity to help other families who have experienced a similar type of grief .

Brynn (left) is pictured here with Rowyn as a baby and her older young, while Cassie (right) is also pictured Rowyn, not too long before her death last year . On the Raise for Rowyn website, Brynn explained what happened to her little on that fateful day last September. Her and Cassie's sons had just started preschool together. 'We were working to get the boys loaded in the car when little 17-month-old Rowyn climbed backwards down the front porch steps in her baby blue pajamas to come see us,' the site noted. 'Her big brother did not want to go to school that day and he was crying. 'Having known one another for quite some time and our kids being in daycare together, we decided to just shut the car door and go anyway, knowing his tears would be short lived. 'We waved one last time, and the car slowly pulled forward. 'Somehow in a matter of seconds Rowyn was not where we thought she was. 'Paramedics say that Rowyn was killed instantly, and despite our desperate attempts to save her life there was nothing we could have done. 'The tragedy of September 16th has left holes and emptiness in many hearts. 'There is nothing we can do to rewind the day, but we hope to honor her memory with Raise for Rowyn.' Making a difference: The two women now run a charity called Raise for Rowyn and held their first fundraiser this month in Washington. Another is set for August . Coming together: Brynn and Cassie say they think about Rowyn every day, and hope their charity will help others get through their own personal tragedies . Raise for Rowyn had a fundraiser in April 18 and there is another one scheduled for August. The initiative has already raised enough to help three families struck by tragedy.","Rowyn Johnson was 17-months-old when she was killed in September .

A mother has been arrested for referring to her African-American neighbors as 'apes' during a dispute over a parking space. Eva Chapin, 34, from West Linn, Oregon, was booked into jail after she left a string of offensive post-it notes on the door of the family home. The qualified nurse referred to the residents, who are believed to have roots in Ghana, as 'n*****' but wrote: 'I am not racist'. One of the notes, seen by KATU, read: 'Apes were never meant to drive so stop.' Another said: 'I've been here 22 years and no [expletive] and now you. U made me hate [expletive] now.' 'I'm not racist,' one of the notes allegedly said, 'but I can see how someone can become [sic] hating [expletive]. You did this. There were no [expletive] in W.L. until u came.'

'She came back from school supposed to be happy,' she said. 'This is what she saw.' 'My little daughter came from school to see this note,' she added. 'I feel like I’m not safe here.' She has been living in the neighborhood for 11 years but now plans to move.

"Protesters have demolished the front window of upmarket estate agents Foxtons during a protest against the gentrification of South London. The store front of its Brixton branch was covered in shattered glass while 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' was spray painted in black across their housing advertisements. A police spokesman confirmed that one man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Thousands of people turned up for the event organised by the Reclaim Brixton group who were demonstrating against local residents and businesses being priced out of the trendy area. One of the event's organisers denounced the violent actions of 'one idiot' but told MailOnline there could be a reason Foxtons - which has a reputation for selling expensive homes - has been 'continuously targeted'.

Defaced: The vandal then spray painted 'no evictions' and 'yuppies' on the estate agent's housing advertisements . Reputation: A spokesperson for Reclaim Brixton - who organised the event - denounced the man's violent actions but suggested there could be a reason Foxtons is 'continuously targeted' Motive: Cyndi Anaso said she is not happy about the vandalism but told MailOnline 'it suggests there's a reason they are being targeted' Response: Police at the scene in Brixton (pictured) had to us CS spray to disperse a group of violent protesters . Cyndi Anaso from Reclaim Brixton told MailOnline said she was 'saddened' that someone behaved 'deviantly' during a wholly peaceful demonstration. But she claims the upmarket estate agents have been targeted before, adding: 'Foxtons has a very poor reputation when it comes to expensive properties and unfortunately.' 'There's a message in it which I'm not happy about but it still suggests there's a reason they are being targeted. 'There's never an endorsement of the attack but nothing else on the day can be considered even slightly violent.' 'I don't even think it's right to apologise for these individuals because every protest that you watch, there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window.' Foxtons is widely considered as a sign of gentrification and its presence is an indicates that an area either is or has the potential to become very affluent. The Reclaim Brixton event was planned to demonstrate against the rising property prices in London which the group believes is 'displacing the city's communities'. A statement on the Facebook page for the event said: 'The fight against gentrification starts here! Brixton is widely known for its vibrancy, which is another word for social and cultural diversity. Keeping watch: There is still a 'police presence' outside the vandalised store in Brixton, South London following the incident . Defence: Sympathisers and Brixton locals used Twitter to condemn the attention being given to the 'isolated' act of vandalism . Break-in: The Metropolitan Police (pictured) also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall, but were removed shortly after and no arrests were made . 'But Brixton's vibrancy now has a question mark on it. Will Brixton turn into a living museum or will it live?' But alongside images of people protesting peacefully on the streets, social media has been flooded with images of hordes pushing past police and the Foxtons window being destroyed. A police spokesman added: 'A group of protesters then made their way to Brixton Road where the window of a commercial premises was smashed and graffiti sprayed on the building.' Police used CS spray on 'a small group of protesters' who went into Brixton Police Station at around 4.10pm before being removed shortly afterwards. The Metropolitan Police also said the group forced their way into Brixton Town Hall at around 3.15pm, saying: 'Officers entered the building and the protesters were removed.'

Ms Lally insisted the protest was 'really lively' but there had been 'no violence or trouble or anything like that'. Those sympathetic to Reclaim Brixton's protest and locals of the area have taken to Twitter to denounce isolated incidents of violence. Regarding the smashed window, Vanessa Furey from London said: 'Whilst sympathetic to the sentiment, idiots who have done this will have taken away what Reclaim Brixton was about.' And Louise Ridley wrote: 'I live in Brixton. I want people to know about extortionate rents and evictions.

A second person has been charged over a doorstep acid attack on a property developer that left him scarred for life and suffering a loss of vision. Property developer Andreas Christopheros, 29, was left fighting for his life when corrosive liquid was thrown in his face outside his home in Truro, Cornwall. Nicole Phillips, 45, from Hastings in East Sussex, has been charged with perverting the course of justice and is due to appear at Bodmin Magistrates Court on April 30.

"A bill that would make Hawaii the first state to raise the legal smoking age to 21 cleared the Legislature on Friday and is headed to the governor. The bill would prevent adolescents from smoking, buying or possessing both traditional and electronic cigarettes. Governor David Ige hasn't yet decided whether he will sign the bill and said he will not review it until it is vetted by his staff for any legal issues, as is the case with all bills. 'The departments will be doing their review and then we'll have the opportunity to look at it,' Ige said. Jessica Yamauchi, executive director of the Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Hawaii, called the legislation 'groundbreaking'. Jessica Yamauchi, executive director of the Coalition for a Tobacco Free Hawaii, called the legislation that could raise Hawaii's smoking age to 21 'groundbreaking'. The bill was recently passed by the state legislature . 'It's amazing to be the first state in something. That's very exciting for us.' The bill includes a $10 fine for first-time offenders. Subsequent violations would lead to a $50 fine or mandatory community service. Dozens of local governments have similar bans, including Hawaii County and New York City. According to the state Department of Heath, 5,600 kids in Hawaii try smoking each year, and 90 percent of daily smokers begin the habit before age 19. Meanwhile, 1,400 people die from tobacco use or exposure in Hawaii every year, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. 'Today we have the opportunity to change the paradigm,' said Democratic state Sen. Rosalyn Baker, who introduced the bill. The new bill will apply to both traditional cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (file photo) Smoking prevalence would fall an estimated 12 percent if the minimum smoking age was raised to 21, according to a report by the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences. The favorite flavors among teens who use electronic cigarettes are sweet tart and 'unicorn puke, which is described as a combination of every flavor of Skittle in one,' Baker said. 'While the industry is not allowed to directly market to children, it is still developing packaging and advertising products in ways that appeal to children,' she said. Sabrina Olaes, 17, got involved in promoting the legislation after finding herself in restrooms full of electronic cigarette fumes when her classmates vaped at her high school. 'You feel like you want to hold your breath because you don't want to smell what they're smoking,' Olaes said. 'It's pretty sad to know that they've fallen under the addiction.' Opponents say it's unfair that a military veteran returning from service could be prevented from smoking. 'It is not right because you are deemed an adult when you turn 18,' said Michelle Johnston, owner of Sub Ohm Vapes in Kailua-Kona, on Hawaii's Big Island. 'You can sign up and be in the military and basically give your life for your country. You can vote,' she said. 'Why shouldn't you be able to choose if you want to buy tobacco products or vaping products, when you're considered a legal adult?' Democratic Senator Gil Riviere, who voted against the bill in the 19-4 vote, said if the state wants to eliminate smoking, it should ban it for everyone. 'You can sign contracts, you can get married, you can go to war and lose an arm or lose an eye... you come back and you're 20 years old and you can't have a cigarette,' Riviere said.

"Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie. But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.","Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested mirrored satellites to collect sunlight .

"A father-of-three who was attacked by a knife-wielding robber has revealed he thought he was going to die in the 40-second assault. Mohammad Ali Akhtar was only on his second shift at the Premier Stores in Flixton, Greater Manchester, when the man stormed in brandishing a large kitchen knife and demanded all the money from the till. CCTV footage shows the hooded thief vault the counter around 8.45pm on Tuesday before wrestling with the brave cashier, who refused his demands. Scroll down for video . Mohammad Ali Akhtar, pictured (left) just after the assault, was attacked by a knife-wielding robber at the Premier Stores in Flixton, Greater Manchester, and has revealed he thought he was going to die . Mr Akhtar, who had to have 14 stitches in his ear and surgery on his hand after the attack, said: 'A man came in with a mask over his face. 'I started to tell him to take his mask off but before I could even complete what I was saying, he took the knife out of his sleeve and was said, ""give me the cash"". 'In the first second I didn't know what I should do, but then I thought, ""well I've just got to tackle him"".' At one point in the footage the pair can both be seen grappling over the knife before the shopkeeper was stabbed. This is the moment that a shopkeeper bravely tackled a knife-wielding raider who stormed into his store . Mr Akhtar said: 'In those few seconds of my life I thought I would die and I could see the knife waving around in front of my face as I was tackling him to the floor. 'I was just thinking of my wife and my children and what would happen if I wasn't here for them anymore, then I felt the sharp stabs to my ear, nose and finger.' The thief eventually managed to stagger to his feet and flee the shop empty-handed, pursued by the shopkeeper. The cashier later told police that the raider was white, between 16 to 18-years-old and was wearing black clothing. He added that he feels scared when he walks into his family kitchen and sees a knife. The raider, wearing dark coloured clothing, stormed into Premier Stores in Flixton, Manchester . The robber, armed with a large kitchen knife, leapt over the counter after demanding all the money from the till . 'I can't sleep and keep re-playing it in my head and I'm always checking on the children in the night,' he said. Detective Constable Andrew Warren said: 'First of all, I would like to commend the bravery of the victim, who despite suffering a stab wound still managed to fight off his attacker and ensure he ran away with nothing. 'However, this attack shows just how important it is that we identify this offender as soon as possible, as he was willing to resort to potentially lethal force for the sake of a few pounds. 'I would like to ask people to have a good look at the footage.

Happiness on a plate: The Mistley Thorn has been around for ten years, and revels in an understated luxury . We are paying £100 for two people, dinner, bed and breakfast. Do the sums. Dinner alone would usually be about £60; breakfast at least a tenner each. So that means the room costs a mere £20. I am almost embarrassed and seek clarification from a friendly young man called Rowan, who shows us to our room on the top floor with wonderful views across the Stour Estuary, where swans preen themselves as the sun sets and the tide recedes.

Connected: The hotel is a two-minute walk from Mistley station which has services to London Liverpool Street . I had never heard of Mistley, but what a fascinating spot, with a grand twin-towered church (designed by Robert Adam) that originally was meant to be a spa, gorgeous terraces of Georgian houses, industrial buildings near the quay that have not yet been dolled up, a Post Office. The Mistley Thorn has been around for ten years, in the capable hands of Californian Sherri Singleton. 'A bit of understated luxury,' is what it says in the directory. Bang on. Decent baths, powerful showers, Ren potions and lotions, muted colours, tongue-and-groove, real ale and terrific nosh. Well set: Built as a coaching inn circa 1723, The Mistley Thorn offers award-winning dining and accommodation . Weekends too: The Sunday lunch menu features roast Red Poll beef and local Sutton Hoo chicken . It is a Sunday evening, and plenty are in for dinner - unless they are still here from lunch. We kick off with nibbles that include a stupendous olive tapenade. Then I'm on to six Mersea Island oysters followed by superb sea bass, while my wife raves about her chowder, followed by moules with chips. Everything feels relaxed because it is so well-organised, unpretentious and welcoming.

She later was banned from the campus of 11,500 students. She was not a student at Valdosta State, according to the school. The flag-walking demonstration involved three protesters, university spokesman Andy Clark said. Meanwhile, tensions rose at Valdosta State when campus police found a backpack containing a handgun on Tuesday. Police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration, and they issued a warrant for Eric Sheppard's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus. Sheppard fled and has not been found by authorities, Clark said. Flag supporters gathered for a rally Friday afternoon, and university administrators said the possibility of thousands of people rallying on the outskirts of campus ultimately led to the decision to give students a day off. 'That level of traffic and that many people will disrupt a lot of things in the city,' Clark said. 'We're from an overall safety perspective looking to close the campus down today so they can have a peaceful rally.' Organizers of the 'Flags Over VSU' rally said they expected as many as 4,000 people Friday afternoon, WALB-TV reported . University administrators arranged for extra police to be on campus to provide security during the rally, Clark told The Valdosta Daily Times. Local law enforcement officials said the crowd that gathered was generally peaceful. Pro-flag: A flag supporter waves a large American flag while attending a rally on Friday in support of the flag . In support: Flag supporters on motorbikes attend a rally on Friday in support of Michelle Manhart . University administrators faced a backlash on social media after Manhart was issued a criminal trespass warning, essentially banning her from campus. Critics saw the university as siding with demonstrators who walked on the flag over a military veteran trying to save it. 'We were protecting their right to free speech and civil liberties' without taking sides, Clark said. NBC reports that some people T-shirts with the American flag and the words 'Try walking on this flag' written on the back and others carried signs. Cover girl: After her original feature, Manhart appeared in Playboy again. She is shown here on the cover of the Mexican edition . NBC spoke with Kim Thompson who drove 30 miles to join in the rally. 'I think it's going to be amazing. I think it's actually going to be part of history,' she said. Thompson, the wife of a sailor, said that after September 11 she became more patriotic than ever and felt that she needed to speak up after watching the flag get trampled. Michelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed by police at Valdosta State University, Georgia, and driven off in a patrol car after grabbing the Stars and Stripes and refusing to return it to the student demonstrators last week. Video footage of the event, last Friday, shows Manhart struggling with officers, who force her to the ground after she refuses to let the flag go. It shows her surrounded by protesters on the campus, who demand their property be returned. In response, Manhart says the flag belongs to 'the entire United States'. Campus police try to convince her to drop the flag, but Manhart, a former training sergeant who served in Kuwait, refuses. Speaking to the Valdosta Daily Times about her intervention, she said: 'I did not want anything like this, but I got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground, and they were walking on it. 'I was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground. I don’t know what their cause is, but I went to pick it up because it doesn’t deserve to be on the ground.' She continued: 'If your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them. 'But to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom. You have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it. I’m not fighting against them. I’m fighting against the way they are going about it.' Cause: Manhart came to the campus because she heard students were walking on the flag, as seen above . Air Force to bare force: Manhart was once a Staff Sergeant at the San Antonio Air Force training camp (right), but was demoted when she appeared nude in Playboy magazine. She is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread . According to the Daily Times, the group didn't want to press charges against Manhart. However, police gave her a trespass warning, which bans her from the campus. Manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before. In 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for Playboy magazine. Explicit photographs from the periodical's February 2007 issue show then-Sergeant Manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with, then later without - her military uniform. When Air Force bosses got wind of the racy feature, they relieved her of her duties at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was later demoted, and ultimately left the Air Force. However, she remained defiant, telling reporters at the time 'I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't think it would be a major issue'. The decision brought an end to 14 years of service . She later appeared in other editions of Playboy - including the cover of the Mexican edition -  and posed for animal rights group Peta to support an anti-fur campaign. The Daily Times reported that Manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on Wednesday. In response to the incident, the university's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest, but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose. Dr William McKinney said: 'The American flag represents everything that is best about our country. As the Supreme Court has held, one of those things is the right to free speech, which includes the right to disrespect even the symbol of our country. 'While I firmly disagree with the actions of the protesters, I understand their right to protest.'","Hundreds protested an Air Force vet and former Playboy model's arrest when she tried to stop people from trampling on a flag .

"Britain's first black prime minister will be a Conservative, David Cameron will claim today. In a bid to woo ethnic minority voters, Mr Cameron will say the Tories are the party of opportunity for people from all backgrounds who want to get on. He will also set out targets for ethnic minority recruitment designed to persuade voters the party is on their side. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron will say the Conservative party will one day be the party of the first black or Asian prime minister . Highlighting Margaret Thatcher’s record as Britain’s first – and only – female prime minister, he will say: ‘We’re the party of the first female prime minister. The party of the first Jewish prime minister. And I know that, one day, we’re going to be the party of the first black or Asian prime minister.’ ‘I want this to be an opportunity country, where no matter who you are or where you’re from; whether you’re black, white, Asian or mixed race – whether you’re from the inner city or rural heartlands, you can make the most of your talents.’ The claim will be seen as a tacit endorsement of the leadership ambitions of Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, the only current Asian Tory seen as a potential contender. It is designed to tackle the Tories’ long-standing difficulty in attracting support from Britain’s growing ethnic minority electorate. The claim will be seen as a tacit endorsement of the leadership ambitions of Culture Secretary Sajid Javid (pictured), the only current Asian Tory seen as a potential contender . A report by the Runnymede Trust think-tank last week warned that suspicion of the Tories among ethnic minority voters could cost the party nine seats at next month’s election and 50 within a decade. Some senior Tories believe Mr Cameron has done too little to address the party’s reputation among ethnic minority voters – and warn that the party could face similar problems to the US republicans unless it acts quickly. Mr Cameron will today pledge to ensure that, by the next election, at least 20 per cent of Tory candidates in seats where a Conservative MP is standing down will be from an ethnic minority background. The figure this year is 18 per cent. At the time of the last census in 2011, 14 per cent of the UK population was identified as black or minority ethnic. But the Prime Minister will today set targets to achieve 20 per cent ethnic representation in the recruitment of police officers. The current figure is just 8.3 per cent. A 10 per cent target will also be set for the armed forces, to hit 20 per cent in the long term. At present the figure for recruits is 5.7 per cent. New targets will also be set to increase by 20 per cent the number of black and ethnic minority students going to university, being offered apprenticeships and getting jobs. Mr Cameron will say: ‘Our mission is to make sure that as our economy recovers, people from every community share in that prosperity. ‘But there are more specific things we can do to make sure we spread opportunity to every community. So I’m setting some ambitious but realistic aspirations for the next five years, specifically for the black and minority ethnic communities.’ Boris Johnson has said Britain needs to train more crane drivers and IT experts to stop migrants filling jobs. The Mayor of London claimed the UK has too many hairdressers and not enough young people learning to do the jobs the economy needs. He said the country’s IT industry desperately needs computer programmers, while building sites need crane operators – and both are often forced to depend on foreign labour. Mr Johnson said colleges had to work more closely with businesses to teach teenagers the skills they need to land well-paid jobs, which would help to reduce the reliance on migrants. He said he did not want to ‘tell talented foreigners to bog off’, but to ensure young people growing up in the UK were able to take the high-skilled jobs which have seen average wages start to rise. The Mayor, who is the Tory candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, told MailOnline: ‘Do we need more crane operators and fewer hairdressers? I think the answer to that at the moment is yes. Do we need more people who can do coding for IT, the answer is absolutely yes. ‘We have a desperate shortage of those sorts of skills ... we have got to up-skill the UK labour force.’","Prime Minister says Conservatives will be party of first black or Asian PM .

"Winner: Simon Wood took home the TV crown . A single father of four was crowned MasterChef champion last night, fulfilling a dream to become a chef that he has nurtured since he was eight. Simon Wood, 38, battled it out against Emma Spitzer and Tony Rodd as they were challenged to cook judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace a three-course meal in three hours. The final followed seven weeks of tough challenges, including the 'chef's table', which involved cooking one of three courses on a menu set up by Italian chef Massimo Bottura. It brings to an end the eleventh series of the popular BBC weekly amateur cooking contest. Mr Wood, a data manager from Oldham in Greater Manchester, served a starter of octopus with chorizo and cannellini beans followed by a main of squab pigeon served two ways with blackberry sauce, watercress puree and carrots. He finished with a dessert of lemon posset topped with seven garnishes – citrus tutti-frutti, charred grapefruit and orange, a lime tuile, limoncello pistachio crumb, edible flowers, tarragon leaves and a lime air. After he presented the dishes to the judges, Torode said: 'Do you know why I love you? Because you take something quite ordinary and make it special.' Wallace said: 'Simon is brilliant, he's an incredible talent.' After being crowned the winner, Mr Wood said: 'I'm shaking inside, it's so surreal, I can't begin to describe how happy I am. It's life changing.' Finalist Mr Rodd, 33, is an architectural recruitment consultant from London, while Miss Spitzer is the managing director of a luxury travel business and mother to four daughters under nine. Finalists: Simon Wood, 38, right, battled it out against Emma Spitzer, left, and Tony Rodd, centre, as they were challenged to cook judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace a three-course meal in three hours . Mr Wood said: 'I have been cooking since I could reach the top of the oven, and I always cooked at weekends with my grandma. 'When I was eight I won a competition where the prize was to have your dream job for the day and mine was to be a chef. Thirty years later who would have thought I would have the MasterChef trophy in my hands.' Momentous: Kim Woodward is the first woman to be appointed head chef at the Savoy Grill . A former MasterChef semi-finalist has become the first woman to run the prestigious Savoy Grill kitchen in its 126-year history. Kim Woodward has been appointed head chef at the famous venue, which has hosted lunches for the likes of prime ministers, musicians and captains of industry for decades. The 34-year-old follows in the footsteps of a string of maître chefs who have headed the kitchen since its opening in the Strand, London in 1889. Ms Woodward, who lives in Camden, said: ‘It is an absolute honour for me to be the head chef here in one of London’s most iconic restaurants. Obviously there is so much history here, and the people who come through the door come here for the classic dishes that the Grill is famous for.’ At the five-star, art deco Grill, which is now part of the Gordon Ramsay stable, Woodward will head a team of about 35 chefs, of whom some 40 per cent are women. It marks her return to the venue — she was a sous chef between 2010 and 2012, before becoming head chef at the York & Albany gastropub in Camden. She reached the semi-final of the 2011 series of MasterChef: The Professionals.","Single father Simon Wood, 38, fulfilled childhood dream of becoming a chef .

"Two gunmen have assassinated prominent Pakistani women's rights activist Sabeen Mahmud by pulling up next to her vehicle at a traffic light and spraying it with bullets. Photographs taken of her vehicle show her sandals remained resting in the footwell of the driver's seat, while the exterior of the white vehicle was left stained with her blood. While investigators declined to speculate on a motive for the killing, friends and colleagues immediately described her death as a targeted assassination in Pakistan - a country with a nascent democracy where the military and intelligence services still hold tremendous sway. Scroll down for video . Assassinated women's rights activist Sabeen Mahmud's sandals remain in the footwell of her car, where she was gunned down on Friday night . A Pakistani cameraman films her car hours after she was gunned down by two men on a motorcycle . Pakistani police officers examine the damaged car, who was killed as she returned to her home in Karachi . The gunmen shot both Mahmud and her mother, Mehnaz Mahmud, as they stopped at a traffic light Friday night in an upscale Karachi neighborhood, senior police officer Zafar Iqbal said. Later, journalists saw their car at a nearby police station, the front driver's side window smashed out and the pair of sandals on the floorboard with broken glass all around them. Blood stained the car's white body. 'Two men riding a motorcycle opened fire on the car,' Iqbal said, adding that Mehmud 'died on her way to the hospital. Her mother was also wounded.' Alia Chughtai, a close friend of Mahmud, said that she was driving at the time of attack and her mother was sitting next to her. She added that Mahmud's driver, who escaped unharmed, was sitting in the back seat at the time of the attack but she was unsure why the driver wasn't driving the car. Mr Iqbal and other police officials declined to offer a motive for the slaying. However, earlier that night Mahmud hosted an event at her organization called The Second Floor to discuss human rights in Baluchistan, an impoverished but resource-rich southwestern province bordering Iran. Thousands of people have disappeared from the province in recent years amid a government crackdown on nationalists and insurgent groups there. Activists blame the government for the disappearances, something authorities deny. Qadeer Baluch, an activist who last year led a nearly 3,000-kilometer (1,900-mile) protest march across Pakistan to demand justice for the missing in Baluchistan, attended the event. He hinted that the government could be involved in Mahmud's slaying. People carry the casket Sabeen Mahmud, who was killed by two unknown gunmen on a motorcycle . 'Everybody knows who killed her and why,' Baluch told Pakistan's The Nation newspaper, without elaborating. 'The programme organisers were already receiving threats. It is very difficult to talk about Baluchistan in Pakistan.' Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned Mahmud's killing and ordered an investigation into the attack. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad also condemned Mahmud's slaying and offered condolences to her loved ones. Mahmud was 'a courageous voice of the Pakistani people and her death represents a great loss,' it said. She was a well-known activist who also ran a small tech company, hosted poetry readings, computer workshops and other events at The Second Floor. She continued to live in Karachi, Pakistan's southern port city, even while acknowledging the danger from insurgent groups and criminals operating there. 'Fear is just a line in your head,' Mahmud told Wired magazine in 2013. 'You can choose what side of that line you want to be on.' Pakistan's powerful army condemned the killing, pledging that the country's intelligence agencies would assist in the investigation.

"In the previews for Bruce Jenner's much-anticipated interview with Diane Sawyer, he said that his whole life has been getting him ready for this moment - and truly, the Olympian's changing looks over the years most certainly seem to have been building up to some kind of dramatic transformation. Since achieving fame in 1976, when he won Olympic gold in the men's decathlon, Bruce, now 65, has notoriously undergone countless cosmetic procedures, from multiple nose jobs to the shaving down of his Adam's apple, many of which - including a revisionary face lift - have been documented as part of his well-known reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Now sporting manicures and ponytails, the former Playgirl cover hunk has evolved from being the picture of American manliness into a favorite feminine topic of tabloid speculation. Scroll down for video . Moving with the times: Bruce Jenner's face has changed dramatically over the years, and the star has finally spoken out about speculation that he is transitioning. He confirmed this is the last time he will appear as Bruce before becoming 'her' After taking home the gold, Bruce was a national hero - and a national heartthrob. Muscles bulging, the athletic champ quickly became the media's darling, and appeared in a variety of advertisements, including a Wheaties box cover, as well as many magazine covers. In 1982, he famously posed shirtless on the cover of Playgirl magazine alongside then-wife Linda Thompson, now 64, epitomizing the manly ideal of a strong athlete with a hairy chest. But underneath that uber-masculine exterior, Bruce confirms, he was already looking to transition from a man to a woman. Boyhood flashback: Bruce shows no hint of his future penchant for pony tails  in his closely cropped high school yearbook photo in 1968 . Crossing the finish line: The former athlete hasn't looked like the Olympian who won gold, here in 1976, for years. While competing in the iconic sporting event, Bruce was known for his bulging muscles and athletic physique . Body hair gone: Since this hairy-legged high jumper competed in Canada in 1976, he has reportedly undergone numerous electrolysis treatments, and photos from the 1975 Pan Am Games show a much more hirsute physique . He told Diane Sawyer that in the mid-1980s, he started hormone therapy and was undergoing electrolysis to rid himself of his 'repulsive' facial hair, and had already gone under the knife in a bid to make himself look more like a woman. In 1984, he got what his future step-daughter Kim Kardashian would later describe as an 'ill-advised' nose job and facelift. He had also noticeably begun thinning out his eyebrows, which only made him look like a better-groomed metrosexual. In fact, Bruce had even been considering getting gender reassignment surgery - until, divorced from Linda Thompson, he began dating his future wife Kris Jenner, known as the matriarch-turned-momager of the Kardashian clan, and changed his mind. Swingin' 70s hunk: As an athlete who gained national recognition in the 1970s, Bruce, shown here in 1978, once oozed masculine sex appeal . His eyes have barely changed, but Bruce is now virtually unrecognizable as the testosterone-fueled man pictured here in 1981 . 1980s: The buff Olympic hero evolved from scruffy athlete to polished celebrity as he cleaned up his hairstyle and began thinning his eyebrows. He is seen far right in 1985 . 1990s: Before the end of the decade, Bruce admitted that he had at least six procedures on his face, including nose jobs and face lifts . 2000s: Bruce's hair got shorter and his skin got smoother as Keeping Up With The Kardashians propelled his family to superstardom . 2010s: The TV patriarch pierced his ears and grew his hair longer again as the naughties past . But though he put a hold on his plans to live his life as a transgender woman, Bruce continued to play with his appearance throughout the 1990s. During the first few years of his marriage to Kris, Bruce's appearance remained much the same, although he would sometimes let his hair grow out a bit longer, which only served to draw more attention to the numerous cosmetic surgeries Bruce is known to have undergone during this time. Before the year 2000, the former Olympian admitted that he had undergone at least six procedures on his face, including nose jobs and face lifts. 'If you Google my name, the worst plastic surgeries of all time or whatever it is… they've compared me to Michael Jackson,' he once said. So in 2009, Bruce went under the knife again, ostensibly to 'correct' his previous procedures, a process which was documented closely on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Pictured here in 1982 in costume, Bruce was still considered the height of manliness at this time, having won a gold medal and appeared on the cover of Playgirl . Pearly whites: Jenner has also gotten and maintained a fantastic set of teeth, even more perfect in 2014, right, than they were decades ago . In 2009 Bruce had a revisionary face lift. He is seen, left, in 2007 and, right, with a smoother jawline in 2013 . Indeed, fans of the reality show have continued to watch as Bruce's appearance has changed more and more since the show premiered in 2007. When the family rose to a previously uncharted level of reality show fame, Bruce adapted to his new Hollywood lifestyle, often showcasing an orange-toned tan while appearing on the red carpet, and even piercing his ears in 2011. But as his marriage to Kris began to fall apart, the former star athlete gradually started revisiting his old desires to transition. His simple gold studs were switched out for diamonds, his hair grew down to his shoulders, and, in 2014, he began going out in public with colorful, perfectly-pampered manicures. Ear-ily feminine: Bruce made headlines when he pierced both of his ears in 2011; in 2012 (pictured here), he upgraded from simple gold studs to flashy diamonds . January 2012: Ellen Pierson, who married Kris Jenner's ex-husband Robert Kardashian, claimed Bruce had been a cross-dresser 'for years'. She claimed his first wife Chrystie Crownover told her he had a penchant for women's clothing, shoes and lingerie. That same month, Star magazine alleged that Kris was unfazed by her husband's odd habit and that he continued to cross-dress for years after their 1991 wedding. January 2014: The Olympic gold medalist reportedly underwent a laryngeal shave to flatten his Adam's apple. May 2014: Bruce refused to cut his long hair for Kim Kardashian's wedding, despite pressure from the bride and his estranged wife Kris Jenner. August 2014: Photos appeared to show Bruce had breasts, sparking rumors he was having hormone therapy as he explored the idea of transitioning from male to female. September 2014: As his divorce from Kris was being finalized, Bruce started growing out his hair and shaving his legs. November 2014: He was spotted on various occasions wearing nail polish, a sports bra, and Spanx. January 2015: When asked about her step-father's changing appearance, Kim Kardashian said he was on a 'journey' and added: 'He'll share whenever the time is right.' February 2015: TMZ reported that Bruce told his family that he has known he was meant to be a female since the age of five. March 2015: People magazine claims Bruce's ex-wives Chrystie Crownover and Linda Thompson knew how he felt and both were supportive. The same month he had rhinoplasty to give himself a more feminine nose. March 31: It was claimed Bruce had had breast implants. April 6: ABC News announced that Bruce would do a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer. April 24: Bruce finally confirms his gender transition, telling Sawyer: 'I am a woman.' From 2012 (left) to 2013 (right), Bruce grew his hair longer and began being pictured with glossy lips . Bruce experimented with other coifs in the late 1980s and early 1990s as well, opting for a slightly lengthier look, for example, at the 1989 Country Music Awards (left). At this point, Jenner revealed, he was already taking hormones and had done electrolysis . Transition underway: The gold medalist revealed a suspiciously smooth chest, legs, and arms during a trip to Greece with his family in 2013 (right), a marked change from the hairy, muscular man pictured during a Sports Illustrated shoot in 1980 (left) Changing body: In March, Bruce sparked further speculation about his plans to transition, when he was pictured with what appeared to be breasts, just a few months after it was reported that he had undergone a breast augmentation . In the spotlight: Discussion about Bruce's long hair and full lips has been increasing for months leading up to his interview with Diane Sawyer. This grab from Keeping up with the Kardashians was filmed last fall . While his go-to ponytail and bright nail polish are only superficial, if shocking, changes, Bruce hasn't abandon the use of surgical procedures. He notably had his Adam's Apple shaved down in 2014, first sparking widespread rumors that he would come out as transgender. Since then, rumors have circulated he has gotten lip fillers and breast implants - both of which can possibly be seen in recent photos of the television star - in order to more completely transition into living his life as a woman.","For the first time after worldwide speculation, Bruce Jenner confirmed to Diane Sawyer: 'I am a woman'

"An Indiana university was in lockdown late on Friday night after a 'likely prank call' about an armed person near the main administration building, school officials said. Police said they received a phone call from someone saying that they had stabbed their roommate at the university, was armed with a shotgun and threatening to blow up the administration building, according to WTHR. Manchester University had issued a statement advising students at its North Manchester campus, some 36 miles  west of Fort Wayne, to shelter in place.

"The humble honeybee may only be small, but scientists are hoping to use its brain to power a series of futuristic-style drones. Boffins are currently working towards digitally recreating the cognitive abilities of the Apis Mellifera or European Honeybee. Their final aim is to build a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like the tiny insects. Scientists are working towards building a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like a honeybee . Professor James Marshall said if they were able to recreate a fraction of the honeybees ability they would have made 'tremendous advances' The artificial brain is being created by the Green Brain Project, which is a collaboration between researchers from the Universities of Sheffield and Sussex. One day it is hoped the remote controlled machines could be used to pollinate crops or even assist on search and rescue missions. 'Bees and all other insects are miracles of engineering which we are nowhere near equalling,' Professor James Marshall reportedly told the BBC. 'If we could even recreate a fraction of their abilities in a robot system then we would have made a tremendous advance.' Building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far, scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee's brain which allows it to see. To do this they mapped out the  brain of the honeybee and recreated it with circuits that fire on and off in an organic brain, Discovery Magazine reported. The software is then uploaded into the drone's circuitry which enables it to  fly around in a similar fashion to the bee. The projects team now has three quadcopters and one ground robot, each with unique abilities and configurations. Tests are being carried out in a dedicated flying room based at the University of Sheffield. In a video footage showing initial tests the drone, powered by the artificial bee brain, can be seen flying down a corridor. On the Green Brain website it states: 'Since the start of the project, the GB team has setup the lab, built and tested our robots, and begun to demonstrate some sophisticated visual-based navigation and cognitive functions through embodiment. 'Current projects include navigation using the GB models, flight tests of our models with the BeeBot quadcopter, developing a Ground Control Station, initial testing with the chemosensors and more.'

"The number plate that got Jeremy Clarkson and his former Top Gear colleagues harangued out of Argentina was a direct reference to the Falklands War, a judge has ruled. While the BBC claimed the plate, which read H982 FKL, was an 'unhappy coincidence', Maria Cristina Barrionuevo said they were deliberately 'provoking people' when they drove it through the country last year. In a report released earlier this week she slammed their actions as 'arrogant and disrespectful'. Scroll down for video . A judge has ruled the controversial number plate that led to Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear colleagues being thrown out of Argentina was a deliberate reference to the 1982 Falklands War . Clarkson and his colleagues fled the South American country last year when their convoy - which was led by a Porsche bearing the controversial number plate - came under attack. A village of Falklands War veterans targeted the team as they drove through Patagonia, with Clarkson claiming in one account that they stormed their hotel. They were accused of deliberately inciting conflict with the plate, an alleged reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Afterwards producers removed the plate and replaced it with another. Investigating whether this was illegal, Mrs Barrionuevo said: 'It should be understood that it is not up to me to investigate or evaluate the decision - arrogant and disrepectful to say the least - by the Top Gear production team to enter the country with one or more Malvinas-referenced number plates. 'Nor is it my job to gauge the reaction - anticipated - of citizens to such an offence. Clarkson (pictured this week) said an angry mob targeted the Top Gear team in their hotel. His producer, Andy Wilman (right), who announced his resignation on Wednesday, denied deliberately using the plate . 'My responsibility is to analyse whether a crime has been committed under Argentinian law in relation to the removal from the Porsche of the original number plate H982 FKL and its replacement by another.' Concluding Top Gear chiefs had not acted in 'bad faith' in changing the plates and their hand was forced by 'massive government and popular pressure', she added: 'It led them to remove the original number plate and replace it with another which in principle wouldn't have negative connotations with the aim of ending the main focus of conflict and avoiding violent reactions by locals which indeed ended up taking place. 'The change was not done in a surreptitious way, but with the knowledge and approval of the presenters who participated in meetings with the programme producers.' Local prosecutors have already been informed of the decision and are understood to be preparing an appeal. Judges in the nearby city of Rio Grande - where Clarkson’s Porsche is thought to be in storage - are now expected to be asked to order Clarkson and his pals to be called in for a court grilling by overturning Mrs Barrionuevo's decision. The group's convoy was attacked as they drove through Patagonia. They abandoned the cars in Argentina to flee the country . Clarkson, 55, and co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May fled Argentina with a police escort after being told to leave the country as angry Falklands War veterans threatened to kill him. They cut short filming for a Christmas special and took flew to the capital Buenos Aires before returning to Britain. Nearly 30 other members of the film crew were stoned as they headed for Chile by road and had to abandon Clarkson’s Porsche and the cars his co-hosts had driven on a 1,400-mike trip through southern Argentina. The number plate that sparked calls for a full criminal probe - HI VAE - was found on the battered Porsche which was attacked by a furious mob after it was left at the side of the road. A local councillor in Ushuaia later claimed the digits 269 on the number plate of the Ford Mustang Richard Hammond had driven were close to the 255 Britons killed during the war - and the numbers 646 on James May’s Lotus could be taken as a reference to the 649 Argentinian casualties. The furore sparked a diplomatic incident with Argentina’s ambassador Alicia Castro calling the H982 plate 'malicious mockery' of those who fought in the 1982 Falklands War. Andy Wilman, who this week announced he was resigning from the show, insisted it was 'completely untrue' the Clarkson car had been chosen for its number plate or that an alternative plate was substituted for the original one. Clarkson told the Argentinian ambassador she could 'go fooey' ahead of the screening of the Top Gear special last December. The presenters were filming a Christmas special in the South American country last year when the controversy erupted . He is now rumoured to be working on a new car show format with Wilman which they are expected to take to a rival British TV channel, Netflix or Amazon. They were spotted in London on Thursday with Richard Hammond and James May, entering Clarkson’s home before leaving together for a drink at a local pub. Hammond, 45, has joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear following Clarkson's sacking, insisting yesterday/on Friday he had no plan to 'quit my mates.' Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. The incident led to the BBC deciding not to renew Clarkson’s contract after the current Top Gear series finishes. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would ‘not be pursuing the matter any further.’","The plate - H982 FKL - was on Clarkson's Porsche during Christmas special .

"It was good while it lasted. Starbucks announced late Friday night that a computer outage that affected registers at 8,000 stores in the US and Canada, prompting baristas to give away free drinks, has now been resolved. The global coffeehouse chain said in an update on its site that stores are expected to open for 'business as usual' Saturday. The company said earlier the outage affected 7,000 stores in the US and 1,000 in Canada. It did not explain exactly what caused the outage, which began in the early evening on the East Coast and in the late afternoon on the West Coast. Scroll down for video . No coffee here: A Starbucks store closes Friday in Phoenix because of computer issues. Starbucks says a sales register computer glitch has disrupted sales at company-operated stores in the US and Canada . It's free! A nationwide shutdown of Starbucks' computer system Friday evening prompted baristas to give away free coffee . Excited Twitter users spread the word about the giveaway, sharing photos of the free-of-charge drinks . Happy customer: User Joshua Decker praised the fine service at a Starbucks store in Redmond, Washington while posing with his free beverages . Store No. 1: There were plenty of satisfied customers at Starbucks' first-ever store in Seattle . The company offered free drinks and baked goods to customers before saying stores that had not already closed for the evening Friday were closing early. Earlier in the day, a young barrista named Jaleel working at a Starbucks coffeehouse on 8th Street in Manhattan told Daily Mail their system went down at around 7.30pm. The computer glitch prevented staff from accepting credit cards or ringing up sales, but Starbucks workers at the East Village location were still accepting cash. Some people who were standing in line at around 8.30pm had their wallets in hand. At one point, Jaleel walked up to a middle-age man waiting to get his coffee and let him know that their system was down and they were unable to take credit cards. In response, the customer flashed several folded banknotes. Starbucks released a statement on its website saying the company is aware of the point-of-sale register outage in the US and Canada. Greed is good: This giddy Starbucks patron took full advantage of Friday's one-of-a-kind giveaway . Get it while it's free: For some fans of the popular coffeehouse chain, the joy proved short-lived. According to Twitter users, many Starbucks locations around the country closed their doors so as not to give away free products during the shutdown . 'We are actively working to resolve the outage and our stores will remain open and continue to serve our customers,' the statement read. 'The outage was caused by a failure during a daily system refresh. We apologize to our customers for any inconvenience or confusion and will update this statement once systems are back online. This outage also affects our Evolution Fresh and Teavana stores.' Twitter immediately lit up with messages from giddy Starbucks customers spreading the word about the impromptu coffee giveaway and sharing photos of their free-of-charge Frappuccinos, venti mochas and soy lattes. 'Got myself a breakfast sandwich & iced tea at #Starbucks for free just now to be fair, I did pay for a drink earlier this afternoon,' boasted user Karen Chu, from Los Angeles. Another LA resident by the moniker @octopuscandy bragged: 'Starbucks systems are down so I got my drink for free. Seems like all Starbucks are doing this. Be sure to tip the barista!' Twitter user iamgrant quipped: 'Who wants to go to Starbucks with me tonight? I'll buy.' But for some fans of the popular coffeehouse chain, the joy proved short-lived.

"Gary Field, pictured,  was seen at a Ukip event in South Thanet awaiting the arrival of Nigel Farage . Nigel Farage was at the centre of fresh controversy last night after National Front members turned up to campaign for him in the South Thanet constituency. The row started after a group of far-Right supporters calling themselves the East Kent English Patriots supported Mr Farage at an event in Broadstairs on Friday evening. They were led by Gary Field, a former regional organiser for the English Defence League, and enjoyed the protection of Ukip’s security teams, which encircled the Broadstairs Pavilion. Mr Field, who has a criminal record for assault, drank beers behind the cordon with fellow members of his group and gestured to onlookers as a crowd waited for Mr Farage’s arrival. Yesterday, Mr Farage’s Labour opponent in South Thanet, Will Scobie, claimed a group of his campaigners had been attacked by National Front members chanting for Ukip in Broadstairs late on Friday. When Mr Farage realised that Mr Field and his supporters had been seen by this newspaper on Friday evening, he moved quickly to disown them, saying: ‘Members of an extremist group today arrived at a Ukip public meeting at the same time as a Mail on Sunday camera arrives.’ Mr Farage’s comments triggered a war of words with the patriots group, which immediately posted a message saying: ‘We went to Ukip meeting with members of Kent NF and after the meeting Nigel Farage went on Twitter saying we have far right extremists here... the question is nig, do you want our vote or not?’ An anti-Ukip campaigner, Bunny La Roche, claims she was followed into a cafe by Mr Field earlier this month after she turned up to protest at a Ukip rally in Margate on April 11. She has reported him to police for alleged assault after he sprayed Lynx deodorant in her face. Shortly after the incident, Mr Field posted offensive messages about Mr Scobie, writing: ‘Will scobie you are a liebour [sic] paedo supporting ponse you won’t beat ukip in south thanet you dirty little scummy traitor.’ He added: ‘I have the lynx effect on lefties.’ Gary Field, in the white hat,  said he was opposed to the 'stand up to Ukip group' and the extreme left . Mr Field is a former regional organiser of the EDL and was waiting for Ukip leader Nigel Farage, pictured . Mr Field was tagged in 2013 for breaching a community service order after being found guilty of assault. Mr Field said yesterday: ‘I am against Labour and oppose the stand-up to Ukip group. I did spray her [Bunny] with deodorant. It was just banter. ‘She and her people are on the extreme Left. I am not a member of any political party and I don’t intimidate people.’ A Ukip spokesman said: ‘We don’t know who Gary Field is, and therefore we have no responsibility for the actions he takes or the events that he attends. We have made our stance on extremist groups clear. We have no truck with them. End of.’","Former EDL organiser Gary Field was spotted at a Ukip event in Kent .

"An Australian doctor is the face of the latest Islamic State propaganda video in which the terrorist organisation announces the launch of its own health service in Syria. The propaganda video shows a man with an Australian accent who calls himself 'Abu Yusuf' and calls on foreign doctors to travel to the ISIS stronghold Raqqa to help launch the ISHS (the Islamic State Health Service), which appears to be mimicking Britain's National Health Service. The vision shows Yusuf handling babies in a maternity ward while wearing western-style blue surgical scrubs and a stethoscope. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . An Australian doctor who calls himself 'Abu Yusuf' is geatured in the latest Islamic State propaganda video in which the terrorist organisation announces the launch of the Islamic State Health Service . The video's poster shows a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an western-style blue surgical scrubs which appear to mimic Britain's National Health Service . The vision, which is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group, shows Yusuf interviewed inside the paediatric ward of a Syrian hospital. 'My name is Abu Yusuf. I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah,’ he says. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' He claims to be sad he delayed travelling to Syria for so long. ‘It is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary from a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.' Yusuf  is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients . The vision is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Yusuf urges foreign Muslims with medical training to come forward and join the latest caliphate initiative. ‘We really need your help. It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' The video also features an Indian physiologist called Abu Muqatil al-Hindi, who says the physical therapy centre is ‘one of them most important areas that any hospital should have.’ The physiologist says there are already Australian physiologists in the wing, but he encourages more doctors to travel to Syria to help the struggling medical service. The video also features an Indian physiologist called Abu Muqatil al-Hindi, who  encourages more doctors to travel to Syria to help the struggling medical service . Abu Yusuf al-Australi calls upon foreigners with medical training to join the Islamic State's new medical initiative . Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones confirmed the authenticity of the video to Daily Mail Australia. ‘I’m familiar with IS propaganda and this is certainly legit,' he said. ‘The video is interesting because it’s trying to communicate a sense of normalcy within the caliphate. The babies, ambulances and modern medical equipment are a far cry from the barbarity of their other videos.’ ‘In reality, the conditions are not accurate: Syria remains a very hostile environment. But it communicates a major shift in their recruitment.’ Dr Jones believes the group are trying to attract more sophisticated demographic than in the past, when they targeted disillusioned youths. ‘They are asking for foreigners with medical training and an education, and they aren’t trying to lure them for militant purposes. This poses an interesting question: is this still considered radicalisation?’ Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Pictured from left to right: Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah, Lena Maumoon Abdulqadir and Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah . The four women and five men apparently kept their plans secret from their families and fled to Syria .             Left to right: Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Sami Ahmed Kadir and Ismail Hamadoun .

The footage, which appeared on social media on Thursday, comes after nine Brritish medical students travelled to Syria last month, claiming they were going to help treat victims of the civil war. The students are all believed to be of Sudanese origin and were studying at a medical school in Khartoum, Sudan. The students have been named as Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir, Nada Sami Kader, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tasneem Suleyman Huseyin, Ismail Hamdoun, Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah, Mohammed Osama Badri Mohammed, Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah and Sami Ahmed Kadir. Former Melbourne man turned Islamic State recruiter Neil Prakash (above) has featured in recnt propaganda videos . In February, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis announced an $18 million initiative to battle extremist propaganda. The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of technology experts to assess the impact of online extremist propaganda. The government also plans to seek the help of platforms such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, to counter extremist messages. This week, senior Islamic State commander Abu Khaled al-Cambodi released a propaganda video where he ordered his 'beloved brothers' to 'rise up' and attack targets in Australia. The former Melbourne man was a key figure in police investigations surrounding a plot which was foiled last week which saw teenagers allegedly planning to attack police during today’s Anzac Day ceremony. Police have charged three men over  the shocking plot which would have seen a police officer run over and killed with a knife.

"Tara Reid's boyfriend was reportedly fired from his high-flying job at a health insurance firm for cheating them out of more than $100,000 by wasting their money on his company credit card. Aaron Kaufman, the former chief technology officer of Blue Shield, has been accused by his former employer of blowing thousands of dollars on vacations, hotel stays and lavish nights out with Reid. Blue Shield also mentioned Reid in their complaint, saying that at one event bankrolled by Kaufman's card she 'behaved inappropriately' by posting raunchy images of herself at the event to social media. Splashing the cash: Aaron Kaufman (left) is accused of blowing more than $100,000 on his company credit card by former employers Blue Shield, a health insurance firm. A lawsuit company spells out several cases of alleged overspending, including one where his girlfriend Tara Reid posted 'inappropriate' pictures (right) 'Employees were embarrassed': Blue Shield claimed that Miss Reid's antics upset fellow workers - and also set the company back $879 - part of an alleged $100,000 unjustifiable spending spree . According to a legal complaint, seen by the LA Times, Reid caused a 'great disturbance' by uploading images of herself at a San Francisco bowling alley in early January. The pictures appear to correspond with bikini pictures Reid put on her Instagram page dated January 7th this year where she flaunts her body while sitting in front of one of the lanes. Reid, 39, shot to fame on the back of roles in The Big Lebowski and American Pie, and now features in the overblown Sharknado franchise. Blue Shield was billed $879.84 for the night, according to the suit. Of the event, it said: 'At some point during the evening, Mr. Kaufman's girlfriend acted inappropriately, taking inappropriate photographs of herself and sharing them. 'Word of the behavior at the bowling alley event spread quickly at Blue Shield and caused a great disturbance within the company. Employees were embarrassed.' Luxury: Pictured is the W hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Flordia, where Kaufman is accused of spending $832 of Blue Shield's money on a single night with Reid . The company also alleges tens of thousands of dollars in other inappropriate spending - including a $17,491 vacation in Florida to see Reid. The two were dating despite Kaufman being married to another woman. Other listings in the more than $100,000 total include a night with Reid at the W hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which cost $832. He is also accused of running up a tab of $1,382 on drinks at the Warwick nightclub in Hollywood. He also spent $832 for one night at the W hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with Reid on Jan. 21, according to the company. Three weeks later, he ran up a corporate tab of $1,382 on drinks at the Warwick, a Hollywood nightclub, they claim. In total the company says that three quarters of his spending on the corporate card had no obvious business purpose, and that even legitimately spending was excessively lavish. Big spender: The company has also accused him of running up a $1,382 bar tab at the Warwick nightclub in Hollywood, pictured . The company is seeking the money back as well as unspecified damages. It is not clear what Kaufman's regular salary at Blue Shield was - but an earlier lawsuit he filed against Blue Shield claimed he was due an annual bonus of $450,000, implying his regular pay was larger still. According to Blue Shield, when confronted about the spending, Kaufman defended himself by saying his cash was 'locked up' his bank account and credit cards because the two were going through a divorce. Kaufman originally picked the legal fight with Blue Shield. A previous LA Times report from the start of April said that Kaufman sued them first, claiming he had been wrongly fired one day before his bonus was due. According to that suit, the dispute was punishment after Kaufman stood up to his bosses for wasting money. Blue Shield denies the allegations. Reid had not spoken publicly about her relationship with Kaufman, but has referenced an unnamed boyfriend in social media posts.","Aaron Kaufman, former chief technology officer at Blue Shield, was fired .

"It is a remarkable, eye-popping portrait of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Entitled 'Naughty Nicola', the painting depicts her as a dominatrix in a short red dress, black suspenders on display and whip in hand. But instead of being offended, Ms Sturgeon is 'tickled' by the image, so much so it is believed to grace the wall of her suburban Glasgow home after she was given it as a birthday gift by her husband, Peter Murrell. He is the man credited with transforming the nationalist leader from surly apparatchik to national stateswoman – on the brink of holding the balance of power. Eye-popping: The painting allegedly hanging in the home of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon shows her as a dominatrix (pictured) Couple: The image is said to grace the wall of Sturgeon's (left) suburban Glasgow home after she was given it as a birthday gift by her husband, Peter Murrell (right) Softly spoken, bespectacled and almost unknown outside the Scottish political village, he can walk the busiest streets in Scotland without being recognised. SNP colleagues reveal that within the party, Murrell is affectionately nicknamed Penfold, after Danger Mouse's loyal hamster sidekick in the 1980s cartoon series. Meek, myopic and chubby, Penfold dutifully shouts 'Coming chief', whenever his superior summons him in the cartoons. Some say the similarity extends further. Sturgeon doesn't drive and her husband frequently acts as chauffeur. He also carries out the lion's share of the domestic chores. When Good Morning Britain's Susanna Reid remarked on the immaculate condition of the couple's detached house last month, Sturgeon, 44, said: 'That's because I had my husband up most of last night cleaning.' Scotland's most powerful politician also leaves the cooking to her spouse, stating: 'I don't cook. I have had lots of disasters and now I prefer not to try, but Peter is a good cook and enjoys it.' However, anyone assuming that Murrell's only role is that of dutiful house-husband would be sorely mistaken. As chief executive of the SNP, he has transformed its fortunes, creating a formidable electoral machine. Transition: Murrell (right) is the man credited with transforming the nationalist leader (left) from surly apparatchik to national stateswoman – on the brink of holding the balance of power . Portrait: Instead of being offended, Ms Sturgeon (pictured) is 'tickled' by the image depicting her as a dominatrix . In 2001, when he took on the role, the party had a paltry 6,000 members; today the SNP is the third-biggest party in the UK, with a membership of 110,000. Murrell, who earns about £120,000 a year, and his wife first met when Ms Sturgeon – an 18-year-old firebrand Left-winger – attended an SNP gathering which he helped to organise. They were married in 2010 with a wedding cake created by the Scottish confectionery dynasty Tunnock's. So was Glasgow-based French artist Laetitia Guilbaud making her own comment on the Sturgeon-Murrell relationship when she dreamt up Naughty Nicola in 2009? 'No, not at all,' Ms Guilbaud, 35 told The Mail on Sunday. 'At the time she was very prominent, but I knew nothing about her partner. 'Her image was quite mousey and she often wore a red suit, so I just wanted to explore her sexy side.' Mr Murrell certainly liked what he saw and snapped up the work for £1,500. He said: 'Nicola was tickled by the depiction.' Perhaps he was following orders from the Chief Whip.","It depicts Sturgeon as a dominatrix in a short red dress with a whip in hand .

"A British grandmother on death row in Bali for smuggling cocaine has accepted that she will be next to face the firing squad. And Lindsay Sandiford has told a friend: ‘I just want to get it over with.’ The 58-year-old broke down in tears last night when she learned that her close friend – Australian drugs gang leader Andrew Chan – is to be shot this week along with eight other prisoners on Indonesia’s ‘Execution Island’, Nusa Kambangan. Scroll down for video . Lindsay Sandiford, pictured, believes that she will be executed by the end of the year for smuggling drugs . Sandiford, 58, from Cheltenham, who is on death row, has told friends she 'wants to get it over with' Chan’s brother Michael told Sandiford in a text message sent last night that the execution has been scheduled for Tuesday evening. Indonesia has vowed to kill all of its 58 foreign drug convicts by the end of 2015 – and Sandiford expects to be in the next batch. She told a friend yesterday she was ‘utterly heartbroken’ at the news about Chan. ‘If they kill someone as good as Andrew, what hope is there for me?’ she said. ‘I just want to get it over with. I feel like just giving up.’ Sandiford says Chan – who was sentenced to death in 2005 for masterminding the so-called Bali Nine heroin smuggling plot – helped her cope in jail after she was given her death penalty two years ago. They became friends inside Bali’s Kerobokan prison. Chan has written at least three times to her since being transferred in March to Nusa Kambangan for execution alongside fellow Bali Nine drugs gang member Myuran Sukumaran, 33, who is also Australian. Chan – who turned to Christianity and was ordained in prison earlier this year – told Sandiford shortly before his transfer to Execution Island that he was reconciled to his fate. He said: ‘I’m not afraid to die but I am afraid of dying. I’m scared of the bullets and I’m scared it won’t be a quick death.’ Her friend Andrew Chan, pictured, is expected to be put to death on Kerobokan prison on Tuesday . Sandiford was arrested trying to smuggle an estimated £1.6million worth of cocaine from Bankok into Bali . She was sentenced to death after Indonesian police linked her to almost five kilograms of cocaine . In his handwritten letters to Sandiford, Chan jokes about the quality of the food, and describes a meal of butter chicken and naan bread as his ‘last supper’. He urges Sandiford, who used to tease him about his religious fervour, to ‘keep reading your Bible’ and writes: ‘You’ll find great comfort in the words, as God will speak to you directly.’ His last letter ends with the message: ‘You have a place within my heart, my friend. Be blessed. Much love and prayers, Andrew.’ In the text, Michael Chan said he hoped his brother would be remembered as ‘Andrew the pastor, not the kingpin’. Sandiford told her friend: ‘I really admire Andrew. He’s been an incredible help to me and he would be there for anyone who genuinely needed help inside the prison. ‘The heart of the prison has gone since they left. They organised rehabilitation projects. If it wasn’t for them, we wouldn’t have running water on the blocks, or the classes in painting, cookery and computers.’ Sandiford, from Cheltenham, admitted smuggling cocaine worth £1.6 million from Bangkok to Bali in 2012, but claims she was coerced into the crime by a syndicate that threatened her sons. She took part in a police sting that led to the arrest of the syndicate’s leaders. She was sentenced to die despite a prosecution recommendation that she serve 17 years. The syndicate’s alleged leader, former Brighton antiques dealer Julian Ponder, 44, was jailed for six years. Sandiford has been refused funding for an appeal against her sentence by the British Government and has rejected consular assistance, in part because of a romance between Ponder and the British Vice-Consul to Bali, Alys Harahap, that led to Harahap’s suspension. A website and Facebook page launched in Sandiford’s name to fund a retrial had by yesterday raised only around £700 towards the tens of thousands of pounds needed for a legal challenge to go ahead.","British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford was convicted of smuggling drugs .

Thousands have been united to honour their nations' fallen as today marks 100 years since the Gallipoli land campaign of the First World War which began on April 25, 1915 . Mr Key told the gathering of the challenges the Anzacs faced as they came ashore on that bloody day a century ago. 'Instead of the open spaces that have been described to them, they landed here with steep hills rising in front of this narrow beach,' he said. He said the opposing forces who set upon one another with such devastating results had something in common - they believed what they were doing was right and necessary, and both sides conducted themselves with courage and bravery. 'The campaign waged here ensured that the name of this place would be written into the histories of New Zealand, Australia, Britain, Turkey and the many other countries that fought here, never to be erased,' he said. He spoke too of the unbreakable bond forged between Australia and New Zealand. 'To us, Gallipoli is also a byword for the best character of Australians and New Zealanders, especially when they work side-by-side in the face of adversity.' Many waited overnight as they braved Anzac Day's pre-dawn chill at Gallipoli . Gallipoli has become a site of pilgrimage for visitors who honour their nations' fallen in graveyards halfway around the world on Anzac Day every April 25 . Prince Charles and Prince Harry attended the dawn service along with political leaders and ministers from New Zealand, Turkey, Ireland, Canada, Nepal, Greece, India and Germany. Mr Key, Mr Abbott, Prince Charles and Prince Harry will attend an Anzac breakfast after the dawn service before heading to the Australian service at Lone Pine and the New Zealand service at Chunuk Bair. About 130,000 men died during the eight month Gallipoli campaign, including 87,000 Ottoman soldiers, 8700 Australians, 2779 New Zealanders and 21,000 British.

"Islamic State fighters ambushed an Iraqi army convoy of Humvees with a bulldozer packed with explosives, killing a commander and three of his soldiers, military officials have confirmed. A suicide bomber first attacked the convoy before militants opened fire, killing the Brigadier General Hassan Abbas Toufan, the commander of the Iraqi first division, a member of the division and an intelligence officer said. A colonel and two lieutenant colonels also died in the attack in the Nadhem al-Taqseem region, north of Fallujah in the Anbar province yesterday. Iraqi army: The country's army is embroiled in a fierce battle to reconquer the western Anbar province . The Iraqi army  is embroiled in a fierce battle to reconquer the western province, which has been under ISIS control for the past year. Fighting has been focused on the provincial capital of Ramadi, where the government had been making slow progress. Earlier on Friday, the army recaptured the important al-Houz bridge over the Euphrates in western Ramadi, which had served as a primary supply route for the militants, according to police Colonel Mahdi Abbas. The security situation in Ramadi sharply deteriorated after the terrorists seized three villages around the city, forcing an estimated 100,000 to flee their homes. Many had started to return in the past few days because Iraqi soldiers and police have been able to secure the centre of Ramadi and push the militants back from some areas of the city. During the weekly Friday prayer, Iraq's most revered Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani urged the country's politicians to end all disputes in order to confront the political, economic and security challenges facing the country. 'It is important that the brothers (the politicians) should come out with final and drastic solutions for the problems,' al-Sistani's representative said during a sermon Friday in the holy Shiite city of Karbala. Militants: Islamic State fighters ambushed an Iraqi army convoy of Humvees with a bulldozer in the Nadhem al-Taqseem region yesterday . Many Iraqis blame the rivalries among the country's political leadership for the humiliating defeat suffered by government forces in the past year at the hands of the Islamic State militants that control large sections of the north and west of the country. In Friday's violence, police officials said a bomb exploded near an outdoor market in the Sunni town of Tarmiyah, north of Baghdad, killing four people and wounding eight. A bomb near a courthouse killed three people and wounded nine in the town of Mahmoudiyah, south of Baghdad. Medical officials confirmed the death toll. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.","ISIS fighters ambushed an Iraqi army convoy of Humvees north of Fallujah .

"Geoff Whitington, 63, from Ashford, Kent, was made so sick by obesity-related type 2 diabetes that he had been told he may need a leg amputated . It is a toe-curling moment that many have faced: the supermarket tantrum. And Geoff Whitington, pouting and shouting, performs it with aplomb. 'I don't want to!' is the cry when he is asked if he will try whelks. Despite the wobbly bottom lip and huffy, crossed arms, Geoff happens to be a 63-year-old father of four grown-up children. And in this bizarre episode of role-reversal, it is his sons, Anthony and Ian, who are gently – some might say valiantly – trying to broaden his palate. The problem will be all too familiar to anyone who has broached the subject of healthier eating with a parent who might not have the most up-to-date ideas about diet. But the Whitington boys are motivated by a matter of life and death. For years, Geoff was ill, made so sick by obesity-related type 2 diabetes that he had been told he may need a leg amputated. Turning round his health would mean changing the habits of a lifetime of poor food choices and no exercise. And Geoff resisted with a passion. While many would have admitted defeat in the face of his almost insurmountable stubbornness, the two brothers overhauled their father's health, and crucially, his attitude. And in doing so, they have undoubtedly saved his life. Anthony and Ian have helped their father shed six stone and now, two years after that tantrum in the supermarket, Geoff is a man transformed. He loves to cycle, never eats take-aways and counts kale and couscous among his favourite foods. Most remarkably, doctors say he is no longer diabetic – and he is off medication. The supermarket stand-off was caught on camera for a forthcoming film called Fixing Dad, a searingly honest but moving account of the Whitingtons' journey, which has already won coveted slots at film festivals. The brothers have a lifelong passion for film – Ian, 35, is a full-time film-maker – so they decided to document their battle to inspire others to do the same. Anthony, 37, says: 'He wasn't old, but Dad had given up on himself. He blamed himself for his illness but didn't think he could do anything about it. Getting a grown man to change his ways is difficult and there were times when it felt like it was pointless, but we knew we had to carry on. Just the thought of losing him spurred us on.' Luckily for Geoff, his sons are just as stubborn as he used to be, and their plan has been a huge success. 'The difference in Dad is incredible and he is proof that it's never too late,' says Anthony, a father-of-four from Ashford, Kent. 'Physically, he's gone from having to use crutches to get around to taking on 100-mile cycle challenges. Mentally he's a new person – he had retreated into himself and was probably depressed.' Scroll down for video . His sons Anthony and Ian (right) helped the father-of-four shed six stone and overhauled his health . He turned his life around and remarkably, doctors say he is no longer diabetic – and he is off medication . Geoff, who lives in Ashford with second wife Marilyn, works 15-hour night shifts as a security guard. Before his sons intervened, his exercise routine was non-existent and he tipped the scales at 20 stone. He existed on a high-fat, high-sugar diet. Sometimes he'd eat three takeaway meals a day. Anthony, a corporate financial adviser, says: 'He had an old-fashioned mentality that cooking was a woman's domain, so he'd opt for something convenient and quick. Marilyn would cook him healthy dinners but Dad would sneak in a takeaway on the way home.' Geoff's weight problems were worrying enough, but there was the added complication of his type 2 diabetes, which affects more than 2.7 million Britons. If left untreated, the condition can leave a person up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke, and at risk of foot problems due to nerve damage and poor circulation. Rates of type 2 diabetes are soaring due to increasing obesity, unhealthy diets, a lack of exercise and an ageing population. Geoff was first diagnosed with diabetes in 2003. But it wasn't until a visit to a podiatrist in August 2013 that the gravity of his situation was laid bare. 'Dad had an ulcer that was giving him a lot of discomfort,' Anthony says. 'He was having to use crutches and going to have the ulcer cleaned and dressed on a regular basis. 'Things had got so bad that the podiatrist told Dad there was a risk he might lose his leg if he carried on as he was. Until then, in his mind having diabetes was just popping a few more pills in addition to ones he was already on for his high blood pressure and cholesterol. This was the wake-up call we all needed.' He now loves to cycle, never eats take-aways and counts kale and couscous among his favourite foods . Anthony and Ian knew drastic action was needed. 'Dad obviously had weight issues which we'd talked about in the past, but we had busy lives so didn't really push it as far as we could have done,' says Anthony. Step one was to overhaul Geoff's diet. Out went the convenience foods and in came a strict two-month, 800 calorie-a-day diet under the watchful eye of professor Roy Taylor at Newcastle University. He is conducting a study, funded by charity Diabetes UK, which aims to see if a low-calorie diet can permanently reverse type 2 diabetes. Step two was to encourage Geoff to be more active, to improve his fitness and outlook on life. 'We wanted him to find a social life and hobby other than work and food – we've done everything from fishing to t'ai chi,' Anthony says. 'But we knew he had to take up an achievable form of exercise that didn't put pressure on his foot, so cycling became a big part of his regime.' He adds: 'Of course there were rows, especially when he was on the low-calorie diet. He'd enjoyed food in the past, but it was the wrong food and here we were telling him it was no good for him, and he had to cook dishes from scratch. 'It's a fine balance taking on an almost parental role with your own dad. We had to be encouraging, but firm, without him feeling he was being bullied into anything.' That's where the filming proved so useful. Anthony explains: 'Filming the whole process meant we could show him footage from a couple of weeks before as a motivator so he could see how far he'd come.' In February last year, the sons took their father on a ten-day cycling trip to Spain. Geoff also tried out a sky-dive simulator (he's planning to do one for real later this year), and tackled rock-climbing. 'He'd spent almost four decades doing soul-destroying night shifts, eating large amounts of processed food and doing no exercise. 'We wanted to inspire him, to show him how great life could be,' Anthony says. 'While the weight loss is fantastic, what is really amazing is his new self-confidence , his self-belief and his love of life.' Step three was transforming Geoff into a diabetes champion, so he could convince others to turn their lives around. Now a trimmer 14 stone, Geoff has taken part in the Prudential 100-mile cycle race, spoken at medical conferences throughout Europe and stopped his diabetes in its tracks. At the most recent meeting with his consultant, he was told he is diabetes-free. Geoff believes the doctors had been 'too nice for too long', and wishes they had been tougher on him. 'I'm just so cross I lived for so long with such a bad quality of life, depressed and basically killing myself. Hopefully my transformation can inspire others too.' Fixing Geoff's diabetes has brought the family closer, says Anthony. 'We went to Scotland over Christmas and Dad was out walking with the grandchildren, which would have been almost impossible two years ago. The kids love having a grandad who is active, and we've got our old dad back.' For more information, go to diabetes.co.uk.

"Investigative journalists looking into possible exaggerations told by Brian Williams about his reporting are focusing on another episode from the NBC broadcasters career, his time reporting in Egypt. A team at NBC tasked with delving into allegations that the former network star has misrepresented his experiences in war zones is looking at tales he's told about the Tahrir Square anti-government uprising in early 2011. A February clip from Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart sees the anchor launch into a story about how he 'made eye contact' with a government soldier on a horse who was beating protesters. However, there is no footage of Williams actually on the square during what he called the moment demonstrations 'turned sour' and descended into violence. Scroll down for video . NBC's committee investigating the alleged misrepresentation of reporting experiences made by Brian Williams (left) are looking at a February 2011 interview he gave to Jon Stewart (right) about the Arab Spring . The anchor said he caught the eye of the lead mounted government soldier before violence at Cairo's Tahrir Square made the situation 'turn sour' Above, Williams speaks to protesters at another point in the protest . Describing the deteriorating situation in Cairo, Williams said he caught the eye of the mounted soldier before he turned a corner and used a whip to begin 'beating human beings'. However, doubts have been raised about whether Williams, who said the violence he witnessed turned the city into a 'don't leave your hotel' situation, was at Tahrir Square. His dispatches from the country at the time said that he was reporting from a balcony above the protest center, according to the New York Times. It is not known exactly which parts of Williams's Egypt reporting are being focused on by the NBC committee investigating him. In other parts of the Jon Stewart interview, the longtime Nightly News anchor tells about seeing streams of protesters coming in from suburban Cairo along the Nile with banners. Williams was suspended in February amid allegations that he had lied about being in a helicopter that was shot down in Iraq in 2003 . Williams (pictured in Baghdad in March 2007) has been questioned about the accuracy of his reporting from war zones . He also said that his crew in Egypt had no body armor and that his 'security guys' were unarmed because of the country's gun laws. Questions about the accuracy of Williams's reporting come after he was suspended by his network for six months after a military newspaper questioned his account of being shot down in a helicopter in 2003, which soldiers say never happened to him. Williams had repeated the Iraq story multiple times afterwards, and doubts were soon raised about another helicopter incident in Israel in 2006 and the way he received a piece of the US helicopter that crashed when Navy SEALs killed Osama Bin Laden. It is not known when the NBC investigation will conclude and make recommendations about Williams's future. Journalists in the news organization's Washington, D.C., bureau were strongly against his return during a February meeting about the matter, according to the Washington Post. Williams' suspension is finished in early August.","Anchor said that he 'made eye contact' with Egyptian government soldier on horse when the Tahrir Square protests became violent .

"Millions of point of sales systems are vulnerable to security breaches as they are protected by the same default password - used by a global maker of payment devices for more than two decades, researches say. The password, 166816, is still being used by about 90 per cent of customers, researchers David Byrne and Charles Henderson disclosed on Wednesday during the annual RSA security conference in California. Henderson said that the unidentified vendor had been using the same default password since at least 1990, according to The Register. Researchers Charles Henderson (right) and David Byrne (left) said a global maker of cash registers has been using the same default password on the payment devices for more than two decades. This potentailly puts the devices at risk of being a target of a security breach . 'Nine out of 10 times when we see equipment from that manufacturer, 90 per cent of the time, this is the password,' he said. 'I actually saw this password really recently on a different manufacturer's device [by a customer] who thought the password was unique to them.' Hackers would need physical access to the payment devices, opening a panel of the device using a paperclip, to exploit it, according to The Register. This type of attack is uncommon and reportedly easy for malicious staff. For example, during the conference it was revealed that two individuals reportedly entered a major American retail store, unscrewed a server rack and walked out with the server leaving the store unable to process credit card payments, according to RT. While Henderson and Byrne did not name the vendor using the 166816 password,  a Google search pointed to Verifone which connects around 27 million payment devices around the world, according to RT. On Thursday, Verifone said in a statement that all of its devices in the field came with the same default password, Z66831, according to CSO. The company also said the password can be found on the Internet with instructions for programming terminals. However, Verifone claimed sensitive payment information or personally identifiable information cannot be captured, even though the password has become known over the years. While Henderson and Byrne did not name the vendor, a Google search pointed to Verifone (file photo of one of the company's payment devices) The company said: 'What the password allows someone to do is to configure some settings on the terminal; all executables have to be file signed, and it is not possible to enter malware just by knowing passwords.' Its new products come with a 'pre-expired' password that has to be changed during installation set up, according to Verifone, and the company also said it encourages customers to change the default password, reported CSO. As retailers have increasingly battled security breaches in recent years, Target was at the center of the second-largest card breach at a U.S. retailer two years ago. An investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70million of Target's customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Hackers are thought to have stolen the credit card details by breaking into Target's computer systems and installing data mining software on credit card machines. The software installed on 40,000 machines across Target's 1,797 stores read the information on a card's magnetic strip - including account number, sort code and CCV code - when it was swiped through the machine. All of the card details were then sent back to the hackers through the internet, before the theft was discovered after nearly three weeks. In another case of a security breach, in 2014, 56million debit and credit cards are estimated to have been breached in a data theft between April and September at Home Depot stores in the U.S. and Canada.","Researchers  said during security conference that payment devices by unidentified global vendor came with password '166816'

"A group of technologically-challenged senior citizens are left completely and utterly befuddled by popular messaging app Snapchat after attempting to use it for the first time, in order to send the perfect selfie. In the latest video from the Elders React series on TheFineBros YouTube channel, the clueless men and women are given their first introduction to Snapchat with hilarious - and mixed – results, all of which are caught on camera. And while many of them say they understand the appeal of the social media app, which allows users to share photos that will disappear within 10 seconds, they still can't really wrap their heads around the point of it. 'I'm not into all this,' a woman named Darlene says of that app. 'This is yet another play on this ""tweet"" thing that's happening.' Scroll down for video . Not a fan: Don (pictured) struggles to take a selfie in the latest Elders React video, in which he and other senior citizens learn about the photo messaging app Snapchat . Before being given some quick instruction about what to do with the app, many of the elders admit that they have no idea what Snapchat is - never mind how to use it. 'I just found out about Yelp,' Darlene says with exacerbation. Meanwhile, another confused woman named Vera calls the app 'Snapchess'. But before the group can start sending pictures, they are given cell phones so they can learn how to snap their own selfies - which proves to be an almost-insurmountable task in itself. 'I don't know how to use an iPhone,' Catherine says with a laugh before they get started. When Vera realizes that the app involves photos, she is disappointed. 'Oh, it's pictures,' she says. 'I hate pictures.' After they take turns learning how to flip the phone's camera around, they start snapping away, but most of them are quick to voice their displeasure with their photos. Feeling nostalgic: Liz can't wrap her head around the idea that the photos on Snapchat disappear. 'Wouldn't you want to save it?' she asks . 'Oh god that is a gross selfie,' Yehuda, father of the Fine brothers, the creators of the channel, exclaims, while Catherine asks: 'Can I have a better picture? That is an awful picture.' They soon move on to captioning their own photos, which presents its own set of issues, as the seniors struggle with typing their messages. 'I just want to say: ""It's Me,""' Don explains with frustration. 'It looks like it says: ""Light Me.""' But almost all of them enjoy the feature that allows them to color on their photos. 'I always wanted to know what I looked like with a mustache on,' Liz says with delight as she adds purple facial hair to her selfie. After they upload their photos to the app, Alex asks: 'Who would care?' Perfect users: Rhoda notes that politicians should get on the app because of all of their 'sexting' and 'nude pictures' What fun: Rhoda can be seeing drawing a purple bow on her selfie. Most of the elders enjoy using this Snapchat feature . Meanwhile, Johnny has no idea that Snapchat is reportedly worth $19 billion. 'This is definitely going to catch on with kids,' he says of the technology. The revelation that Snapchat is considered disposable social media because their photos will soon disappear soon leaves the group divided. 'Why would you do that?' Liz asks. 'Wouldn't you want to save it for the memory?' 'Oh, that is so stupid,' Darlene adds, however Catherine notes that the feature is 'pretty neat'. And Rhoda quickly thinks of a group of people who would benefit from this app. 'All that sexting and texting and nude pictures and all that, politicians should get onto this thing,' she notes. No thank you: Darline (pictured) is completely unimpressed with Snapchat, calling it 'stupid' Parental supervision: Alex (pictured) says she would never let her daughter have a cell phone during sleepovers at her house because of this app . Although Don is not convinced that the pictures will completely disappear, explaining: 'Nothing is gone forever - not on this stuff.' Darlene remains unimpressed after she learns that there are ways for users to save the pictures against the sender's wishes. 'Well, then what the heck are we talking about,' she says with frustration. The elders then go on to discuss the controversy surrounding teens who are using the app to send inappropriate pictures. 'Don't send the picture in the first place if it's anything that is going to [include] your little naked a**,' Rhoda advises. And Alex says she would refuse to allow her daughter to have cell phones during sleepovers at her house. 'No pictures of girls in their underwear are going to leave this house,' she says.","The new video is a part of the Elders React series on TheFineBros YouTube channel .

"Gordon Brown has warned that the Scottish nationalists want an SNP vote in the General Election to force a second referendum on independence. The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion'. But that her party want 'chaos and constitutional crisis' at Westminster to force another independence referendum. Scroll down for video . Gordon Brown, pictured campaigning this week, has warned that the SNP want to use the chaos after the election to force another referendum on Scottish independence and urged 'patriotic Scots' to vote Labour . And he warned that those casting their vote on May 7 will be deciding the future of Scotland for the next few years. Mr Brown was speaking during a joint event with local Labour candidate and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander at Elderslie Village Hall in Renfrewshire. He said: 'There is an SNP candidate in this constituency. She says vote SNP, get SNP MPs at Westminster and we will twist their arms and get another referendum. 'Remember what the SNP used to say - the referendum was once in a generation, then it changed a little to once in a lifetime, then it was once every 15 years and now when you ask Ms Sturgeon about this her answers are all evasion. She cannot give a straight answer to the question. 'But does not the SNP candidate in this constituency tell the truth, that what they want is an SNP vote not to deliver social justice but to deliver the chaos and constitutional crisis at Westminster to as she said force a second referendum. 'And I say I don't want the divisiveness, I don't want the bitterness, I don't want the acrimony, I don't want the divisions between families and communities in the next few months that we had in the past few months.' The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion' Mr Brown urged people to vote Labour to end the bedroom tax, food bank poverty, zero-hours contracts and the neglect of the NHS. He added: 'When you vote on May 7 remember that you are not just voting to end Tory austerity and the possibility of five more years of the bedroom tax and everything else, you're also voting on whether you are going to allow the SNP to use your vote to try to force a second referendum on this country within a few months or after the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.' He also said that Labour will hold an economic summit immediately after the General Election to boost jobs, expand city deals, encourage investment and provide jobs and training for young people. Mr Brown also urged people to be 'proud patriotic Scots' and back Labour's plan for full employment in Scotland. He said: 'Patriotism means, yes, supporting a strong Scottish parliament, but it doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation across the whole country that can deliver us full employment and more jobs. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the money that comes from the bankers' bonus tax that will allow Scottish young people to have jobs in the future. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation on research and innovation that will replace the Linwoods of the past and the lost jobs of the present with the new high-quality jobs of the future. 'And, yes, patriotism means a strong Scottish parliament but it doesn't need or require us to reject the partnership that allows us to fund the pensions of this country, sharing the resources of 60 million people across the whole country, far better than pooling the resources of only five million people, to secure the best pensions imaginable.' SNP Leader Nicola Sturgeon joins  female activists in Glasgow's Buchanan Street to launch the party's womens pledge today . Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: 'While Gordon Brown appears to be re-fighting last year's referendum, the SNP are out talking to voters about next month's General Election and the huge opportunity to make Scotland stronger at Westminster. The contrast could not be clearer. 'Unfortunately for Labour Brown's speech this morning simply reminds people once again of how Labour stood shoulder to shoulder with the Tories for two and a half years to talk Scotland down. 'The question Labour's current leadership have repeatedly failed to answer is if there are more anti-Tory MPs - between the SNP and Labour - than there are Tory MPs, will they work with us to lock the Tories out and to deliver better policies for people not just in Scotland but across the rest of the UK. 'A strong team of SNP MPs can give Labour the backbone to oppose further cuts and pursue a progressive alternative to austerity.'

"A man has been arrested after the body of a 22-year-old missing Indiana University student was found more than 20 miles from campus. Police confirmed that Hannah Wilson's body was found on Friday in the rural area of Needmore, Indiana, which is about an hour drive outside Bloomington, where she attended school, police said. Daniel Messel, 49, of Bloomington, was arrested after a police investigation and he is facing a preliminary charge of murder. Brown County Coroner Earl Piper told the Herald Times that Wilson was struck three or four times in the back of the head with an unknown object, which was not found at the scene. Scroll down for video . Indiana University student Hannah Wilson, 22, was last seen at about 1am on Friday. Her body later turned up in a rural area of Brown County in Needmore, which is more than 20 miles from the Bloomington campus . A photo circulated social media on Friday in hopes of finding the Gamma Phi Beta sorority sister who was studying psychology . Piper said Wilson was found fully clothed and there was no sign of sexual assault, according to Sky News. Piper said that Wilson  would have been dead four to seven hours when police were notified that she was missing on Friday,  the Indy Star reported. With that being the timeline, Wilson, a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority at IU, would have died sometime between 1.30am and 4.30am. The connection between Messel and Wilson is unclear, police said. The young woman was last seen at around 1am on Friday, according to the Crimson Quarry. Toxicology reports for the woman will not be available for ten to 14 days. Information surrounding Wilson's disappearance has not been released, but she went missing on the same weekend of celebrations for the Little 500, an annual bicycle race held on campus that is known for its party atmosphere. Though rumors circulated on Twitter that Wilson was last seen getting into an Uber car - creating a possible connection to Messel being a driver - an Uber spokesperson told a Herald Times reporter that he was not a driver with the company. Daniel Messel, 49, of Bloomington, was arrested in connection to the case and faces a preliminary murder charge . Wilson, originally from Fishers, Indiana, was a senior studying psychology at the university. 'I can't even stop crying,' a friend of Wilson told WTHR. 'I keep expecting her to text me back or to wake up and this all be a horrible nightmare.' A friend of Wilson's, Matt Molewyk, posted a tribute to his 'best friend' on his Facebook fan page along with the pair of them together standing behind DJ equipment. He wrote: 'She was always there when I needed to talk and complain about trivial things. She could always get me to laugh when I was down. 'She's the rare type of person that really makes an impact on you. She was so loving and down to earth. She cared about everyone and she was a genuine person, which is rare these days.' He added that he planned to dedicate his DJ set on Friday to Wilson and that she was 'one of, if not the most loyal friend' he had. Matt Molewyk, pictured here with Wilson, wrote a tribute to his friend on Facebook, claiming that Wilson was 'one of, if not the most loyal friend' he had . Molewyk said that Wilson had an 'infectious' laugh and that he wished she was on stage with him like she had been in the past. He added: 'She was a wonderful human being and I hope that when the day comes that I leave this earth, that I can hopefully leave half as much of a positive impression on people as she did. 'I truly love you Hannah, and I would give anything and everything I have just to hangout with you one more day. I would even trade places with you because I am not half the person you are. 'I love you so much, and I will never forget you. I know you supported me and I am going to continue to pursue my dreams in hopes that I can make you proud and hopefully leave a positive impact on people, like you have left on me. 'I am so lucky to have had all the time that I did with you - thank you for being my friend and putting up with me. I love you so much Hoon.' Wilson went missing on the same night as the Little 500, an annual celebration surrounding a bicycle race on campus that is known for its party atmosphere. Police have not revealed information as to the connection between Wilson (pictured) and Messel . Other friends, too, posted photos together with Wilson and mourned the loss of the woman on social media. Indiana University released a statement on the incident Friday. Wilson's death comes four years after Indiana University student Lauren Spierer went missing in 2011. She was never found . 'The entire IU Bloomington community mourns the tragic death of Hannah Wilson. Our deepest sympathies go out to Hannah's family and friends during this unspeakably sad time,' the statement read. Gamma Phi Beta sorority also released a statement regarding Wilson's death. 'The entire Gamma Phi Beta family mourns the tragic loss of Hannah. She was a sister, friend and cherished member who will be genuinely missed,' International president Krista Davis said. She continued: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Hannah's friends, family and the women of Beta Phi Chapter'. This is not Messel's first run in with the police, according the the Indiana Daily Student. He was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and endangering persons in 1995. A year later he was sentenced to eight years in prison for battery by means of a deadly weapon and battery resulting in serious bodily injury. Indiana State Police have yet to release more information about the case. This isn't the first time, however, a woman has gone missing from IU's campus. Lauren Spierer was 20 years old when she went missing in 2011. Jill Behrman disappeared after going for a bike ride in 2011. Both cases still remain unsolved. Both Indiana University and the national organization of Gamma Phi Beta released statements regarding Wilson's (right) death.

"A California man was ordered on Friday to stand trial on charges of kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl that he went on to marry and live with for a decade. Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald made the decision after hearing preliminary evidence against 41-year-old Isidro Garcia, who has pleaded not guilty. Authorities said the daughter of Garcia's live-in girlfriend told them he began fondling her shortly after she was brought from Mexico in 2004 to live with her mother in Santa Ana, and that he repeatedly had sex with her despite her protests. Alleged kidnapper: Isidro Garcia, 41, will stand trial on charges of kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl that he went on to marry and live with for a decade . After an argument broke out at the home, the girl said, Garcia took her to a neighboring county, where he told her she would be deported and separated from her mother if she contacted authorities, Santa Ana police Cpl. Ricardo Diaz testified. The girl was given fake ID and a job but Garcia prevented her from fleeing and assaulted her, Diaz said. Garcia later married and fathered a daughter with the girl, who is now 25, and lived with her until last year. 'This is a different type of captivity,' prosecutor Whitney Bokosky told reporters after the hearing. 'It is more of a mental captivity. She doesn't know where else to go, she doesn't know where else to turn to.' Garcia is charged with one count of rape, one count of kidnapping with intent to rape, and three counts of lewd acts on a child. He is being held on $1 million bail and scheduled to be arraigned May 5. The case came to light last year when the woman went to a police station in Bell Gardens to report a domestic violence incident and was connected to a missing-persons report filed by her mother in 2004. Defense lawyer Charles Frisco said the girl left willingly with Garcia and fabricated the allegations after reconnecting last year with her sister on Facebook and attempting to win back her mother's love. Last year: Isidro Garcia , 41, and his attorney Charles Frisco are seen in this close up of a monitor showing a jailhouse video court hearing in Santa Ana, California last year . 'She had so many opportunities to leave,' Frisco said. Neighbors were shocked to learn of the case and said the pair, who in recent years lived in a Los Angeles suburb, seemed happy and loving. Zak Salazar, a 53-year-old friend of Garcia who attended the hearing, had trouble imagining that the friendly, helpful man he knew would be capable of the allegations made by Diaz. 'We're listening to her side' of the story, he said. Last year, a number of Garcia’s friends and neighbors  painted a very different picture, saying the woman was so happy with her husband that she was desperate to add to their family and have another baby. She had apparently had fertility injections prior to the birth of their daughter three years ago. And she told neighbors Adely Rios and her father, Ernesto, that she was undergoing more treatment to have a second child. Lat year, Police described the ordeal during which the now 25-year-old woman — broken through mental, physical and sexual abuse — was moved at least four times and given multiple fake identities to hide her from family and authorities. Arraignment: Isidro Garcia , 41, pictured last year during an arraignment hearing in Santa Ana . The woman, who police did not identify by name, said she often thought about escaping but stayed out of fear, even though in recent years she was not physically held captive. Then, in April of last year, the woman got in touch with her mother after finding her sister on Facebook to wish her a happy birthday, Santa Ana Police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna said. The mother showed the daughter news articles written at the time of her 2004 disappearance to prove that she had gone to the police and filed a missing-persons report, according to Bertagna. The woman said in a television interview that she was overjoyed to be reunited with her family. 'I was very afraid about everything because I was alone,' she told KABC-TV. Police said that the woman had arrived in the U.S. from Mexico several months before her abduction and did not speak English at the time. After one fight between the girl's mother and Garcia in August 2004, the girl's mother left the house and the girl went to a nearby park. Confused neighbors: Neighbor Maria Sanchez holds a photo of her neighbor Isidro Garcia at his daughter's third birthday . Garcia allegedly followed the girl. When he caught up with her, she said she had a headache and wanted to go home. He told her then, 'You can't go home. You're here illegally. You don't speak the language. Your mom's called the police. They will send you back. I'm your only hope,'Bertagna said. Garcia allegedly gave her five pills that he said would help her headache but instead knocked her out. When the girl awoke, she was locked in a garage in Compton, a city between Santa Ana and Los Angeles. The mother 'filed a police report and for 10 years (police) did due diligence. But they were changing their names and dates of birth and physical locations so that made it exceedingly difficult,' Bertagna said. In 2007, Garcia got documents from Mexico that gave the girl a new name and date of birth. Using those documents, he married her at a courthouse. Police said the woman tried to escape twice but was severely beaten.","Isidro Garcia, 41, will stand trial for allegedly raping, kidnapping, then marrying the 15-year-old daughter of his live-in girlfriend .

"Scientists have used a gecko as inspiration to create super-strong robots that  can carry over 100 times their own weight. The nine-gram robots - built by mechanical engineers at Stanford University in California - can haul more than a kilogram up a vertical wall. Another robot created by the scientists - nicknamed μTug - weighs just 12 grams and can drag a weight up to 2000 times heavier. They are so successful they could be used in emergencies, in factories or on construction sites in the future. New footage shows one robot slowly pulling an older model up a wall as it hangs on a delicate piece of string. David Christensen, a student in the Cutkosky Lab, compared the robots' achievements to a human pulling a blue whale. He told New Scientist: 'You can do some pretty amazing things.' Scientists have used a gecko as inspiration to create super-strong robots, one pictured, that can carry over 100 times their own weight . Geckos have small hairs on their feet to enable them to scurry across ceilings and walls without falling off. The robots' 'feet' are covered in tiny rubber spikes, mimicking these hairs. They were built under a microscope using tweezers. They will be presented next month at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Seattle, Washington. Geckos have small hairs on their feet to enable them to scurry across ceilings and walls without falling off. The tiny hairs create a weak bond with the area they are standing on, allowing them to get a strong foothold. As they are not sticky, they are also able to attach and detach their feet easily. These adhesives toepads are what inspired the scientists at Stanford University. The robots' 'feet' are covered in tiny rubber spikes, mimicking the hairs. When pressure is applied by the robot climbing the wall the spikes bend, which increases their surface area and allows them to 'bond' to the surface. Only one foot moves at a time to ensure the robot moves forward without falling down.","Robots built by mechanical engineers at Stanford University in California .

"A Mexican . archaeologist hunting for a royal tomb in a tunnel . beneath a towering pre-Aztec pyramid has made a discovery that . may have brought him a step closer: liquid mercury. In the bowels of Teotihuacan, a mysterious ancient city that . was once the largest in the Americas, earlier this month Sergio Gomez found 'large quantities' of the silvery metal in a chamber at . the end of a sacred tunnel sealed for nearly 1,800 years. And because of the potential supernatural significance of liquid mercury in ritual ends, deeper into the complex Gomez hopes to find the elusive last resting place of a king. Scroll down for video . Hope: Mexican archaeologist Sergio Gomez has been excavating a pre-Aztec pyramid in Teotihuacan, Mexico, for six years and came across 'large quantities' of liquid mercury earlier this month . Underground: Gomez announced on Friday that he found the liquid mercury in a chamber at the end of a tunnel (pictured) that had been sealed off for more than 1,800 years . 'It's something that completely surprised us,' Gomez said at . the entrance to the tunnel below Teotihuacan's Pyramid of the . Plumed Serpent, about 30 miles  northeast of Mexico City. If Gomez is right, it could help settle a debate over how power was wielded in Teotihuacan, a city boasting massive stone pyramids that was home to as many as 200,000 people and the heart of ancient empire that flourished between 100 and 700 A.D. Some archaeologists believe the toxic element could herald . what would be the first ruler's tomb ever found in Teotihuacan, . a contemporary of several ancient Maya cities, but so shrouded . in mystery that its inhabitants still have no name. Unsure why the mercury was put there, Gomez says the metal . may have been used to symbolize an underworld river or lake. Though mercury has previously been uncovered in small amounts at a few Maya sites much . further south, it had never been found in Teotihuacan. Mercury was rare in ancient Mexico, as it was difficult to mine and prized for its reflective properties. Archaeologists believe it may . have had a supernatural significance for ritual ends. Teotihuacan, or 'abode of the gods' in the Aztec language of . Nahuatl, was distinct from the Mayan civilization. Royalty: Gomez said that he is unsure as to why the mercury was in the tunnel (pictured), but he hopes that it will lead him to the tomb of the city's king . Digging: National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) archaeologists work at a tunnel that may lead to a royal tombs discovered at the ancient city of Teotihuacan in 2011. Gomez said their findings could lead to settling the debate as to how power was distributed in the city . Its . inhabitants left behind no written record, abandoning the city . long before the Aztecs came to power in the 14th Century. Spaniards dug at Teotihuacan in the 1670s, but rigorous . scientific excavation of the site did not begin until the 1950s. Gomez's six-year slog in the tunnel has already yielded tens . of thousands of artifacts including stone sculptures, fine . jewelry and giant seashells leading to the three chambers. The . painstaking excavation has slowed due to extreme humidity, mud, . and now, the need for protective gear to avoid mercury . poisoning. George Cowgill, a U.S. archaeologist who has spent more than . four decades excavating Teotihuacan, says the mercury find . increases the odds of finding a tomb. 'But it's still very uncertain, and that is what keeps . everybody in suspense,' he added. Mexican archaeologist Linda Manzanilla believes that at its . peak, the city was ruled not by a single king, but a council of . four lords, and that Gomez may find the remains of one of them. To bolster her argument, she cites the absence of a single . palace or the presence of kings in any of the city's many . murals. The excavation of the chambers should be finished by . October, Gomez said, with an announcement of findings by the end . of 2015.","Mexican archaeologist found mercury in chamber of Teotihuacan pyramid .

"Qatar's grip on London’s real estate tightened this week when it agreed to buy a majority share in the company behind the iconic Claridge’s hotel. The Gulf state's Constellation Hotels bought the 64 per cent stake in hotel company Coroin - which owns five-star offerings Claridge's, The Berkeley and The Connaught - from billionaire brothers Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay. It is not known how much the deal is worth, but some have reported it could be as much as £1.6billion. The hotels are the latest in an impressive list of high-profile acquisitions for the country, whose investment arm has been snapping up a number of the city's landmark buildings including The Shard, Harrods and One Canada Tower - the centrepiece of the Canary Wharf financial district. Constellation also recently bought London Park Lane Hotel, and owns Le Grand hotel in Paris. Qatar’s royal family, which owns more of London than the Crown Estate, is also planning their own British palace in the capital. Last December, the rulers submitted plans to convert three prime properties in London’s Regent’s Park into a huge mansion, set to become the UK’s first £200million home. The country also hold stakes in flagship British companies including Barclays Bank, Sainsbury's and British Airways owner IAG.

"An Arkansas woman became a little richer this week after finding a large diamond at Crater of Diamonds State Park. Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, found the 3.69-carat white diamond in a 37.5-acre search field on Thursday, her last day of a trip to the park with her husband. Clark, who first visited the park 33 years ago with her mother and grandmother, prayed to God, asking, 'Are you doing to bless me and let me find a diamond today?' as she searched the field. Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, Arkansas, found a 3.69-carat white diamond on a search field at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas . Clark named the pinto-bean-sized, teardrop-shaped gem a 'hallelujah diamond' because she spotted the gem shortly after praying that she would find something . And shortly after praying, Clark said she spotted the diamond sticking out of a ridge of plowed dirt, according to Region 8. She named the teardrop-shaped diamond the Hallelujah Diamond, claiming that her prayer helped her find the gem. Clark plans to keep the pinto-sized diamond, which is the largest diamond of the 122 found in the park this year. Crater of Diamonds State Park holds the only diamond-bearing site accessible to the public, in the form of a large plowed search field. 'The gem is frosted white with a pearlescent metallic shine,' park interpreter Waymon Cox told Region 8. 'It's the largest one found since April 16, 2014.' The search field had just been plowed earlier in the week because the park had seen a lot of rain, Cox said. 'This regular endeavor loosens the diamond-bearing soil which, along with rain erosion, brings more diamonds to the surface and helps park visitors' chances of finding them,' he said. Cox added: 'With all the rain we've been seeing, along with this week's plowing, there's a good chance more diamonds will be found on the surface in the days to come.'

"The Queen has dropped out of the list of the 300 richest people in Britain for the first time, it emerged yesterday. Although her wealth has increased year-on-year, her assets have been dwarfed by hundreds of financiers and businessmen. Britain’s super-rich are now more than twice as rich as they were in 2009, despite the catastrophic economic crisis. Queen Elizabeth II, pictured at Westminster Abbey yesterday. She placed 302nd on the Sunday Times Rich List with a wealth of £340m, compared with 285th last year and putting her outside of the top 300 for the first time . Len Blavatnick, pictured left with his wife Emily, topped the Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of £13.2bn. Brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja were pushed into second placed as their wealth was valued at £13bn . 1. Len Blavatnik £13.17billion (Investment, music and media) 2. Sri and Gopi Hinduja: £13billion (Industry and finance) 3. Galena and George Weston and family: £11billion (Retailing) 4. Alisher Usmanov: £9.8billion (Mining and investment) 5. David and Simon Reubeb: £9.7billion (Property and internet) Today the wealthiest 1,000 people based in Britain are collectively worth £547billion, up from £258billion in 2009, an increase of 112 per cent. Those placed lowest on the 1,000 rankings have around £100million – £45million more than in 2009 and £15million more than last year, the biggest annual leap in 18 years. The findings are revealed in this year’s Sunday Times Rich List, which consists of people who are British, who live and work in the UK, or who have ‘strong links’ to this country. The Queen’s wealth grew modestly in the last year by £10million to £340million, leaving her at number 302 – down from 285 in 2014. Almost three decades ago, when the list was first compiled, the Queen was placed at the top, with £5.2billion. However, the rules of the list have changed to stop counting the value of assets such as the royal art collection, which could not be described as her personal wealth. Much of the rise in her income recently is down a record year for the Crown Estate in 2013-14, with profits of £267million. Under new financing rules, the 89-year-old monarch receives 15 per cent of the Crown Estate profits via the Sovereign Grant. Lord Alan Sugar is a billionaire for the first time, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, while JK Rowling continues to earn from the Harry Potter franchise as well as her adult bestseller The Casual Vacancy . George Clooney's marriage to human rights lawyer Amal means the couple's wealth also features at no. 790 . Roman Abramovich, the seventh wealthiest person in the UK according to the Rich List (right) speaks to Jose Mourinho, manager of Chelsea FC which he owns. Abramovich made his wealth through oil and industry . Among the new entries are Hollywood actor George Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal, who married in September. Worth an estimated £121million, the pair are listed at number 790 above a number of super-wealthy businessmen and aristocrats. Other celebrities on the list include David and Victoria Beckham, as their joint wealth increases to £240million thanks to his sponsorship deals with Adidas and H&M. The footballer, 39, is now one of the country’s leading philanthropists, with his latest project, 7: The David Beckham Unicef Fund, aiming to raise £7million for needy children in the next three years. Apprentice star Alan Sugar is now a billionaire for the first time, after his wealth increased by £140million to £1.04billion. Blavatnik, pictured with singer Katherine Jenkins . Len Blavatnik, a businessman and music mogul born in Ukraine, tops this year’s Rich List with an estimated personal wealth of £13.17billion. The 57-year-old built much of his fortune, which is up £3.17billion on 2014, from Russian oil in an unlikely alliance with BP, but also bought Warner Music in 2011 and later added Parlophone, the Beatles’ label, to his growing number of interests. The son of two Jewish academics, he emigrated to New York in 1978 and became a US citizen in 1984. Two years later, he started an investment company, Access Industries, and with Viktor Vekselberg and Mikhail Fridman he gained control of the oil producer TNK, partner of BP. When TNK-BP was sold in 2013, Blavatnik’s share was more than £4billion. Access’s stakes in aluminium producer Rusal and chemicals firm LyondellBasell meant his wealth continued to grow. Blavatnik has two daughters and two sons with his American wife, Emily Appelson. At his 50th birthday party, she surprised him by dancing with a troupe of professionals in a Russian ballet. He owns a £41million mansion in London’s Kensington, recently paid $77million (£50.7million) for a five-bedroom duplex in New York, and has donated £75million to Oxford University to found the Blavatnik School of Government. Blavatnik’s ten quoted and private company stakes are worth £9billion. With £3billion of cash, £440million of property and other assets, he is worth £13.17billion. He may have just missed out on the top 100, but Lord Sugar is unlikely to be unhappy with his lot after becoming a billionaire for the first time this year. The 68-year-old businessman was ranked 101 in the Rich List for his £1.04billion wealth. Lord Sugar, pictured with Apprentice winner Leah Totton, has £700million of real estate, while net profits for Amshold, his holding company, soared to £552m in 2013-14 . He was described by The Sunday Times as ‘super-boss and master of the acerbic put-down’ on The Apprentice. The BBC show first ran in 2005, with winners including Leah Totton, who triumphed in 2013, securing Lord Sugar’s backing to open a cosmetic clinic. Lord Sugar has £700million of real estate, while net profits for Amshold, his holding company, soared to £552m in 2013-14. There are now 117 sterling billionaires based in Britain, up 12 per cent on last year, but only 62 are British – including Sir Richard Branson, Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley and Sir James Dyson. At the top of Britain’s cash pile is Ukraine-born Len Blavatnik, who has investments in music, industry and media, and is worth £13.17billion, up £3.17billion on 2014. A Briton on the average annual wage of £25,000 would need to work for 526,800 years to earn the same. At number two are India-born brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who have family interests in industry and global finance and are worth £13billion. The Anglo-Canadian Weston family, who own Primark as well as Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason in London, are third with £11billion. David and Victoria Beckham, worth £240million .
